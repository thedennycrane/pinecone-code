<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Mr Ho Sheng Yu Garreth
                    (“the Appellant”), a 39-year-old male Singaporean, faced 18
                    charges in the District Court of engaging in a conspiracy to carry on the
                    business of moneylending without a licence. On 29 December 2010, he pleaded
                    guilty to six charges and agreed to the remaining 12 charges being taken into
                    consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The six charges which he pleaded
                    guilty to were offences under s 14(1) of the Moneylenders Act
                    (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MLA 2010”), and were
                    punishable under the same section as well as under s 14(1A), both read with
                    s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal
                    Code”). In particular, the six charges, according to the amended
                    Statement of Facts dated 29 December 2010 (“the Statement of
                    Facts”), expressly stated that the Appellant had “abetted [Ku Teck
                    Eng] and [Lee Kim Hock] by engaging in a conspiracy with them to carry on the
                    business of [unlicensed] moneylending”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The
                    Appellant was convicted accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This was the second time that the Appellant was
                    convicted of unlicensed moneylending. On 29 December 2008, the Appellant
                    had been convicted of two charges of unlicensed moneylending under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Moneylenders Act
                    (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the MLA 1985”), punishable
                    under s 8(1)(i) of the MLA 1985 read with s 109 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 revised edition of the Penal
                    Code”). It should be noted that the MLA 1985 was later repealed and
                    re-enacted as the Moneylenders Act 2008 (Act 31 of 2008) (“the MLA
                    2008”), which was in turn amended to become the MLA 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In view of the Appellant’s previous
                    moneylending offences, the Prosecution submitted that he was a repeat offender
                    and was thus subject to the enhanced penalties (relating to fines and
                    imprisonment) under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                    2010 (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Ho Sheng Yu Garreth</em>
                    [2011] SGDC 125 (“the GD”) at [3]). The Prosecution, however, stopped short of seeking an
                    enhanced sentence in respect of caning, which was available under
                        s 14(1A)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The District Judge
                    (“the DJ”) accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the
                    Appellant was a repeat offender for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 and accordingly meted out a total
                    sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment, six strokes of the cane and a fine of
                    $480,000 (in default, 24 months’ imprisonment) (see the GD at [8]). Dissatisfied with the DJ’s decision
                    on sentencing, the Appellant initiated this appeal against his
                sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At the hearing of the appeal, the preliminary issue (which was also the central issue) was whether the Appellant was liable for enhanced punishment under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 owing to his prior convictions under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985. I decided that issue in the affirmative and did not disturb the custodial sentence imposed by the DJ. Nonetheless, I also thought it appropriate to halve the Appellant’s sentences in respect of the fines and the caning as I considered the lower court’s sentences manifestly excessive in the prevailing circumstances. I now give the detailed reasons for my decision. As these grounds are fairly lengthy, for ease of reference, I set out here an outline of the scheme adopted herein:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant was arrested on 4 September
                    2010 at the void deck of Block 624 Yishun Ring Road. With him were three
                    accomplices: Ku Teck Eng (“B2”), Lee Kim Hock (“B3”)
                    and Tan Cheng Huat Melvin (“B4”). Each of the accomplices was
                    prosecuted in separate criminal proceedings. As those proceedings have no direct
                    relevance to this appeal, I shall not elaborate upon them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The facts of the case admitted to by the
                    Appellant are contained in the Statement of Facts tendered in the District Court
                    proceedings below. According to the Statement of Facts, B2 and B3 started an
                    unlicensed moneylending business together in or around September 2009. It was
                    agreed between them that B3 was to provide a capital sum of $20,000 to finance
                    the business, which was to be run by B2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sometime in November 2009, B2 recruited B4 to
                    assist in the unlicensed moneylending business in return for 30% of the profits
                    made from the business (the remaining 70% of the profits were to be split
                    equally between B2 and B3). B4’s role was to canvass for borrowers and to
                    issue loans to them at an interest rate of 20%. In order to keep track of their
                    dealings, B2 and B4 each maintained a set of identical records comprising the
                    debtors’ particulars, details of the loans issued and the repayments
                    received. B2 and B4 met up once in two days to compare and update their
                    respective records. Once a week, B3 met B2 to inspect the records so as to be
                    kept abreast of the profits made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It was only later in April 2010 that the
                    Appellant came into the picture. He was introduced by B4 to B2, who learnt that
                    the Appellant was working as a runner for an unlicensed moneylender known as
                    “Sam”. Subsequently, in around July 2010, B2 discovered that B4
                    had been dishonestly using fictitious particulars to siphon money away from the
                    unlicensed moneylending business. As a result, B2 recruited the Appellant to
                    take B4’s place in around August 2010 on terms that the Appellant would
                    receive 30% of the profits made from the business. Accordingly, the Appellant
                    assumed B4’s role of canvassing for borrowers, issuing loans at the
                    interest rate of 20% as well as collecting repayments from debtors. The
                    Appellant also took over the records maintained by B4 and ceased working for
                    “Sam”. Significantly, the Appellant was later introduced by B2 to
                    B3 as a new partner in their unlicensed moneylending business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the point of the Appellant’s arrest,
                    the amount of loans in circulation was estimated to be around $41,000, with a
                    pool of about 45 debtors. This sum of money represented the profits made from
                    the unlicensed moneylending business. By the time B4 left the unlicensed
                    moneylending business, he had collected about $5,000 as his share of the
                    profits. B2 collected a sum of about $5,000 as his share. B3 recovered his
                    capital sum of $20,000 sometime in May 2010 and made a profit of about $12,000
                    from the unlicensed moneylending business. As for the Appellant, he received
                    just $600 as his share of the profits (see <a href="#p1_124">[124]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present convictions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Of the six charges which the Appellant pleaded
                    guilty to, three (<em>viz</em>, the first, second and fifth
                    charges) were for issuing loans in furtherance of a conspiracy to carry on the
                    business of unlicensed moneylending, and three (<em>viz</em>, the eighth, eleventh and twelfth charges) were for
                    collecting repayments in consequence of that conspiracy. The first charge (for
                    issuing a loan in furtherance of a conspiracy to carry on the business of
                    unlicensed moneylending) read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The previous convictions</p>

                    worded save for the locations where the offences were committed and the sums of

                        moneylending syndicate, under the alias of “Ah Boon”, to carry

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant was sentenced to five

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In sentencing the Appellant, the DJ agreed
                    with the Prosecution that a deterrent sentence was called for because the
                    Appellant was carrying on an illegal moneylending business for profit (see the
                    GD at [5]). He noted further that this
                    was a “highly organised syndicated illegal moneylending operation which
                    charged [a] very high interest rate to the debtors” (see the GD at
                    [7(e)]). Although the DJ considered the Appellant’s mitigation plea and
                    his prompt plea of guilt, he observed that in cases of illegal moneylending, the
                    overriding principle of sentencing was “clearly based on
                    deterrence” (see the GD at [7(a)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The DJ also took into account the prevalence
                    of illegal moneylending activities in Singapore in recent times (see the GD at
                    [7(b)]). In addition, he considered that these activities, which were generally
                    well planned and difficult to detect (see the GD at [7(c)]), affected public
                    safety and caused public fear and disquiet (see the GD at [7(d)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The DJ further referred to the parliamentary
                    debates on 21 November 2005 during the second reading of the Moneylenders
                    (Amendment) Bill 2005 (Bill 28 of 2005), observing that Parliament had
                    “clearly stated its zero tolerance policy against illegal moneylending
                    activities” (see the GD at [7(f)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Considering all the circumstances, the DJ was
                    of the view that a clear message must be sent to illegal moneylending business
                    operators that a deterrent sentence would be imposed for moneylending offences.
                    He further stated that the sentence in the Appellant’s case must deter
                    both the offender (<em>ie</em>, the Appellant) and
                    potential offenders. The DJ also made clear his awareness that any deterrent
                    sentence must be tempered by proportionality in relation to the severity of the
                    offence as well as the offender’s culpability (see the GD at [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Accordingly, the DJ sentenced the Appellant to
                    a fine of $80,000 (in default, four months’ imprisonment), 20
                    months’ imprisonment and one stroke of the cane for each of the six
                    charges proceeded on. The imprisonment sentences for three of the charges were
                    ordered to run consecutively, giving a total sentence of 60 months’
                    imprisonment, a fine of $480,000 (in default, 24 months’ imprisonment) and
                    six strokes of the cane (see the GD at [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The preliminary issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The central plank of the Appellant’s
                    submissions was an imaginative argument that he was a first offender under the
                    MLA 2010 and should not be liable for enhanced punishment under
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010. This in
                    turn raised the issue of whether the Appellant was liable for enhanced
                    punishment under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                    2010 on account of his previous convictions under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985. I dealt with this as a preliminary issue
                    because had the Appellant succeeded on this front, then the maximum imprisonment
                    sentence for his offences would have been four years (see s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the MLA 2010) instead of seven years (see
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010). That, in
                    itself, would have been a <em>prima facie</em>
                    justification to recalibrate his custodial sentence downwards significantly.
                    Therefore, I thought it sensible to first determine the applicable maximum
                    imprisonment sentence for the Appellant’s offences before considering the
                    remainder of the submissions on his behalf, which went towards determining an
                    appropriate total sentence in his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Before going further, it is necessary to set
                    out the relevant statutory provisions. As mentioned earlier, the Appellant was
                    previously convicted under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    MLA 1985, and was punished under s 8(1)(i) of the MLA 1985 read with
                    s 109 of the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code. Section 8(1) of
                    the MLA 1985 (as it stood when the Appellant committed his earlier moneylending
                    offences in November 2008)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> was worded as follows:</p>

                    “second or subsequent offence”. It should be noted that the
                    present appeal pertained only to s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 because, as stated above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>, the Prosecution did not seek an enhanced

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr S K Kumar
                    (“Mr Kumar”), counsel for the Appellant, vigorously asserted
                    that the DJ erred in treating the Appellant as a repeat offender under the MLA
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> First,
                    Mr Kumar submitted that s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    MLA 1985, under which the Appellant was previously convicted, had been
                        repealed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Second, he argued
                    that the word “offence” in s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 must precisely refer only to an offence
                    defined by s 14(1) of the MLA 2010, <em>viz</em>, the
                    offence of contravening (or assisting in the contravention of) s 5(1) of
                    the MLA 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> He further submitted that
                    such offence was different from the offence of unlicensed moneylending under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 in two
                    ways.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The first difference was that the punishment
                    for a first offender under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of
                    the MLA 2010 was plainly heavier than the corresponding punishment under
                    s 8(1)(i) of the MLA 1985.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In this regard, Mr Kumar
                    also suggested that even if the court treated the Appellant as a first offender
                    under the MLA 2010, it would be free to take his prior convictions into account
                    as aggravating factors and impose a slightly higher punishment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The second difference (according to
                    Mr Kumar) lay in the fact that s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 created the new
                    offence of <em>assisting</em> in the carrying on of the
                    business of unlicensed moneylending.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Therefore, s 14(1) of the MLA
                    2010 described two offences (<em>viz</em>, the principal
                    offence of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending and the offence
                    of assisting in that principal offence) and not one. In contrast,
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 only described
                    the principal offence of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending.
                    Mr Kumar submitted that while the Appellant’s previous offences under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 were for
                        <em>abetting</em> the carrying on of an unlicensed
                    moneylending business,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    the Appellant’s present offences were in the nature of <em>assisting</em> in the carrying on of an unlicensed moneylending
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> These offences,
                    Mr Kumar maintained, were altogether different from the Appellant’s
                    previous offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Third, Mr Kumar argued that if Parliament
                    had intended the provisions for enhanced punishment under the MLA 2010 to take
                    into account previous offences committed under the MLA 1985, then the
                    MLA 2010 would have specifically provided for it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Finally, Mr Kumar submitted
                    that treating the Appellant as a repeat offender for the purposes of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 on account
                    of his prior convictions under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the MLA 1985 would contravene Art 11(1) of the Constitution,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>
                    which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Protection against retrospective criminal laws and
                            repeated trials</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>11.</b>—(1) No person shall be
                        punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was
                        done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence
                        than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p30_30"></a>31     Mr Edwin San
                    (“Mr San”) for the Prosecution submitted, first, that the
                    Appellant’s convictions under the MLA 1985 did not cease to exist on
                    account of the purported “repeal” of that Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Second, Mr San argued
                    that Parliament could not have intended the repeal of the MLA 1985 to
                    “[wipe] the slate clean”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> for offenders convicted of offences
                    under that Act. Third, Mr San submitted that the offence described by
                    s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 was substantively the same as that under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 since both
                    provisions criminalised, <em>inter alia</em>, the carrying
                    on of the business of moneylending without a licence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> On that point, he emphasised
                    that there had been no change to the constituent elements of the
                        offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Fourth, Mr San also tried to rely on
                    s 7E of the ROCA, which deals with the consequences of criminal records
                    becoming or being treated as spent, to show that Parliament’s intention
                    was for convictions under the MLA 1985 to be taken into account for the purposes
                    of court proceedings pursuant to the MLA 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> In particular,
                    Mr San drew attention to ss 7E(2)(<em>b</em>) and
                        7E(2)(<em>c</em>) of the ROCA as well as the relevant
                    debates in Parliament to show that although the ROCA provided for an
                    offender’s previous conviction to be treated as spent under certain
                    circumstances, Parliament did not intend this to amount to an expunging of the
                    offender’s criminal record “for purposes of court
                    proceedings” [emphasis in original omitted].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, Mr San
                    argued, given Parliament’s reluctance to expunge an offender’s
                    criminal records wholly (even for minor crimes), Parliament could not have
                    intended an offender’s previous conviction to be disregarded only because
                    that previous conviction lay under legislation which had since been
                        repealed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Fifth, Mr San cited
                        s 16(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Interpretation Act
                    (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IA”) to support his argument
                    that the repeal of the MLA 1985 did not affect the punishment in respect of an
                    offence committed under that Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Finally, Mr San submitted that
                    the absence of transitional and savings provisions in the MLA 2010 did not
                    prevent the court from considering previous convictions under the MLA 1985 when
                    determining whether an offender’s present offences under the MLA 2010
                    counted as “second or subsequent” offences for the purposes of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The gist of Mr San’s submissions
                    was that the repeal of the MLA 1985 and its simultaneous reincarnation in the
                    form of the MLA 2008 must be regarded as “a continuation and affirmation
                    of the statute in uninterrupted operation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The interpretational issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In essence, the submissions made by both sides
                    centred on the following three key interpretational issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the repeal of
                            s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985, in and of
                        itself, meant that convictions made under it could not be taken into account
                        as prior offences for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 ought to be construed to take into
                        account convictions under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                        the MLA 1985 as prior offences; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether treating the Appellant’s present offences
                        as repeat offences under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii)
                        of the MLA 2010 would contravene Art 11(1) of the
                    Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Determination of the interpretational issues</p>

                    arguments, I ought to acknowledge the assistance which I received from the
                    submissions made by both Mr Kumar and Mr San. I also found the
                    submissions made by the <em>amicus curiae</em>,
                    Mr Kenneth Lim Tao Chung (“Mr Lim”) from Allen &amp;
                    Gledhill LLP, helpful. Mr Lim was appointed under the Supreme
                    Court’s Young <em>Amicus Curiae</em> scheme to
                    address the preliminary issue at hand, <em>viz</em>,
                    whether the Appellant had been correctly held to be liable for enhanced
                    punishment under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Lim’s submissions set out with clarity the applicable law on the
                    relevant issues. Also, for the avoidance of doubt, I should add that the terms
                    “interpretation” and “construction” and their
                    derivatives have been used interchangeably in these grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the repeal of s 8(1)(b) of the MLA 1985, in and of
                itself, meant that convictions made under it could not be taken into account as
                prior offences for the purposes of s 14(1)(b)(ii) of the MLA 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I begin by dealing briefly with the threshold
                    issue of whether the Appellant could succeed on the preliminary issue in this
                    appeal simply because s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA
                    1985, the provision under which he was previously convicted, had been
                    repealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Kumar submitted that since the
                    Appellant’s prior convictions were under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985, which had been repealed, the Appellant could
                    not be considered a repeat offender for the purposes of the MLA 2010.
                    Mr Kumar’s submission was principally founded on the preamble of the
                    MLA 2008, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An Act to <em>repeal and re-enact</em> with
                        amendments the Moneylenders Act (Chapter 188 of the 1985 Revised
                        Edition) for the regulation of moneylending and for matters connected
                        therewith, and to make consequential amendments to the Corruption, Drug
                        Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act
                        (Chapter 65A of the 2000 Revised Edition) and the Registration of
                        Criminals Act (Chapter 268 of the 1985 Revised Edition). [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Court of Appeal considered a similar
                    argument in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Teck
                        Hin</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 672 (“<em>Tan Teck
                        Hin</em>”). The respondent in that case was convicted of a
                    drink driving charge under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”). He had a previous conviction under
                    the same subsection of the RTA. However, in between his two convictions, the
                    version of s 67(1) in force at the time of his first conviction
                    (“the repealed s 67(1) RTA”) was repealed by the Road Traffic
                    (Amendment) Act 1990 (Act 7 of 1990) and re-enacted to give a new version
                    of s 67(1) (“the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA”), which raised
                    the existing penalties for both first and repeat offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Prosecution reserved to the Court of
                    Appeal the question of whether the respondent should be treated as a repeat
                    offender for the purposes of the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA. The
                    respondent’s counsel, in contending that the question should be answered
                    in the negative, argued (<em>inter alia</em>) that the fact
                    that the repealed s 67(1) RTA had been repealed meant that the offence
                    under it had ceased to exist. Therefore, an offence under the repealed
                    s 67(1) RTA could not count as a prior offence for the purposes of the
                    re-enacted s 67(1) RTA (see <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> at
                        [17]–[18]). The Court of Appeal unequivocally
                    disagreed with that proposition and answered the question reserved by the
                    Prosecution in the affirmative; <em>ie</em>, it held that
                    the respondent was a repeat offender for the purposes of the re-enacted
                    s 67(1) RTA. In its view (see <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> at
                        [26]), there was no magic in the use
                    of the word “repeal”, and the fact that the repealed s 67(1)
                    RTA no longer had force did not assist the court in construing the re-enacted
                    s 67(1) RTA. The Court of Appeal further held (see <em>Tan
                        Teck Hin</em> at [33]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The conviction of the respondent under s 67(1) before the
                        “repeal” [<em>ie</em>, under the repealed
                        s 67(1) RTA] is a fact which did not cease to exist on the
                        “repeal”. ... He remained as a person who had been so
                        convicted. ... [T]here is no question of the “repeal”
                        affecting the subsistence of this fact. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Both Mr San and Mr Lim rightly drew
                    to my attention s 16(1) of the IA,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> the relevant parts
                    of which are as follows:</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Unfortunately for Mr Kumar, this appears to lend support to the
                    Prosecution’s contention that the repeal of s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 did not affect the continuing existence of
                    the fact of the Appellant’s previous convictions under that
                    provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Further, I also pointed out to Mr Kumar
                    that s 2(1) of the IA expressly defined “repeal” in the
                    following non-exhaustive manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“repeal” includes rescind, revoke, cancel or <em>replace …</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Plainly, the word “repeal” is an etymological chameleon
                    that takes colour from its context. It seems to me that “replace”
                    is the correct meaning to be ascribed to “repeal” in the present
                    context. Since the MLA 2008 simply “replaced” and re-enacted (see
                    the preamble reproduced above at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>) the
                    MLA 1985, there was no break in the continuum between the legislative regime
                    under the MLA 1985 and that under the MLA 2008 (which was later amended and
                    revised to become the MLA 2010). As such, there is little force in the
                    proposition that an offence under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the MLA 1985 cannot be taken into account as a prior offence for the purposes
                    of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 simply
                    because s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 has been
                    repealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For the reasons outlined above, it is clear in
                    the present case that the fact that s 8(1)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the MLA 1985 has been repealed is in itself of little significance. As
                    Mr San rightly submitted, such repeal does not have the effect of wiping
                    the slate clean for those previously convicted under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985. Instead, as alluded to above at
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>, the question depends on the proper
                    construction of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                    2010, to which I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether s 14(1)(b)(ii) of the MLA 2010 ought to be construed to
                take into account convictions under s 8(1)(b) of the MLA 1985 as prior
                offences</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   An issue of construction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Tan Teck Hin</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal, having dismissed the notion that that the word
                    “repeal” had any significance in itself, clarified that the
                    central issue was really one of construction of the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA
                    (see <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is before us is simply whether a conviction under s 67(1) before
                        its “repeal” [<em>ie</em>, a conviction
                        under the repealed s 67(1) RTA] can properly be taken into account when
                        applying the subsection after its “repeal” [<em>ie</em>, when applying the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA].
                            <em>The issue is one of construction, of ascertaining the
                            intention of Parliament when enacting the new provision.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Court of Appeal went on to resolve that
                    question of construction by having regard to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, Parliament’s intention. Indeed, legislative intention
                    is now the cornerstone of statutory interpretation in the Singapore context as
                    this is statutorily mandated by s 9A of the IA, which was introduced by
                    Parliament via the Interpretation (Amendment) Act 1993 (Act 11 of 1993)
                    (see further below at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>–<a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>; in this regard, it should be noted that
                        <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> was decided before s 9A of
                    the IA was enacted). After comparing the repealed s 67(1) RTA and the
                    re-enacted s 67(1) RTA, the Court of Appeal found that Parliament intended
                    convictions under the repealed s 67(1) RTA to count as prior convictions
                    for the purposes of the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA (see <em>Tan
                        Teck Hin</em> at [35]).
                    Accordingly, it answered the question reserved by the Prosecution in the
                    affirmative (see above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the same vein, the present issue of whether
                    the Appellant’s convictions under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 could properly be taken into account for the
                    purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 is
                    one of construction of the latter provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether the offences of carrying on the business of
                unlicensed moneylending and assisting in the same under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010
                are the same in the context of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of
                the MLA 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Before drawing s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 into the picture, I move first to address an
                    issue pertaining solely to s 14(1) of the MLA 2010.
                        Section 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010
                    refers to a “second or subsequent offence” without explaining what
                    constitutes a first offence. However, having regard to the two-part structure of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 2010 and given that
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the MLA 2010 stipulates
                    the punishment for what must be a first offence under s 14(1) of the MLA
                    2010, the first offence which s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii)
                    of the MLA 2010 contemplates must be an offence described by s 14(1) of the
                    MLA 2010. As stated above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>,
                    Mr Kumar pointed out in his submissions that s 14(1) of the MLA 2010
                    encompasses not one, but two offences: that of contravening s 5(1) of the
                    MLA 2010 and that of <em>assisting</em> in the
                    contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It is obvious that in the absence of clear
                    statutory provision to the contrary, a subsequent offence can only be considered
                    a <em>repeat offence</em> if it is the same as the prior
                    offence; otherwise, the two offences would be different and the subsequent
                    offence would not be a repeat offence. Mr Kumar’s observation
                    therefore raised the question of whether the offences of carrying on the
                    business of unlicensed moneylending and assisting in the same under s 14(1)
                    of the MLA 2010 are the same in the context of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Kumar helpfully drew my attention to
                    the South Australian Supreme Court case of <em>Bartlett v
                        D’Rozario</em> [1971] SASR 88 (“<em>Bartlett</em>”). That case concerned s 47 of the Road
                    Traffic Act 1961–1967 (“the Aust RTA”), the relevant parts
                    of which were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     One of the questions raised in <em>Bartlett</em> was whether a conviction for a breach of
                        s 47(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Aust RTA should be
                    treated as a conviction for a second or subsequent offence when there had been a
                    previous conviction (within five years) for a breach of s 47(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Aust RTA (see <em>Bartlett</em> at 89). Bray CJ answered that question in the
                    negative, primarily on the basis that the statute was ambiguous and thus had to
                    be resolved in favour of the citizen (see <em>Bartlett</em>
                    at 93–94):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>On reflection, … I think that this is a case of
                            a genuine ambiguity in the language.</em> Clearly, as I have said,
                        the offences are separate and distinct. A complaint charging the defendant
                        with driving a vehicle or attempting to put a vehicle in motion whilst so
                        much under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug as to be incapable
                        of exercising effective control would, I think, be bad for duplicity.
                            <em>The offences being separate and distinct, the use of
                            the expressions “second offence” and “third or

                            it plain whether it means a second, third or subsequent offence of the
                            same kind as the previous offence or whether it means that offences
                            against s. 47(1)(</em>a<em>) and offences
                            against s. 47(1)(</em>b<em>) are to be

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Bower’s Case</em> [[1963] 1 All ER
                        437], Lord Parker drew a distinction between a provision which is
                        ambiguous and a provision which is difficult to interpret, but <em>he thought that a true ambiguity in a penal section must be
                            resolved in the manner most favourable to the citizen if doubt still
                            remains after the application of the proper canons of
                            construction</em> …
                        <em>I think there is here a true ambiguity which remains
                            after the application of those canons and I think the principle cited by

                            <em>[[1931] 2 KB 606 at 609] from</em> Maxwell

                            be given to the subject and against the Legislature which has failed to
                            explain itself.”</em> Accordingly I hold that the
                        conviction on 8th January, 1969 was not a previous conviction for the
                        present purposes. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is not for the courts to question the policy which Parliament has
                        thought fit to adopt in enacting legislation of this rigidity, but the case
                        is not one in which any diffidence need be felt in invoking the principle
                        referred to by Lord Hewart CJ in <em>Chapman’s Case</em>, if that principle is fairly
                        applicable, as I think it is here.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Another reason for Bray CJ’s
                    decision was s 165 of the Aust RTA (see <em>Bartlett</em> at 93):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, there is one consideration in favour of the former
                        construction [referring to the construction eventually decided on].
                        Section 165 reads as follows:—</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“<em>In determining whether an offence against a
                                provision of this Act is a second or subsequent offence within the

                                repealed by this Act shall be taken into account as an offence
                                against the said provision.</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think driving under the influence and attempting to put a vehicle
                        in motion while under the influence are now “like offences” or
                        were so under the provisions of s. 48 of the previous legislation, the
                        Road Traffic Act 1934–1960, which was in similar terms for the present
                        purpose to s. 47(1) [of the Aust RTA]. “Like” here must
                        mean not “allied” but “substantially the same”
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Pertinently, our High Court took a contrary
                    view on a similar issue in <em>Teo Kwee Chuan v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 289 (“<em>Teo Kwee Chuan</em>”), which involved drink driving under the
                    same provision as that which was in issue in <em>Tan Teck
                        Hin</em>, <em>viz</em>, the re-enacted
                    s 67(1) RTA (see above at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>–<a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>). The
                    appellant in <em>Teo Kwee Chuan</em> had a previous
                    conviction for “driving under the influence of drink/drugs” (see
                        <em>Teo Kwee Chuan</em> at [4]) contrary to s 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act
                    (Cap 92, 1970 Rev Ed, 1973 Reprint). The main issue was whether
                    the appellant should have been treated as a repeat offender <em>vis-à-vis</em> his later offence under the re-enacted s 67(1)
                    RTA. However, I note in particular Yong Pung How CJ’s views on the
                    issue of whether driving and attempting to drive under the influence of drink
                    were separate offences such that a prior conviction for one would not count as a
                    prior conviction for the other (see <em>Teo Kwee Chuan</em>
                    at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [C]ounsel submitted that driving and attempting to drive were two
                        separate offences so that a conviction for driving whilst under the

                        offence” if the offender’s earlier conviction or convictions
                        were for attempting to drive whilst under the influence of drink, and
                            <em>vice versa</em>. <em>Even
                            leaving aside the manifestly preposterous sense of this submission, it
                            is plain from the drafting of s 67(1)</em> [<em>viz</em>, the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA] <em>that the words “second or subsequent offence”
                            therein presupposes</em> [<em>sic</em>]
                            <em>that the relevant earlier offence or offences may be
                            of any description so long as it falls within s 67(1).</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I make three observations regarding <em>Teo Kwee Chuan</em>. First, it is not clear why, in the first
                    place, the appellant’s counsel raised the issue of whether driving and
                    attempting to drive under the influence of drink were separate offences since it
                    appeared from the charges, as summarised in the judgment, that the
                    appellant’s prior and subsequent offences both involved actual drink
                    driving (as opposed to an attempt to engage in the same). Therefore,
                    Yong CJ’s holding as set out above is <em>obiter</em>. Second, it is not clear whether <em>Bartlett</em> was brought to the attention of Yong CJ as it was
                    not referred to in the court’s grounds. However, I do not suggest that
                    Yong CJ’s views on this issue would have been different had <em>Bartlett</em> been cited to him (assuming that it had not).
                    Third, I note that the two offences in issue in <em>Bartlett</em> were in two separate statutory limbs (<em>viz</em>, ss 47(1)(<em>a</em>) and
                        47(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Aust RTA) whereas the two
                    offences in <em>Teo Kwee Chuan</em> were not, but I do not
                    think <em>Bartlett</em> can be distinguished solely on that
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In any case, as Australian law has evolved, it
                    is quite possible that <em>Bartlett</em> might be decided
                    differently by an Australian court sitting today. Bray CJ decided <em>Bartlett</em> on the basis that the particular statutory
                    provision in issue was genuinely ambiguous and “must be resolved in the
                    manner most favourable to the citizen if doubt still remain[ed] <em>after the application of the proper canons of
                        construction</em>” [emphasis added] (see <em>Bartlett</em> at 94 (also reproduced above at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>)). It is not insignificant that the High
                    Court of Australia has since held that the rule of interpretation applied by
                    Bray CJ in <em>Bartlett</em> is one of “last
                    resort” (<em>per</em> Gibbs J in <em>Beckwith v The Queen</em> (1976) 135 CLR 569
                        (“<em>Beckwith</em>”) at 576). More
                    recently, the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court has also tried to
                    confine that rule of interpretation to ambiguities as to whether an offence is
                    created or not (<em>per</em> Layton J in <em>Police v Whitehouse</em> (2005) 92 SASR 81 at [52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>… [T]he rule in relation to the interpretation
                            of penal statutes is predominantly concerned with those statutes where
                            it is unclear because of the ambiguity whether an offence is created or
                            not.</em> Gibbs J [in <em>Beckwith</em>
                        at 577] stated the rule as relating to situations where the statute may
                        extend the category of criminal offences. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Pertinently, Layton J in fact
                    distinguished <em>Bartlett</em> on the basis that it
                    concerned the issue of whether or not an offence had been committed, rather than
                    whether a previous conviction could be considered when convicting an offender
                    for committing the same offence (see <em>Police v
                        Whitehouse</em> at [55]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>[T]he cases of</em> Beckwith <em>and</em> Bartlett <em>were concerned with the
                            issue as to whether or not an offence had or had not been committed,
                            therefore one can see why in such a case any ambiguity should be
                            construed in favour of the accused. However, in this situation the
                            question is not whether an offence was committed but rather whether a
                            previous conviction could be taken into account when convicting the
                            respondent for committing the same offence.</em> In that
                        situation, resolving the ambiguity in favour of the accused would seem to
                        defeat the very purpose underlying the creation of a specific penalty for a
                        subsequent offence. Therefore that canon of interpretation does not seem to
                        be applicable to the facts in this case and does not lend support to the
                        interpretation found by [the judge in the court below]. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With respect, I do not think <em>Bartlett</em>
                    can be satisfactorily distinguished on the basis stated by Layton J since
                    it did in fact concern whether a previous conviction could be considered when
                    convicting an offender for committing the same offence (see <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Purposive interpretation as the cornerstone of statutory
                interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In my view, there is no need in the present
                    case to resort (as Bray CJ did in <em>Bartlett</em>
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>)) to what I have
                    previously termed the “strict construction rule” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R)
                    183 (“<em>Low Kok Heng</em>”) at [30]–[31]), <em>viz</em>, the rule that
                    ambiguous penal provisions must be construed in favour of the accused person. In
                        <em>Low Kok Heng</em>, I considered the strict
                    construction rule against the backdrop of s 9A of the IA in the context of
                    construing penal provisions (see <em>Low Kok Heng</em> at
                        [30]–[57]). I concluded that s 9A of the IA
                    mandates that the rule of purposive interpretation trumps all other common law
                    principles of interpretation, including the strict construction rule (see
                        <em>Low Kok Heng</em> at [41] and [56]–[57]):</p>

                        number of arrests made in unlicensed moneylending and related harassment
                        cases increased by almost 20% in one year, from 330 arrests in 2003 to 393

<b><em>First, the existing fines for offenders who carry out

<b><em>Fourthly, repeat offenders of illegal moneylending

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Next, as stated above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>, the MLA 1985 was repealed and re-enacted as
                    the MLA 2008. This was undertaken pursuant to comprehensive changes made to the
                    MLA 1985 following a holistic review of that Act, which, at the time, was
                    considered to have become outdated (see the speech by the then Senior Minister
                    of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho, during the second reading of the
                    Moneylenders Bill 2008 (Bill 33 of 2008) in <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (18 November 2008)
                    vol 85 at cols 1001–1007; see also my observations in <em>City Hardware Pte Ltd v Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2005] 1 SLR(R) 733 at [47]–[50]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Significantly, the moneylending offences under
                    s 8(1) of the MLA 1985 (under the heading “Offences”) were
                    later split between ss 14 and 15 of the MLA 2008 (under the respective
                    headings “Unlicensed moneylending” and “Other offences
                    under this Part”). Further, while s 8(1) of the MLA 1985 provided
                    for both the offence of unlicensed moneylending (via, specifically,
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985) as well as its
                    punishment under a single subsection (<em>viz</em>,
                    s 8(1) of the MLA 1985), the MLA 2008 did not. Rather, the MLA 2008
                    prohibited unlicensed moneylending via s 5(1), and separately provided that
                    the contravention or the assistance in the contravention of s 5(1) was an
                    offence and was punishable under s 14(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Pertinently, s 14(1) of the MLA 2008
                    expressly made it an offence to assist in carrying on the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending (see s 14(1) read with s 5(1) of the MLA 2008). In
                    contrast, prior to the enactment of the MLA 2008, s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 only provided for the principal offence of
                    unlicensed moneylending. Under the statutory regime set out in the MLA 1985, if
                    a person assisted in the principal offence of unlicensed moneylending, he would
                    have been charged (as the Appellant was in 2008) with the abetment (by
                    intentional aiding) of unlicensed moneylending under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 (read with s 109 of the 1985
                    revised edition of the Penal Code).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Despite the significant changes introduced in
                    the MLA 2008, the penalties for first and repeat offenders in respect of
                    unlicensed moneylending remained the same as before. However, in 2010, the MLA
                    2008 was amended to increase the penalties dramatically. Both the punishment of
                    fine and that of imprisonment were made mandatory for first as well as repeat
                    offenders. The sentencing range for fines for both first and repeat offenders
                    was increased to between $30,000 and $300,000 (<em>cf</em>
                    the previous range of between $20,000 and $200,000). The maximum imprisonment
                    term for first offenders was doubled from two to four years, while the maximum
                    imprisonment term for repeat offenders was increased from five to seven years.
                    Most significantly, caning was introduced as a sentencing option, capped at six
                    strokes for first offenders and 12 strokes for repeat offenders.</p>

                    (Amendment) Bill 2009 (Bill 23 of 2009) (“the Moneylenders Bill
                    2009”), the then Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho,
                    explained the tougher penalties and reiterated the need to send a strong message
                    of zero tolerance for all unlicensed moneylending activities as follows (see
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official

                    cols 2051 and 2060–2061):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, last year in August, I informed this House that MHA [the Ministry of

                            hopefully, also make our youths and debtors think twice before

<p class="Judg-1">The MLA 2008 (as amended in 2010) was later revised to become the MLA
                    2010, which preserved the penalties discussed above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The purpose of moneylending legislation was
                    also explicated in the Court of Appeal case of <em>Donald McArthy

                    Keong CJ explained that the primary objective of the MLA 1985 was to
                    protect poor individuals from unscrupulous unlicensed moneylenders (at [6]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Purpose of the MLA</em></b> [referring to the MLA
                        1985]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    Before giving our
                            reasons for our decision on the preliminary issues, it would be useful
                            to restate the legislative purpose of the MLA and the relevant
                            principles that have been established by case law on the scope of the
                            MLA. It is trite that a court should give effect to the legislative
                            purpose when interpreting an Act of Parliament. <b><em>From
                                the transcripts of parliamentary debates on the enactment and
                                subsequent amendments of the MLA, it is clear that Parliament
                                intended the MLA to be a social legislation designed to protect
                                individuals who, being unable to borrow money from banks and other
                                financial institutions, have to turn to unscrupulous unlicensed
                                moneylenders who prey on people like them.</em></b> For example,
                            in <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                                Report</em> (2 September 1959) vol 11 at
                            col 593, Mrs Seow Peck Leng made the following
                        remarks:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">This Bill [referring to the Bill which was later enacted as the MLO
                            1959] is laudable for the fact that it protects the poor from the
                            clutches of unscrupulous moneylenders. This Bill, in my opinion, should
                            be implemented as soon as possible to ease the hardship of those already
                            victimised and to prevent those who, because of financial difficulties,
                            may be victimised in the future ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>It is the very, very poor, Sir, who need protection
                                most, who usually take loans of less than $100, and I think that
                                they are the ones who should be protected</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These expressions of legislative purpose have been reiterated
                        whenever the MLA has come up for amendment in Parliament. For example, in
                            <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                            Report</em> (28 May 1993) vol 61 at col 294,
                        Prof S Jayakumar (the Minister for Law) said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Sir, this Bill amends the Moneylenders Act to increase the quantum of
                            penalties for illegal moneylending ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Members, I am sure, would have read numerous accounts in the press of
                            illegal moneylenders or loansharks resorting to the use of threats and
                            violence in extracting payment from debtors for loans given. These loans
                            were often at exorbitant rates of interest. <em>They prey
                                on debtors who, having no access to the usual channels of raising
                                finance, had no recourse except to look to those loansharks for
                                their funds</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I have no doubt that this salutary social objective survived the
                    repeal of the MLA 1985, and applies both to its re-enactment in the form of the
                    MLA 2008 and the revision of the MLA 2008 to, in turn, the MLA
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As can be seen from the markedly robust
                    increases in the penalties for moneylending offences over the years as outlined
                    at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>–<a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above, the rising scourge of unlicensed moneylending has
                    repeatedly prompted Parliament to toughen its stance against this particular
                    criminal activity over the years. Plainly, Parliament has set its face
                    implacably against this pernicious malaise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The offences of carrying on the business of unlicensed
                moneylending and assisting in the same under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 are the
                same in the context of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Taking into account the unambiguous statutory
                    genesis of the MLA, I return to the issue set out at the beginning of this
                    section (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above), <em>viz</em>, whether carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending
                    and assisting in the same (respectively, contravening and assisting in the
                    contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010) are indeed two separate offences
                    such that a prior conviction for one would not count as a prior conviction for
                    the other. I begin by noting that in <em>Bartlett</em>
                    (religiously cited by Mr Kumar), Bray CJ had in fact repressed
                    misgivings about his eventual decision that a previous conviction for a breach
                    of s 47(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Aust RTA did not count
                    for the purposes of determining whether a later conviction for a breach of
                        s 47(1)(<em>a</em>) of that Act amounted to a
                    second or subsequent offence (see <em>Bartlett</em> at
                    93):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There may, perhaps, be <em>some element of
                            caprice</em> as a result of the learned Special Magistrate’s
                        construction [which Bray CJ went on to uphold]. <em>I
                            assume for the present purposes that attempting to put a vehicle in
                            motion under the influence is a lesser offence than driving it under the
                            influence. Nevertheless, it might seem odd if a gaol sentence is
                            mandatory on the second of two convictions for attempting to put the
                            vehicle in motion under the influence and yet not for a conviction for
                            driving under the influence after a conviction for attempting to put a
                            vehicle in motion under the influence</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On reflection, however, I think that this is a case of genuine ambiguity
                        in the language. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the present context, I think it is quite
                    clear that assisting in the carrying on of the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending is a lesser offence than actually carrying on the business of
                    unlicensed moneylending. That said, if carrying on the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending does not count as a prior conviction for assistance of the same and
                        <em>vice versa</em>, then the second of two convictions
                    for assisting in unlicensed moneylending would be punishable with a higher
                    maximum imprisonment sentence (of seven years, as opposed to four years for a
                    first offender) than in the case of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     a conviction for assisting in
                        unlicensed moneylending after a conviction for actually carrying on
                        unlicensed moneylending; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     a conviction for actually carrying on unlicensed
                        moneylending after a conviction for assisting in unlicensed
                        moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Surely, the repeat offender who is convicted
                    of the principal offence of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending,
                    regardless of whether his earlier conviction was for that same principal offence
                    or for assisting in carrying on an unlicensed moneylending business, is more
                    deserving of the maximum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment than the
                    repeat offender who has never gone beyond assisting in carrying on the business
                    of unlicensed moneylending to actually carrying on such business himself or
                    herself. In my view, if s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 is construed such that the
                    offences of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending and assisting in
                    the carrying on of such business are not regarded as the same in the context of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii), this would not merely
                    “seem odd” (see <em>Bartlett</em> at 93). It
                    would in fact be “manifestly … unreasonable” within the
                    meaning of s 9A(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the IA (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I also note that during the second reading of
                    the Moneylenders Bill 2009, the then Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc
                    Prof Ho, emphasised that anyone who contributed to an unlicensed
                    moneylending operation would also face the law’s wrath and that even
                    assistants would be liable to the same penalties (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> vol 86 at
                    col 2059):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In order to target the many layers forming the

                        therefore amends section 14 [referring to the MLA 2008 as it originally
                        stood] (which is on unlicensed moneylending) and section 28 (on
                        harassing borrowers besetting his residence) to treat certain acts as
                        assistance of unlicensed moneylending and abetment of the harassment
                        offence, respectively. These acts include, for example, selling pre-paid SIM
                        cards to loansharks, transporting runners to harassment targets, acting as a
                        lookout for harassment runs and assisting the loansharks in verifying
                        harassment jobs before paying the runners. Indeed, a 27-year old ex-runner
                        said that he was paid $10 for every address that he verified that harassment
                        had been conducted. Sir, these acts are specifically chosen as they reflect
                        the current <em>modus operandi</em> adopted in
                        loanshark harassments. <em>Persons carrying out these acts
                            are deemed to have assisted or abetted loansharking offences and will be
                            liable to the same penalties.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The last sentence in the above quote is particularly noteworthy. Those
                    who have a secondary role in unlicensed moneylending activities are deemed to
                    have “assisted or abetted” the same (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> vol 86 at col 2059)
                    and are liable to “the same penalties” as the principal offenders
                    (see likewise <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>
                    vol 86 at col 2059). Such “assisting” conduct should be
                    viewed through exactly the same lenses, at least in the context of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010, rather
                    than be semantically micro-analysed as being conceptually
                different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     For the reasons outlined above, I consider
                    that Parliament’s intention is not to distinguish principal offenders from
                    assistant offenders when it comes to determining whether one is a repeat
                    offender <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of unlicensed
                    moneylending. Therefore, I interpret s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 to mean that regardless of whether an
                    offender was previously convicted of actually carrying on the business of
                    unlicensed moneylending or merely assisting in the same under s 14(1) of
                    the MLA 2010, he is to be considered a second or subsequent offender for the
                    purposes of s 14(1)<em>(b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010
                    upon his next conviction for either actually carrying on the business of
                    unlicensed moneylending or merely assisting in the same. In other words, the
                    offences of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending and assisting in
                    the carrying on of such business under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 should be
                    treated as the same in the context of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether the moneylending offences under
                    s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 are the same as the
                offences described by s 14(1) of the MLA 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I have held above (at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>) that the offences of carrying on the business of
                    unlicensed moneylending and assisting in the carrying on of such business under
                    s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 should be treated as the same in the context of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 for the
                    purposes of determining whether a later offence is a “second or
                    subsequent offence”. Extending the reasoning (see above at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>) that a subsequent offence can only be
                    considered a repeat offence if it is the same as the prior offence, unlicensed
                    moneylending offences under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    MLA 1985 may be prior offences for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 only if they are the same as
                    either of the two above-mentioned offences under s 14(1) of the MLA
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Different penalties for first offenders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As stated above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>, Mr Kumar repeatedly pointed out that the offence of
                    unlicensed moneylending under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the MLA 1985 was different from that under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 because
                    the punishment for a first offender under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the MLA 2010 was heavier than the corresponding
                    punishment under s 8(1)(i) of the MLA 1985.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Mr Kumar’s submission in this
                    regard was based on the argument that the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>–<a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>) had in fact
                    misapplied the Canadian authority of <em>Campbell v The
                        King</em> (1949) 95 CCC 63 (“<em>Campbell</em>”). In coming to its decision in <em>Tan Teck Hin</em>, the Court of Appeal had adopted the
                    decision in <em>Campbell</em>. In particular, the Court of
                    Appeal held in <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> at [39]–[41]:</p>

                            in the case of <em>Campbell</em> … In that
                            case, the appellant was convicted on a charge of possession of spirits
                            in violation of a section of the Excise Act [<em>viz</em>, the Excise Act 1934, c 52 (Can)]. He was
                            sentenced, as for second offence, to the minimum penalty of six
                            months’ imprisonment and a fine and costs. He contended that the
                            imposition of a second offence penalty was invalid on the ground that
                            his previous offence was under the same section of the Act before it was
                            amended. As in the instant case, the amendment in that case was also to
                            enhance the penalty for the same offence. <em>The
                                appellant contended that the punishment for a second or subsequent
                                offence under the re-enactment could not be imposed unless the
                                previous offence was also under the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Mr Kumar submitted that the Court of
                    Appeal might have decided <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> differently
                    if the following paragraph from <em>Campbell</em> had been
                    brought to its attention<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> (see <em>Campbell</em> at 65–66):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sections 164 and 169 of the Excise Act [<em>viz</em>, the Excise Act 1934, c 52 (Can)] can be readily
                        analyzed into three essential components: (a) The ingredients of the
                        offence; (b) <em>the punishment for first
                            offence;</em> (c) the punishment for second offence or
                        subsequent offence. <em>So far as (a) and (b) are concerned
                            the re-enactment of 1948 leaves the law precisely the same as it
                            previously was.</em> The sole purpose of the repeal and
                        re-enactment was to make it clear th[at] (c) both fine and imprisonment
                        with hard labour must be imposed in the first instance on a second or
                        subsequent offender. <em>So far, therefore, as the nature of
                            the offence and the punishment for a first offence are concerned, the
                            repeal and re-enactment must be construed as an affirmation and
                            continuance of the former law, or as Lord Esher said</em> [in
                            <em>Ex p Todd, Re Ashcroft</em> (1887) 19 QBD
                        186 at 195]<em>, so far as the re-enactment is a repetition
                            of the repealed section, it must apply to transactions which took place
                            before the commencement of the new Act.</em> [original emphasis
                        omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, Mr Kumar argued that for <em>Campbell</em> to apply, the punishment for a first offender under the
                    new Act had to be the same as the corresponding punishment under the old Act.
                    The corollary of this argument is that <em>Tan Teck
                        Hin</em> was wrongly decided since the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA
                    provided for more severe penalties for first offenders than the repealed
                    s 67(1) RTA (see below at <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a>–<a href="#p1_90">[90]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I did not accept Mr Kumar’s
                    argument. First, it is not clear that <em>Campbell</em>
                    itself would have been decided differently if the punishment for a first offence
                    had been increased after the Excise Act 1934, c 52 (Can) was repealed and
                    re-enacted. Indeed, the paragraph which preceded the passage quoted by
                    Mr Kumar (see above at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>) read as
                    follows (see <em>Campbell</em> at 65):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle so enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada [in <em>Trans-Canada Ins Co v Winter</em> [1935] 1 DLR 272]
                        and by the Court of Appeal of England [in <em>Ex p Todd, Re
                            Ashcroft</em> (1887) 19 QBD 186], is admirably stated in a
                        reference to United States cases made by Chisholm C.J. of the Supreme
                        Court of Nova Scotia, in <em>Re Green</em>,
                        65 Can. C.C. 353 at p. 355, [1936] 2 D.L.R. 153 at
                        p. 155, 10 M.P.R. 335 at pp. 338–9: “That the
                        repeal and simultaneous re-enactment of <em>substantially the
                            same statutory provisions</em> must be construed, not as an
                        implied repeal of the original statute, but as an affirmance and continuance
                        of the statute in uninterrupted operation.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To my mind, the phrase “substantially the same statutory
                    provisions” in the aforesaid principle considered in <em>Campbell</em> does not require the penalties for first offenders
                    under the old Act to be exactly the same as the corresponding penalties under
                    the new Act in order for offences under the old Act to be considered as prior
                    offences for the purposes of the new Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Further, I do not think that <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> would have been decided differently even if
                    the passage from <em>Campbell</em> reproduced at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above had been drawn to the Court of
                    Appeal’s attention (and here, I am only assuming that that had in fact not
                    been done). <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> was decided by construing
                    the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA in accordance with Parliament’s intention
                    (see <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> at [34]–[35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    What is before us is simply whether a conviction
                            under s 67(1) before its “repeal” [<em>ie</em>, a conviction under the repealed s 67(1) RTA]
                            can properly be taken into account when applying the subsection after
                            its “repeal” [<em>ie</em>, when
                            applying the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA]. The issue is one of
                            construction, of ascertaining the intention of Parliament when enacting
                            the new provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    We have no doubt at all that what Parliament
                            intended to do was simply to enhance the punishment for persons found
                            guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol [or] drugs. The
                            offence dealt with by the amended subsection [<em>viz</em>, the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA] is the same as
                            that under the old subsection [<em>viz</em>, the
                            repealed s 67(1) RTA]. <em>What was changed was the
                                punishment prescribed for persons convicted of the offence. The
                                Legislature was particularly intent on dealing severely with repeat
                                offenders.</em> Rather than prescribing a maximum fine and
                            imprisonment term and leaving it to the courts to impose an appropriate
                            punishment up to the maximum, Parliament prescribed the minimum as well.
                                <em>This indicates beyond doubt an intention to see
                                that such criminal conduct is treated with the required degree of
                                seriousness by the courts.</em> If the argument for the
                            respondent [<em>viz</em>, that his previous
                            conviction under the repealed s 67(1) RTA did not count as a prior
                            offence for the purposes of the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA] is correct,
                            it would lead to the absurd result that a person no matter how many
                            times he has been convicted in the past under the old subsection would
                            be treated as a first offender if he is convicted for the first time
                            under the new subsection. This would obviously defeat the intention of
                            the Legislature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As seen above, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> observed (at [7]) that after the repeal and re-enactment of
                    s 67(1) of the RTA, first offenders became subject to a minimum fine. It
                    noted in the same paragraph that the penalty had become “drastically
                    enhanced” for repeat offenders. Considering the changes in the punishment
                    for persons convicted under s 67(1) of the RTA, the Court of Appeal had no
                    doubt that Parliament intended to enhance the punishment for persons found
                    guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (see <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> above). Of central relevance in <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> was Parliament’s intention to see
                    that repeat drink drivers were “treated with the required degree of
                    seriousness by the courts” (see <em>Tan Teck
                        Hin</em> at [35]). This was
                    entirely consistent with the raising of penalties for (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) first offenders. Therefore, I do not think that the Court
                    of Appeal’s decision in <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> would
                    have turned on whether the penalties for first offenders under the re-enacted
                    s 67(1) RTA had been made more severe than the corresponding penalties
                    under the repealed s 67(1) RTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Returning to <em>Campbell</em>, I note that the Supreme Court of Canada has in fact
                    approved the application of <em>Campbell</em> in a
                    situation where the new legislation in question provided for increased penalties
                    for a first offender as well. In the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal case
                    of <em>Regina v Johnston</em> [1977] 2 WWR 613
                        (“<em>Johnston</em>”), the offender was
                    convicted of impaired driving under s 236(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC
                    1970, c C-34 (Can) as re-enacted by the Criminal Law Amendment Act
                    1974-75-76, c 93 (Can). He had previously been convicted under a previous
                    version of the same section, which read as follows (see <em>Johnston</em> at 614):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">236.  Every one who drives a motor vehicle or has the
                            care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,

                            in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in
                            100 millilitres of blood, is guilty of an offence punishable on

                    that the judge in the court below had applied <em>Campbell</em> correctly (see <em>Johnston</em>

                    the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I take the same view of the conviction of [the offender] in
                        1975. It was in no way affected by the subsequent substitution of
                        s. 236. It remains as an unaltered fact. Nothing has been added to or
                        taken away from that offence or its penalty. Putting aside the doctrine of
                        retrospectivity as an element in the construction of the substituted
                        section, <em>there is much support for the opinion of
                            Tallis J.</em> [<em>viz</em>, the judge

                        and on the judgment of Campbell C.J. in <em>Campbell</em> … In the latter case Campbell C.J.
                        relied, amongst other authority, upon the canon of construction stated in
                            <em>Re Green; Re Jamel</em>, 10 M.P.R. 335 at
                        338, 65 C.C.C. 353, [1936] 2 D.L.R. 153 (C.A.):</p>

                                as an affirmation and continuance of the statute in uninterrupted
                                operation.</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, the quotation from <em>Re Green</em>
                    [1936] 2 DLR 153 cited at 618–619 of <em>Johnston</em> was the same as that cited with approval by our Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> (at [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Most significantly, the Northwest Territories
                    Court of Appeal also dismissed the same argument that Mr Kumar made in the
                    present appeal, <em>viz</em>, that the offences in the old
                    and the new versions of the statutory provision in question were different
                    because the new version provided for more severe penalties for first offenders.
                    In <em>Johnston</em>, the Northwest Territories Court of
                    Appeal held (at 620):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is urged that the provisions in the substituted section that an accused
                        may be charged either on indictment or with an offence punishable on summary
                        conviction with liability to more severe penalties on a first offence
                        sufficiently separate it from the old section. I do not think so. The
                        offence is the same. Parliament has stated that for the future the
                        commission of the same offence must be dealt with more rigorously in the
                        public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The appeal against the Northwest Territories
                    Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Johnston</em> was
                    summarily dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada, which delivered a brief oral
                    judgment stating its unanimous approval of the Northwest Territories Court of
                    Appeal’s conclusion for the reasons that it gave (see <em>Johnston v The Queen</em> [1978] 2 WWR 478).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Finally, I also note that the fact that the
                    new version of a statute increased the penalty for a first offender did not
                    trouble the English Court of Criminal Appeal in a similar case. In <em>The King v Frederick Austin</em> [1913] 1 KB 551
                        (“<em>Austin</em>”), the offender was
                    convicted of living on the earnings of prostitution and was deemed a rogue and
                    vagabond within the meaning of the Vagrancy Act 1898 (c 39) (UK). He had
                    three previous convictions for similar offences. In between his previous
                    convictions and the conviction which was in issue in <em>Austin</em>, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912 (c 20) (UK) was
                    passed to increase the penalty for a first offender from a maximum of three
                    months’ imprisonment to a maximum of six months’ imprisonment with
                    hard labour. In addition, the same amendment Act provided that on conviction on
                    indictment for a subsequent offence, an offender could be whipped in addition to
                    being imprisoned. Phillimore J held that in order to justify a sentence of
                    whipping, it was not necessary that an offender should have had a previous
                    conviction since the enactment of the amendment Act; neither was it necessary
                    for the offender’s previous conviction to have been on indictment (see
                        <em>Austin</em> at 555).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Having carefully considered <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> as well as the cases of <em>Campbell</em>, <em>Johnston</em> and <em>Austin</em> discussed above, I could not accept
                    Mr Kumar’s argument that the offence of unlicensed moneylending under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 was different
                    from that under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 because the punishment for a first
                    offender under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the MLA 2010
                    was heftier than the corresponding punishment under s 8(1)(i) of the MLA
                    1985.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     For completeness, I also deal with
                    Mr Kumar’s related argument that it was simply not fair to punish the
                    Appellant as a repeat offender under the MLA 2010 when the punishment for a
                    first offender under the MLA 2010 was already stiffer than that provided for in
                    the MLA 1985 (see above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>). With
                    respect, I did not see the logic of this argument. That the punishment for a
                    first offender was stiffer under the MLA 2010 was irrelevant to the Appellant if
                    he were correctly considered to be a repeat offender under the MLA 2010, which
                    was the preliminary issue at hand in this appeal. As for Mr Kumar’s
                    suggestion that the court could impose a slightly higher punishment on account
                    of the Appellant’s prior convictions under the MLA 1985 even if it were to
                    treat him as a first offender under the MLA 2010 (see above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>), this would neither be proper nor necessary
                    if the Appellant were rightly identified as a second or subsequent offender
                    under the MLA 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Different wording and structure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The offence of unlicensed moneylending is set
                    out differently under the MLA 2010 as compared to under the MLA 1985. This is
                    primarily due to the changes introduced when the MLA 1985 was repealed and
                    re-enacted as the MLA 2008 (see above at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>). While s 8(1) of the MLA 1985 provided for both the
                    offence of unlicensed moneylending and the punishment for it, the MLA 2008
                    prohibited unlicensed moneylending under s 5(1), and separately provided
                    that the contravention or the assistance in the contravention of s 5(1) was
                    an offence and was punishable under s 14(1). The MLA 2010, which the
                    Appellant’s present offences fall under, proscribes unlicensed
                    moneylending in much the same way as the MLA 2008, save that the existing
                    penalties have been enhanced and the additional punishment of caning has been
                    made available under s 14(1A) of the MLA 2010 (see above at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As the offence of unlicensed moneylending is
                    now set out differently under the MLA 2010, this case is a first of sorts. In
                    the previous cases dealing with the point of law raised by the preliminary issue
                    presently under consideration, the new version of the statute in question had
                    largely (if not entirely) preserved the way in which the offence was set out in
                    the previous version of the statute. For example, in <em>Tan Teck
                        Hin</em>, the repealed s 67(1) RTA read as follows (see <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> at [3]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a
                            motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of
                            drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper
                            control of such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence</em> and
                        shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to
                        imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, and in the case of a second
                        or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment
                        for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. [original emphasis omitted;
                        emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The re-enacted s 67(1) RTA read as
                    follows (see <em>Tan Teck Hin</em> at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a
                            motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of

                            control of such vehicle shall be guilty of an offence</em> and
                        shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more
                        than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and, in the
                        case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $3,000
                        and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12
                        months. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, although the re-enacted s 67(1) RTA provided for
                    more severe punishment for both first and repeat offenders, that part of the
                    re-enacted s 67(1) RTA which set out the offence was exactly the same as
                    the corresponding part of the repealed s 67(1) RTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     This was the same situation as that in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohd Yusoff bin Jalil</em>
                    [1994] 3 SLR(R) 895 (“<em>Jalil</em>”),
                    where s 8(<em>a</em>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act
                    (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the MDA 1985”) entirely
                    preserved the wording of the offence of possession under s 6(<em>a</em>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (Act 5 of 1973)
                    (“the MDA 1973”), but provided for stricter punishment for second
                    and subsequent offenders. Yong CJ held that the respondent’s
                    conviction in 1980 under s 6(<em>a</em>) of the MDA
                    1973 subsisted as a “<em>previous
                    conviction</em>” [emphasis in original] (see <em>Jalil</em> at [3]) for the
                    same offence that later became the offence under s 8(<em>a</em>) of the MDA 1985.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In contrast, in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Chen Chih Sheng and another appeal</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 182 (“<em>Chen Chih
                    Sheng</em>”), there was a substantive change in the wording
                    providing for the offence in question. This case is particularly instructive.
                    There, a restaurant’s employment of a foreign worker without having
                    obtained a valid work permit was attributable to the default of the offender,
                    who was the managing director of the restaurant. Such employment was an offence
                    under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1991 Rev Ed) as
                    amended by the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Act 1995 (Act 37
                    of 1995) (“the amended EFWA 1991”). The offender had a previous
                    conviction pursuant to similar provisions in the pre-amended version of the same
                    Act (“the original EFWA 1991”). The Prosecution submitted that the
                    offender’s conviction under the original EFWA 1991 meant that his
                    conviction under the amended EFWA 1991 was a second conviction for the purposes
                    of the latter Act. Therefore, the Prosecution argued, the offender was subject
                    to mandatory imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In coming to his decision, Yong CJ
                    compared a series of matching provisions in the original EFWA 1991 and the
                    amended EFWA 1991. To illustrate my point, I need only discuss his comparison of
                    s 5(6) of the original EFWA 1991 and s 16D of the amended EFWA 1991.
                    Both provisions provided that an officer of a company would be guilty of the
                    offence of employing a foreign worker without a valid work permit if the same
                    offence, as committed by his company, was proved to be attributable to him.
                    Section 5(6) of the original EFWA 1991 read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When any offence under subsection (1) [<em>viz</em>, the offence of employing a foreign worker without a
                        valid work permit] committed by a body corporate is proved to have been
                        committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to
                            <em>any neglect</em> on the part of, any director,
                        manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate or any
                        person purporting to act in any such capacity, he as well as the body
                        corporate shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be
                        proceeded against and punished accordingly. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 16D of the amended EFWA 1991 read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an offence under this Act or any regulations made thereunder is
                        committed by a body corporate, and it is proved to have been committed with
                        the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to <em>any act or default</em> on the part of, any director, manager,
                        secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person who
                        was purporting to act in any such capacity, he, as well as the body
                        corporate, shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be
                        proceeded against and punished accordingly. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In respect of the aforesaid provisions,
                    Yong CJ held (see <em>Chen Chih Sheng</em> at
                        [46]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    Having perused the
                            relevant sections of the 1991 as well as the 1995 Act [<em>viz</em>, the original EFWA 1991 and the amended EFWA
                            1991 respectively], I agreed with the submissions of the DPP. The only
                            difference between the 1991 and the 1995 Acts is that the 1995 Act has
                            incorporated into it the amendments made to the 1991 Act by the
                            Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Act (Act 37 of 1995).

                                concerned, its definition has remained the same save for the
                                following changes</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    
                <em>In the 1991 Act, the
                                    offence of employing a worker without a valid work permit by the
                                    body corporate must be attributable to the neglect of the
                                    accused. In the 1995 Act, the offence by the body corporate must
                                    be attributable to the act or default of the accused.</em>
                                I do not propose to go into an exhaustive or in-depth examination of
                                the term “default” in the context of the 1995 Act.
                                Suffice it to say that in interpreting the term, it is useful to
                                keep in mind the natural and ordinary meaning of the word
                                “default” as a working guide, albeit with the
                                qualification that this is not exhaustive. For present purposes, it
                                suffices to note that one of the meanings of default as defined in
                                the Oxford English Dictionary is: “Failure to act;
                                neglect”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>It is clear therefore that the phrase “act
                                or default” is wider than and includes the term
                                “neglect”.</em>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Having dealt with and compared the other
                    matching provisions of the original EFWA 1991 and the amended EFWA 1991,
                    Yong CJ concluded as follows (see <em>Chen Chih
                        Sheng</em> at [47]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was clear from the above comparison that the sole effect of the
                        amendments to the offence in question between 1991 and 1995 was to broaden
                        the ambit of the offence. <em>In other words, the same facts
                            which would support a conviction under s 5(6) read with s 5(1)
                            and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1991 Act</em> [<em>viz</em>, the original EFWA 1991] <em>would also sustain a conviction under s 16D read with s 5(1)
                            and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1995 Act</em> [<em>viz</em>, the amended EFWA 1991]<em>.</em> As such, I did not see why the accused’s conviction
                        under s 5(6) read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of
                        the 1991 Act should not count as a previous conviction under the 1995 Act,
                        so as to make the accused’s current conviction under s 16D read
                        with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1995 Act a second
                        conviction which would attract the sentence of mandatory imprisonment under
                            s 5(4)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the 1995 Act.
                        Clearly, the intention of Parliament in re-enacting s 5(4)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the 1995 Act was to ensure stricter
                        punishment for individuals who repeatedly committed the offence in question,
                        and it would be an absurd denial of Parliament’s intention if in
                        considering whether the accused’s current conviction was a second
                        conviction, the courts were to ignore his past conviction on the mere basis
                        that … he had been convicted under an earlier edition of the Act
                        which defined the offence in question more narrowly than the 1995 Act. I
                        therefore allowed the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In my view, <em>Chen Chih
                        Sheng</em> is sound authority for the proposition that the test for
                    whether an offence provided for under the previous version of a statutory
                    provision is <em>the same</em> as the offence provided for
                    under the new version of that statutory provision is whether the same facts
                    which would support a conviction under the previous version would also sustain a
                    conviction under the new version. In short, only the ingredients of the offence
                    need be the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In the present case, it is clear that the
                    facts supporting a conviction for carrying on the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985
                    would also support a conviction for carrying on the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending in contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010, which is an
                    offence under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010. Further, it is also clear that the
                    facts supporting a conviction for the abetment (by intentional aiding) of
                    carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 would also support a conviction for
                    assisting in the carrying on of the business of unlicensed moneylending, which
                    is also a contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010 and an offence under
                    s 14(1) of the MLA 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Therefore, for the purposes of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010, the two
                    aforementioned offences under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the MLA 1985 are the same as the offences under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 of
                    carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending and assisting in the
                    carrying on of such business (respectively, contravening and assisting in the
                    contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Whether Parliament intended that convictions for
                moneylending offences under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA
                1985 should count as prior convictions for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Absence of transitional and savings provisions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I shall now deal with Mr Kumar’s
                    submission that if it were Parliament’s intention for prior convictions
                    for unlicensed moneylending under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the MLA 1985 to count as prior convictions for the purposes of s 14(1)
                    of the MLA 2010, then Parliament would have provided specifically for it. In
                    this regard, Mr Kumar referred to s 5 of the Employment of Foreign
                    Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 1997 Rev Ed) (as amended by the Employment of

                    Mr San’s and Mr Lim’s arguments that the absence of
                    transitional and savings provisions is of little consequence to the present

                    5th Ed, 2008) (at pp 314 and 725–726) are illuminating:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Where an Act contains substantive, amending or

                            their effect during the period of transition.</p>

                    Parliament’s intention was for it not to be so. Rather, in the absence of

                    history of the MLA 2010 (at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>–<a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above) and
                    concluded (at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> above) that the markedly
                    robust increases in the penalties for unlicensed moneylending over the years
                    indicate that Parliament has set its face implacably against this societal
                    problem. As stated above at <a href="#p1_98">[98]</a>, the
                    offences under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 of
                    carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending and abetting (by
                    intentionally aiding) the carrying on of such business are the same as the
                    offences under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 of carrying on the business of
                    unlicensed moneylending and assisting in the carrying on of such business
                    (respectively, contravening and assisting in the contravention of s 5(1) of
                    the MLA 2010). What is different in the MLA 2010 is the increased penalties for
                    both first and repeat offenders in respect of these offences. In particular, the
                    higher maximum imprisonment term provided for repeat offenders under
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 as
                    compared to first offenders shows Parliament’s clear intention to punish
                    repeat offenders more severely than first offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In my view, it would entirely defeat the
                    legislative intention if the courts were to ignore prior convictions for
                    unlicensed moneylending (and the abetting by intentional aiding thereof) under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 when
                    considering whether an offender should be punished as a repeat offender under
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010. To ignore
                    such prior convictions would be to “[wipe] the slate
                        clean”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> for all offenders who have
                    been convicted of offences under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the MLA 1985. I agreed that this would be an absurd result in the face of
                    Parliament’s untiring refrain of wanting to send a strong signal of zero
                    tolerance for unlicensed moneylending activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The ROCA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Given my ruling at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a> above, Mr San’s submission based on s 7E
                    of the ROCA (see above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>) was quite
                    unnecessary. However, for completeness, I will deal with it briefly.
                        Section 7E(2)(<em>c</em>) of the ROCA provides
                    that in the context of court proceedings, a person’s criminal records will
                    not be considered spent and can be considered for (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) sentencing purposes. Mr San argued that given
                    Parliament’s reluctance to expunge an offender’s criminal records
                    wholly, it could not have intended that an offender’s previous conviction
                    was to be disregarded only because that previous conviction was under a repealed
                        Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> With respect, I did not find
                    this argument particularly helpful. It was as weak as it was broad. Whether or
                    not a previous conviction under a repealed Act should be regarded as a previous
                    conviction for the purposes of the replacement Act depends on Parliament’s
                    intent regarding the specific statutory provision in question, which intent is
                    to be ascertained by taking into account, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the considerations which I have discussed in coming to my
                    conclusion at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether treating the Appellant’s present offences as repeat
                offences under the MLA 2010 would contravene Art 11(1) of the
                Constitution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Notwithstanding my views on
                    Parliament’s intention (see above at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>), the Appellant could nonetheless still have succeeded in
                    the present appeal if he had succeeded on his alternative submission that to
                    treat his convictions under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    MLA 1985 as prior convictions for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 would be contrary to
                    Art 11(1) of the Constitution. To recap, Art 11(1) of the Constitution
                    (reproduced earlier at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Protection against retrospective criminal laws and
                            </b>

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>11.</b>—(1) No person shall be
                        punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was
                        done or made, and <em>no person shall suffer greater
                            punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time
                            </em><em>it was committed.</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    If the Appellant’s alternative
                    submission were correct, he would succeed in his appeal because
                    Parliament’s powers are ultimately limited by the Constitution. In this
                    regard, Kevin Y L Tan &amp; Thio Li-ann, <em>Constitutional Law in Malaysia and Singapore</em> (LexisNexis,
                    3rd Ed, 2010) states this trite principle thus (at p 353):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>(2) LIMITS TO LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCE</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A legislative body which operates under a written constitution derives its
                        legislative competence and powers from the constitution itself. It cannot
                        therefore promulgate laws which are contrary to the constitution, unless it
                        complies with the special procedure for constitutional amendment.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Mr Kumar argued that the second limb of
                    Art 11(1) of the Constitution prohibited treating the Appellant as a repeat
                    offender for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii)
                    of the MLA 2010. This was because the word “offence” in
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 referred
                    to an offence under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010, and not an offence under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Therefore, since the Appellant
                    was being convicted under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 for the first time, to
                    treat him as a repeat offender for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 was to apply
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) to him
                        retrospectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    With respect, this was, on closer analysis,
                    no more than a tired rehash of Mr Kumar’s argument that
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 should not
                    be construed to include convictions for unlicensed moneylending under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 for the
                    purposes of determining whether the Appellant was a repeat offender. Since I
                    have rejected Mr Kumar’s argument on that point (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>), his argument in relation to
                    Art 11(1) of the Constitution necessarily fails as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The effect of the second limb of
                    Art 11(1) of the Constitution is that no one may be punished more severely
                    for an offence than was legally provided for when the offence was committed.
                    Criminal laws guide human behaviour by threatening the imposition of certain
                    penalties for certain misconduct. It would not be fair to raise the stakes after
                    the misconduct is committed. The more severe penalties would also achieve
                    nothing in the way of general deterrence by then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Article 11(1) of the Constitution might
                    arguably be engaged if one conceives of the enhanced penalties for second or
                    subsequent offences as being also punishment for the first offence. On that
                    conception, since the enhanced penalties for second or subsequent moneylending
                    offences are more severe now than they were when the Appellant committed his
                    prior moneylending offences in November 2008, he would be suffering greater
                    punishment for his earlier offences than was prescribed by law at the time those
                    offences were committed. I do not think this conception of the enhanced
                    penalties for repeat offences is correct. The correct view is that such enhanced
                    penalties are punishment for only the repeat offences, and not for the earlier
                    offences as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    This is because the effect of the first
                    offence is to <em>aggravate</em> the commission of the
                    repeat offence. The aggravated nature of the repeat offence forms the basis for
                    punishing it more severely. Even without legislation specifically providing for
                    it, it is an established sentencing principle for repeat offenders to be
                    punished more severely on account of the aggravated nature of their second or
                    subsequent offences. Legislation such as s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 merely serves to increase the
                    court’s sentencing powers when it comes to taking into account the
                    aggravated nature of the repeat offence. The enhanced penalties imposed on a
                    repeat offender are to punish him for committing the same offence a second or
                    subsequent time. It would be a stretch to assert that they are imposed to punish
                    him once again for committing the offence the first time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Therefore, the only question that the second
                    limb of Art 11(1) of the Constitution raises is whether the Appellant
                    suffers greater punishment for his present offences than was prescribed by law
                    at the time they were committed. Since the enhanced penalties under
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 were in
                    force at the time the Appellant committed the present offences, there is no
                    contravention of Art 11(1). It is not unfair or retrospective to impose the
                    enhanced penalties for repeat offences provided for under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 on the Appellant as he could have
                    avoided those penalties by not committing the present offences. I leave this
                    point by gratefully adopting Phillimore J’s eloquent concluding
                    remarks in <em>Austin</em> (at 556):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is said that a retrospective effect must not be given to a penal
                        statute. No doubt; one can hardly imagine the Legislature punishing a man
                        for having done an act which at the time of its commission was a perfectly
                        innocent act. <em>But to prescribe punishment for an old
                            offender in case in the future he persists in his crime is quite another
                            matter. The offence in question was committed since the Act</em>
                            [<em>viz</em>, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912
                        (c 20) (UK)]<em>. The Act says that a man guilty in the
                            future may, if he has already been guilty in the past, be punished as he
                            could not have been before the Act. There is nothing wrong in that. No
                            man has such a vested interest in his past crimes and their consequences
                            as would entitle him to insist that in no future legislation shall any
                            regard whatever be had to his previous history.</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary and determination of the preliminary issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    To summarise the foregoing analysis of the
                    preliminary issue, there is no particular significance to be attached to the
                    repeal of the MLA 1985 and its re-enactment as the MLA 2008. This appears to be
                    an instance of legislative housekeeping rather than one of radical change.
                    Whether previous offences committed under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 may be taken into account as prior offences
                    for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                    2010 is a matter of statutory construction. In this regard, the offences under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 of carrying on
                    the business of unlicensed moneylending and abetting (by intentionally aiding)
                    the carrying on of such business are the same as the offences under s 14(1)
                    of the MLA 2010 of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending and
                    assisting in the carrying on of such business (respectively, contravening and
                    assisting in the contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    It is abundantly clear from the conspicuous
                    increases in the penalties for unlicensed moneylending over the years, the
                    parliamentary debates and the more severe penalties for repeat offenders
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> first offenders that Parliament has
                    signalled that offenders who are repeatedly involved (either as principal or
                    assistant) in unlicensed moneylending operations must be severely dealt with. On
                    a purposive interpretation of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii)
                    of the MLA 2010, previous offences of carrying on the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985
                    and abetting (by intentionally aiding) the same should count as prior offences
                    for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                    2010. This would be the case regardless of whether the second or subsequent
                    offence under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010 is one of carrying on the business of
                    unlicensed moneylending or assisting in the same (respectively, contravening and
                    assisting in the contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010). This
                    construction of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA
                    2010 does not contravene Art 11(1) of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Focusing on the specific circumstances of
                    the Appellant’s case now, the Appellant’s prior convictions were for
                    abetting (by intentionally aiding) the carrying on of the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985.
                    He did so by disbursing money to an unlicensed moneylending syndicate’s
                    runner. His present charges were for issuing loans and collecting repayments of
                    loans in consequence of a conspiracy to carry on the business of unlincensed
                    moneylending, which conduct was a contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA 2010
                    and, thus, an offence under s 14(1) of the MLA 2010. In this regard, I
                    disagreed with Mr Kumar’s submission that in respect of the present
                    offences, the Appellant merely assisted in the contravention of s 5(1) of
                    the MLA 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Notwithstanding that the Statement of Facts
                    stated that the Appellant was arrested “for <em>assisting</em> in carrying on an unlicensed moneylending
                    business” [emphasis added],<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> it also made clear that the Appellant
                    was a partner in the unlicensed moneylending business whose activities
                    contravened s 5(1) of the MLA 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> In fact, the Appellant can be
                    considered an “equity partner” since he was promised a 30% share
                    of the profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I noted that the acts of collecting
                    repayment and issuing loans on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender came within
                    the defined instances of assisting in the contravention of s 14(1) of the
                    MLA 2010 (and in turn, assisting in the contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA
                    2010) as set out by s 14(3A) of the MLA 2010.
                        Sections 14(3A)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) provide as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the Appellant was not merely assisting in the unlicensed
                    moneylending business by collecting repayments and issuing loans on behalf of B2
                    and B3. As stated above, he was in partnership with them as they conducted the
                    unlicensed moneylending business together. I therefore accepted
                    Mr San’s submission that the Appellant’s conduct had clearly
                    gone beyond that of mere assistance. In respect of the present offences, the
                    Appellant had been carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending on his
                    own account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Therefore, the Appellant’s prior
                    offences were for abetting (by intentionally aiding) the carrying on of an
                    unlicensed moneylending business under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985, while his present offences were for actually
                    carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending in contravention of
                    s 5(1) of the MLA 2010. I have held (see above at <a href="#p1_98">[98]</a>) that these offences are the same for the purposes of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010. In the
                    light of the above, Mr Kumar’s submission that the Appellant’s
                    previous offences (which he said were for abetting) and the Appellant’s
                    present offences (which he said were for assisting) were different offences (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>) was quite clearly off the
                    mark. As none of Mr Kumar’s other submissions found any success
                    either, I decided the preliminary issue in the affirmative and against the
                    Appellant. To my mind, it was clear beyond doubt that the Appellant’s
                    repeated intimate involvement in unlicensed moneylending operations in relation
                    to his previous and present convictions was exactly the type of conduct which
                    Parliament intended to deter in enacting s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010 as legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In my view, as far as the offences of
                    carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending and abetting (by
                    intentionally aiding) the same are concerned, ss 5(1) and 14(1) of the MLA
                    2008 (and in turn, ss 5(1) and 14(1) of the MLA 2010) are in substance an
                    affirmation and continuance of the former law under s 8(1) of the MLA 1985
                    (read with the relevant abetment provisions under the 1985 revised edition of
                    the Penal Code, in the case of abetment by intentional aiding). Therefore, the
                    DJ was correct to consider the Appellant’s previous convictions under
                        s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 for abetting
                    (by intentionally aiding) the carrying on of the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending in determining that his present offences under s 14(1) of the
                    MLA 2010 (of contravening s 5(1) of the MLA 2010) were “second or
                    subsequent offence[s]” for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010. In other words, the enhanced
                    penalty provisions under s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of
                    the MLA 2010 were correctly applied to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    This is an appropriate juncture to state
                    that before me, Mr San also clarified that the only reason why the
                    Appellant was charged with abetment in the present proceedings was because there
                    was a conspiracy involved. Section 107 of the Penal Code states that
                    abetment may take place by instigation, intentional aiding or conspiracy. To
                    that extent, it was incidental that the element of abetment was repeated in the
                    present offences as well. I should make it clear that had the Appellant been
                    acting alone and, thus, not charged with abetment with regard to the present
                    offences, it would not have made any difference to my decision on the
                    preliminary issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reduction of the Appellant’s sentence in respect of fines and
                caning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Having established that the Appellant was
                    correctly treated as a repeat offender for the purposes of
                        s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010, I moved
                    on to consider the merits of his appeal against sentence proper. Mr Kumar
                    submitted that the total sentences in respect of the fines, caning and
                    imprisonment imposed on the Appellant were manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fines</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    I agreed with Mr Kumar that the fines
                    imposed on the Appellant were manifestly excessive. In <em>Chia
                        Kah Boon v Public Prosecutor</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 1163
                        (“<em>Chia Kah Boon</em>”), the District
                    Judge ordered the appellant to pay a total of $4,606,000 in fines (in default,
                    50 months’ imprisonment) – more than 1,000 times his annual income
                    – for nine charges of the offence under s 130(1) of the Customs Act
                    (Cap 70, 1997 Rev Ed) of importing uncustomed goods into Singapore. On
                    appeal, Yong CJ held that the cumulative effect of the fines was contrary
                    to the second limb of the totality principle in that it imposed “a
                    crushing sentence” on the appellant not in keeping with his records and
                    prospects. The appellant’s total fines were thus reduced to $1,550,993.25
                    (however, the default terms of imprisonment for the nine charges were increased
                    to 203 months in total as Yong CJ considered the default imprisonment terms
                    imposed by the District Judge manifestly inadequate). In considering the
                    appropriate sentence to be imposed, Yong CJ stated (see <em>Chia Kah Boon</em> at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Turning then to the question of what the appropriate sentence would be in
                        the circumstances of the present case, in determining the fines to be
                        imposed on the appellant, I took into account two competing considerations.
                            <em>On one hand, the fines had to be of an amount which
                            the appellant could reasonably pay given his financial means. On the
                            other hand, the fines had to be fixed at a level which would be
                            sufficiently high to achieve the dual objectives of deterrence, in terms
                            of deterring both the appellant and other importers from evading GST
                            [goods and services tax] on imported goods in future, and retribution,
                            in the sense of reflecting society’s abhorrence of the offence
                            under s 130(1)(</em>a<em>) of the Customs
                            Act.</em> In particular, importers and other persons who might be
                        tempted to commit the same offence should not be given the impression that
                        they may be let off lightly for their misdeeds if they are detected simply
                        because they lack the financial ability to pay the fines which may be
                        imposed under s 130(1)(<em>i</em>) of the Act.
                        Bearing these considerations in mind, <em>I concluded that a
                            fine of five times the amount of GST payable in respect of each charge
                            would be just and appropriate in light of the appellant’s limited
                            financial means, the totality principle of sentencing</em>, the
                        aggravated nature of the offences in question, and the deterrent and
                        retributive aspects of the penalty under s 130(1)(<em>i</em>) of the Customs Act. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should add that Yong CJ also ordered the default terms of
                    imprisonment for two of the nine charges to run concurrently, resulting in an
                    aggregate default term of imprisonment of 71 months (<em>cf</em> the 50 months imposed by the District Judge).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In the present case, as far as the facts in
                    the record show, the Appellant does not appear to any extent to be a man of any
                    financial means; neither did the Prosecution suggest that he had the means to
                    pay the fines imposed by the DJ or that he had derived significant financial
                    benefits from his offending conduct. I did not think that the cumulative fine of
                    $480,000 was an amount which, by any stretch of imagination, the Appellant could
                    pay. To sentence the Appellant to a cumulative fine of this amount was
                    effectively to order an additional imprisonment sentence (in default of the
                    amount that the Appellant could not pay). <em>If the Appellant
                        were the financier (as B3 was) of the unlicensed moneylending business, or
                        if he had made significant profits from the business, he would certainly
                        </em><em>have deserved a substantial fine to ensure
                        that all the profits which he made would be disgorged.</em> This much
                    is clear from the statement by the then Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc
                    Prof Ho, during the second reading of the Moneylenders Bill 2009 as follows
                    (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> vol 86
                    at col 2056):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As loanshark syndicates evolve their <em>modus
                            operandi</em> to take on more characteristics of organised
                        criminal groups, it is no longer sufficient to deal with loansharking as
                        discrete acts of runners and harassers. We need measures that can cripple
                        them, that is, <em>disgorge them of their ill-gotten gains,
                            choke the supply of funds</em> and availability of foot soldiers,
                        target the irresponsible borrowers and take loansharks out of the system for
                        as long as we need to. Thus, this Bill allows us to deal with loanshark
                        syndicates as criminal organisations, extend beyond the frontline to target
                        financiers and masterminds, disrupt the flow of money and resources and
                        ensure that syndicate leaders do not escape the bite of our laws by
                        directing local operatives from the haven of other countries. To cripple the
                        many layers of a loanshark syndicate, anyone who contributes to or
                        facilitates a loansharking operation will attract the wrath of the law.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In the present case, the Appellant was
                    plainly merely “the hands and legs” of, and not the supplier of
                    capital for, the unlicensed moneylending business. Further, the Statement of
                    Facts stated that he had received only $600 in profits from the business. Taking
                    these considerations into account, I reduced the fines imposed on the Appellant
                    for each of the six charges proceeded on from $80,000 to $40,000. Accordingly, I
                    also reduced the default term of imprisonment for each charge from four months
                    to two months. Therefore, the Appellant’s aggregate sentence by way of
                    fine was reduced to $240,000 (in default, 12 months’ imprisonment). I
                    considered that this aggregate fine was of a level sufficient to deter other
                    persons in the Appellant’s position from engaging in unlicensed
                    moneylending and to reflect society’s abhorrence of the Appellant’s
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Before leaving the issue of fines, I should
                    perhaps point out that there is a paucity of case authorities from both within
                    and outside our jurisdiction providing any comprehensive guidance as to how a
                    court should assess the quantum of fine to be imposed in circumstances where a
                    written penal law (such as that in issue in the present appeal) mandates that a
                        <em>conjunctive sentence</em> of <em>both</em> a fine and a term of imprisonment be meted out to an
                    offender. Written penal laws ordinarily give the courts the option of imposing
                    either a fine or a term of imprisonment or both. In such situations, there have
                    been some general principles laid down by the courts to the effect that the
                    judicial practice of combining a fine with a custodial sentence should generally
                    be eschewed. In this particular respect, it may be profitable to refer to the
                    Malaysian case of <em>Thavanathan a/l Balasubramaniam v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1997] 2 MLJ 401 (“<em>Thavanathan a/l Balasubramaniam</em>”), where the offender in
                    question was charged, acquitted and later convicted of corruption. The Malaysian
                    Supreme Court perceptively observed (at 423D–E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, a punitive fine should not be added to a term of imprisonment
                        which a sentencer considers is itself adequate punishment for the offence
                        except in rare cases where, for example, even the maximum permitted
                        custodial sentence is considered to be inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In the much older Malaysian case of
                        <em>Yap Teng Chai v Public Prosecutor</em> (1959)
                    25 MLJ 205 (“<em>Yap Teng Chai</em>”),
                    where the offender in question was convicted of the offence of attempting to
                    escape from lawful custody, Hepworth J similarly noted (at
                    205I–206A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In general I take the view that a sentence should be either a sentence of
                        imprisonment or a sentence of fine and not both. Again speaking generally
                        cases in which a sentence of imprisonment and fine might, in my opinion,
                        fairly be imposed are cases of serious revenue offences and in the case of
                        offences which are not <em>mala per se</em> but where
                        it has become apparent that sentences of fine only on other persons in the
                        area in respect of similar offence[s] in the recent past have been
                        insufficient to act as a deterrent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should parenthetically add that in the context of our legislative
                    regime against illegal moneylending activities in Singapore, it appears that the
                    introduction via the Moneylenders Bill 2009 (enacted as the Moneylenders
                    (Amendment) Act 2010 (Act 5 of 2010)) of the mandatory conjunctive
                    imposition of both a fine and a term of imprisonment for first as well as repeat
                    offenders (see, respectively, ss 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i)
                    and 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2008 as amended by the
                    aforesaid amendment Act) was precisely the upshot of Parliament’s resolve
                    to strengthen the legislative regime in response to the perception at the time
                    that a stronger signal should be sent out to society to deter illegal
                    moneylending activities (see <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>–<a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    A quick survey of the jurisprudence in
                    foreign jurisdictions also showed that in at least two other jurisdictions,
                    namely, England (see David Thomas, <em>Current Sentencing
                        Practice</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2010) at vol 2,
                    paras J1-3A01–J1-3E01) and Hong Kong (see I Grenville Cross
                    &amp; Patrick W S Cheung, <em>Sentencing in Hong
                        Kong</em> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Sentencing in Hong Kong</em>”) at p 245), the position
                    with respect to situations where conjunctive sentences of fine and imprisonment
                    may discretionarily be imposed has always been that while the courts may impose
                    a fine in conjunction with a custodial sentence where it is shown that an
                    offender has profited from the offence, <em>a fine should not be
                        imposed if the offender lacks the means to pay the fine and will have to
                        serve the imprisonment term imposed in default of payment of the
                        fine.</em> For the sake of completeness, I shall also quote a passage
                    from <em>Sentencing in Hong Kong</em> (at p 245) which
                    succinctly summarises the principles applicable to the determination of the
                    length of the default custodial sentence whenever conjunctive sentences of fine
                    and imprisonment are imposed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a term of imprisonment is imposed upon an accused in default, that is
                        not to be regarded as an additional punishment. It is simply the means by
                        which the accused is encouraged to surrender his profits or to pay his debt
                        to society. <em>However, when imprisonment is coupled with a
                            fine, and a term is fixed in default, a court should consider the
                            overall sentence to which the accused may become subject</em>: R v
                        Savundra <em>(1968) 52 Cr App R 637, 646</em>.
                            <em>The court should ensure that in the event of default
                            the total sentence to be served is not disproportionate to the
                            offence</em>: R v Green and Green <em>(1984)
                            6 Cr App R (S) 329, 332</em>. Such sentences, inevitably,
                        will be consecutive to one another. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These words, if I may add, are a succinct summary of the judicial
                    reasoning underpinning the particular sentences meted out in each of the cases
                    cited. In <em>Emil Savundra, Stuart de Quincey Walker</em>
                    (1968) 52 Cr App R 637 (“<em>Savundra</em>”), where the offenders were arrested and tried on
                    charges of gross fraud, the English Court of Appeal stated at 646:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Turning to the appeals against sentence and dealing first with
                        Savundra’s appeal, there can be no doubt that he was the architect of
                        these gross frauds and played the chief part in carrying them out. Equally,
                        there is no doubt that by these frauds he enriched himself by many hundreds
                        of thousands of pounds at the expense of the policyholders who had trusted
                        the Fire, Auto and Marine Insurance Company Limited with their money and
                        who, as a result of the frauds, lost large sums which many of them could ill
                        afford. This was fraud on an enormous scale. Moreover, this appellant did
                        not stop short of uttering forged certificates for over £500,000 of
                        stock on one occasion and over £800,000 worth of shares on another for
                        the purpose of covering up his defalcations. <em>Having
                            regard to the gravity of these offences, this Court does not consider
                            that a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment would have been any too
                            long. The learned judge sentenced this appellant to eight years’
                            imprisonment and he fined him in all £50,000 and in default of
                            paying that £50,000 he sentenced him to a further two years’
                            imprisonment</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Jonathan Russell Green and John Green</em>
                    (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 329 (“<em>Green and
                        Green</em>”), where the offenders in question were convicted of
                    illegal importation of cannabis into the United Kingdom and sentenced to fines
                    in addition to imprisonment terms, the English Court of Appeal (citing <em>Savundra</em>, among other authorities, with approval) laid
                    down the proposition in more substantive terms as follows (see <em>Green and Green</em> at 332):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have been assisted by Mr. Corkery [counsel for the second
                        appellant] taking us through a fairly elaborate citation of authority. I do
                        not propose to refer to all those authorities, but I summarise their effect
                        as follows. <em>If it cannot be shown that an offender has
                            made a profit out of a transaction and has no means to pay a fine, it is
                            not right to impose a fine in addition to a prison sentence (see
                            </em><em><font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Maund </font></em><em>(1980) 2 Cr.App.R.(S.) 289). If it is apparent to the court that,
                            as the result of a crime, the accused has received a large financial
                            benefit and if there is reason to suppose that some of that financial
                            benefit is still available to him, it is perfectly proper to impose a
                            fine in addition to a term of immediate imprisonment. But, nevertheless,
                            when imposing the fine and fixing the alternative penalty to be served
                            in default of payment of the fine, the court should have regard to the
                            overall term of imprisonment that will be served in such circumstances.
                            The court should ensure that the overall term of imprisonment to be
                            served in such a contingency will not be disappropriate to the offence

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    I broadly agree with the approach on
                    conjunctive sentencing adopted in <em>Thavanathan a/l
                        Balasubramaniam</em>, <em>Yap Teng Chai</em>,
                        <em>Savundra</em> and <em>Green and
                        Green</em>. I am of the view that in the context of
                        ss 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) and 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010, the mandatory fine imposed in
                    addition to the mandatory term of imprisonment should <em>ordinarily</em> be pegged closer to the prescribed minimum quantum of
                    $30,000, especially if the offender demonstrably has little or no means of
                    paying even the statutorily mandated minimum fine of $30,000. <em>This is provided also that the default custodial sentence is imposed in a
                        way that would not undermine the stronger deterrent effect which Parliament
                        intended the mandatory conjunctive sentencing regime under the relevant
                        provisions of the MLA 2010 to have on existing and potential unlicensed
                        moneylenders in our society.</em> Fines, the payment of which is often
                    secured by the court’s imposition of default imprisonment terms which
                    cannot be negligible if they are to serve their purpose of “prevent[ing]
                    evasion of the payment of fines” (see <em>Low Meng Chay v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 46 at [13]), should, wherever possible, avoid being
                    made a “disguise” or “cloak” for substantial
                    additional terms of imprisonment (see Tan Yock Lin, <em>Criminal
                        Procedure</em> (LexisNexis, 2010) at vol 3, para 1751).
                    Further, it ought to be also borne in mind that while the same principle of
                    remission applies to default imprisonment sentences, the scenario may be quite
                    different if part of the fine is paid before or after the default imprisonment
                    sentence has commenced (see <em>Tan Lai Kiat v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1042 at [46]–[49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    In providing for a mandatory fine together
                    with a mandatory custodial sentence in ss 14(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 2010, Parliament plainly intended to impose an
                    additional <em>financial</em> penalty on offenders as
                    deterrence. It follows that a substantial default <em>custodial</em> sentence should not be imposed on an offender who is
                    clearly unable to pay the mandatory fine. On reflection, I have to acknowledge
                    that had this issue been properly argued before me, I would have been inclined
                    to reduce the Appellant’s fines to the minimum of $30,000 on each charge
                    and to reset the default imprisonment sentence per charge to less than a
                    month’s imprisonment. I think that in a conjunctive penalty scenario that
                    stipulates a mandatory minimum fine, the default imprisonment term for an
                    offender with no means to pay even the mandated minimum fine should not
                    ordinarily be substantial. In particular, it seems to me that it was never the
                    legislative intention of the 2010 amendments to the MLA 2008 (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>–<a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>) to use the mandatory fine scheme as a device to impose
                    further lengthy imprisonment terms in the event of default.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The foregoing, however, is not to say that a
                    higher quantum of fine and a corresponding default imprisonment sentence should
                    not be imposed in deserving situations (for instance, where the offender has
                    reaped and retained a profit from his committal of the offence in question, or
                    where even the maximum permitted custodial sentence is considered to be
                    inadequate). It cannot be overemphasised that criminal sentencing is an onerous
                    and delicate task which requires each and every case to be closely examined and
                    decided based on its own particular set of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In summary, the applicable principles for
                    mandatory conjunctive sentencing in the context of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 2010 are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_a"></a>(a)     The mandatory fine should
                        ordinarily be pegged closer to the minimum of $30,000 unless:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_131-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       the offender has reaped
                            illicit profits which should be disgorged; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_131-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       even the maximum permitted
                            custodial sentence is, in rare cases, inadequate to reflect the full
                            extent of the offender’s criminality.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_131-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where the offender is clearly unable
                        to pay the mandatory $30,000 minimum fine, the default imprisonment sentence
                        imposed should not be substantial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Caning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    I also agreed with Mr Kumar that the
                    sentence of a total of six strokes of the cane imposed on the Appellant (one
                    stroke for each of the six charges proceeded on) was manifestly excessive. The
                    DJ did not specifically justify the imposition of six strokes of the cane on the
                    Appellant by reference to any precedents. When queried, Mr San ventured
                    that the DJ imposed six strokes of the cane only because he imposed the same
                    sentence of one stroke of the cane for each of the six charges proceeded on.
                    Mr San diffidently suggested that as the six charges were for similar
                    offences, it would be arbitrary to impose caning for some of them but not for
                    others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Yong CJ held at [11] of <em>Chia Kah
                        Boon</em> that the totality principle could be applied in the context
                    of a cumulative sentence made up of fines for several distinct offences. It
                    seems to me that this principle may also be applied in the context of a
                    cumulative sentence of caning imposed for several distinct offences. Contrary to
                    Mr San’s suggestion, it was not necessary for the Appellant’s
                    conviction of each charge to attract the exact same sentence. Where multiple
                    convictions for similar offences are made, the court is certainly entitled to
                    vary the sentences for each charge on account of the totality
                principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In the present case, the Appellant’s
                    offences were not aggravated by any acts of violence or intimidation. In my
                    view, a total sentence of six strokes of the cane was disproportionate to
                    “the overall gravity of his criminal conduct” (see <em>Maideen Pillai v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R)
                    706 at [11]) and, therefore, manifestly
                    excessive. Accordingly, I held that the sentence of one stroke of the cane was
                    to remain only for the first three charges proceeded on (<em>viz</em>, District Arrest Cases Nos 40653, 41704 and 41707 of
                    2010). The sentences in respect of caning for the remaining three charges
                    proceeded on (<em>viz</em>, District Arrest Cases
                    Nos 42909, 24912 and 24913 of 2010) were set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Imprisonment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    As for the Appellant’s imprisonment
                    term imposed by the DJ (<em>viz</em>, a total of 60
                    months’ imprisonment), I was not inclined to disturb it. The
                    Appellant’s partners in the unlicensed moneylending business, B2 and B3,
                    were sentenced to imprisonment terms of 45 months and 39 months respectively
                    (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Kim Hock</em> [2011] SGDC
                    201 (“<em>Lee Kim Hock</em>”) at [12] and [44] respectively). However, while B2 and B3 had no relevant
                    antecedents (see <em>Lee Kim Hock</em> at [9] and [12(e)] respectively), the Appellant
                    had returned to unlicensed moneylending at least by April 2010, when (as
                    mentioned in the Statement of Facts)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> the Appellant was working as a runner
                    for the unlicensed moneylender known as “Sam” (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). This was close on the heels of the
                    five-month imprisonment term imposed on the Appellant for his prior convictions
                    under s 8(1)(<em>b</em>) of the MLA 1985 in December
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    This indicated to me the extent of the
                    Appellant’s recalcitrance and the little effect which his previous
                    five-month imprisonment term had on him. Moreover, the Appellant had escalated
                    the gravity of his offences since his previous term of imprisonment. First, he
                    had graduated from being a mere runner for an unlicensed moneylending business
                    to being a partner in such business. Second, while the Appellant was convicted
                    of only two charges in December 2008, he was convicted of six charges in the
                    present case. In fact, he faced a total of 18 separate charges (involving 13
                    different debtors) this time around, of which six were proceeded on, with the
                    remaining 12 being taken into consideration for sentencing purposes (see
                        <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above). Taking all the circumstances
                    into account, I did not think that the 60-month imprisonment term imposed by the
                    DJ was manifestly excessive. I therefore dismissed the Appellant’s appeal
                    in that regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The courts have noted Parliament’s
                    implacable resolve to combat all manner of illegal moneylending activities. This
                    has been emphatically manifested through a series of legislative changes that
                    have robustly enhanced the punitive consequences of such offending conduct. The
                    sentences meted out by the courts for moneylending offences have, to date, been
                    severe, and are underpinned by the desire to signal that there will be no
                    judicial tolerance for such conduct. The principal sentencing consideration has
                    been that of general deterrence, with specific deterrence always being an added
                    consideration for repeat offenders. Nevertheless, the sentences, while severe,
                    must also always remain proportionate to the totality of the <em>particular</em> offending conduct being assessed. Care must be taken
                    to assiduously calibrate the punishment against the offending conduct. In every
                    case, the punishment must fit the crime and the principle of proportionality
                    remains a cardinal determinant in this area of sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Thus, although Parliament has made clear its
                    intention that persons who assist in unlicensed moneylending operations will be
                    liable to the same penalties as persons who actually carry on such operations
                    (see the extract from <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em> vol 86 at col 2059 reproduced at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above), depending on the facts of the case at
                    hand, it may be appropriate to punish more severely offenders who have
                    previously been convicted of actually carrying on the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending, as compared to offenders who have previously been convicted of
                    assisting in the carrying on of such business. As for offenders who have
                    previously been convicted of both assisting in the business of unlicensed
                    moneylending and actually carrying on such business, it may (again depending on
                    the facts of the particular case in question) be appropriate to impose on them
                    sentences in between, with stiffer punishment being meted out to offenders who
                    have graduated from simply assisting in the business of unlicensed moneylending
                    to actually carrying on such business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The DJ was correct in treating the Appellant
                    as a repeat offender for the purposes of s 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MLA 2010. Notwithstanding that, in the light of
                    the sentencing principles of proportionality and totality, I allowed the present
                    appeal in part and reduced the total fine imposed on the Appellant for the six
                    charges proceeded on from $480,000 to $240,000. Accordingly, I also reduced the
                    total default term of imprisonment from two years to one year. In addition, I
                    halved the total number of strokes of the cane imposed on the Appellant from six
                    to three, ordering the sentence of one stroke of the cane per charge to remain
                    only in respect of District Arrest Cases Nos 40653, 41704 and 41707 of
                    2010. The total imprisonment sentence of 60 months imposed by the DJ remained
                    for I saw no reason to disturb it.</p>
