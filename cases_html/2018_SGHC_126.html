</div> In other words, the Suit concerns events that ostensibly occurred after the expiry of the Lease.

With respect to TPPI’s Arbitration Application, the AR noted that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that TPPI and Nippon had treated the Lease as binding on them while they attempted to negotiate a new agreement.

</div> The courts have taken a generous approach towards construing the scope of an arbitration agreement clause (see [27] and [30] below). Therefore, although cl 11 of the HA does not include the words “including the validity, scope, meaning, construction, interpretation or application [of the lease]”, such matters would fall within the provision.

But this also means that the court does not go into the full merits of the parties’ cases.

</div> On the other hand, Nippon argues that a stay in favour of arbitration should not be granted because the Arbitration Clause is no longer in effect.

But one cannot ignore the fact that he was the manager of funds that controlled all of Nippon’s shares.

From the correspondence, it appears that Nippon itself took the position that the Lease continued to operate while the parties negotiated a new lease agreement.

</div> Once again, no new lease had been agreed upon by the parties when this letter was sent. The phrase “Catalyst Lease” can hence only refer to the Lease. In this letter, Nippon threatened to take legal action against TPPI if the latter continued to use the Catalysts. It is also clear from this letter that Nippon took the position that <span class="font-italic">TPPI </span>had confirmed the continuation of the Lease under the CA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Nippon] notes that <span class="font-italic">TPPI has elected</span> since the PKPU and the subsequent tolling arrangement beginning November 2013 to utilize the Catalyst. <span class="font-italic">By </span><span class="font-italic">doing so TPPI has impliedly consented to the continuation of the Lease on all its applicable commercial terms until such time as any other written agreement is made between TPPI and [Nippon]</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On 31 January 2017, Nippon issued an invoice to TPPI for “arrears” and “rent” due to Nippon for the “Lease of Catalyst” for the period “November, 2013 up to and including May 21, 2013 and November 2015 to January 2017”.

</div> Nippon also points out that its invoice dated 31 January 2017 seeks payment from TPPI for the use of the Catalysts at a rate of US$875,000 per month, which is less than the rental rate under the Lease. This is not disputed by TPPI, and according to Nippon, this shows that it was not claiming rent under the Lease.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 While the e-mail dated 24 April 2014 does suggest that Nippon did not treat the Lease as being operative, one has to analyse the evidence holistically and consider all the other pieces of correspondence where it treated the Lease as subsisting. In particular, I note its letter dated 8 August 2016 (<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">see [</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">21(d)] </span>above) wherein it set out clearly its position that TPPI had “impliedly consented to the continuation of the Lease” under the CA. Further, although the rate of US$875,000 per month was lower than the rental rate under the Lease, it is equally impossible to ignore the fact that the invoice was for the “Lease of Catalyst” and for “arrears” and “rent” (see [21(e)] above). Indeed, there is no evidence to show that “arrears’ and “rent” can reasonably mean anything else except the rent due under the Lease. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Accordingly, when examined against the fact that TPPI continued to use the Catalysts pursuant to the tolling agreements that it had entered into with Nippon’s knowledge, Nippon’s correspondence to TPPI constitutes <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence that the parties treated the Lease (and hence the Arbitration Clause) as binding on them. It also shows <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> that there was an understanding between the parties that the existing Lease would continue to govern TPPI’s use of the Catalysts until a new agreement was put in place. Nippon took the position that the Lease continued to operate, and that it was entitled to claim rent under the Lease. It cannot now come to court and blow hot and cold, deciding that the Lease is no longer operative simply because it does not wish to arbitrate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 At this juncture, I pause to address Nippon’s contention that TPPI was not entitled to confirm the continuation of the Lease under the CA because the Lease had expired in December 2010 and was no longer “remaining in effect” when the CA was executed.

</div> This argument ignores the evidence which <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> shows that the parties treated the Lease as continuing up to the point that the CA was entered into. First, as I have examined above, Nippon’s argument runs against the grain of its correspondence to TPPI, where it took the position that TPPI had elected to continue the Lease even after the CA had been executed. Second, Nippon has adduced no evidence contradicting TPPI’s averment that the parties envisioned that TPPI would continue using the Catalysts even after the Lease had formally expired.

</div> I add only that Art 16 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (which has the force of law in Singapore by virtue of s 3 of the IAA) confers on an arbitral tribunal the jurisdiction to “rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Nippon maintains that the Conversion Claim falls beyond the ambit of the Arbitration Clause because the Conversion Claim is in tort and the relief it seeks are unconnected to the Lease. For instance, it highlights that it is claiming damages at the rate of only US$1.25m a month, whereas the Lease provides for rent at the rate of US$2.25m a month.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my judgment, Nippon’s action against TPPI is in substance intricately tied to the Lease, and it is irrelevant that its causes of action are framed in tort rather than contract. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span> at [12]–[14] and [19] (and referring to its previous decision in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732) recognised that in construing arbitration clauses generously, words such as “any dispute” are wide enough to include any matter related to the contract even if the underlying action is based in tort. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [125] and [126], “the court must consider the underlying basis and true nature of the issue or claim, and is not limited solely to the manner in which it is pleaded” and emphasised the importance of identifying the “substance of the controversy”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The fact that Nippon’s claim is intrinsically tied to the Lease is apparent from its Statement of Claim (“the SOC”), where it is clear that it is relying on its rights under the Lease in its Conversion and Conspiracy Claims. For instance, in paras 2.1.6 and 3.1.2 of the SOC, Nippon claims that it was the owner of the Catalysts and that it is entitled to immediate possession of them “since the expiry of the Lease Agreement on 31 December 2010”. Additionally, in para 3.1.3 of the SOC, Nippon states that “[f]rom 1 January 2011” TPPI has unlawfully retained the Catalysts and used them as if they were its own without Nippon’s consent. In para 3.1.4 of the SOC, Nippon claims that TPPI is under a continuing legal obligation to return the Catalysts “following the expiry of the [Lease]”. The references to Nippon’s rights under the Lease are repeated in the paragraphs concerning the Conspiracy Claim (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, para 4.1.3(c)–(d) of the SOC).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the same vein, that Nippon is limiting its claim to the period <span class="font-italic">after</span> 5 November 2012

</div> does not change the <span class="font-italic">premise</span> of Nippon’s cause of action, which is that TPPI failed to return the Catalysts after the expiry of the Lease period. In seeking to make a claim only from 6 November 2012, Nippon was merely limiting its <span class="font-italic">relief</span>. Indeed, it had no choice but to do so because the debt owed to it by TPPI from 1 January 2011 and 5 November 2012 already had been compromised and settled by way of the CA (as Nippon acknowledged in para 2.2.3 of the SOC).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I therefore find that the Conversion Claim falls within the scope of the Arbitration Clause.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The survival of the Arbitration Clause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The above is sufficient to dispose of the question of whether there was a valid arbitration agreement. Nevertheless, for completeness, I proceed to examine TPPI’s alternative case that even if the Lease had expired on 31 December 2010, the Arbitration Clause nevertheless applies to capture Nippon’s claim (particularly the Conversion Claim) against TPPI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In this regard, TPPI submits that the Arbitration Clause is applicable even if the Lease is found to have been terminated by the CA. To this end, it argues that Nippon’s claim is in substance one of TPPI “holding over” the Catalysts from the expiry of the lease period. It points out that cl 15.2 of the LA expressly provides that the terms under the LA continue to apply during any “holding over” period, and thus the Arbitration Clause continues to apply till today because it continues to hold on to the Catalysts.

</div> Nippon thus contends that the Arbitration Clause can only cover disputes concerning events that occurred before the Lease ceased to have effect. According to Nippon, the Arbitration Clause is inapplicable in this case because its claim in the Suit pertains to the period after 5 December 2012, which is about two years after the Lease had expired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I disagree. As TPPI notes, Nippon’s claim is at heart about TPPI’s retention of the Catalysts immediately after the Lease period had expired or terminated. Put another way, it is about TPPI’s failure to meet its obligations under cl 11 of the LA to return the Catalysts “upon the termination of the Lease Term”.

</div> It thus follows that the current dispute is one that arose from when the Lease was still in effect, and is one that is intricately connected to the Lease. Here, I note Nippon’s objection that the term “holding over” is typically applied to leases of real property.

</div> But it is clear that the phrase “holding over” is not used as a term of art under cl 15.2 of the LA, but is instead used to refer to the situation where TPPI holds on to the Catalysts after the expiry of the Lease period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The cases relied upon by Nippon for the proposition that disputes arising after the expiry of the main contract are beyond the reach of an arbitration clause can be distinguished.

The Collaboration Agreement contained an arbitration clause, and it subsequently expired in 2011. Despite its expiry, the parties continued their collaboration until a dispute arose around 2014 when it was discovered that Linglong was selling its own tires in America. Horizon brought a suit against Linglong, which sought to compel arbitration under the Collaboration Agreement. The Sixth Circuit dismissed Linglong’s application (to dismiss or stay for arbitration Horizon’s counterclaim to a separate claim filed by Linglong) as Horizon’s claims were not based on any rights created by the Collaboration Agreement. This is because Horizon had unequivocally and irrevocably waived any claim based on a continuing obligation created by that agreement. After the Collaboration Agreement had expired, the parties’ dealings, and the ensuing dispute, were not based on the Collaboration Agreement. Hence Horizon’s claim against Linglong was not caught by the arbitration clause. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Local 703,</span> <span class="font-italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v Kennicott Bros Co </span>771 F.2d 300 (7th Circuit, 1985), the defendant (“<span class="font-italic">Kennicott</span>”) and the plaintiff, a union, entered into a collective-bargaining agreement that expired in October 1981. The parties entered into negotiations for a replacement agreement but failed to reach an agreement before a dispute arose due to the discharge of one of Kennicott’s employees. Relying on the arbitration clause in the expired collective-bargaining agreement, the union sought to compel arbitration of the dispute. The Seventh Circuit court dismissed the union’s application, noting that the “events triggering the grievances… occurred more than six months after the [collective-bargaining agreement] expired”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">BCY v BCZ</span> [2017] 3 SLR 357, the issue there was that the arbitration agreement remained subject to contract, and the court found that no binding arbitration agreement was formed before the main contract was concluded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the present case, neither party is relying on a contract that has not been executed or concluded (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a new lease agreement). Moreover, even if the Lease did not continue to have effect after 31 December 2010, Nippon’s Conversion Claim emerges from the Lease and concerns the immediate consequences of the termination of the Lease. Nippon’s right to immediate possession of the Catalysts was a right borne out of cl 11.1 of the LA, which survived the expiration of the Lease itself. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Kennicott</span>, this was not a case in which there were months between the expiration of the main contract and “the events triggering the grievances”. In the present case, “the events triggering the grievances” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the right to immediate possession and any unpaid rent) arose when Nippon claimed that the Lease had expired, even if Nippon may have chosen to sue or bring an action only in 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For the above reasons, even if the Lease has been terminated and is no longer binding on the parties, I find that the Arbitration Clause has <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>survived the termination and continues to apply.

This argument is neither here nor there. Nippon and TPPI negotiated the wording of the Arbitration Clause as commercial parties with equal bargaining power.

The Conversion Claim is thus subject to the mandatory stay under s 6 of the IAA. I add that although the Conspiracy Claim and Joint Tortfeasor Claim are not covered by the Arbitration Clause, and Nippon had joined Pertamina in the Joint Tortfeasor Claim and brought the Conspiracy Claim against both TPPI and Pertamina, this would not take the Conversion Claim outside the ambit of the Lease and Arbitration Clause (see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> where a similar situation arose with regard to a suit with various claims and multiple defendants). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Pertamina’s Jurisdiction Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Pertamina’s Jurisdiction Application comprises three grounds.

First, the plaintiff’s claim must come within one of the heads of claim in O 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). Second, it must have a sufficient degree of merit. Third, Singapore must be the proper forum for the trial of the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 With respect to the last requirement, it is trite that the applicable test is the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd </span>[1987] AC 460. In <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Accent Delight</span>”), the Court of Appeal noted at [68] that there are two stages to the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. First, the court determines whether there is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> some other available forum that is more appropriate for the case to be tried. Second, if so, the court will stay the action (or not grant leave to serve out of jurisdiction, as the case may be) unless justice requires that the Singapore courts exercise their jurisdiction. In determining whether Singapore is the most appropriate forum, the court looks at the following incidences or connections (<span class="font-italic">Accent Delight </span>at [71]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[F]irst, the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses; second, the connections to relevant events and transactions; third, the applicable law to the dispute; fourth, the existence of proceedings elsewhere (that is, <span class="font-italic">lis alibi pendens</span>); and fifth, the “shape of the litigation”, which is shorthand for the manner in which the claim and the defence have been pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It should be emphasised that none of these factors are determinative, and the court does not engage in a box-checking exercise to see which jurisdiction has the largest number of “points of contact” with the dispute (<span class="font-italic">Accent Delight </span>at [70]). The court ultimately seeks to determine the “forum which is the more suitable for the ends of justice, and is preferable because pursuit of the litigation in that forum is more likely to secure those ends” (<span class="font-italic">Accent Delight </span>at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On this note, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> has held at [77] that “the substance of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test does not differ regardless of whether the inquiry on the proper forum takes place as part of a challenge to the existence of the local court’s jurisdiction, or as part of an application for a stay of proceedings on improper forum grounds”. The difference lies in the burden of proof. Where a plaintiff seeks leave to serve out of jurisdiction, the burden lies on him to prove that Singapore is the proper forum. This is so even when the defendant challenges the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts in setting aside an order granting leave to serve out of jurisdiction. However, where a defendant seeks to stay proceedings on improper forum grounds, the burden is on him to show that Singapore is <span class="font-italic">not </span>the proper forum. That being said, in the final analysis, the court will “collapse the issue of proper forum into one question considered in the round” (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> at [71], [77] and [80]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Nippon’s claims fall within O 11 r (1)(f)(ii) and (p)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Nippon argues that the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order should not have been set aside because it falls within O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and (<span class="font-italic">p</span>) of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I start with O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii), which provides that service out of Singapore is permissible with leave if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the claim is wholly or partly founded on, or is for the recovery of damages in respect of, damage suffered in Singapore caused by a tortious act or omission where occurring</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Nippon argues that its claim fails within this rule (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there is “damage suffered in Singapore”) because it is a Singapore entity with a bank account in Singapore, and because all payments by TPPI were to be made to its Singapore bank account.

</div>
</div> In my judgment this, in itself, is insufficient to bring it within O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii). The fact that a plaintiff has a bank account in Singapore that it uses to transact with a defendant, which then fails to make payments into that bank account, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the plaintiff thus suffers damage in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Metall Und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc </span>[1990] 1 QB 391, which Nippon relies on, the English Court of Appeal stated (at 437) that whilst it is not necessary that all the damage must be sustained within the jurisdiction, there must be some “significant” damage that is suffered in the jurisdiction. In that case, the Court found (at 449) that the plaintiff had suffered significant damage within the jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, London). Not only did it not receive the ledger credit payment which should have been made in London, it also did not receive warrants which should have been delivered in London and suffered the detrimental closing out of its accounts in London. Moreover, security that should have been available to the plaintiff in London was wrongly charged in London and paid out of London. In the present case, Nippon has not explained in any of its affidavits how it has suffered damage, let alone significant damage, just because TPPI had failed to make the payments to its Singapore bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In this regard, Pertamina refers to <span class="font-italic">Alfred Dunhill Ltd v Diffusion Internationale de Maroquinerie de Prestige SARL and others </span>[2001] 1 All ER (Comm) 950 at 962, to support its case that it is insufficient to show that a plaintiff has a bank account within the jurisdiction:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he fact that the ultimate financial loss may have been felt by the claimant in his principal place of business, where his bank accounts are located, does not mean that that damage had occurred at that place for the purposes of art 5(3) – otherwise, in most cases of financial loss, the exception would establish jurisdiction at the place of the domicile of the claimant, a result which these cases made clear a court should lean against.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although that case was concerned with Art 5(3) of the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968 (where jurisdiction can be founded in a state where, in relation to a tort, the “harmful event occurred”), the reason undergirding the holding there applies with equal force to O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As for O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">p</span>), service out of Singapore is permissible with leave if “the claim is founded on a cause of action arising in Singapore”. It has been noted by commentators that there remains some uncertainty as to the proper test to be applied (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018, Vol I </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) (Foo Chee Hock, gen ed) at para 11/1/40), but it appears that the prevailing test is to ask “where in substance did the cause of action arise” (<span class="font-italic">Kishinchand Tiloomal Bhojwani v Sunil Kishinchand Bhojwani and another </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 518 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 568 at [15]). To answer this question, one has to look at the place of the torts alleged by Nippon. As I examine below, the place of the torts is Indonesia, not Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Singapore is the most convenient forum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In any event, even if Nippon is able to bring itself within O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and (<span class="font-italic">p</span>), I find that it has failed to show that Singapore is the most convenient forum. Given that Nippon’s claims against Pertamina are tortious in nature, the starting point of analysis is to ascertain where the torts took place. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>”) at [37], it is a general rule that “the place where a tort occurred is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>the natural forum for determining the claim”. As for how the place of a tort is to be determined, the test to be applied is the “substance of the tort” test. To that end, the court examines the events undergirding the elements of the tort to ascertain where, in substance, the cause of action arose (<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2014] 1 SLR 860 (“<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>”) at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Nippon relies on the torts of conversion, detinue, and conspiracy. In my view, the torts took place in Indonesia, where TPPI continues to hold on to the Catalysts. Starting with the tort of conversion, it has been observed that “The <span class="font-italic">essence </span>of conversion lies in the unlawful appropriation of another’s chattel, whether for the defendant’s own benefit or that of a third party” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Faith Maritime Co Ltd v Feoso (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another action </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 1088 at [114], citing <span class="font-italic">Clerk and Linsell on Torts </span>(18th Ed, 2000)). In this case, it is indisputable that the Catalysts are being held on to by TPPI in Indonesia. It naturally follows that the essence of Nippon’s claim in the tort of conversion is in Indonesia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As for Nippon’s action in detinue, the elements of the tort are: (a) wrongful detention; and (b) the refusal to deliver (Gary Chan and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 11.067). Any wrongful detention of, and any refusal to return, the Catalysts is in Indonesia. Nippon contends otherwise. It relies on the case of <span class="font-italic">General and Finance Facilities Ltd v Cooks Cars (Romford) Ltd </span>[1963] 1 WLR 644 at 649 for the proposition that the demand for delivery of the chattel is an essential requirement of an action in detinue, and points out that it seeks to have the Catalysts delivered up to Singapore. Therefore, according to Nippon, the place of the tort is Singapore.

</div>
</div> In my view, this argument is insufficient to tilt the analysis in Nippon’s favour. By itself, that Nippon has requested for the Catalysts to be delivered to it in Singapore cannot mean that the tort took place in Singapore. To reach such a conclusion is to ignore the flipside of the analysis, which is that TPPI’s <span class="font-italic">refusal</span> to deliver the Catalysts is rooted in Indonesia, and that the delivery of the Catalysts would be <span class="font-italic">from</span> Indonesia.

</div>
</div> Nippon’s argument also ignores the fact that any wrongful detention of the Catalysts is in Indonesia. Accordingly, I find that the place of the tort of detinue is Indonesia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Lastly, with respect to the tort of conspiracy, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>held at [53] that the key factors of consideration in identifying the place of the tort are the “identity, importance and location of the conspirators, the locations where any agreements or combinations took place, the nature and places of the concerted acts or means, the location of the plaintiff and the places where the plaintiff suffered losses”. Both TPPI and Pertamina (the alleged conspirators) are located in Indonesia, and it naturally follows that any agreement forming the alleged conspiracy took place in Indonesia. Indeed, in its SOC, Nippon identifies the entry by TPPI and Pertamina into the tolling agreements as being part of the alleged conspiracy. The first tolling agreement was entered as part of the CA, which was endorsed by the Indonesian court. The conclusion that Indonesia is the place of the tort is further reinforced by the analysis above that the place of the alleged torts of conversion and detinue (both of which form the basis of Nippon’s Conspiracy Claim) is Indonesia. Nippon has not adduced any evidence suggesting that the conspirators or the salient agreements are based in Singapore. Accordingly, it stands to reason that the place of the alleged conspiracy is Indonesia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Accordingly, Indonesia is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum to determine Nippon’s claims. However, Nippon maintains that the place of torts is Singapore for the following reasons. First, it suggests that the court should look at where the damage was suffered and refers to <span class="font-italic">Tolofson v Jensen </span>(1994) 120 DLR (4th) 289, which was cited extensively in<span class="font-italic"> Ang Ming Chuang v Singapore Airlines Ltd (Civil Aeronautics Administration, third party)</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 409, for the proposition that “where an act occurs in one place but the consequences are directly felt elsewhere… it may well be that the consequence would be held to constitute the wrong”.

</div> It also has not referred me to any authorities showing that that is the case for the torts of conversion, detinue and conspiracy. Indeed, a full reading of the relevant passage in <span class="font-italic">Tolofson v Jensen</span> at [43] makes clear that the place of a tort is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> where it took place:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]t seems axiomatic to me that, at least as a general rule, the law to be applied in torts is the law of the place <span class="font-italic">where the activity occurred</span>, i<span class="font-italic">.</span>e<span class="font-italic">.</span>, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>.

</div> The rule simply states that in order for a tort to be actionable in Singapore, it must be actionable not only in the law of the forum, but also under the law of the place where the wrong was committed (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [53]). The rule is conceptually distinct from the question of whether Singapore is the proper forum. The rule is not intended to assist the court in locating the proper forum; the object of the rule is one of fairness.

</div>
</div> I address both contentions in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is undisputed that both Pertamina and TPPI are located in Indonesia. Without evidence to the contrary, it follows logically that their witnesses would also be based in Indonesia. Indeed, I observe that the affidavits in support of Pertamina’s and TPPI’s applications were affirmed in Indonesia, and it is clear from the affidavits that their representatives are based in Indonesia. Hence I find that Pertamina has made an arguable case that the witnesses relevant to its defence are likely to be based in Indonesia. Next, I disagree that there are no substantial disputes of fact underlying Nippon’s claims. It is clear from the face of the parties’ affidavits and arguments that there are vast disagreements over issues such as whether the parties had treated the Lease as continuing, and whether Nippon had acquiesced to the use of the Catalysts under the tolling agreements. Further, in both the Joint Tortfeasor Claim and Conspiracy Claim, various factual issues would have to be established including whether Pertamina did authorise, procure or instigate the commission of the tort of conversion and/or detinue, and whether there was any agreement between Pertamina and TPPI to do certain acts which were unlawful.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Pertamina’s Jurisdiction Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the above reasons, I find that Indonesia is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the more appropriate forum for the action to be tried. I also add that this applies to the Conspiracy Claim against TPPI for the same reasons as it applies in relation to Pertamina. The question that remains is whether justice requires that the Singapore courts exercise jurisdiction over the matter. Nippon has not shown me why that would be so, and I find that there is no reason for the Singapore courts to exercise jurisdiction in this case. Consequently, there is no need for me to consider a stay on the basis of the court’s inherent power of case management.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It leaves me to decide whether I should discharge the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order or to stay the proceedings vis-à-vis Pertamina. This has to be assessed in the light of the stay to be granted to TPPI in favour of arbitration on the Conversion Claim but not on the Conspiracy Claim. Although I have found that the Conversion Claim falls within the Arbitration Clause, this does not apply to the Joint Tortfeasor Claim and Conspiracy Claim. Further, unlike Pertamina, TPPI has neither challenged the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order granting Nippon leave to serve out of jurisdiction nor sought a stay on the basis that Singapore is not the appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In this regard, I note the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [186] that “the court, as the final arbiter, should take the lead in ensuring the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole”. In taking the lead, the court must strike a balance between: (a) a plaintiff’s right to choose whom and where to sue; (b) the desire to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing an arbitration clause; and (c) the court’s inherent power to manage its processes to prevent an abuse of process and to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of disputes (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [188]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the round, I am of the view that this is a case in which it is appropriate to grant Pertamina a stay of proceedings.

</div> in the event the Conspiracy Claim is stayed against Pertamina, that claim should also be stayed against TPPI as it ideally ought to be determined against TPPI and Pertamina together. Having regard to the above, I order as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Conversion Claim vis-à-vis TPPI is stayed in favour of arbitration pursuant to s 6 of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Joint Tortfeasor Claim against Pertamina is stayed. I find that Singapore is not the proper forum for the dispute and that Indonesia is the more appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Conspiracy Claim against both TPPI and Pertamina is also stayed, for the same reasons as the Joint Tortfeasor Claim. Both Nippon and TPPI have agreed that, in the event that the Conspiracy Claim against Pertamina is stayed, that claim against TPPI should also be stayed and litigated in the same forum as it would be litigated against Pertamina.
