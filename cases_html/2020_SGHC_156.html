Even at trial, none of the Club’s witnesses identified any single act by the first defendant which warranted immediate dismissal at this time.  It was therefore agreed between the MC members who had been part of Dr Singh’s team that the first defendant’s performance would be raised as the reason for terminating his employment, but it was fairly apparent that Dr Singh’s team simply wanted the first defendant replaced with someone else.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 11 August 2014, the MC resolved, by majority, that the first defendant’s employment would be terminated.

</div>  It is not in dispute that Dr Singh and two other MC members, Professor Sum Yee Leong (“Professor Sum”) and Dr Christopher Chong, were tasked by the MC to communicate its decision to the first defendant and to handle the procedures for the first defendant’s exit from the Club.  Therefore, after the MC meeting, the news that the MC had resolved to terminate his employment was conveyed to the first defendant by Dr Singh and the two other MC members.  The first defendant was given an option to either resign or be given two months’ notice of the termination of his employment by the Club.

The specific conduct complained of is in relation to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the failure to account for or return the Dell laptop and the failure to account for the Club’s property that was allegedly removed on the night of 11 August 2014;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) having received unauthorised “special” bonuses annually for 2005 to 2014, except 2006 (Financial Years (“FYs”) 2004 to 2013, except FY 2005), amounting to S$98,450.48;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) failing to ensure the collection of Visiting Member fees from guests who stayed at the Residence amounting to at least S$216,350;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) procuring the Club to make commission payments to booking agents for the reservation of rooms at the Residence from 2009 to 2014 for an unspecified quantum, but including the amount of S$845,192.02 paid to the operator of “Booking.com”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) exposing the Club to possible fines or penalties by causing the Residence to be operated as a hotel in breach of the URA Condition and/or under the Hotels Act (Cap 127, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Hotels Act”).

From the evidence, it was clear to me that the defendants and the two members of the present MC who testified, that is, Dr Singh and Mr D’Souza, have a long history of ill-will and rancour arising from their association with the Club.  Many allegations were flung by each side against the other.  Some of these accusations were serious, but many were inconsequential and trifling.  At times, the parties appeared to think that the Court was the forum to resolve every niggling dispute that they had.  That is not the function of the Court in these proceedings.

The Club relies on the fact that (a) the first defendant had been told on 11 August to come back to the office only on the morning of 12 August to clear out his personal belongings, but had defied this instruction, and (b) that there was closed circuit television (“CCTV”) footage which showed the first defendant appearing to take a different lift from his office to his car that night when he carried his bags to his car, purportedly to avoid meeting members of the MC who might still be in the Club.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The first defendant’s evidence is that he was in state of shock after he was abruptly told in the evening of 11 August 2014 that his employment as general manager-cum-secretary, a position that he had held since 2002, was going to be terminated.

The difficulty with the Club’s case on this point is that it has been unable to identify what property or documents of the Club, if any, were supposedly removed from the first defendant’s office that night and not returned.  Leaving aside the specific issue of the Dell laptop for the moment, I find that the Club has failed to show that the first defendant removed any of its property or documents, or failed to return them.  Both Dr Singh and Mr D’Souza conceded, during cross-examination, that up to the time of the trial, more than five years since the incident on 11 August 2014, the Club has not been able to identify <span class="font-italic">any</span> particular missing documents or property which might have been taken away by the first defendant.

</div>  Let me explain.  The first defendant made three trips from his office to his car.  For the first two trips, the first defendant, who was carrying his bags, took the service lift, which was the closest lift to his office, down to basement level two (“B2”), then took a flight of stairs down to basement level three (“B3”), where his car was parked.  The service lift does not go down to B3, unlike the passenger lift.  The second defendant was seen on the footage accompanying the first defendant on the first trip and then coming up again.  For the third trip to the car, when he was not carrying any bags, the two defendants walked from the first defendant’s office to the passenger lift, which is much further away from the office than the service lift, and took the passenger lift directly to B3.  According to the Club, this convoluted arrangement involving taking different lifts was done because the first defendant wanted to avoid running into the MC members who might be leaving the Club after the MC meeting that night, as they might have caught him in the act of taking away the Club’s property.  Otherwise, given that the second defendant is an elderly man, the Club argues that the two defendants would have tried to avoid taking the stairs from B2 to B3 and up again for that first trip.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I did not accept the Club’s contention in this regard.  This is because the defendants gave a logical and coherent explanation as to what transpired, which was largely unshaken under cross-examination.

</div>  The first defendant explained that he always parks his car at the part of B3 that is right next to the staircase.  He will then take a flight of stairs up to B2, and take the service lift up to the floor where his office is located.  The service lift is near his office and this is the quickest way to get there.  On the night of 11 August, for the first trip to his car, the first defendant took this route down to his car while accompanied by the second defendant, who helped him by carrying a bag.  This was his usual route and there was nothing suspicious about it.  The second defendant testified that his knee hurt from walking up and down the stairs in between B2 and B3, and that was why he did not accompany the first defendant on his second trip down to the car.

</div>  For that same reason, for the third and final trip, the two of them took the longer route of walking to the passenger lift so that the second defendant did not have to use the stairs to get from B2 to B3.  The defendants’ evidence in this regard was not seriously challenged.  As such, I was not prepared to infer from the CCTV footage that the first defendant was behaving in a surreptitious manner and taking away the Club’s property.  Even if I were to accept that the first defendant had been behaving surreptitiously, I am not satisfied that such a finding would <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> lead to the conclusion that he had misappropriated property.

Though Mr Tan was the individual who produced the screenshot of the assets master maintenance list relied on by the Club, he candidly admitted that he did not know whether what was stated in the list meant that the Dell laptops were in fact being used by the first defendant.

Quite apart from the fact that the purchase requisition and payment advice shows at best that two Dell laptops were purchased by the Club, what is indicated on these documents is that one of the two Dell laptops that were supposed to have been issued to the general manager’s office, according to the assets master maintenance list, was actually intended to be given to one “Arthur” of the Club’s food and beverage department.

His evidence was that he was standing in the office and saw the first defendant packing his things.  After that was done and while some boxes were being moved to the first defendant’s car, Mr D’Souza’s evidence was that he took a cursory look around the office to see if there was anything that the first defendant had left behind.  Mr D’Souza further indicated that he was sure that there was no laptop left on the desk.  However, when he was pressed in cross-examination, he admitted that he did not have the laptop in mind when he took his cursory look around the office, and agreed that the laptop could have been left somewhere in the office.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In my judgment, this issue of the missing laptop turned on the burden of proof.  It is a serious allegation to accuse someone of misappropriating property.  In this case, whether the allegation is made out depends on the contrasting evidence of the first defendant and Mr D’Souza on whether the laptop was left on the table in the office.  I do find it odd that the first defendant would have specially returned his first laptop to the Club’s information technology department, but then left the laptop he was using in his office, which he knew could not be properly locked.  This led me to question the credibility of the first defendant’s evidence on this issue, though I acknowledge that this point was not raised by the Club’s counsel and the first defendant was never given an opportunity to explain his behaviour in this regard.  Further, the first defendant might have left the second laptop in his office rather than with the IT department in the belief that his successor would be using it.  This is plausible given the first defendant’s unchallenged evidence that the first laptop was on his desk the first day he started work as the general manager.

</div>  Either way, it appears to me that there is a range of potential reasons why the first defendant might have behaved in the manner he did, and the burden is on the Club to show that the first defendant had in fact misappropriated the second laptop.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Turning to Mr D’Souza’s evidence on this issue, I did not find him to be a credible witness.

Mr D’Souza’s use of that word suggests that he was part of the collective seeking to persuade the Attorney-General to commence criminal proceedings against the first defendant, which was contrary to his position at trial.

Belatedly, at the trial, the Club also dropped its claim for the payment of the “special” bonus in the year 2005, for FY 2004, because it had apparently missed the fact that the MC meeting minutes from December 2004 had in fact recorded the approval of such a bonus.

The audio recording would then be switched off so as to allow the MC members to have a frank and uninhibited discussion about the first defendant’s performance.  The quantum for the first defendant’s “special” bonus, typically, an additional month’s salary or occasionally, a month and a half, would be proposed by the MC member in charge of human resources, and the rest of the MC members would then give their opinions about the first defendant’s performance that year.  After a discussion, a decision would then be made on the quantum of the first defendant’s bonus.  In the usual case, the first defendant would be told about the quantum of his bonus only sometime later by the second defendant when he handed the bonus letter to the first defendant.  Some MC members recalled that there might have been once or twice when the first defendant was told of the MC’s decision on the quantum of his bonus immediately after the MC meeting, and that the first defendant was then congratulated on his bonus.

The executive secretary might have been given specific instructions to include details concerning the bonuses for the FY 2005 and earlier, which explains why the decision of the MC on the first defendant’s bonus was recorded in the minutes for FYs 2005 and 2006.  I noted that, from FY 2007 onwards, when the MC meeting minutes did not record the approval of the first defendant’s bonus, there was a new executive secretary who had been employed by the Club.

</div>  Dr Singh’s claims in relation to the purported control by the first and second defendants over the Club’s pay package are inaccurate and at odds with the objective evidence.  Specifically, Mr Bernard Ho, the then-finance member of the MC, signed several of the GIRO payment forms authorising the payment of salaries and bonuses, which included the first defendant’s “special” bonus.

</div>  It was therefore simply not true that <span class="font-italic">only</span> the first and second defendants signed and had oversight over the GIRO payment forms, since the finance member of the MC signed them as well.  In addition, it cannot be said that the bonuses were a “secret” since the MC members who gave evidence, apart from Dr Singh, all testified that they had approved the payments of such bonuses to the first defendant.  Considering all the evidence in totality, I was simply unable to accept Dr Singh’s evidence in relation to the “special” bonuses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The MC meeting minutes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Club went on to contend that the absence of any MC meeting minutes addressing the “special” bonuses showed that such bonuses were never discussed and approved.

That is not correct because, as referred to at [56] above, the second defendant would give instructions for a letter to be prepared <span class="font-italic">each</span> year setting out the amount of the first defendant’s bonus and the reasons for the MC’s decision as to the quantum.  That letter was presented to the first defendant each year, and a copy was kept by the Club.

Put another way, the Club appears to be relying on the aforementioned breaches to vitiate the MC members’ approval of the “special” bonuses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my judgment, the approach by the Club is misconceived.  It appears to misunderstand the <span class="font-italic">Re Hampshire Land </span>principle altogether.

The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets.

For instance, an obligation under the Societies Regulations does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> give rise to fiduciary duties, contrary to what the Club appears to suggest.  Similarly, simply being an <span class="font-italic">officer</span> of the Club within the meaning of the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Societies Act”) does not <span class="font-italic">without more</span> imbue one with fiduciary obligations.  Given the weight which the law accords to fiduciary relationships, and the unique character of such relationships where loyalty is the “distinguishing obligation”, more is required than duties under statutory regulations.  Quite simply, the Club appears to be stretching the ambit of fiduciary obligations out of all recognition, and all without providing <span class="font-italic">any</span> authority for such propositions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee</span> went on (at [135]) to reference <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Mothew</span> [1998] Ch 1 (at 18) for the following proposition:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Breach of fiduciary obligation, therefore, connotes disloyalty or infidelity. Mere incompetence is not enough. A servant who loyally does his incompetent best for his master is not unfaithful and is not guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, even if fiduciary obligations could be said to arise simply because of their position as MC members, those obligations cannot be said to have been <span class="font-italic">breached</span> because breaches of such duties connote disloyalty or infidelity.  By any stretch of argument, I do not think that the Club’s case about the failure to ensure a proper record of the bonus decisions in the MC minutes can amount to the MC members showing disloyalty or infidelity towards the Club.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the MC members have acted in breach of any fiduciary obligations they might owe to the Club.  Even if they may be in procedural non-compliance with the obligation to keep proper records as outlined in the Club’s constitution or the Societies Regulations, I am of the view that neither of these obligations created fiduciary duties on the MC members.

In these relationships, there is a strong, but rebuttable, presumption that fiduciary duties are owed. Equally, the categories of fiduciary relationships are not closed or limited only to the settled categories … [However], whether the parties are in a fiduciary relationship depends, ultimately, on the nature of their relationship and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is not simply a question of whether their relationship can be shoe-horned </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">into one of the settled categories (eg, a partnership) or into a non-settled category</span> (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a joint venture or quasi-partnership). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Original emphasis in italics, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the Court of Appeal has made clear, whether the parties are in a fiduciary relationship depends on the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of their relationship and not on whether or not the relationship can be shoe-horned into the circumstances the Club asserted at [69] above.  The Club’s analysis of this question is simply misplaced<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, I am not certain that the Club’s case concerning the <span class="font-italic">Re Hampshire Land </span>principle would be aided even if the MC members are found to have acted in breach of their fiduciary obligations.

The <span class="font-italic">Re Hampshire Land</span> principle applies to prevent a defaulting individual from being able to attribute his knowledge and acts to the plaintiff in order to defeat the plaintiff’s claim against <span class="font-italic">himself</span>.  There is no suggestion that the MC members who approved the relevant “special” bonus payments (and whose knowledge the Club is seeking to disclaim) are seeking to defeat any claim by the Club against <span class="font-italic">themselves</span> in relation to the purportedly unauthorised “special” bonuses.

Neither was it pleaded that the MC members had in any way colluded or conspired with the second defendant for the Club to make unauthorised “special” bonus payments to the first defendant, and hence are now giving false testimony to cover their tracks.  These claims appear to have only developed subsequently over the course of proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Ultimately, on the Club’s approach to the <span class="font-italic">Re Hampshire Land</span> principle, I find this Court’s observations at [52] of <span class="font-italic">UOB</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The recent cases of <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span> and <span class="font-italic">Moulin</span> have, fortunately, clarified the rationale and scope of the [<span class="font-italic">Re Hampshire Land</span>] principle.

For example, the decision by the MC to add the second defendant as a party to these legal proceedings is absent from <span class="font-italic">any</span> MC minutes.  Mr D’Souza testified that the decision to add the second defendant was a “serious matter” that had to be discussed and decided by the MC members.

</div>  This principle of company law is founded on the idea that the body of the shareholders acting unanimously is a manifestation of the will and mind of the company.  Hence, if all the shareholders informally assent, even at different times, to the conduct of a director which would otherwise be a breach of duty on his part, the director’s conduct would not be actionable by the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 This well-known principle of company law, however, has no application to the facts of our case.  Leaving aside the question of whether a principle of company law can be applied in the context of a club registered under the Societies Act, the evidence clearly establishes that the issue of the first defendant’s bonuses was raised, discussed and approved at MC meetings before the bonuses were then paid to the first defendant.  The omission to minute the decision in the MC meeting minutes is a failure of procedure, but it does not mean that a decision had not been made.  There is thus no breach of duty on the part of the second defendant giving instructions for the payment of the bonuses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Given the evidence of ten MC members that there were decisions at MC meetings that gave prior approval for the payment of the bonuses, there is no need to consider whether the three MC members who did not give evidence <span class="font-italic">would</span><span class="font-italic"> have approved</span> the bonuses.  The evidence before me is that the MC <span class="font-italic">did approve</span> the bonuses.  Thus, the argument that <span class="font-italic">all</span> the MC members must now give evidence to show that they agree to the bonuses has no legal basis, and it proceeds on the erroneous premise that the MC <span class="font-italic">never</span> approved the payments of the bonuses in the first place.  As such, the Club’s reliance on the principle referred to in <span class="font-italic">Si-Hoe </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Chun</span> is entirely misconceived on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For the above reasons, I find that there is no merit to the Club’s claim against the second defendant for breach of any duties he might owe, fiduciary or otherwise, in relation to the bonuses paid to the first defendant.  The second defendant did not act on his own to procure the payment of bonuses from the Club to the first defendant.  The bonuses were approved as a collective decision of the relevant MCs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As for the first defendant, I struggle to understand the nature of the claim against him in relation to these bonuses.

</div>  For the first defendant, it is argued that he should be liable for the failure to collect Visiting Membership fees for 4,327 guests, giving rise to a total of S$216,350 from the time the Residence started its operations in 2009 until 1 September 2014, when his employment as the Club’s general manager was terminated.  For the second defendant, it is argued that he should be liable to the Club for S$323,900, being the uncollected Visiting Membership fees for 6,478 guests from the same start date in 2009 up to the time he ceased being the Club’s president, that is, April 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I will just note here the rather odd position taken by the Club in relation to the second defendant.

How the second defendant can remain liable for the management of the Residence during this time of suspension has not been explained by the Club.  The other rather puzzling fact is that the Club does not appear to be taking issue with how the new general manager, Shareef Bin Abdul Jaffar (“Mr Shareef”), who took over from the first defendant in September 2014, managed the Residence until it ceased operation on 30 June 2017.

</div>  The application form stipulated a S$50 application fee.  Since the Club had decided that each guest of the Residence would have to be registered as a Visiting Member to meet the URA Condition that the Residence could only be used by the Club’s members, it is argued that the defendants should have ensured that all the procedures of the Club in relation to the admission of Visiting Members were met.  This would include the S$50 fee, as referred to in the application form.  The first defendant is said to be liable because he had overall charge of the Residence as the general manager of the Club.  The second defendant, on the other hand, is liable because the Residence was his “pet project”, which he conceived, developed, and took a special interest in.

The Club’s constitution sets out the various categories of membership that the Club has.  It also sets out the fees that are to be collected for each category of membership.  Article 18 of the Club’s constitution does not prescribe any fee to be paid by Visiting Members.

Given this, I accept the defendants’ submission that it would have been a breach of the Club’s constitution for Visiting Membership fees to be collected from the guests of the Residence.

</div>  These booking agents had been engaged to secure guests for the Residence.  In particular, the first defendant allegedly did not bring the attention of the MC to the fact that the use of booking agents by the Club was prohibited by the URA Condition that the guest rooms at the Residence were not to be used as independent hotel rooms.  The Club also argues that there is actually no need for the use of such booking agents since the marketing of the Residence to the general public was prohibited.  By failing to bring the attention of the MC to the URA Condition even though the use of booking agents might potentially breach this restriction, the first defendant is said to have breached his duties to the Club.  Also, because the second defendant was fully aware of the URA Condition and that the use of booking agents would breach that restriction, he has also been accused of breaching his duties by permitting the Club to engage booking agents.  In this regard, the Club seeks to make the two defendants jointly and severally liable for the amount of booking fees paid by the Club over the years, that is, <span class="font-italic">at least</span> the amount of S$845,192.02 that was paid to one booking agent, “Booking.com”.

It specifically referred the URA Condition set in the written permission that had been granted in July 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Given that the evidence unequivocally showed that the MC was aware of the URA Condition, at the very latest, by December 2009, I fail to understand the Club’s repeated references in cross-examination, and in its submissions, to the fact that the MC meeting minutes did not record that <span class="font-italic">earlier</span> communications from the Singapore Tourism Board (“STB”) and from the URA concerning the same restriction were discussed at MC level.  In my view, this is simply immaterial.

</div>  This is pertinent because Dr Singh was elected to the MC in April 2014, and was the vice-president of the Club.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In this regard, I found Dr Singh’s claim that he was unaware of the use of booking agents until his alleged discovery of the URA letter sometime in 2017 particularly galling because he had attended a Residence sub-committee meeting on 14 August 2014, where the issue of the commissions paid to online booking agents was specifically discussed.

</div>  These minutes indicated to me that, Dr Singh’s protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, he must have been aware of the Club’s practice of paying commissions to booking agents for the Residence all along.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For the above reasons, I did not accept as at all credible Dr Singh’s evidence that he was not aware that the Club was paying commissions to booking agents.  I also could not accept Dr Singh’s claim that the payment of commissions was not approved by the MC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 On this issue of the commissions, I do not need to decide whether the use of booking agents by the Club to market and create awareness of the Residence to the public would breach the URA Condition.  The fact remains that the MC had authorised and approved the use of the booking agents, even after the restriction that had been imposed by the URA Condition had been brought to their attention.  That being the case, the first defendant was simply carrying out the instructions of the MC when he engaged the use of booking agents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I also found the Club’s submission that the terms of the agreements with the booking agents had not been surfaced to the MC and specifically discussed at MC meetings to be a non-starter of an argument.

</div>  The MC had authorised the first defendant to engage booking agents.  It was within the scope of his authority to decide on which booking agent to use and what terms to accept.  There is no allegation that the first defendant had acted negligently in making a poor selection of the booking agents to use, that he had exceeded his authority, or that the payments of commissions were not in accordance with the terms of the agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As for the second defendant, from the evidence before me, it is clear that he did not act alone in making decisions about the use of booking agents for the Club.  It was a collective decision of the MC, and the second defendant was simply a part of the MC in making that decision.

</div>  In fact, even if the second defendant had disagreed with the approach taken, he would have been the sole voice, perhaps together with Dr Singh, in the MC dissenting, since the majority has given evidence that they were aware and in favour of the use of booking agents to secure occupancy of the Residence guest rooms.  That being the case, I do not see what basis the Club has in attempting to hold the second defendant liable to account for the commissions paid to the booking agents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 For the above reasons, I find that the claims against the defendants in relation to the recovery of the commissions paid to the booking agents engaged by the Club are without merit.  Again, the question as to whether the defendants were the Club’s fiduciaries in respect of such payments to these booking agents is academic given my findings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Indemnity for potential fines or penalties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The Club’s case is that the Residence had been operated from the time of the start of its operations in 2009 until its cessation of operations on 30 June 2017 in a manner that was in breach of the URA Condition that the guest rooms were not to be used as independent guest rooms.

It also stated that it would “not hesitate to take any action and/or exercise such powers as it deems fit”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  SS at Exhibit 35. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 After having carefully considered the matter, I find that there is no need for the Court to decide in these legal proceedings whether the Club operated the Residence in a manner that was in breach of the Hotels Act or the URA Condition.  Even if the Club can surmount the difficulty of explaining why it should only be the first and second defendants who should indemnify it for what I have already found to be decisions of the relevant MCs <span class="font-italic">collectively</span>, I am not satisfied that the indemnity sought should be granted. My reasons are as set out below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 First, and most obviously, there are no regulatory actions or prosecutions which have been brought by the URA, HLB, or STB thus far.  There is therefore no particular factual matrix on which I can assess whether the Club had acted in breach of any legislation and should be indemnified by the defendants, in light of the facts which the regulatory body is relying upon.  In fact, the Club has <span class="font-italic">itself </span>not specified in its written submissions precisely <span class="font-italic">which</span> provisions it claims to have breached, and instead only asserts in broad-brush language that the defendants’ acts have “exposed the Club to penalties from various government agencies including the URA and the STB”.  This lack of specificity undermines any attempt to consider the Club’s alleged wrongs, and is exacerbated by the fact that it is not possible to say with <span class="font-italic">any</span> degree of certainty whether the loss stemming from potential regulatory action would flow from any wrongs committed by the first and/or second defendants.  It would all depend on the facts upon which the regulatory action is taken.  Put shortly, the Club is asking that the Court decide the issue of an indemnity in abstract even though the factual matrix on which the regulatory action is based will have a <span class="font-italic">direct</span> impact on whether an indemnity should be ordered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Second, and more critically, there is precedent which suggests that the Club is acting prematurely in seeking an indemnity at this juncture.  In <span class="font-italic">Freight Connect (S) Pte Ltd v Paragon Shipping Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 178 (“<span class="font-italic">Freight Connect</span>”), the Court of Appeal held that, where a plaintiff was facing a possible claim by a third party which had not at the time made a claim, it would not be appropriate to order the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of any loss it <span class="font-italic">may</span> suffer <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the third party.  Instead, the issue of an indemnity could be reserved with a liberty to apply for directions when the real issue can be determined and damages quantified, but only if there was a need to do so.  For example, if a claim had already been made by the third party against the plaintiff, the issue of whether an indemnity should be ordered can then be reserved until after damages owed to the third party are quantified at the appropriate time, as opposed to merely being decided in a vacuum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 At [52] of <span class="font-italic">Freight Connect</span>, the Court of Appeal observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In <span class="font-italic">Trans Trust SPRL v </span><span class="font-italic">Danubian Trading Co Ltd </span>[1952] 2 QB 297 … [the] Court of Appeal further observed that even if the head of damage was recoverable (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the event that it was not too remote), it would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be correct to make a declaration of indemnity. Somervell LJ stated the law as follows at 303:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The problem can be shortly stated. B sues C for breach of contract. The court holds that B is entitled as against C to recover damages in respect of B’s liability to A arising out of C’s breach of contract. At the time of the hearing B is not in a position to call evidence to quantify this damage. There may be some cases in which the court can state a principle which makes the subsequent quantification of this damage simple. On the other hand, difficult questions may arise, depending, for example, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(1) on any variation of the terms of the contract between B and C as between B and A, (2) on the question whether A took the steps which should have been taken to mitigate damage</span>. No declarations ought to prejudice or preclude a proper determination of these issues, on which the defendants should be entitled to be heard. It might, as it seems to me, be more satisfactory if there were <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">liberty to apply for directions as to the determination of these issues, if any, and quantification of damages under this head as between plaintiffs and defendants, should disputes arise.</span> Some order in this form, at any rate, in some cases, might be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">more satisfactory than a declaration in the form ordered</span>. [Emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Denning LJ also held that in the event where the liability of the seller to a third party was within the contemplation of the parties, but had not yet been assessed, the proper order was to reserve that head of damages. It was further observed that judgment could be entered for the damages already ascertained, leaving the rest to be ascertained later by the same or another judge (at 307). On this basis, Denning LJ arrived at the conclusion that “it would not be correct to make a declaration of indemnity”. In the subsequent English decision of <span class="font-italic">Deeny</span><span class="font-italic"> v Gooda Walker Ltd (in liquidation</span>) [1995] 1 WLR 1206, Philips J followed <span class="font-italic">Trans Trust</span> and deferred dealing with the claimants’ future losses until it had been determined (at 1214).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On the basis of the reasoning as outlined above, the Court of Appeal declined to order an indemnity on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Freight Connect</span>.  While <span class="font-italic">Freight Connect</span> dealt with the possibility of a plaintiff facing a civil claim by a third party, I do not see any distinction in principle between that situation and one where there is a possibility of the Club being prosecuted for statutory offences and facing potential monetary penalties in the future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Third, the uncertainty as to whether the authorities will take action or what action they might actually take makes this an inappropriate case for an indemnity against the first and second defendants to be ordered.  As stated above at [108], the Club has not outlined the specific legislative provisions or regulations it alleges that it has breached.  However, looking at the regulatory frameworks in both the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed) and the Hotels Act, not all the potential penalties are necessarily monetary, and not all of them necessarily apply only to the Club.  For example, the regulatory authorities have a broad discretion in determining whether to only prosecute the Club, or to also prosecute specific individuals (for instance, as hotel-keepers under the Hotels Act).  Further, the regulatory authorities also have the discretion to issue warnings instead of proceeding against the Club or its members.  Given the multiple permutations of actions which the regulatory authorities may elect to take, and the fact that the Club has not even outlined precisely <span class="font-italic">which</span> regulatory provisions it may have fallen foul of, I am not satisfied that I should speculate as to the manner in which the discretion may possibly be exercised by the regulatory authorities, which I would be doing by ordering an indemnity at this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In this case, on the evidence before me, the last time the authorities raised any issue with the Club about the manner in which the Residence was operated was in the letter from the HLB of 27 March 2013.

</div>
</div>  The Club’s reply, signed by the first defendant, denied that the Residence was being operated like a hotel.  In the evidence before me, there has been no complaint raised by the URA, STB or HLB since then.  It is entirely unclear whether any action will be taken by the authorities against the Club now that several years have passed since that letter from HLB and the Residence has ceased operation.  As such, following the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Freight Connect</span>, and for the reasons outlined above, it is not necessary for me to consider whether the Club is entitled to an indemnity from the two defendants.  It is a hypothetical question.  That issue can be decided <span class="font-italic">if and when</span> the Club ever faces prosecution for operating the Residence like a hotel and/or for breaching the URA Condition, <span class="font-italic">and</span> the Club then brings proceedings against the defendants for an indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As for the question of whether the issue of an indemnity should be reserved, the Club has not satisfied me that there is a need to reserve the issue of an indemnity (see [109] above).  As in <span class="font-italic">Freight Connect</span>, no claim (or prosecution) has been brought by any third parties.  I am not satisfied, given the long lapse of time since the HLB letter of 27 March 2013, that there is a need for the issue of an indemnity to be reserved.  Such a reservation might result in these proceedings being extended indefinitely if no prosecutions are eventually brought.  The Club can seek an indemnity at the appropriate time.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first defendant’s counterclaim for wrongful dismissal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The first defendant’s counterclaim is on the basis that he was constructively dismissed on 11 August 2014, and/or wrongfully terminated from his employment on 1 September 2014 by the Club.

His claims relate to three main components.  First, he was not paid his salary from 2 September 2014 until 11 October 2014, which would have been his last day of employment if he had been permitted to serve out his two months’ notice after he gave notice of his resignation on 11 August 2014.  Second, he claims to be entitled to an annual wage supplement for the year 2014, as well as a handphone allowance from 1 August to 11 October 2014.  Third, the first defendant claims a sum representing his “accrued” annual leave of 56.5 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I note for completeness that while the counterclaim entails <span class="font-italic">both</span> a claim for constructive dismissal on 11 August 2014, <span class="font-italic">and/or</span> a claim for summary dismissal on 1 September 2014, the damages claimed flow from the summary dismissal on 1 September 2014 and the fact that the first defendant was denied his salary and benefits from 2 September 2014 until 11 October 2014.  In that sense, whether or not the first defendant was constructively dismissed or elected to resign on his own accord on 11 August 2014 is not directly relevant to the damages he is seeking.  The crux of the loss stems from being denied what he would have received whether he resigned with notice <span class="font-italic">or</span> was constructively dismissed.  Accordingly, there is no real need for me to determine whether or not the first defendant had been constructively dismissed, and the focus of my analysis on the counterclaim will be on the first defendant’s argument that his dismissal on 1 September 2014 was wrongful and without basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The Club’s response in this regard is that it was entitled to terminate the first defendant’s employment with immediate effect on 1 September 2014.  In its pleadings, the Club claims that the conduct of the first defendant in relation to the unauthorised bonuses, the operation of the Residence, and the failure to account for the Club’s property and the Dell laptop form the bases for its right to summarily dismiss the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I have dealt with these allegations and why they are unfounded above.  There does not appear, from the evidence and arguments canvassed thus far, to be sound basis for the Club to have summarily dismissed the first defendant on 1 September 2014.  But, in addition to the grounds already I have already considered, the Club also argues that the first defendant’s conduct on the night of 11 August 2014, and in particular, his defiance of the instructions he was given, provides a basis for summary dismissal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 There is no dispute that the MC had authorised Dr Singh, Professor Sum, and Dr Chong to communicate its decision on the termination of the first defendant’s employment to him and to handle his exit procedures.  The Club has pleaded that the first defendant was given an express instruction by Dr Singh on the night of 11 August 2014 to return to the office the next morning to clear out his personal belongings from his office, and that the first defendant disobeyed this express instruction.  The first defendant’s case is that he did not deliberately defy any instructions given by Dr Singh, and he thought it was fine to take some of his belongings home that night.  In assessing this issue, it is pertinent to remember that the burden is ultimately on the Club to show on balance that there is a proper basis for summary dismissal.  The Club has to show, in accordance with the well-known approach in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato </span><span class="font-italic">Kyogo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”) from [90] to [101], that the first defendant’s alleged acts in defiance of the instruction given by Dr Singh were sufficiently serious to constitute repudiatory breach of his contract of employment, and to therefore justify summary dismissal: <span class="font-italic">Phosagro</span> <span class="font-italic">Asia Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Piattchanine, Iouri</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1052 at [50] to [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 For the reasons outlined below, I am of the view that the Club has failed to discharge the burden of showing that there is a proper basis for summary dismissal of the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 First, I find that the instruction given by Dr Singh, which the first defendant is alleged to have defied, was not as clear as it should have been.  Dr Singh’s account of the instruction he gave to the first defendant on the night of 11 August 2014 is that he “instructed the 1st Defendant to return the next day at 10.00 am to his office at the Plaintiff’s premises to collect his personal belongings, during which time he would be supervised by some of the MC members”.

</div>  The first defendant’s account of Dr Singh’s instructions to him is somewhat similar.  The first defendant claimed that he was told “to return to the club premises the next day at around 10 a.m. to do the handover and [Dr Christopher Chong] would be present”.

</div>
</div>  But, if the intention was for the first defendant to leave the Club’s premises <span class="font-italic">straight away</span>, and that he could not take <span class="font-italic">any</span> of his personal belongings at all that night, then the instructions given to him could have been more explicit.  Complying literally with what Dr Singh said would not preclude the first defendant from returning to his office after the meeting with Dr Singh.  The express instructions did not stipulate that the first defendant was to leave the Club’s premises <span class="font-italic">immediately</span> and without returning to his office first.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Further, the instructions Dr Singh gave the first defendant did not preclude the first defendant from removing <span class="font-italic">some</span> of his personal belongings that night.  That might have been the implied subtext of what Dr Singh said, but even on Dr Singh’s own account of his instructions to the first defendant, there was no express prohibition on the first defendant removing <span class="font-italic">any</span> of his personal belongings from his office on the night of 11 August 2014.  This absence of clarity in Dr Singh’s instructions goes towards whether any alleged disobedience by the first defendant was so flagrant and serious as to constitute repudiatory breach of his contract of employment with the Club.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Second, even if Dr Singh’s account of his instructions to the first defendant is regarded as having been clear and unambiguous, it is obvious that demanding literal compliance with those instructions would give rise to an absurd result.  If Dr Singh’s expectation was actually that the first defendant would not collect <span class="font-italic">any</span> of his personal belongings until he was supervised the next morning, that would mean that the first defendant would be precluded from taking even essential items like his car keys, briefcase, and other personal accessories from his own office, which he would normally take home every day.  That would have been wholly unreasonable, and it is clear that this cannot have been what Dr Singh meant.  Rather, a margin of interpretation must have been afforded to the first defendant to act reasonably in compliance with Dr Singh’s instructions.  Viewed through that lens, the first defendant’s act in removing some of his personal belongings on the evening of 11 August 2014 is not necessarily an act of defiance against his employer, but could have been simple misunderstanding of the instructions he was given.  Accordingly, I am not convinced that the alleged wrong on the part of the first defendant was of such gravity as to strike at the root of his contract of employment, such that it would destroy the confidence underlying such a contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Third, and significantly, the second defendant was present with the first defendant in the first defendant’s office as the first defendant was packing his personal belongings and bringing them to his car.  He was there to offer some consolation to the first defendant about his termination.  The significance of the second defendant’s presence should not be understated.  The second defendant was, at that time, still the President of the MC.  He had attended the MC meeting that evening, and it would have been entirely reasonable for the first defendant to assume that the second defendant was aware of the proper exit procedures to be followed.  Specifically, I find that it was reasonable for the first defendant to have believed that the second defendant, as an MC member, was aware of Dr Singh’s instructions concerning his exit procedures, since one would have expected Dr Singh to have discussed the termination and exit procedures at the MC meeting.  The first defendant therefore assumed, justifiably in my opinion, that the second defendant knew what the MC had decided about what the first defendant could or could not do.  That the second defendant, his direct supervisor, did not raise any issue with him packing up some of his personal belongings therefore gave rise to the impression that his acts were permitted and unobjectionable.  I accordingly find it difficult to accept the Club’s portrayal of the first defendant as having acted in repudiatory breach of his contract of employment by wilfully defying his employer’s instructions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The Club’s main argument in support of why the first defendant’s acts on the night of 11 August 2014 should be seen as defiance of a direct instruction giving rise to repudiatory breach of his employment contract is that the first defendant had failed to make any kind of explanation for his actions at the “inquiry” held on 1 September 2014 (see [12] above).  The Club therefore argues that the first defendant impliedly accepted that he had knowingly acted in defiance of Dr Singh’s instructions, and that any of the first defendant’s current reasons are mere afterthoughts.

</div>  The first defendant’s response when confronted with this argument under cross-examination was that he was “worried and frightened” and had therefore not made arguments in his defence at the “inquiry” on 1 September 2014.

</div>
</div>  I initially had some doubts about the veracity of the first defendant’s explanation, particularly given that it appeared a somewhat convenient way to explain away his not having spoken in his own defence.  However, having reviewed the transcript of the “inquiry”, I am satisfied from all the circumstances that the first defendant may well have been “worried and frightened” and therefore neglected to outline his defence.  My reasons are as outlined below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 First, the first defendant was, for all intents and purposes, ambushed at the “inquiry” on 1 September 2014.  It is not disputed that the first defendant had been asked by the Club’s Head of Department for Human Resources, Ms Veronica Kok, to attend what had been described as a meeting on 1 September 2014 to discuss the issue of his accumulated leave, which was quite substantial.  No indication <span class="font-italic">whatsoever</span> was provided to the first defendant that he was in fact attending an inquiry about the allegedly missing laptop or his conduct on the night of 11 August 2014.

</div>
</div>  This was obviously a deliberate ploy by the MC, so as to try to catch the first defendant off-guard.  Given the absence of notice given to him, I accept that the first defendant was taken by surprise at the “inquiry” – both in terms of the content of the meeting, and the tone the meeting took.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Second, I find that the “inquiry” itself was carried out in an oppressive and aggressive manner.  This is most clear from the transcript of the “inquiry”, which was recorded secretly without the first defendant’s knowledge.  I highlight the most telling extracts below:

Often when he tried to answer or give an explanation, he was interrupted and cut off by the MC members, who mutually reinforced each other’s statements.  While I accept that inquiries into acts of wrongdoing can be carried out in a robust and direct manner, I am of the view that the way in which “inquiry” on 1 September 2014 was carried out had the intended effect of throwing the first defendant off balance in his thought process.  This hindered him from giving all his reasons for his actions on the night of 11 August 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 As such, I do not accept that the first defendant’s actions on the night of 11 August 2014 constitute repudiatory breach of his contract of employment.  I do not find such actions to be so serious as to strike at the root of his contract of employment of the Club, nor am I of the view that the Club has established any of the grounds for repudiatory breach outlined in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> ( [118]<span class="font-italic">supra</span>).  I therefore find that the Club had no proper basis to summarily dismiss the first defendant, and the first defendant is accordingly entitled to his salary-in-lieu-of-notice for his two-month notice period, subject to the sums already paid to him by the Club (as reflected in the table at [114] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 For completeness, I should add that the fact that the first defendant had used his Club email address for personal purposes does not change my conclusion on repudiatory breach.  While such use of Club email addresses is, strictly speaking, a breach of the “Undertaking on Code of Ethics for Use of Internet, Email and Confidentiality” the first defendant signed on 29 June 2002, I am not satisfied that such a breach is sufficient to be deemed repudiatory.

The annual wage supplement is commonly referred to by employers as the “thirteenth month bonus”.  On the instant facts, the annual wage supplement the first defendant is claiming is for S$13,104.00, or one month’s salary.  The first defendant’s entitlement to remuneration and other benefits are set out in his employment contract with the Club, supplemented with other terms which might be incorporated, such as from the Club’s employee handbook.  I accept the Club’s submission that the terms of the first defendant’s employment clearly incorporate the employee handbook terms, as amended from time to time.  This is made indisputable by clause 15 of annex 1 to the first defendant’s employment contract, which states that “[r]eference should be made to the Club’s current [e]mployee handbook which may be amended from time to time”.

This is because, as already explained, there is nothing in the terms of his employment that contractually commits the Club to make such a payment on the resignation of the first defendant.  Critically, the first defendant has also not pleaded that he agreed to resign only on condition that he be paid such an annual wage supplement or “thirteenth month bonus”.  That being the case, I find that the first defendant has not discharged his burden of proving his claim that the Club is obliged to pay him an annual wage supplement.  Being an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> payment, the Club is fully within its rights to stand firm and refuse to make this payment to the first defendant now that he has been summarily dismissed: see <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Siok Wah v American International Assurance</span> <span class="font-italic">Co Ltd </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 245 from [41] to [44].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The claim by the first defendant to be entitled to a reimbursement of his handphone bills for the month of August 2014 suffers from the same difficulties.

</div>  The Club’s position is that it had previously reimbursed some of the first defendant’s phone bills out of goodwill and not because of any contractual obligation to do so.  The first defendant’s evidence in this regard is that he had a conversation in 2003 with one Bryan Phan, then the MC member in charge of human resources, who told him that his phone bills would be subsidised by the Club since he was using his own handphone.  However, surprisingly, this evidence only emerged when he was cross-examined, and did not appear in his AEIC.

</div>  As such, I have some doubts as to the credibility of the first defendant on this count.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 However, even if it did take place, this conversation with a sole MC member in 2003 is insufficient to establish that the Club had contractually committed itself to paying or subsidising his handphone bills.  A single member of the MC, unless properly authorised, would not be able to bind the Club to any contractual commitment.  The first defendant did not point me to any evidence of such authority, nor did he refer me to any documents or communications that would evidence that the Club had committed itself contractually to making such payments in relation to the handphone bills.  As such, I find that the first defendant’s claim to be entitled to reimbursement of such handphone bills has not been established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Finally, I come to the issue of the first defendant’s accumulated leave of 56.5 days, for which he claims to be entitled to be paid the sum of S$34,171.20. The Club’s response is quite straightforward.  The employee handbook states that only seven days of annual leave can be carried over per year.

</div>  The second defendant, as Club president, might have agreed with the first defendant that the latter could carry his unconsumed annual leave over to the next year.  However, the second defendant did not have the authority to bind the Club to a decision which effectively varied the terms of the first defendant’s employment with the Club.  Only the MC could have authorised such a variation of the employment contract with the first defendant, and none was obtained in this case.  As such, the Club’s position is that the first defendant could carry over seven days of leave from 2013, and had earned 15.33 days of leave in 2014 (as of 31 August).  Subtracting the seven days of leave the first defendant had taken in 2014 prior to the termination of his employment, the first defendant had 15 days of leave remaining which required compensation.  The Club has paid the first defendant S$8,522.18 for these 15 days. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I accept the Club’s submission that the second defendant could not bind the Club contractually on the issue of the first defendant’s leave entitlement without the authority of the MC.  In fact, the second defendant acknowledged his own failing in not obtaining the MC’s prior approval when this issue of the first defendant’s sizable unconsumed annual leave was raised at the MC meeting on 8 September 2014.

</div>  Graciously, he apologised to the MC for having acted on his own accord when he purported to allow the first defendant to carry over his annual leave.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I have sympathy for the first defendant’s position on this issue.  The evidence was quite clear that he was a dedicated general manager who spent long hours at work.  When there were events at the Club held in the evenings or over the weekend, the first defendant would always try to be present to ensure that everything ran smoothly.

</div>  The second defendant expected this of him.  In fact, the second defendant often rejected the first defendant’s applications for leave because he wanted him to be around for Club events.  I also accept the first defendant’s evidence that he sacrificed holidays and time with his family by not using up his leave entitlement every year.  However, the terms of his employment are a matter of contract.  The issue before me falls to be decided on the basis of whether the second defendant had the requisite authority to approve the carrying over of leave.  While three MC members, namely N Pandian, Steven Goh, and John Tan, gave evidence that the second defendant had on occasion mentioned in passing at MC meetings that he had allowed the first defendant to carry over his unconsumed annual leave, this is clearly insufficient to show that the MC had <span class="font-italic">discussed and decided</span> the question of the first defendant’s unconsumed annual leave.  Unless this was done, the second defendant would not have been authorised by the MC to agree to the carrying over of the first defendant’s leave beyond the contractually-stipulated seven days.  In this regard, the second defendant’s admission of having make an error of judgment at the MC meeting of 8 September 2014 is entirely consistent with the fact that no prior MC approval had been sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I also could not accept the first defendant’s submission that, <span class="font-italic">if</span> the issue had been brought up and discussed, it was almost certain that the MC would have allowed the first defendant’s leave to be carried over.  That might well be the case, and it may even be fair to say that the first defendant is the unfortunate victim of politics within the Club.  However, this is quite irrelevant to the question of whether the Club is bound in law by the acts of the Club president, who acted on his own without first seeking the MC’s express approval.  In my judgment, I find that there is no merit to the first defendant’s claim that he be paid for the full 56.5 days of unconsumed annual leave.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 For all the reasons set out in this judgment, I find there is no merit to the Club’s claims against the two defendants.  The Club’s claims are dismissed in full.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Club made, <em>inter alia</em>, the following claims in relation to the first and second defendants:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a) That the first defendant had removed the Club’s property, including one Dell laptop, from the Club and not returned the said property: <strong>[34]</strong> to <strong>[50]</strong>;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>b) That the second defendant had improperly and without the approval of the Club’s management committee (“MC”) procured the payment of “special” bonuses to the first defendant, and that the first defendant accepted such bonuses despite knowing that they had not been approved: <strong>[51]</strong> to <strong>[83]</strong>;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>c) That the first and second defendants caused loss to the Club by failing to ensure that Visiting Membership fees </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">were collected by the Club for the guests who stayed at the Residence from 2009 to 2014: <strong>[84]</strong> to <strong>[89]</strong>;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>d)That the first and second defendants improperly and without the approval of the Club’s MC procured the payment of moneys </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">to various online booking agents and platforms which had been contracted by the Club for the purposes of securing occupancy of the Residence: <strong>[90]</strong> to <strong>[103]</strong>; and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>e)That the first and second defendants operated the Residence in breach of the Hotels Act and/or a condition set by the Urban Redevelopment Authority that the Residence not be operated as an independent hotel and therefore ought to indemnify the Club: <strong>[104]</strong> to <strong>[113]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Each of these claims was dismissed by the Court.  The first defendant’s counterclaim for wrongful dismissal after having been allegedly summarily dismissed on 1 September 2014, was partially successful.  The Court ordered that the first defendant be paid his salary-in-lieu-of-notice for his two-month notice period, subject to the sums already paid to him by the Club: <strong>[127]</strong>.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The material facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The first defendant was employed by the Club as its General Manager-cum-Secretary from June 2002 until the end of August 2014.  The second defendant had been elected as the Club’s president in 1995 and held that position for almost 22 years.  Although the second defendant was the Club’s President until April 2016, he had in fact been suspended by the Club at the end of 2015 pursuant to a complaint made in July 2015 by the Club’s then vice-president, Dr Sarbjit Singh (“Dr Singh”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>In the MC elections of April 2014, nine of the 12 members elected were part of a team led by Dr Singh.  These nine had campaigned as part of Dr Singh’s team.  The remaining three elected MC members were the second defendant and two members of the previous MC.  Thus, while the second defendant still held his position as the Club’s president, he no longer held sway over the MC.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>After the new MC took office, there were discussions amongst the members who came in as part of Dr Singh’s team that the time was ripe for a change of General Manager-cum-Secretary for the Club.  On 11 August 2014, the MC resolved, by majority, that the first defendant’s employment would be terminated.  This resolution, proposed by Dr Singh, was passed at the MC’s monthly meeting.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The first defendant was given an option to either resign or be given two months’ notice of the termination of his employment by the Club.  The first defendant opted for the former option, and he signed a pre-prepared letter of resignation which was handed to him by Dr Singh.  The first defendant was then placed on garden leave for his notice period. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Club alleges that the first defendant, after having resigned, took documents from the Club that night on 11 August 2014 before leaving.  The Club also alleges that the first defendant failed to return the laptop issued to him.  Without informing the first defendant, Mr Derrick D’Souza (“Mr D’Souza”), an MC member of the Club, made two police reports against the first defendant, alleging that he had “stolen” the Club’s documents and property. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 1 September 2014, </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">whilst he was serving his garden leave, the first defendant was asked to attend a meeting at the Club.  The reason he was given for the meeting was to discuss the issue of his substantial unconsumed annual leave and whether it would be encashed.  However, at the meeting, which the Club itself acknowledges is more aptly described as an “inquiry”, Dr Singh, and three other MC members grilled the first defendant about the missing laptop.  The first defendant denied any wrongdoing.  However, the Club nonetheless decided to terminate him with immediate effect on grounds of unprofessional conduct.  A year later, the Club brought proceedings against the first defendant.  These proceedings were added to over time until they encompassed all the claims outlined at [2] above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The court’s grounds of decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>In relation to the Club’s claim that the first defendant had misappropriated its property, including the Dell laptop, the </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Club did not adduce any evidence as to what might have been removed by the first defendant and/or not returned by him to the Club.  The Club also has been unable to identify what property or documents of the Club, if any, were supposedly removed from the first defendant’s office the night of 11 August 2014 and not returned: <strong>[37]</strong>.  In fact, both Dr Singh and Mr D’Souza conceded during cross-examination that up to the time of the trial, more than five years since the incident on 11 August 2014, the Club still had not been able to identify <em>any</em> particular missing documents or property, apart from the Dell laptop, which might have been taken away by the first defendant: <strong>[37]</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>As for the Dell laptop which was allegedly taken by the first defendant, whether the allegation was made out depended on the contrasting evidence of the first defendant and Mr D’Souza on whether the laptop was left on the table in the office: <strong>[46]</strong>.  The Court did not find Mr D’Souza to be a credible witness: <strong>[47] – [48]</strong>.  The “objective” evidence relied on by the Club was also equivocal at best: <strong>[42] – [44]</strong>.  Overall, the Club had failed to discharge its burden of proof that the first defendant had misappropriated the Dell laptop. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Club’s claim in relation to the “special” bonuses was that the relevant MCs had not approved such bonuses to be paid out to the first defendant over several years.  In fact, according to Dr Singh, the second defendant, who together with the first defendant had “control” over payments, had secretly arranged the payment out of these bonuses: <strong>[60]</strong>.  The Court rejected this as being at tension with the objective evidence.  Dr Singh’s evidence that this issue of “special” bonuses had <em>never</em> been discussed by the relevant MCs was contradicted by the clear evidence of ten former MC members who gave evidence, and was in any event showed to be false by objective evidence in the form of letters dating back to 2007: <strong>[59]</strong>.  Because of significant inaccuracies in Dr Singh’s evidence, the Court was unable to accept it in relation to the “special” bonuses: <strong>[60]</strong>.  Further, the fact that approval had not been explicitly recorded in the MC minutes was not in itself sufficient to indicate that the MC had not granted the relevant approvals – several important decisions were not recorded in the MC minutes even after Dr Singh took over leadership of the Club, and the second defendant provided a coherent explanation as to why the MC minutes may not have included reference to the relevant bonuses: <strong>[61] – [64]</strong>, <strong>[76]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>As for the Club’s claim for uncollected Visiting Membership fees, the difficulty with the Club’s case in this regard is that almost all the MC members, past and present, who gave evidence in this case, whether for the Club or for the defendants, did not appear to be aware of the existence of <em>any</em> requirement to collect Visiting Membership fees.  There was no evidence before the Court that the MC had ever authorised the collection of Visiting Membership fees for the guests at the Residence: <strong>[87]</strong>.  In fact, Article 18 of the Club’s Constitution states that <em>no entrance fee</em> shall be collected for Visiting Members, and it would have been a breach of the Club’s Constitution for Visiting Membership fees to have been collected: <strong>[88]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Turning to the commissions paid by the Club to various booking agents, the Court found that the MCs for the period from 2008 to 2014 were fully aware of the condition that the guest rooms at the Residence not be operated as independent hotel rooms.  This was the clear and consistent evidence of the MC members who testified on behalf of the defendants: <strong>[91]</strong>.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The minutes of the MC meeting of 15 December 2009 even showed that an email from the URA to the Club dated 2 December 2009 had been tabled and discussed, and that email concerned the condition set that the Residence not be operated as an independent hotel: <strong>[91]</strong>.  The MC members from 2007 to 2013 who gave evidence for the defendants testified that they were fully aware of and approved the use of booking agents in order to secure occupancy of the Residence guest rooms: <strong>[93]</strong>.  Like the case of the first defendant’s bonuses, Dr Singh was the <em>only</em> MC member from that period who was prepared to testify that he was ignorant that the Club was using booking agents.  After reviewing the totality of the evidence, documentary and oral, the Court concluded that Dr Singh was simply not being truthful in this regard: <strong>[93] – [96]</strong>.  The objective evidence from the time, including the Club’s Annual Report and various financial reports, made clear that moneys were being paid to various booking agents.  This was done with the knowledge and acceptance of the MC. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>As for any indemnities sought by the Club, the grant of indemnities at this stage was inappropriate given the absence of any pending regulatory proceedings against the Club (at <strong>[108]</strong>), the clear authority indicating that granting an indemnity at this point would be premature (at <strong>[109]</strong>), and the fact that an indemnity would not properly account for the range of regulatory measures the relevant authorities could take, if they chose to do so (at <strong>[111]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Finally, in relation to the first defendant’s counterclaim, the Club had failed to show that it had sound basis to summarily dismiss the first defendant on 1 September 2014.  None of the required grounds for repudiatory breach outlined in </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kyogo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal </span></em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 from [90] to [101] had been satisfied.  In particular, the Club’s “inquiry” into the first defendant’s behaviour had been carried out in an oppressive and aggressive manner where the first defendant was ambushed and caught unawares: <strong>[125] – [126]</strong>, and had hampered the ability of the first defendant to properly explain himself.  However, in relation to any <em>ex gratia</em> payments the first defendant sought, the Club was entitled, in the absence of any implied term that it would pay them, to decline to make payment: <strong>[131]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Overall, the Court was satisfied that there was no basis for any of the Club’s claims, and they were accordingly dismissed: [<strong>127</strong>]. </span></p>
