<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Under
our immigration law, specifically s 57C(1) of the Immigration Act
(“Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), it is an offence for a person
to enter into a marriage knowing or having reason to believe that
the purpose of the marriage is to assist one of the parties to the
marriage to obtain an immigration advantage, and where any sort
of gratification is involved. This offence is colloquially known
as “transacting a marriage of convenience”. The appeal before me
concerned the arrangement, or assisting in the arrangement, of a
marriage of convenience, a separate offence under s 57C(2) of the
Act. Under the latter offence, there is no requirement to show that
any consideration or gratification is involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
charge levelled against the Appellant, Mehra Radhika, a 22-year old
female Indian national, was that she had committed an offence under s 57C(2)
of the Act by arranging a marriage of convenience between one Norhayati,
a female Singapore national, and one Gagandeep, a male Indian national,
with the intention of assisting Gagandeep to obtain an immigration
advantage so as to extend his stay in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Although
the Appellant initially claimed trial, she (later) admitted to the
Statement of Facts without qualification and pleaded guilty to the charge
on the first day of trial. She was convicted and sentenced by the learned
District Judge (“DJ”) to eight months’ imprisonment in addition
to the month or so that she had spent in remand prior to her being
bailed out. The Appellant appealed against the sentence on two grounds,
the first being that the sentence was manifestly excessive and the
second being that the sentence was arrived at by the DJ without
a proper appreciation of the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I
allowed the appeal and reduced the sentence of imprisonment to six months.
These are my full grounds of decision to supplement the brief reasons
I gave when I disposed of the appeal after hearing the arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
relevant facts are set out in the Statement of Facts. The seed of
the marriage of convenience was sowed in the middle of 2012, when
the Appellant was first contacted by her brother in India and was
asked for help in finding a job for Gagandeep. In response, the
Appellant suggested that Gagandeep enter into a marriage of convenience
with a female Singapore national as she thought that that would
make it easier for him to secure a work permit. His “wife” would
also be able to sponsor the extension of his stay in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Appellant then sought the assistance of her friend, one Peer Ali, in
February 2013. The Appellant discussed the following proposed terms
of the marriage of convenience with Peer Ali: (a) the “wife” would
be paid a sum of money for her involvement; (b) the “wife” would
not need to fulfil any marital obligations; and (c) the “wife” would
have to sponsor Gagandeep’s application for a Visit Pass to extend
his stay in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Peer
Ali (evidently, through his brother) found Norhayati quite quickly.
Gagandeep arrived in Singapore shortly thereafter on 26 February 2013
and just days later, on 2 March 2013, was brought by the Appellant
to the Toa Payoh South Community Club where his marriage to Norhayati was
solemnised. After the solemnisation, the Appellant paid Peer Ali
a sum of $6,300 for his assistance. From the Statement of Facts,
it was not clear how much of this was paid to Norhayati or if any
of it was paid by Peer Ali to his brother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
Appellant, along with Norhayati, Gagandeep and Peer Ali were all
subsequently arrested and charged. Norhayati and Gagandeep were charged
under s 57C(1) of the Act for entering into a marriage of convenience.
Peer Ali was charged under s 57C(2) (as was the Appellant) for arranging
a marriage of convenience. Norhayati and Gagandeep were sentenced
to six months’ imprisonment each while Peer Ali was sentenced to
nine months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       For
ease of reference, I set out the entirety of s 57C:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>57C</b>.—(1) Any
person who contracts or otherwise enters into a marriage —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    knowing or having reason

the parties to the marriage to obtain an immigration advantage;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    where
any gratification, whether from a party to the marriage or another
person, is offered, given or received as an inducement or reward

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    In any proceedings for an offence
under subsection (1) or (2), it shall be a defence for the person
charged with the offence to prove that, although one purpose of

marriage would result in a genuine marital relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    For the purposes of subsection (4),
what constitutes a genuine marital relationship is a question of
fact and the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of
the case in determining the question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    In this section —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“gratification” includes —</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“immigration advantage”, in relation to

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The DJ’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
DJ imposed what, in effect, was a nine-month term of imprisonment
on the Appellant. His reasons for doing so are contained in his
judgment which is reported as <em>Public Prosecutor
v Mehra </em><em>Radhika</em> [2014]
SGDC 206 (the “Judgment”). These may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Section
57C of the Act was enacted in December 2012 because Parliament recognised
that targeted legislation aimed at marriages of convenience was
needed in order to safeguard the security and integrity of our borders
and to maintain law and order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     As
other courts have noted, marriages of convenience create serious
social and economic problems, undermine the integrity of the immigration
system, and erode the sanctity of marriage. If left unchecked, human
trafficking and transnational organised crime may be facilitated
under the cloak of a marriage of convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
list of precedents tendered by the Prosecution showed that similar
offences attracted between eight and 11 months’ imprisonment terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
Appellant had initiated and facilitated the offence; in that sense,
her role was crucial. The Appellant was therefore more culpable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     Peer
Ali, the Appellant’s accomplice, had been sentenced to nine months’
imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
Appellant had no antecedents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     While
I could understand the approach that had been taken by the DJ, I
considered that appellate intervention was warranted in this case
because, having regard to all the relevant factors, it was evident
that the Appellant’s sentence was manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant sentencing considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
DJ essentially took into account five factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     first,
Parliament’s intentions behind and its reasons for enacting a provision
targeted at marriages of convenience;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     second,
the sentencing benchmark based on sentences previously imposed for
similar offences;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     third,
the significance of the Appellant’s role in the commission of the
offence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     fourth,
the Appellant’s antecedents; and finally,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
sentences imposed on the others involved this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     These
factors are undoubtedly relevant. But, in my judgment, they do not
provide a complete basis upon which the sentencing decision in this case
should be arrived at.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Some
other considerations that ought to be factored into the sentencing
framework for this offence were usefully highlighted by the English
Court of Appeal in <em>Regina v Milusca </em><em>Theresita </em><em>Olivieira,
Kingsley Jozue </em><em>Oramulu</em> [2012]
EWCA Crim 2279 (“<em>Oramulu</em>”). I am
grateful to Ms Mavis Chionh, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor,
who referred me to this authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     
          <em>Oramulu</em> was a consolidated appeal brought
against two separate decisions that were related in that both concerned
the English equivalent of a marriage of convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In
the first case, Olivieira, a female Dutch national, and Oramulu,
a male Nigerian national, had carried out an elaborate plan which
culminated in a ceremony of marriage in 2007 that provided Oramulu
with a lawful basis for residing in the United Kingdom. Over the
next three or four years, Oramulu sent payments totalling about
£3,600 to Olivieira. In 2011, the police discovered that Oramulu
was living alone. While the police found no sign that Olivieira
was living with Oramulu, they did find a bag containing, amongst
other things, a photocopy of Olivieira’s Dutch identity card, the couple’s
marriage certificate, Olivieira’s driving licence and some wedding photographs.
These were documents that could be used to substantiate the marriage,
at least superficially, if the need arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The
second case before the court in <em>Oramulu</em> involved
a male Czech national, Cina. Over a period of 15 months, Cina recruited
five different Czech women and made arrangements for them to enter
into marriages of convenience with Nigerian men who wished to evade
immigration controls and acquire rights of movement, residence and
employment associated with marriage to a European Union (“EU”) national.
Cina’s fees for his services ranged from £4,000 to £5,000 for each
case. The women were promised something in the order of £2,000,
although in at least two cases, Cina cheated the women, underpaying
them by £1,500 and £1,100. There was also evidence that whenever
the Czech women had second thoughts, Cina would prevail upon them
to carry out the plan to fruition. In one instance, there was reasonably
clear evidence of undue pressure bordering on a threat being exerted
on one of the women who was told, amongst other things, that if
she did not comply, she might expect trouble from some Nigerians
who might visit her at home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Cina,
Oramulu and Olivieira were all charged with and convicted of an
offence under s 25 of the Immigration Act 1971 (c 77) which provides that
a person commits an offence if he:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     does
an act which facilitates the commission of a breach of immigration
law by an individual who is not a citizen of the EU,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     knows
or has reasonable cause for believing that the act facilitates the
commission of a breach of immigration law by the individual, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     knows
or has reasonable cause for believing that the individual is not
a citizen of the EU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Oramulu
and Olivieira were both sentenced to three and a half years’ imprisonment.
Although Cina pleaded guilty – unlike Oramulu and Olivieira – he
was sentenced to a longer imprisonment term of five years. The question
before the English Court of Appeal was whether there was any merit
in their respective appeals against sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Cina’s
appeal was dismissed. Although the court noted that his sentence
was “significantly long”, it was nonetheless considered appropriate given,
in particular, the fact that he had actively recruited the women
to participate in his criminal enterprise; and had not only exerted
pressure on them but had also exploited them. Consideration was
also given to the fact that he ran a sophisticated operation and
carried out multiple transactions; and the entirety of his enterprise
was driven by the pursuit of profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Oramulu
and Olivieira, on the other hand, had their imprisonment sentence
reduced to thirty months. The court noted that theirs was a single transaction
which was not part of a commercial operation; and although the marriage
was not motivated by family loyalty, friendship or other non-commercial
motives, and had been done for money alone, there was no element
of exploitation by either party. Oramulu and Olivieira’s offence thus
fell within the normal sentencing range for such offences which
was 18 months’ to three years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It
should also be noted that the court was alive to the evolution of
the legislation proscribing such marriages of convenience. The statutory maximum
for the offence had been increased <em>twice</em> in
the preceding years – from seven to ten years’ imprisonment in 1999,
and then to 14 years’ imprisonment in 2003. There was no question,
according to the court, of the “significance which Parliament attaches
to these offences” and sentencing must respond to this Parliamentary
signal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable sentencing framework
for such offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In
my judgment, the factors considered by the DJ, together with the considerations
that figured in <em>Oramulu</em>, reflect
an appropriate sentencing framework that ought to apply to an offence
under s 57C(2) of the Act. In summary and broadly speaking, the
factors which are relevant for the purpose of sentencing are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
circumstances of the offence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
particular role and the motivation of the offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In
my judgment, the relevant factors to be considered in relation to the
circumstances of the commission of the offence are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
the offence was committed in circumstances that reveal that active
steps were taken in an attempt to avoid detection of the offence;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
the offence was a one-off incident or part of a wider illicit commercial
operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Relevant
factors to be considered in relation to the role and motivation
of the offender are</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
specific role played by offender;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
specific motive with which the offender committed the offence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether
the offender had recruited accomplices to assist in the commission
of the offence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether
the offender had pressured or exploited any of the other parties
involved in the marriage of convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Some
of these factors are of general application while others are specific
to the offence at hand. Aside from these, it will of course be relevant to
have regard to matters such as the offender’s antecedents as well
as any other aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Legislative intention behind
s 57C of the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   General principle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Legislative
intention is relevant to and influences sentencing in various ways.
As a generally operative background factor, if Parliament has increased
the punishment for an offence on the basis that the mischief in question
was becoming more serious and needed to be arrested, as was the case
in <em>Oramulu</em>, the courts would not
be acting in concert with the legislative intent if they fail to
have regard to this in developing the appropriate sentencing framework
or if they nonetheless err on the side of leniency in sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Legislative
intention is also relevant in the assessment of the appropriateness
of a sentence for an offence that has a statutorily prescribed range
of sentences. In <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd
v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653, V K Rajah J
(as he then was), when meting out a sentence that was close to the
statutory maximum, observed thus (at [87]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a particular criminal provision prescribes
a maximum sentence that seems unduly light or lenient in relation
to the potential seriousness of offences that fall under it, meting
out a near-maximum sentence is not warranted unless it is demonstrated
by the prosecution that that particular offence figures among the
worst type of cases <em>falling within that prohibition</em>. <b><em>Thus, there must be a sense that the sentence is
proportionate not only to the culpability of the offender but also
in the context of the legislative scheme</em></b>. [emphasis in original
in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The
principle is that the court should consider the range of conduct that
may be captured at either end of the sentencing range before considering
where in that spectrum falls the particular conduct that is at issue
in the case before it. In short, the culpability of the offender
cannot be assessed in a vacuum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Relevance of legislative
intention to the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As
the DJ noted in his Judgment, s 57C of the Act was enacted to specifically
target marriages of convenience. Section 57C took effect on 19 December
2012 pursuant to the Immigration (Amendment) Bill that was passed
on 13 August 2012. There was little elaboration on the overall object of
enacting a specific provision targeting marriages of convenience.
All that the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mr S Iswaran, explained
when introducing the Bill during the Second Reading was that the
new law carried with it “stiff penalties [which] will serve as a
strong deterrent” (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
Debates, Official Report</em> (13 August 2012) vol 89 (“<em>Hansard</em>”) at p 2). Reference was also
made to the existence of similar legislation in the United States
and Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In
expressly acknowledging that there was “no specific law against marriages
of convenience” at that time (<em>Hansard</em> at
p 2), and by enacting such a law, the Second Reading speech suggests
that the position at law prior to the enactment of s 57C of the
Act was deficient and needed to be addressed in order to keep up
with the changing immigration landscape.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Prior
to the enactment of s 57C, transacting a marriage of convenience
was not an offence <em>per se</em>, but acts
associated with a marriage of convenience were frequently prosecuted
under one of two pieces of legislation: s 5(<em>b</em>)(i)
of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, Rev Ed 1993) or s
57(1)(<em>k</em>) of the Act. These two provisions
were generic provisions, in that they respectively targeted all
types of corrupt acts and all false declarations made for the purpose
of obtaining an immigration advantage. Punishment for corruption
is a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment of up to five years
or both. Punishment for a false declaration is a fine of up to $4,000
or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There
are a number of significant differences between the old position and
the current position under s 57C of the Act. The current position, which
is specifically targeted at marriages of convenience, draws a distinction
between an offence committed by the parties to the marriage of convenience
and an offence by a person who assisted in the arrangement of such
a marriage. After the enactment of s 57C, as I have already noted, parties
to the marriage of convenience are convicted of an offence under
s 57C(1) while persons who assisted with the arrangement of the
marriage of convenience are convicted of an offence under s 57C(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The
punishment regimes are also different. Under both ss 57C(1) and (2)
of the Act, which carry the same punishment, an offender is liable
to a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years or
both. When compared to the generic offence of false declaration
under s 57(1)(<em>k</em>), the punishment
for entering into or otherwise arranging a marriage of convenience
was significantly increased in severity. In particular, the maximum
imprisonment sentence was increased ten-fold. When compared to the
punishment for corruption, the maximum fine is lower but the imprisonment
term was doubled. On the whole, there can be no doubt that the punishment
regime applicable to these targeted offences is considerably more
severe than was the case when offenders were charged with the generic
offences of making a false declaration or of corruption. This is unsurprising
and coheres with the stated legislative objective of creating a strong
deterrent against transacting marriages of convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Thus,
it can safely be concluded that Parliament had intended, through
the enactment of s 57C of the Act and the enhanced punishment that
was provided for under that section, to signal that marriages of convenience
had become a sufficiently pressing issue that needed direct attention
and deterrence through a targeted regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Circumstances of the commission
of the offence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In
the analysis that follows, I address only the offence of assisting
in the arrangement of a marriage of convenience, that is, an offence
under s 57C(2) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Attempting to prevent
detection of the offence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     An
offence committed in circumstances which were designed to prevent
detection is a well-established aggravating factor. It has particular significance
in the context of s 57C(2) of the Act because of the deliberate legislative
intention behind enacting a targeted provision in the Act to deal with
marriages of convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     If
the arranger has taken active steps to prevent the detection of
the offence or has put in place measures designed to deceive an
inquisitive third party into thinking that the marriage is legitimate,
that could be an aggravating factor that warrants a more severe
sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This
is a function of the amount of planning that has gone into the commission
of the offence (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Fernando
Payagala </em><em>Waduge </em><em>Malitha Kumar</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 334 at [42]).
However, it is important to recognise that evidence of planning,
on its own, does not always justify a harsher sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Rather,
planning is typically considered an aggravating factor when it points
to the existence of a <em>considered</em> intention
to perpetrate the offence which in turn justifies a harsher sentence.
Intention, in the context of sentencing, is important. At one end
of the spectrum are offences which have been planned with deliberation;
on the other end are those which are the result of a “spur of the
moment” decision (see Andrew Ashworth, <em>Sentencing
and Criminal Justice</em> (Cambridge University Press, 5th
Ed, 2010) (“<em>Sentencing and Criminal Justice</em>”)
at p 148).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The
law generally imposes a more severe punishment on an offender who
has planned the commission of the offence with great deliberation than
one who has committed the offence on a spur of the moment because the
former is deemed to possess a greater commitment to the criminal enterprise
than the latter. As Professor Andrew Ashworth explains in <em>Sentencing and Criminal Justice</em> at p 164:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A person who plans a crime is generally
more culpable, because the offence is premeditated and the offender
is therefore more fully confirmed in his criminal motivation than
someone who acts on impulse, since he is more considered in his
lawbreaking…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However,
it bears noting that premeditation and planning are actually two
distinct concepts even though they overlap; a premeditated offence need
not have very much planning but a planned offence is usually premeditated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This
distinction is an important one because it brings out the point that
in some instances, evidence of planning, though indicative of premeditation,
might not in itself justify a harsher sentence. To take the example
at hand, it is inherent in the offence of arranging a marriage of convenience
that there will have been some degree of premeditation. It will generally
not be an offence that happens on the spur of the moment. The arranger
must have formed an earlier intention to arrange the marriage of convenience.
But where active steps have been taken to attempt to conceal the
detection of the marriage or a notable degree of planning has gone
into the offence, it suggests that the criminal intent is more directed
and the commitment to the offence greater and this is what calls
for a harsher sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Single incident or
an illicit commercial operation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     There
is a fundamental difference between an offence that is committed
as a one-off incident and one that is part of a wider illicit commercial
operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It
is self-evidently the case, at least as a general proposition, that
a one-off incident of arranging a marriage of convenience is likely
to cause less harm than one effected as part of a commercial operation.
By its very nature, a commercial operation is designed to bring
about continuity of “business”, in this context, the arranging of
marriages of convenience. At the very least, in contrast with an
offender who only commits the offence as a one-off incident, the
reach or at least the potential reach of a commercial operation
is far greater, and consequently, far more deleterious. It is this consequence
that needs to be especially punished and deterred and which therefore
justifies a harsher sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Role and motivation of the arranger</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The
factors relating to the role and motivation of an arranger are relevant
to his culpability. The importance of each individual factor, and the
interplay between factors, will vary from case to case. Notwithstanding the
potential variation, there are some general principles that ought
to apply in every case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The specific role
played by the offender</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It
is self-evident that the particular role played by the offender
will be relevant to his culpability. At one end of the spectrum,
the offender may be the mastermind or moving force of a major illicit
commercial enterprise. At the other end, the offender may have been
acting under extreme pressure or have played a purely ancillary
role.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     This
will be a fact-specific inquiry but as a general principle, the
more important and intensive the role of the arranger is, and the
greater the scale of the enterprise is, the more severe the punishment
should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The offender’s profit
motivation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It
is not a requirement of the offence that the arranger must profit from
arranging the marriage of convenience. The key element is simply
that there must be assistance in arranging a marriage of convenience,
knowing that the marriage is to enable one of the parties to the
marriage to obtain an immigration advantage. This is unlike the
position in relation to the offence of entering into a marriage
of convenience under s 57C(1) of the Act, where financial gratification
is a necessary element of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Offenders
may commit such offences driven by various considerations including,
for instance, a misguided desire to assist a friend or relative
as was noted in <em>Oramulu</em> (at [22]).
Although the absence of a dishonourable motivation is not a mitigating
factor, its presence would be an aggravating factor. Indeed, the
lack of a profit motive would tend to militate against the likelihood
of the offence being repeated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For
this reason, there is enhanced culpability where the arranger is motivated
by any form of financial gain or benefit, and this should be accompanied
with a harsher sentence. As a general proposition, the greater the
reward received, the greater the punishment ought to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In
addition, where there is an element of financial reward, a fine should
be imposed in addition to any term of imprisonment. In <em>Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor</em> [2014]
SGHC 186, in relation to vice offences, I observed (at [102]) that
fines should be imposed in such cases to annul or negate any financial
advantage that might have been obtained through the commission of
the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Recruiting other
accomplices</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     There
are a number of ways in which accomplices may be recruited by an
arranger. For instance, a “spouse” may be recruited to transact
the marriage of convenience, which was what happened in the second
of the two cases in <em>Oramulu</em>, where
Cina had recruited the Czech women to be the spouses in the marriage
of convenience. In this situation, the arranger’s recruitment of
the “spouse” should not be an aggravating factor because the procurement
of a “spouse” is a key element of brokering a marriage of convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     However,
any other form of recruitment beyond recruiting the “spouse” could
well be an aggravating factor. Thus, it would be an aggravating
factor if the arranger recruits others to procure the “spouse” or to
provide assistance on other operational aspects of the criminal endeavour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In
general, an arranger who has recruited more people to participate in
the criminal enterprise should be given a harsher sentence than
one who has not done so or who has extended the involvement of others
to a lesser degree.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Exploitation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Exploitation
and the application of pressure are, without doubt, aggravating
factors. Indeed, as a general point, I would regard these as seriously
aggravating factors that would warrant a significantly longer term of
imprisonment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The
manifest disregard of the rights and interests of others for the
sole purpose of benefiting oneself is an aggravating factor because
it accentuates and builds on the primary criminal conduct, in this
case, the arranging the marriage of convenience. In such circumstances,
there will almost always be a monetary inducement that drives the
commission of the offence. The additional harm inflicted by the
arranger on others to increase his own gain warrants a stiffer sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Crossing the custodial threshold</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     There
is a wide range of permissible punishments for this offence beginning
with a fine and extending to a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years.
The custodial threshold will generally be crossed where any of the factors
listed above are present, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     if
active steps were taken to conceal the offence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     if
the offender played a major role in the commission of the offence
as opposed to a minor or merely ancillary role;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     if
the offence was committed as part of a commercial enterprise that
was active in the commission of such crimes as opposed to being a
one-off incident;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_d"></a>(d)     if
the offender was motivated by profit, in which case a fine should
additionally be imposed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_e"></a>(e)     if
the offender has recruited others (beside the “spouse”) in the course
of committing the offence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_f"></a>(f)     if
there has been any exploitation or pressure applied to any of the
participants involved in the commission of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Each
of these factors may vary in severity but on the face of it, I would regard
items (c) and (f) above as seriously aggravating considerations
that in themselves may warrant a significantly longer term of imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the sentencing
considerations to the Appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I
have outlined six aggravating factors that are relevant to the offence of
arranging or assisting in the arrangement of a marriage of convenience.
I reiterate that these are non-exhaustive and further, that it goes
without saying that all the circumstances of the case will have
to be balanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In
this case, I note that there were no factors agitating for an unusually
stiff sentence. This was a one-off incident committed to facilitate a
sibling’s desire to help a friend. The Appellant’s mode of arrangement
was basic. It is true that she initiated the idea of securing a
marriage of convenience, approached Peer Ali and finally brought
Gagandeep to the solemnisation venue. But none of this detracted
from the fact that she was essentially following through on a scheme
to help her brother’s friend. More importantly these factors went
to the question of her role in this incident, to which I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I
had no difficulty accepting as a matter of principle, the DJ’s finding that
the Appellant’s role was significant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
question, having regard to the whole range of sentencing options available,
was what would be the appropriate sentence to reflect the Appellant’s
overall level of culpability? In my judgment the aggravating considerations
in this case were the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
Appellant initiated and suggested that Gagandeep enter into a marriage
of convenience. She was initially approached for help in securing
a job for him but she opted for a wholly unwise and illegal course
(see [58(b)] above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_b"></a>(b)     She
recruited Peer Ali and paid him a considerable sum knowing that
he would involve another person, who as it eventually turned out
was the “spouse”, Norhayati (see [58(e)] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As
against this, there appears to have been no exploitation of any
of the parties. Moreover, as I have noted, this was a one-off incident
and the offence was committed by the Appellant at least, not for
any gain but in an ill-conceived attempt to accede to her brother’s
request for assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In
the circumstances, the aggravating factors present were sufficient to
cross the threshold warranting a custodial sentence. However, I
did not think that the circumstances were so exceptional as to call
for the imposition of a sentence longer than six months, having
regard to the fact that the range extended to a term of imprisonment
of up to 10 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It
would have been apparent from the above that there were no relevant
mitigating factors that operated in favour of the Appellant. The Appellant’s
counsel, Mr S K Kumar, submitted that the medical report obtained
by the Appellant showed that she suffered from depression, and that
she had only agreed to arrange the marriage of convenience because she
felt obliged to assist her brother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In
my judgment there was no merit in this at all. In the first place,
the medical report read more like a fact-finding report than a professional medical
opinion. The portion dealing with the Appellant’s supposed medical
condition was much briefer than the lengthy portion where the doctor
set out the background facts, seemingly in an attempt to give the reader
of the report a detailed account of what factually transpired in
terms that were exceedingly favourable to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Moreover,
not only was the report patently lacking in objectivity, it was
plainly erroneous in stating that the Appellant had been “used in
a marriage for visa scam without her knowledge.” This was simply
incorrect. The Appellant knew what she was doing. Either the doctor
was told of the wrong facts and had not bothered to check them even
cursorily or he had misunderstood the facts. On either basis it
militated against any weight being given to the medical report.
I digress to repeat the observation that experts owe their duty
first and foremost to the court and not to the client who pays their
fee. The doctor in this case did himself no credit because he did
not give me the sense that he had even a basic conception of the responsibility
he owed the court when he put himself forward as an expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Moreover,
the report concluded that depression set in on the Appellant “after
her arrest”. In so far as the medical report was tendered for the
purposes of mitigation, I did not see how any depression after the offence
could mitigate the Appellant’s culpability. As I pointed out to
Mr Kumar in the course of arguments, many offenders who have been apprehended
and face the prospect of a term of imprisonment for breaking the
law may feel depressed. This cannot possibly be a mitigating consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing precedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For
completeness, I should comment on the sentencing precedents briefly
because the DJ placed considerable reliance on the sentence of nine months’
imprisonment that was imposed on Peer Ali as well as the other sentencing
precedents provided by the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As
regards Peer Ali, although he was party to the same transaction
as the Appellant, the principle of parity of sentencing ought not
to be applied blindly, without regard to the degree of culpability
of each individual offender in committing the offending acts. I
emphasised this recently in <em>Public Prosecutor
v Marzuki bin Ahmad and another appeal</em> [2014] SGHC 166
at [45].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     To
the extent that Ms Chionh pressed me to apply the principle of parity
in this case, I disagreed that this was appropriate in the present circumstances.
What distinguished Peer Ali from the Appellant was that Peer Ali’s
participation in the criminal endeavour was driven purely by monetary
gain which, at least relative to the Appellant’s motivation, reflected
a greater degree of culpability. As mentioned above at [51] to [52], a
harsher sentence is warranted where monetary profit is the motivation
for the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As
for the other sentencing precedents, it is important to divide them into
two groups. The first group comprises cases decided prior to the enactment
of s 57C of the Act. In the light of the differences between the regime
then and the regime now under s 57C (see [32]–[35] above), it goes without
saying that the sentencing precedents under the old regime cannot be
of assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As
to the second group of cases, namely, those prosecuted under s 57C(2)
of the Act, aside from the case involving Peer Ali, there were six others
in the list of precedents included in Ms Chionh’s written submissions.
Of the six, the arrangers in four were sentenced to nine months’
imprisonment and the remaining two to 10 months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I
note that the four arrangers sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment
had profited from the endeavour while the two arrangers sentenced
to 10 months’ imprisonment do not appear from the Statement of Facts
to have so profited. However, as the decisions in the latter two
cases are unreported, and no judgment of the district court is available,
it would be inappropriate for me to rely on the decisions in those
cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The
only case amongst the six that is reported is <em>Public
Prosecutor v Tay Szu </em><em>Khee</em> [2014]
SGDC 52 where the arranger was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment.
There, the arranger who recruited one other person (aside from the
“spouse”) was involved in the operational aspects of the arrangement
and made a profit of $2,000 from his crime. In my view, applying
the sentencing considerations that I have set out above, the fact that
the offender in that case committed the offence solely for profit distinguished
that case from the present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     For
these reasons, I allowed the appeal and set aside the DJ’s sentence of
eight months’ imprisonment in favour of a term of imprisonment of
six months.</p>
