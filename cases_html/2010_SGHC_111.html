        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal was in respect of the decision of an
                    Assistant Registrar (“AR”) on 4 September 2009 to stay
                    proceedings in an action commenced by the plaintiff, Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd
                    (“SJE”), a Singapore company, against the defendant, Hwang Jae Woo
                    (“Hwang”), on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>. I dismissed SJE’s appeal and now give the
                    grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       One Seung Yong Chung (“Seung”)
                    alleged that he was the majority shareholder of SJE and substantive shareholder
                    of Sun Jin Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd (“SJM”), a company incorporated
                    in Malaysia, and under SJE’s control. SJM was the main contractor of two
                    building projects in the Maldives (“the projects”). It was
                    SJE’s case that Hwang was one of its employees seconded to SJM for the
                    purpose of the projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       SJE claimed that Hwang had acted in breach of
                    his duty to it and caused it loss. As such, it instituted an action in Singapore
                    to recoup those losses, which were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     a payment of US$20,470.59 to a
                        fictitious company, which was authorized by Hwang;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     a payment of US$175,000 as alleged
                        commission to one Ahmed Shahid (“Shahid”), which was
                        authorized by Hwang in breach of his authority;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     a payment of US$101,982.37, of which $75,000 was
                        a bonus to SJE’s former employee, Son Chang Ju (“Son”),
                        which was authorized by Hwang. The balance was for Son’s arrears for
                        salary and compensation for termination of services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In
                    addition to the above, SJE also sought to recover US$50,000 allegedly lent to
                    Hwang. SJE also mentioned a sum of US$500,000 that the Maldivian courts had
                    ordered SJM to pay to Hwang in Maldivian Suit No 733/MC/2008 (“the profit
                    suit”), but this was not the subject of SJE’s Singapore
                    proceedings. It was mentioned as background information in order to set the
                    context of a number of disputes involving Hwang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Hwang applied, inter alia, to stay the Singapore
                    proceedings in favour of the Maldives. He accepted that the stay application did
                    not extend to the alleged loan of US$50,000, which should be dealt with by the
                    Singapore court. On the other hand, SJE accepted that it would not pursue its
                    claim for the US$20,470.59 in Singapore. Therefore, the stay application
                    ultimately only involved the payments Hwang had authorised to Shahid and
                    Son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The issues in this appeal were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Hwang was precluded from
                        applying for a stay on the grounds of <em>forum non
                            conveniens</em> by reason of his delay in making the application
                        and, if not</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether a stay should be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Hwang was precluded from applying for a stay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The first issue called for my consideration of
                    steps taken by both parties in the Singapore proceedings. The chronology of
                    events was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The writ was served on Hwang
                        personally in Singapore on 5 May 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Hwang’s appearance was filed on 7 May
                        2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     Hwang’s defence was due on 27 May 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     On 27 May 2009, Hwang’s
                        solicitors wrote to SJE’s solicitors, seeking a two week extension for
                        the filing of his defence and to consider any necessary applications to be
                        made;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     On
                        2 June 2009, SJE’s solicitors faxed and posted a letter to
                        Hwang’s solicitors, giving them 48 hours’ notice to file the
                        defence. However, Hwang’s solicitors claimed that they received the
                        hard copy only on 3 June 2009 and not the fax of 2 June
                        2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_f"></a>(f)     On
                        4 June 2009, Hwang’s solicitors wrote seeking a further extension
                        of time till the next day to file the defence. They added that their client
                        would be taking out an application to strike out parts of the claim and/or
                        for the action to be stayed in favour of litigation in the Maldives on the
                        ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. On that basis,
                        they asked whether Hwang would be allowed to withhold filing the defence
                        pending the final disposition of the intended
                    applications;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_g"></a>(g)     On the
                        same day, <em>ie</em>, 4 June 2009, Hwang’s
                        solicitors wrote a further fax confirming SJE’s solicitors’ oral
                        agreement to extend time for the filing of the defence to Friday,
                        5 June 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_h"></a>(h)     Hwang’s defence was filed on 8 June
                    2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_i"></a>(i)     SJE filed its
                        reply on 22 June 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_j"></a>(j)     Hwang filed his amended defence on 6 July 2009; and
                        finally</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_k"></a>(k)     Hwang
                        only filed his stay application on 31 July 2009, which was one month
                        and three weeks after the extended deadline to file the defence, <em>ie</em> 5 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same
                    application, he invoked the Court’s jurisdiction to strike out the action
                    pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    2006 Rev Ed)(“Rules”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the course of argument, SJE raised a
                    preliminary point<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, namely
                    whether Hwang’s application for a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> should be allowed in light of O 12
                    r 7(2) of the Rules because the application for a stay of proceedings was
                    filed late.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       O 12 r 7(2) of the Rules provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A defendant who wishes to contend that the Court should not assume
                        jurisdiction over the action on the ground that Singapore is not the proper
                        forum for the dispute shall enter an appearance <em>and,
                            within the time limited for serving a defence, apply to Court for an
                            order staying the proceedings</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Order 12 Rule 7(2) was considered in
                        <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung and others</em>
                    [2009] SGCA 62 (“<em>Chan</em>”).
                    There, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) held that while the filing of a
                    defence might disentitle a defendant from contesting the court’s
                    jurisdiction, this step did not preclude a defendant from applying for a stay on
                    the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In that case,
                    the appellant commenced three suits in Malaysia against the trustees of an
                    estate for breach of their duties. Subsequently, the appellant began an action
                    in Singapore against the respondent for defamation, and the respondents filed
                    their defence, claiming justification. The appellant applied in the Malaysian
                    courts to stay the first of the three Malaysian suits pending the disposal of
                    the Singapore action. That application was dismissed and the respondents then
                    sought to stay the Singapore proceedings pending the outcome of the Malaysian
                    proceedings. The issue which then arose and which was relevant to this case
                    before me was whether the respondents, having taken steps in the Singapore
                    proceedings, were barred from seeking a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Chan</em>, the CA
                    held at [22] that although the respondents’ application for a stay was
                    made late and only after it had taken steps in the proceedings by filing their
                    defence, this did not bar them from applying for a stay <em>per
                        se</em>. The test was whether there was any prejudice to the appellant
                    which could not be compensated by costs. Since there was none, the late
                    application did not in itself preclude the stay application. On the facts there,
                    the CA upheld the decision of the High Court to grant a stay of the Singapore
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Applying the decision in <em>Chan</em> to the present case, Hwang was not precluded from applying
                    for a stay although he had taken steps in the proceedings by filing and amending
                    his defence and even though his application for a stay of proceedings included
                    an alternative prayer to strike out the action. There was no prejudice to SJE
                    which could not be compensated by costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     However, I would add that I have reservations
                    about the decision of the CA in <em>Chan</em>. The CA had
                    referred to the case of <em>The “Tokai
                        Maru”</em> 1998 2 SLR(R) 646 (“<em>Tokai Maru”</em>) and noted that a party should not be
                    precluded from presenting his case unless there was prejudice which could not be
                    compensated by costs. However, <em>Tokai Maru</em> was not
                    a case in which a defendant had filed his stay application late. In that case,
                    the party was filing an affidavit of evidence-in-chief late and the court was
                    loath to preclude that party from presenting its case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In resisting an application for a stay of
                    proceedings, a plaintiff is not seeking to preclude a defendant from presenting
                    his case. On the contrary, the plaintiff is suggesting that the defendant should
                    do so but that he should do so <em>in
                    Singapore</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Furthermore, the purpose of O 12
                    r 7(2) is to ensure that a defendant files his application for a stay as
                    soon as possible and before taking a step in the proceedings, usually by filing
                    the defence. It is expressly stated in O 12 r 7(2) that a defendant
                    should apply for a stay within the time limited for serving a defence. It
                    implicitly recognises that the filing of a defence is incongruous with the
                    application for a stay. The rationale for the application for a stay is that the
                    merits of the dispute should be litigated elsewhere; a defence addresses the
                    merits of the dispute. Therefore, once a stay application is filed and served,
                    it should be combined with an alternative prayer for an extension of time to
                    file the defence pending the outcome of the final resolution of the stay
                    application, including resolution by way of appeal. Furthermore, a plaintiff
                    should refrain from insisting that the defendant file his defence once the stay
                    application is served. I have mentioned this procedure before. If it is really
                    necessary to file a protective defence to avoid judgment in default of defence
                    then the defence should specifically state that it is filed without prejudice to
                    the stay application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     If the test is merely one of prejudice, it may
                    lead to unsatisfactory results. For example, a defence may well trigger a slew
                    of applications including summary judgment, further and better particulars or
                    discovery. Should any or all of these steps be undertaken only for the plaintiff
                    to subsequently encounter an application for a stay? I do not think
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In my view, the threshold for granting an
                    extension of time should not primarily or solely be whether the plaintiff has
                    suffered prejudice which cannot be compensated by costs. This places an unfair
                    burden on the plaintiff to show good reasons why a defendant should not be
                    allowed to make his application for a stay late. The burden should be on the
                    party who is making the late application to adduce good reasons to show why he
                    should be allowed to make his application although he is out of
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The main reason for the delay in the present
                    case was that Hwang’s solicitors were trying to get a copy of the Shahid
                    judgment and were unable to get a legal opinion from a Maldivian lawyer due to
                    parliament elections in May 2009. The wait for a copy of the Shahid judgment was
                    an unacceptable reason as Hwang nevertheless eventually filed the stay
                    application without the judgment attached. It was obtained thereafter. The
                    second part of the explanation was similarly unconvincing as Hwang’s
                    solicitors managed to meet with a Maldivian lawyer during a trip to the Maldives
                    from 23 to 26 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It appeared to me that the reality was that
                    Hwang’s solicitors did not realise that the stay application had to be
                    filed as soon as possible and before filing the defence. Had they realised this
                    and if there were genuine reasons why they could not do so promptly, then they
                    should have applied for an extension of time to file the stay application as
                    well as to defer the filing of the defence pending the outcome of the stay
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I wish to make another observation. The
                    application to strike out the action should not have been filed together with
                    the stay application unless Hwang did not intend to appeal an unsuccessful
                    application for a stay. If the court refused the application for a stay of
                    proceedings and proceeded with the application for striking out which then
                    proved unsuccessful, a question would arise as to whether Hwang could still
                    appeal on the unsuccessful stay application after having already asked the court
                    to rule on the application to strike out. If the test remained one of prejudice
                    then arguably he could still appeal for a stay even if he was unsuccessful in a
                    strike out application. In my view, that would not be the correct
                    position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Thus, an application for a stay of proceedings
                    should be exhausted first and through all avenues of appeal before taking
                    another step in the proceedings - whether it be to file a defence or to apply
                    for an order to strike the action out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the stay should be granted on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is trite law that the most appropriate
                    forum is that with which the dispute has the most real and substantial
                    connection, <em>ie</em>, the place “in which the
                    case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the
                    ends of justice”: <em>per</em> Lord Goff in
                        <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em>
                    [1987] 1 AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”), at 476.</p>

                    (“Chao JA”) explained that the test should be applied in the
                    following manner, at [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The first stage is for the court to determine whether, <em>prima facie</em>, there is some other available forum,
                        having competent jurisdiction, which is more appropriate for the trial of
                        the action. The legal burden of showing that rests on the defendant. In
                        determining that issue the court will look to see what factors there are
                        which point in the direction of another forum as being the forum with which
                        the action has the most real and substantial connection, <em>eg</em> availability of witnesses, the convenience or expenses of
                        having a trial in a particular forum, the law governing the transaction and
                        the places where the parties reside or carry on business. Unless there is
                        clearly another more appropriate available forum, a stay will ordinarily be
                        refused. If the court concludes that there is such a more appropriate forum,
                        it will ordinarily grant a stay unless, in the words of Lord Goff, 'there
                        are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should
                        nevertheless not be granted. In this inquiry the court will consider all the
                        circumstances of the case, including circumstances which go beyond those
                        taken into account when considering connecting factors with other
                        jurisdictions' ... [In the second stage,] all circumstances must be taken
                        into account, including those taken into account in determining the question
                        of the more appropriate forum. However, in this stage of the inquiry the
                        burden shifts to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First stage of the Spiliada test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In determining the factors relevant at the
                    first stage, the CA in <em>Good Earth Agricultural Co Ltd v Novus
                        International Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 711 held as
                    follows at [10] :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The main factors that are relevant at the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test ("Stage 1") include the
                        following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)   general connecting factors;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)   the jurisdiction in which the tort (or breach of
                        contract) occurred; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)   the choice of law (whether the choice of law in the
                        contract was exclusive and if not, which law should be applied in the
                        claims)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     SJE’s case was that Hwang failed to
                    discharge the burden of proving that the Maldives was clearly and distinctly a
                    more appropriate forum than Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Employment Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Hwang’s employment contract should be
                    the first general connecting factor to be considered. While SJE contended that
                    its employment of Hwang was a factor connecting its claims to Singapore, Hwang
                    claimed that he was in fact SJM’s employee and not SJE’s
                    employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In a letter dated 15 August 2006, Seung
                    appointed Hwang as acting director “for all projects sited at the
                    Maldives”. The circumstances under which this letter was issued were
                    unclear as the letter was apparently back-dated and SJE had no projects in the
                    Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There was also a second letter dated
                    15 August 2006, under which SJM’s executive director, Mr Mohd Al
                    Johari (“Johari”), appointed Hwang as acting director “for
                    all projects sited in the Maldives”. Hwang also referred to a resolution
                    of SJM’s Board of Directors dated 3 May 2007, which stated that SJM
                    would pay him 30% profit or US$500,000 if he was removed from his position as
                    project manager before the completion of the project. These documents appeared
                    to suggest that Hwang was employed by SJM. SJE, however, disputed their
                    authenticity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Much was made by the parties as to whether SJE
                    or SJM was Hwang’s employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     SJE relied on, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the fact that on 23 November 2006 it had applied for
                    an employment pass for Hwang to work in Singapore and had supported Hwang in his
                    application for permanent residence for himself and his family in Singapore. SJE
                    paid Hwang’s salary and contributed to his Central Provident Fund account
                    after he became a permanent resident. The salary was paid through SJE’s
                    bank account with Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Limited in Male, the Maldives, or
                    deposited through Hwang’s bank account in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the other hand, Hwang pointed to the work
                    permit for him to work in the Maldives. This was issued for SJM and not SJE.
                    When Hwang’s employment was terminated, SJM placed an advertisement in a
                    local newspaper in the Maldives to announce that he ceased to have any authority
                    or discretion whatsoever to act on SJM’s behalf. Hwang worked in the
                    Maldives. He also relied on the fact that, in the profit suit, the Maldivian
                    Court had found that SJM was Hwang’s employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It seemed to me that the Maldivian Court had
                    relied on documents issued in the Maldives and Hwang’s work there to the
                    exclusion of documents issued in Singapore to conclude that Hwang’s
                    employer was SJM and not SJE. Yet both sets of documents could be considered
                    together and it was not necessary to consider one set to the exclusion of the
                    other. When considered together, my tentative view was that Hwang was employed
                    by SJE but seconded by them to work for SJM in the Maldives. In this respect,
                    Hwang owed a duty to both SJE and SJM to act honestly and diligently. However,
                    as he was seconded to work for SJM, he was authorised to act on its behalf. It
                    was not open to SJM to avoid all obligations accepted by Hwang on its behalf
                    just because SJE was Hwang’s employer. The actions of Hwang on behalf of
                    SJM bound SJM provided Hwang acted within his authority and honestly. That would
                    be the law in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is interesting to note also that in a
                    profile of a company known as “Creative Management and Engineering Pte
                    Ltd” (“Creative”), Hwang was referred to as a project
                    director of SJE (not SJM) for projects in the Maldives. Creative is
                    Hwang’s company in Singapore which was apparently established after his
                    services in the Maldives were terminated by SJM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Nonetheless, the emphasis placed by each side
                    on the identity of Hwang’s employer was out of proportion to its
                    significance in the stay application. This was only one of the connecting
                    factors. The identity of Hwang’s employer may be more determinative for
                    the purposes of the striking out action, but that was not the application I was
                    deciding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Another connecting factor was that Hwang was
                    working for SJM in the Maldives. Hwang relied on <em>Koh Kay Yew
                        v Inno-Pacific Holdings Pte Ltd</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 148
                        (“<em>Koh Kay Yew”</em>), to support his
                    assertion that the Maldives was the natural forum for the resolution of the
                    disputes. In that case, a Singapore company which hired a Singaporean resident
                    in California to provide it with business services terminated his employment
                    without notice. The employee sued the employer in California. The
                    employer’s attempt to stay the proceedings in California on the ground of
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em> was dismissed by the
                    California courts. The applicant then applied to the Singapore courts for a
                    declaration that Singapore was the natural and proper forum for the
                    determination of the matter and for an injunction to restrain the respondent
                    from taking any further steps in the Californian action. The CA considered the
                    terms of the employment contract to ascertain whether the contract was more
                    closely connected with Singapore or the United States. The fact that the
                    employee was paid $10,000 per month and that the employer contributed CPF
                    pointed to Singapore. On the other hand, the contract was made in and was to be
                    performed in the US; the applicable law was Californian law; and the employment
                    was terminated in the US. Furthermore, the California courts could exercise
                    personal jurisdiction over the applicants. It was thus held that the more
                    appropriate forum was California and the employer’s application was
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Admittedly, the present case was not exactly
                    the same as <em>Koh Kay Yew</em>. Unlike <em>Koh Kay Yew</em>, where the employment contract was made in the US,
                    the employment contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was allegedly
                    made in Singapore and the plaintiff claimed that Singapore law governed the
                    contract. All the same, Hwang had performed his contract in the Maldives, the
                    alleged breaches were committed there, and his employment was terminated there.
                    My tentative view was that Maldivian law was probably the governing law of the
                    disputes in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Availability of witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     SJE argued that as the issue in this case
                    concerned the authority of Hwang, the only material witnesses were SJE’s
                    managing director, Seung, SJM’s executive director, Johari, and Hwang.
                    Seung was resident in Singapore, Johari in Malaysia, and Hwang was a permanent
                    resident of Singapore. However, Hwang claimed that he had other relevant
                    witnesses in the Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     With regard to SJE’s claim of
                    US$175,000.00 which concerned the alleged commission to Shahid, Hwang argued
                    that Shahid was a key witness who could testify that Seung had negotiated
                    directly with the latter, and that Chung had agreed to pay Shahid US$175,000 for
                    his services. In view of this, SJE’s contention that the evidence of
                    Shahid would be irrelevant to the question of whether Hwang could authorize the
                    payment to him was not tenable. I also accepted Hwang’s assertion that the
                    testimony of Shahid would be relevant in order to elucidate the circumstances
                    surrounding the letter of payment, as well as the type of services he performed
                    for SJM. Hence, I was of the view that Shahid was a key witness in SJE’s
                    claim of US$175,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     With regard to SJE’s claim for
                    US$101,982.37, of which $75,000 was a bonus to Son, SJE also argued that this
                    was authorized by Hwang in breach of his authority. I was informed by counsel
                    that Son was working in the Maldives but was resident in Singapore. It appeared
                    to be common ground that Son was prepared to give his evidence in either the
                    Maldives or Singapore. However, Hwang alleged that Shahid was present at a
                    meeting between Seung and Hwang when Son’s bonus was discussed and Seung
                    had agreed to the same. One Ibrahim Gahir (“Gahir”) was allegedly
                    also present. Both Shahid and Gahir were residents of the Maldives and were not
                    prepared to come to Singapore to assist Hwang although SJE suggested that these
                    witnesses were a contrived strategy to support the stay application. Apparently,
                    Gahir is, according to SJE, Shahid’s brother-in-law. Be that as it may, I
                    could not say at this stage that the Maldivian witnesses required by Hwang were
                    contrived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Hwang asserted that the Maldives was the more
                    appropriate forum for the dispute because his Maldivian witnesses were unwilling
                    to assist him in the Singapore proceedings but were compellable in the Maldives
                    to give evidence. This was based on the opinion of Hussein Siraj, Hwang’s
                    expert on Maldivian law. In contrast, Aishath Azima Shakoor
                    (“Aishath”), SJE’s expert on Maldivian law stated that
                    witnesses were not compellable by the Maldivian Courts. She added that the Civil
                    Court of the Maldives would not reject any request from the Singapore High Court
                    to facilitate the taking of evidence of a willing witness via video linkage.
                    However, this was inapplicable as Hwang alleged that the Maldivian witnesses
                    were unwilling witnesses. As a result of these two conflicting opinions, the
                    position on compellability of witnesses in the Maldives was not entirely clear
                    to me. Even if they were not compellable, I was of the view that Hwang had a
                    better chance of obtaining the assistance of the Maldivian witnesses if the case
                    was heard in the Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Thus, the need for the evidence of witnesses
                    in the Maldives for both claims was another reason in favour of staying
                    proceedings in the Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the first stage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On balance, Hwang had succeeded in proving
                    that there were more connecting factors with the Maldives than with Singapore
                    and the Maldives was the more appropriate forum for the litigation in question.
                    SJE had to prove that despite this, the action should not be stayed. This
                    involved a consideration of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Stage of Spiliada</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of
                        <em>Spiliada</em> involved considering all factors when
                    determining which forum is more appropriate. In <em>Peters Roger
                        May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 381,
                    V K Rajah J observed at [20]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A court has to take into account an entire multitude of factors
                        in balancing the competing interests. The weightage accorded to a particular
                        factor varies in different cases and the ultimate appraisal ought to reflect
                        the exigencies dictated by the factual matrix. Copious citations of
                        precedents and <em>dicta</em> are usually of little
                        assistance and may in reality serve to cloud rather than elucidate the
                        applicable principles…. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Moreover, in <em>PT
                        Hutan</em>, Chao JA aptly stated at [17] that the ultimate
                    question remains the same, which is “where should the case be suitably
                    tried having regard to the interest of the parties and the ends of
                    justice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">No available forum in the Maldives</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     SJE asserted that there was no available forum
                    in the Maldives to resolve its claims and that it would have been unfairly
                    prejudiced if the action was stayed. Aishath, opined that as Hwang was employed
                    under a contract governed by the laws of Singapore (which she assumed to be the
                    case), “such a contract of employment was not enforceable in the Courts
                    of the Maldives”. However, Aishath’s concern appeared to be
                    contradicted by SJE’s other expert, Shaaheen Hameed
                    (“Hameed”), who stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, even if the present case is filed in the Maldivian Courts, it
                        is most likely that the Maldivian Courts will ignore the applicability of
                        Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     This statement suggested that Maldivian law,
                    instead of Singapore law would be applied and not that SJE had no recourse in
                    the Maldives. Aishath appeared to have accepted this in her last opinion of
                    4 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Unfair prejudice due to prior rulings of Maldivian Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     SJE alleged that in the profit suit, the
                    Maldivian Court had already ruled that Hwang was employed by SJM. Thus, it
                    contended that its case would not get off the ground as it would be unfairly
                    prejudiced by this prior ruling and had no standing to sue Hwang in the
                    Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On the other hand, Hwang wanted the benefit of
                    the court ruling. The fact that there was a ruling which appeared to favour
                    Hwang, regarding the point of who his employer was, seemed in my view to be a
                    neutral factor. SJE wanted to avoid that ruling and Hwang wanted to rely on
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In any event, SJE was not yet a party to
                    proceedings in the Maldives and it would be open to another Maldivian court to
                    take a different view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     More importantly, it should be a simple matter
                    for SJM to be added as a co-plaintiff in a Maldivian suit. Indeed, in the
                    Singapore proceedings, SJE made it clear that it might add SJM as a
                    co-plaintiff. There was no suggestion that this could not be done in the
                    Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Law in the Maldives not as developed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     SJE also asserted that Singapore was the more
                    appropriate forum as the law was more developed here. This was based on
                    Aishath’s opinion that causes of action based on the law of tort, trust
                    and agency are not available in the Maldivian courts, though she accepted that
                    contract law for breach of employment would be available. Furthermore, Hameed
                    stated that he was unaware of judicial precedents establishing fiduciary duties
                    of directors in the Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In my view, a plaintiff cannot argue that a
                    forum is appropriate simply because it offers it more causes of action. This
                    would lead to plaintiffs engaging in forum shopping to find the jurisdiction
                    with the causes of action most advantageous to them. As for judicial precedents,
                    it is for the Maldivian courts to develop their precedents and jurisprudence. In
                    addition, the importance of international comity cannot be overlooked. In
                        <em>The Hung Vuong-2</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 11,
                    Chao JA stated at [27] that it is not for the courts in Singapore to pass
                    judgment on the competence or independence of the judiciary of another country
                    and that comity between nations would be gravely undermined if such a wholly
                    invidious pursuit is embarked upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It was also important to note that for all the
                    allegations about the lack of development of the law in the Maldives, SJE did
                    not suggest that there would be no recourse in the Maldives whatsoever against
                    Hwang if SJE (or SJM) managed to establish that Hwang acted without authority by
                    authorizing the payments in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     For the reasons stated above, the appeal was
                    dismissed with costs.</p>
