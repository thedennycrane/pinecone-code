</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 6 December 2018, following the decision in <span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>and the reasons therein, the Assistant Registrar dismissed the Appellant’s application. The Appellant appealed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Malayan Banking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Before detailing the parties’ arguments, it is helpful to summarise the decisions. In this regard, <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>appears to be the first local case which dealt squarely with the issue at hand (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) (“Tay JC”) held that a WSS against immovable property could not be used to enforce a judgment against a debtor who was one of two or more joint tenants of that property (<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>at [24]). Tay JC reasoned that the interest of the judgment debtor attachable under a WSS must surely be a distinct and identifiable one, and since a joint tenant holds no distinct and identifiable share in land while the joint tenancy subsists, a WSS cannot attach to the interest of a joint tenant unless it concomitantly severs the joint tenancy (<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Tay JC did not think that a WSS concomitantly severs a joint tenancy. While he acknowledged the Court of Appeal’s (“CA”) observation in <span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah and another </span>[1987] SLR(R) 702 (“<span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu</span>”) at [39] that “[i]n principle, there is no reason why a court order may not have such an effect [of severing a joint tenancy]”, Tay JC observed that a WSS against land does not necessarily result in its sale. Indeed, even after a WSS over land is granted, the sale may be postponed or subsequently withdrawn (<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>at [17]; see Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) O 47 rr 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Accordingly, he viewed that “it would be creating a fine mess to hold that a WSS when registered severs a joint tenancy” since the WSS may not be given full effect. In such instances, it would then be unclear whether the joint tenants revert back to being joint tenants (<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>at [18]). Tay JC also observed that his holding accorded with the legal position in Canada that the delivery of a writ of execution does not by itself amount to severance (<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>at [19]–[20]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decisions in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Kien</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The holding in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>remained undisputed locally for almost 20 years, until 2015 when Edmund Leow JC (“Leow JC”) held in <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span> that a joint tenant’s interest in property was exigible to a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In coming to his decision, Leow JC observed that severance of a joint tenancy into undivided shares was <span class="font-italic">not </span>a prerequisite for a WSS to be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land, because while a joint tenant “does not have an undivided share of the land for as long as the joint tenancy subsists, the joint tenant has an interest in land which is identifiable and capable of being determined”. Hence, when the property is sold, the joint tenant will be entitled to his share of the property (<span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee </span>at [11]–[12]). Leow JC also compared the WSS to a receivership (at [14]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he challenge of having to particularise the exact interest that the judgment creditor is entitled to similarly arises in the appointment of a receiver, which was the alternative method of enforcing a judgment debt suggested in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>… [However,] even if a receiver were to be appointed, the receiver cannot receive more rent and profit than what the joint tenant is entitled to, and hence his exact “share” of the joint tenancy has to be determined. It is difficult to see why the situation involving a WSS of a joint tenant’s interest in the property should be any different.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Leow JC’s proposition, as Chua Lee Ming J (“Chua J”) observed shortly after in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>at [31],  was that “although a joint tenant does not have an undivided share, his interest can be seized under a WSS because it will be converted into an undivided share when the joint tenancy is <span class="font-italic">subsequently </span>severed” [emphasis in original] (“Leow JC’s proposition”). Leow JC found further support for his conclusion from how other Commonwealth jurisdictions have proceeded on the assumption that a joint tenant’s interest is exigible to a writ of execution over land (<span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee </span>at [15]–[16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 However, Chua J disagreed with Leow JC’s proposition because it focused “not on what is being seized when the WSS is issued but on what can<span class="font-italic"> </span>be seized <span class="font-italic">subsequently </span>upon severance of the joint tenancy” (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>at [32]). This presupposes that until the joint tenancy is severed, there is nothing for the WSS to latch onto. In Chua J’s view, before the court makes an order for a WSS, it must be satisfied that there is an interest under the WSS that is capable of being seized. It cannot be an answer to say that upon a <span class="font-italic">subsequent </span>severance (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>through a sale of the property), the joint tenant’s interest will be converted into that of a tenant in common which is capable of being seized under a WSS (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Therefore, Chua J considered the decision in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>to be good law in Singapore, and held that a WSS cannot attach to a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 A natural corollary of his decision was that, like Tay JC, Chua J held that a WSS order <span class="font-italic">does not </span>concomitantly sever the joint tenancy (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>at [29]), such that the WSS has something to latch onto. If this view is adopted, a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property would not be exigible to a WSS.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Peter Low</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In <span class="font-italic">Peter Low, </span>Pang Khang Chau JC (“Pang JC”) embarked on a comprehensive review of the history of the WSS in Singapore and the position in other Commonwealth jurisdictions before deciding that a WSS can be enforced against a joint tenant’s interest in land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The salient points of the <span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>decision are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In England, money judgments could be executed against the interest of a joint tenant in land since at least the 17th century through writs of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span> (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [17]–[20]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Writs of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>were replaced by the WSS in Singapore through the Straits Settlement Civil Procedure Ordinance 1878 (Ordinance No 5 of 1878) (“CPO 1878”). In subsequent legislation that replaced the CPO 1878, the interest of a joint tenant in land was never expressly excluded from the reach of the WSS. Indeed, the draftsman of the Land Titles Ordinance 1956 (Ordinance No 21 of 1956) (“LTO”) that eventually became the current Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”), noted in his Commentary (John Baalman, <span class="font-italic">The Singapore Torrens System – Being a Commentary on the Land Titles Ordinance, 1956 of the State of Singapore </span>(The Government of the State of Singapore, 1961) (“Baalman’s Commentary”) at p 218) that the LTO was not intended to render inapplicable Australian decisions which held that a joint tenant’s interest could be taken under a writ. Australian jurisprudence was persuasive given that the LTA was derived from the Australian Torrens system (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [22]–[35]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In every jurisdiction surveyed by Pang JC (which included England, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and a number of Caribbean jurisdictions), a joint tenant’s interest in land could be taken in execution of money judgments (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [37]–[55]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Most importantly, in response to the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>that disallowed the attachment of a WSS on a joint tenant’s interest as a joint tenant holds “no distinct and identifiable interest in land”, Pang JC noted at [77] of his judgment, after surveying Australian authorities, that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he court is not compelled to focus only on one aspect [of a joint tenancy] (that a joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenant but nothing by himself) to the exclusion of the other equally valid aspect (<span class="font-italic">that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenants</span>). Once both aspects of joint tenancy are given weight to:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) it will no longer appear incompatible with the nature of the joint tenancy to hold that a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a WSS; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the seizure of a joint tenant’s interest in land by WSS will also need not be seen as a seizure of the other joint tenant’s interest – while a WSS would prevent the debtor-joint tenant from dealing with his interest, with the consequence that the other joint tenant would not be able to join the debtor-joint tenant in disposing of the whole property together, the other joint tenant remains free to deal with his aliquot share independently of the debtor-joint tenant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-left">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]<br/></div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">Since a joint tenant can sever the joint tenancy without the prior consent of the other joint tenant(s), a joint tenant’s interest is sufficiently distinct and identifiable to be seized by a WSS (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [88]).

</div> judgment was obtained by the plaintiff against one Margaret Pool, who held the subject plot of land in joint tenancy with her sister, Frances Pool. The judgment was obtained in 1592. On 24 May 1595, Margaret released all her estate and right in the said land to Frances, and therefore ceased to be a joint tenant to the land. Thereafter, on 27 June 1595, the plaintiff sought execution of the judgment by a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. It was held that Margaret’s share in the land was charged to the plaintiff’s execution once he had obtained a judgment against her, and that her act of transferring her interest in the land to Frances could not defeat the plaintiff’s execution. Accordingly, notwithstanding the prior transfer, the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span> attached to Margaret’s half share in the land in satisfaction of the judgment debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 While the issue of Margaret’s joint tenancy was not considered by the court, it is implicit in the judgment that the law of England as it stood when the case was decided allowed a joint tenant’s interest in land to be taken in execution of a judgment by a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In this regard, the Appellant argued that <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case </span>is more akin to the principle enshrined in ss 98–100 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”), which allows the court to invalidate an unfair preference or undervalue transaction and restore the parties’ position to what it would have been but for the transaction.

</div> This is similar in effect to what was done in <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case</span>, where the court disregarded Margaret’s transfer of her interest in the land to ensure that the plaintiff could enforce the judgment against her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 However, even if I accept that <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case </span>reflects the principle enshrined in the Bankruptcy Act, this would mean that the transfer by Margaret was undone and Margaret was regarded as a joint tenant of the land for enforcement purposes. If this were the case, the fact that the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case </span>could attach the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>to Margaret’s half share must imply that there was nothing preventing a joint tenant’s interest in land from being taken in execution of a judgment. Hence, I find that <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case </span>supports the finding that a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a writ.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Writ of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">elegit</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> replaced by WSS in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>became part of Singapore law through the Second Charter of Justice of 1826. In 1878, it was repealed and replaced by the WSS locally through the CPO 1878 (Tan Sook Yee, “Execution Against Land in Singapore – Some Problems” [1987] 1 MLJ xv at xv–xvi). Barring a break between 1970 and 1991 when the WSS was replaced by charging orders, the WSS has remained the mode of execution against immovable property since 1878 (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [22]–[33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 However, as the Appellant pointed out, unlike the WSS, the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>merely enabled the judgment creditor to receive the proceeds of the judgment debtor’s land, and did not allow the seizure and sale of said land to satisfy the judgment debt.

Alienation of a joint tenant’s interest in land is one method of severance. This can occur as a result of a legal process. For example, <span class="font-weight-bold">taking a joint tenant’s interest in land in execution of a judgment will sever a joint tenancy</span> ... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In fact, in the local Straits Settlements Case of <span class="font-italic">Muthoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Karuppan Chitty v Onan &amp; ors, Onan, executor of Rajeedin deceased</span>, Suit No 688 of 1907, Hyndman-Jones CJ interpreted “any interest therein” in s 619(1) of the Straits Settlements Civil Procedure Code 1907 (Ordinance No 31 of 1907) (“CPC 1907”) as including “the interest of a tenant in common, a <span class="font-italic">joint tenant</span>…” [emphasis added] (see J Bernard Weiss, Bashir Mallal &amp; Nazir Mallal, <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Straits Settlements Practice </span>(Malayan Law Journal Office, 1937) at p 296). Section 619(1) of CPC 1907 referred to the seizure of “immovable property <span class="font-italic">or any interest therein</span>”, [emphasis added] and is materially similar to O 47 r 4(1) of the ROC today, which begins with “[w]here the property to be seized consists of immovable property <span class="font-italic">or any interest ther</span><span class="font-italic">ein</span>…” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Hence, <span class="font-italic">even if </span>the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>was not the progenitor of the WSS, it remains that, until <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>, Australian and local authorities appeared to show that the interest of a joint tenant over land could be taken under a writ. This is bolstered by Pang JC’s extensive review of decisions in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, namely, England, Hong Kong, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and several Caribbean nations, all of which allow for the same (see <span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [37]–[53]). Indeed, the Appellant has not submitted any authorities showing otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Be that as it may, it appears that the issue as to whether a WSS can latch onto a joint tenant’s interest in land for the purpose of enforcement did not arise squarely in some of the cases from the Commonwealth jurisdictions considered by Pang JC. For example, in England, because the authority of <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case </span>has never been doubted, modern authorities continue to conclude without discussion that “involuntary severance results from the making of a charging order … in respect of a debtor joint tenant’s beneficial interest in land” (Gray and Gray, <span class="font-italic">Elements of Land Law </span>(Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2009) at para 7.4.81). It will be recalled that <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case </span>did not deal squarely with the issue of severance. Instead it stands predominantly for the proposition that where judgment is given against one of two joint tenants and the debtor-joint tenant subsequently releases his interest to the other joint tenant before execution, such release does not bar the judgment creditor’s execution unless the releasing joint tenant died before execution.

The only disagreement between the judges in <span class="font-italic">Registrar-General </span><span class="font-italic">v Wood </span>was whether the wife’s interest, having been registered as a “tenant by entireties”, had been transformed into a joint tenancy because of the Married Women’s Property Act.

</div><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 329–331, Dixon J noted that the principle that joint tenants do not own sufficiently distinct interests is not an unqualified one, and represents but “one of two not altogether compatible aspects of joint tenancy”. The other aspect of joint tenancy which was not considered in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>was that a “joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenants” (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [77]). This was because “joint tenants have the whole for the purpose of tenure and survivorship, while, for the purpose of immediate alienation, each has only a particular part” (<span class="font-italic">Wright </span>at 331).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This second aspect of joint tenancy is demonstrated by <span class="font-italic">Felicity </span><span class="font-italic">Cassegrain v Gerard Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Ltd </span>[2015] HCA 2 (“<span class="font-italic">Cassegrain</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Cassegrain</span>, a husband fraudulently procured the conveyance of land to him and his wife as joint tenants. A question that arose was whether the husband’s fraud infected his wife’s interest in the land. The HCA adopted Dixon J’s finding in <span class="font-italic">Wright </span>above, and noted that “[o]nly by recognising the necessity to qualify those statements of principle [that a joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenants but nothing by himself] is it possible to account for the cases of forfeiture suffered by, and execution against, one of several joint tenants” (<span class="font-italic">Cassegrain</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]). Hence, the court held that the wife’s indefeasible title was not affected by her husband’s fraud (<span class="font-italic">Cassegrain</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Given the “two not altogether compatible aspects of joint tenancy”, the court is not compelled to focus on only one aspect (that a joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenants but nothing by himself) to the exclusion of the other equally valid aspect (that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenants). Giving weight to both aspects of joint tenancy, it would not be incompatible with the nature of the joint tenancy to hold that a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a WSS (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>at [77]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Recognising the second aspect of joint tenancy (that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation), it is therefore not a requirement that the WSS concomitantly severs a joint tenancy before it may attach to a joint tenant’s interest in land (<span class="font-italic">cf</span>, <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>at [15]; <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Instead, as is consistent with the LTO draftsman’s intention, the WSS may attach to a joint tenant’s interest in land <span class="font-italic">independent </span>of severance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This is consistent with the broad wording of the relevant statutory provisions, which do not indicate the need for severance of the joint tenancy before the WSS may be attached for the purposes of enforcing a judgment:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) O 47 r 4 of the ROC allows “immovable property or <span class="font-italic">any interest </span>therein” to be seized without expressly excluding the interest of a joint tenant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Section 13 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) contemplates the exigibility of “all the property, movable or immovable, of whatever description” by a WSS. While certain properties such as the wages or salary of the judgment debtor cannot be seized under this provision (s 13(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SCJA), a joint tenant’s interest in property is not exempted.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Section 135(1) of the LTA allows the “interest in registered land” to be “sold in execution under a writ” as long as such interest “belongs to the judgment debtor at the date of the registration of the writ”. Even though the Act clearly distinguishes between the interests of a tenant-in-common and a joint tenant (see s 53 of the LTA), the interest of the joint tenant is not excluded, as is consistent with the draftsman’s intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 These non-exclusory provisions may be contrasted with the position under s 51(6) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) and s 68(1) of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, 2013 Rev Ed), which provide for express restrictions against the use of protected property and Central Provident Fund monies to satisfy an execution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No judicial overreach despite lack of express wording in statute </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Appellant argued that because there are no statutes enabling the seizure of a joint tenant’s interest under a WSS, allowing for this would amount to judicial overreach.

In that case, the court reaffirmed the traditional modes of severance recognised at common law, which are: (a) operating on his own share; (b) mutual agreement; and (c) mutual conduct or course of dealing (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>(CA) at [19]). In relation to (a), the court noted that “operating on his own share” was widely considered to mean selling or assigning a joint tenant’s own share (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>(CA) at [19]). While “operating on his own share” did not extend to unilateral declarations by one joint tenant that the joint tenancy should be severed (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>(CA) at [31]–[39]), it certainly contemplates the joint tenant severing the joint tenancy <span class="font-italic">unilaterally</span>, albeit not by a declaration. This reaffirms the second aspect of joint tenancy as considered by Dixon J and Pang JC (at [48] above), that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenant(s).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Hence, I do not find that <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>(CA) affects my decision that a WSS can attach to a joint tenant’s interest. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Defendant has a beneficial interest in the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Having found that the WSS can attach to the Defendant’s interest as a joint tenant of the Property, I must then consider whether the Defendant has any beneficial interest in the Property. Without any such beneficial interest in the Property, there would be nothing for the WSS to attach to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In this regard, the Appellant submitted that the entire beneficial interest of the Property belongs to him, as he was the only person who paid for the mortgages for the Property and the Defendant had not contributed to the purchase price of the Property.

<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Registrar Appeal No 339 of 2018<br/>
<em>Ong Boon Hwee v Cheah Ng Soo and another </em>[2019] SGHC 65</span></p>
<p><font face="Calibri">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the High Court (delivered by Justice Chan Seng Onn):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> &lt;High Court holds that a writ of seizure and sale can be attached to a joint tenant’s interest in land</em>&gt; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Background </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          In recent times, there have been several conflicting High Court decisions dealing with the question of whether a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property can be subject to a writ of seizure and sale (“WSS”). </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">While the court in <em>Malayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltd </em>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 1008 (“<em>Malayan Banking</em>”) and <em>Chan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching </em>[2017] SGHC 136 (“<em>Chan Lung Kien</em>”) decided in the negative, two other High Court decisions, namely, <em>Chan Shwe Ching v Leong Lai Yee </em>[2015] 5 SLR 295 (“<em>Leong Lai Yee</em>”) and <em>Peter Low LLC v Higgins, Danial Patrick </em>[2018] 4 SLR 1003 (“<em>Peter Low</em>”) took a contrary position.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          In <em>Ong Boon Hwee v Cheah Ng Soo and another </em>[2019] SGHC 65, Chan Seng Onn J (“Chan J”) decided that a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a WSS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          The plaintiffs, Cheah Ng Soo and Phoey Kaw Moi (collectively “the Plaintiffs”) entered into a consent judgment with Chan Shwe Ching (“the Defendant”), whereby the Defendant was to pay them a certain sum with interest thereon. To enforce the consent judgment, the Plaintiffs sought and obtained a WSS in respect of the Defendant’s property, which was subject to a joint tenancy between the Defendant and her husband, Ong Boon Hwee (“the Appellant”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          The Appellant applied to set aside the WSS granted against the property which he jointly held with the Defendant. The Assistant Registrar dismissed the Appellant’s application. The Appellant appealed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Reasons for the judgment</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">5          In coming to his decision, Chan J embarked on a historical overview of execution of money judgments against land, where he agreed with Pang Khang Chau JC’s (“Pang JC”) finding in <em>Peter Low </em>at [36(c)] that, prior to the court’s decision in <em>Malayan Banking</em>, all relevant authorities appeared to allow a joint tenant’s interest in land to be attached in execution: at <strong>[21]–[36].</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6          Chan J also found that allowing a joint tenant’s interest to be attached to a WSS would be consistent with the intention of John Baalman (“Baalman”), the draftsman of the Land Titles Ordinance (the predecessor of the present-day Land Titles Act). In his commentary on the Land Titles Ordinance, Baalman wrote that, in Australia, the interest of a joint tenant could be taken under a writ, and that there was nothing in the Ordinance which made the Australian decisions inapplicable: at <strong>[39]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7          However, the court in <em>Malayan Banking </em>and <em>Chan Lung Kien </em>had held that there was nothing for the WSS to latch onto as “each joint tenant holds nothing by himself; he holds the whole estate together with the other joint tenants” (<em>Chan Lung Kien </em>at [29]). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8          In response, Chan J agreed with Pang JC’s finding in <em>Peter Low </em>at [77], that there was another not altogether compatible aspect of joint tenancy, namely, that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation (“the second aspect of joint tenancy”). Once this second aspect of joint tenancy was recognised, it was not a requirement that the WSS concomitantly severs a joint tenancy before it may attach to a joint tenant’s interest in land: at <strong>[48]–[49]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9          Instead, as is consistent with Baalman’s intention, the WSS may attach to a joint tenant’s interest in land <em>independent</em> of severance of the joint tenancy: at <strong>[50]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">10        This was supported by the broad wording of the relevant statutory provisions, which do not indicate the need for severance of the joint tenancy before the WSS may be attached for the purposes of enforcing a judgment (at [51]). There was no judicial overreach in allowing for such attachment despite the lack of express statutory wording enabling the seizure of a joint tenant’s interest under a WSS; the Canadian and Australian statutes which expressly provided for the attachment of the interest of a joint tenant under a writ were clarificatory rather than enabling provisions: at<strong> [55]–[60]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">11        The Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Chan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching </em>[2018] 2 SLR 84, which did not deal with the issue in this case, did not affect the decision as to whether a WSS could attach to a joint tenant’s interest in land: at <strong>[62]–[67]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">12        Having found that a WSS could be attached to a joint tenant’s interest in land, Chan J found that the Defendant had, by virtue of the presumption of advancement which was not rebutted, a beneficial interest in the property: at <strong>[69]–[72]</strong>. As such, the Assistant Registrar was correct in holding that the Defendant’s joint tenancy interest in the property was exigible to the WSS.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Addendum</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">13        For the avoidance of doubt, under the judgment, a joint tenant’s interest is exigible to a WSS <em>independent </em>of the severance of the joint tenancy. Chan J did not make any finding as to whether the joint tenancy can be severed by a subsequent registration of the WSS, as Pang JC considered in <em>Peter Low </em>at [97].</span></p>
