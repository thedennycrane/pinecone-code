</div> The net tangible asset approach would not have taken this into consideration. While there was logic in counsel’s argument, in absence of an expert opinion as to the extent of the additional margin, I nevertheless preferred a more conservative approach of using the book value as a base, and adding the enhanced valuation of the commercial properties to the book value, still following the initial approach of the net tangible asset value. Thus, adding the enhanced value of the commercial properties to the net asset value of P Pte Ltd reflected in the 2012 accounts, $2,454,430, came to $3,309,791.

</div> Compared to her frugal habits, the Wife asserted that the Husband’s high expenditure resulted in the matrimonial assets being recklessly dissipated. Given that the Husband had not properly accounted for his high expenditure, apart from asserting that much of it had been spent on gambling, this lent weight to the inference that he had dissipated assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"><span class="font-underline">Adverse inference </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”) at [29], the Court of Appeal held that the court had the power to draw adverse inferences against a party who had failed to make full and frank disclosure of his assets. In my view, it was reasonable, in this case, to draw a conclusion that the Husband had funds elsewhere. First, the pattern of discovery showed that that the Husband was chary of giving information unless required. The Husband did not disclose his A Pte Ltd shares until confronted by the Wife. More importantly, his share account, while admitted in the course of an interrogatory, was not disclosed: the Husband rather nonchalantly stated that it was “not relevant”. Second, there were substantial unexplained withdrawals from OCBC 001, and third, unexplained high expenses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Regarding the specific sum, the Wife suggested adding back $1,979,000 for OCBC 001 and unexplained expenditure. The Husband’s case, however, was that he was “rolling money around”, through loans and their subsequent repayment, to meet his business needs. Counsel for the Wife pointed out, however, that between the deposits and withdrawals, a significant sum had been siphoned out: he estimated this as at least $1,019,479.30, over and above the dissipation of $979,000 in expenses and $313,180 for gambling. It was also clear from the Husband’s notation of deposit and withdrawal for the purposes of his share account that his undisclosed share account would have at least $300,000. I decided to add a conservative sum of $500,000 to the asset pool arising from the adverse inference I had drawn against him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Husband’s liabilities </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Husband contended he was subject to the following liabilities:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $200,000 owed to his friend Ronald;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $137,582 owed to his friend Ramakrishnan;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $70,000 owed to P Pte Ltd; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) $18,213.18 owed to DBS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I first considered the alleged debt owed to Ronald.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Affidavit of Ronald Charles Klyne dated 19/5/2016 (PA 19).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Wife pointed out that although it has been some 5 years since the disbursement of the loan, no part of it has been repaid nor was there any evidence of any demand for repayment made by Ronald. At the same time, the Husband had prepared a ledger of alleged loans to various persons but there is no entry relating to Ronald; instead an 18 April 2011 movement of $200,000 is described as a dividend.

</div>
</div>
</div> This discrepancy between the quantum of debt the Husband and Ramakrishnan claimed was explained by reference to a difference in disbursement dates. Nevertheless, this allegation surfaced for the first time only in May 2016. In two affidavits filed by the Husband earlier, on 6 May 2015 and 18 January 2016, this debt of $137,582 did not appear on the list of debts the Husband claimed were owed by him as of 28 January 2013. To date, the debt remains unpaid and there is no evidence that Ramakrishnan has demanded repayment of it. In the circumstances, there was insufficient evidence for me to find that the Husband owed Ramakrishnan any money. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the $70,000 debt allegedly owed to P Pte Ltd, the documents suggested that this loan was disbursed in two parts: a $50,000 loan and then a $20,000 loan. To first deal with the $20,000, the Husband had exhibited a payment voucher of $20,000 dated 22 February 2012 made out to him and described as “staff loan”. This was supported by a corresponding OCBC debit note dated 22 February 2012 showing a corresponding $20,000 cheque deposit into his account and the debit note described the transaction as “STAFF LOAN” under “Additional Details”.

As a result, the Wife was the main person maintaining the household. She also contributed to the household expenses at the beginning of the marriage, before the Husband’s business took off. While the Husband did make some effort to take care of their daughter and the household, his contributions were limited given that he was busy with work most of the time. While the Wife did take care of her family in their home, this was with the agreement of the Husband.

It was, by all measures, a very long marriage. The couple started in humble circumstances, in one instance with the Wife having to pawn her jewellery to assist the Husband. Through their joint efforts in their respective spheres, all of the asset enhancement being divided was obtained during the marriage. As is usual in cases of divorce, there were expressions of dissatisfaction on both sides with the other’s contribution to the marriage. The fact of the matter is that, in this case, both parties had put in strong and equal effort into the marriage, over a very long period of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Of relevance here is the guidance of the Court of Appeal that financial and non-financial contributions to the household should be equally respected: see <span class="font-italic">Lock </span><span class="font-italic">Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520, <span class="font-italic">Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Choon Lai</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan and another appeal and another matter </span>[2012] 4 SLR 785. Also, in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [41], the Court of Appeal affirmed the principle that the process of matrimonial division of assets “must involve a mutual respect for spousal contributions, whether in the economic or homemaking spheres, as both roles are equally fundamental to the well-being of the marital partnership”. The Court of Appeal added that financial and non-financial contributions should be put “on an equal footing” (at [27]). In <span class="font-italic">ANJ v </span><span class="font-italic">ANK</span> (at [17] and [26]), the Court of Appeal reiterated the guidance of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choon Lai</span> (at [14]) and <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> (at [41]) that spousal contributions in both the economic and home-making spheres are equally fundamental to the well-being of a martial partnership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In such cases of long marriage where parties have ordered their lives where one party concentrates solely on the home and family, strictly applying steps (a) and (b) of the <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> approach without adjusting the ratio at step (c) may lead to a greater emphasis on financial rather than non-financial contributions. In the first step of the direct contribution ratio, parties’ direct contributions are based on their <span class="font-italic">financial</span> contributions <span class="font-italic">to the matrimonial assets</span>. The parties’ indirect contributions comprise <span class="font-italic">both</span> their <span class="font-italic">financial and non-financial contributions</span> to the welfare of the household, above and beyond their financial contributions to the matrimonial assets. Given that financial contributions feature in computing both the direct and indirect contributions ratio, the Court, in cases such as the present, must adjust the final ratio such that there is no role discrimination weighing in favour of the fee earner. Such a conclusion would be contrary to the well-established position that courts give equal respect to the economic and homemaking spheres given the fundamental importance of each role to the well-being and flourishing of the marital partnership. In following the three-part analysis in dividing parties’ assets, the Court’s singular statutory duty is to ensure that the final result brings a just and equitable closure to parties’ joint lives. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AN</span><span class="font-italic">J v ANK</span> (at [30]): “The controlling principle has always been and remains that the court must approach the exercise with broad strokes based on its feel of what is just and equitable on the facts of the case.”</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Value of the Wife’s half share</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The total value of the matrimonial assets came up to $4,631,434.58.

This explained why he could have such high monthly expenditures. His counsel conceded that his expenses of $1,073,004 for a period of 61 months came to $17,590 per month. ACRA searches conducted by counsel for the Wife showed that the Husband was involved in many businesses. P Pte Ltd also seemed to be a source of income. He explained on affidavit that P Pte Ltd was resting on rental income, and he receives a portion of that rental income. Referencing his 40% share of the $444,408 obtained annually after deducting expenses, his rental income would be $123,000 annually. This was a steady income stream that was stable. From the Husband’s spending pattern, it was clear that he had recourse to other sources of funds.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Wife was last a clerk and would have difficulty re-entering the labour market after being a home-maker for many years. Since June 2012 to the present, the Husband had been giving the Wife monthly maintenance of $2,500 for herself and the Child. The Wife claimed that she had other expenses which she had been using her savings for and that the $2,500 from the Husband had been insufficient.

</div> She also claimed that her financial situation was ameliorated by the fact that from August 2012 to August 2013, the Husband had allowed her to keep the rental of $2,600 from the Marsiling HDB, which meant that she effectively had $5,100 to spend each month.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 A lump sum award was appropriate because of the desirability of a clean break between the spouses in this case, especially in light of the animosity between them. Affordability was not an issue for the Husband. The Wife asked for a lump sum based on a 12-year period. Because the Wife had been awarded a substantial sum of assets pursuant to the division of matrimonial property and because the Court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to that to divide assets (see <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2016] SGCA 2 at [33]), I decided to award the Wife a small lump sum to ease the transition. I set this sum at $171,422, using a sum of $3,000 per month, discounted using the net present value formula over five years with an assumption of interest at 2% per annum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Implementation of orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Adding the sum the Wife was entitled to pursuant to the division of assets, namely, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">$1,985,772.24</span>, and the lump sum maintenance of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">$171,422</span> awarded to the Wife, a total sum of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">$2,157,194</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline"> (nearest dollar)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>was payable to the Wife. In the circumstances, I found that the best way of effecting my decision on the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance was to order, <span class="font-italic">inter alia,</span> that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Husband</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">transfer the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Condominium and the Marsiling HDB to the Wife</span>. This addresses the needs of the family in ensuring that the Wife and their daughter would continue to have stability. The Wife is also advanced in age and would be disadvantaged in the job market in the light of her many years as a home-maker. This would allow her a stable source of income from rental collected from the Marsiling HDB. While the Husband was living at the Marsiling HDB, he had previously rented property elsewhere for a year, allowing the Wife the benefit of the rental. His business interests indicated that he was also experienced on the property market and given his various sources of funds, would be able to find alternative accommodation easily.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Given that the two properties were valued at $2m, the Husband was ordered to pay a further sum of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">$</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">157,194</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>to the Wife.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Specifically, I ordered that the Husband was to pay the Wife the first $100,000 in three months, and the remainder $57,194 within three months thereafter. Parties were to keep all other assets in their own names.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Child orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Husband and Wife were given joint custody of the Child, with care and control to the Wife and liberal access to the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Child is 19 and will complete her polytechnic education in 2017. For the Child’s maintenance, in accordance with the Husband’s prior proposal, I awarded the Child $1,500 per month until she completed her education. The Husband was ordered to credit the monthly maintenance of $1,500 to the Child on the first day of each month with effect from 1 November 2016. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the case at hand, the Husband initially obtained ancillary orders in absence of the Wife’s participation. Upon the Wife’s application to set the judgment aside, the High Court previously decided that, while the order for the division of assets obtained in the Wife’s absence was regular, the orders made ought to be set aside. Costs of that setting aside were reserved to me. The Wife asked for those costs as well as the costs of the hearing on the ancillary matters before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In general, costs are not ordered in matrimonial cases; nevertheless, the court exercises its discretion to do so in appropriate cases: see rr 854(b), 856, and 857, Family Justice Rules 2014 (GN S 813/2014), and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Cheung Kam Yi Betty v Liu Tsun Kie</span> [2012] SGHC 213 at [79]. Costs remain an important tool in regulating the litigation process in family cases, in discouraging misconduct and incentivising sensible behaviour on the part of litigants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Of relevance here was the Husband’s significant non-disclosure. In the Husband’s first affidavit filed for the ancillary matters, there were non-disclosures in the areas both of his salary - in the previous proceedings he stated it was $8,000 per month whereas later he admitted it was over $12,000 a month - as well as his assets, where various businesses had not been disclosed. Even after that judgment was set aside, the Husband did not do much better on disclosure in the second set of ancillary matters. The enhanced value of the properties held by P Pte Ltd came to light during his interrogatories and it was the Wife who sought and obtained an updated valuation of the properties held by the company after queries from the Court. Another company, A Pte Ltd, was discovered by the Wife in the course of litigation and the Husband conceded when confronted by the Wife. Disclosure of his bank accounts, obtained by the Wife after a discovery application, led to information as to withdrawals and expenditure that were ill explained. As at the hearing of the second set of ancillary issues, the Court still had not had sight of his share trading account, information he dismissed, in answer to an interrogatory, as “irrelevant”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Such conduct must be discouraged, for several reasons. Fundamentally, in family cases, where there is no general process of inspection and discovery applicable to other kinds of civil litigation, parties’ disclosure of their assets is fundamental to the exercise of the court’s discretion. The principle of full and frank disclosure applies not only to contested proceedings but also to exchanges of information between parties and their solicitors leading to consent orders without further inquiry of the court: see <span class="font-italic">Livesey</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly Jenkins) Respondent and Jenkins Appellant [on Appeal From Jenkins V. Livesey (formerly Jenkins)] </span>[1985] 1 AC 424. Thus, although the Wife did not participate in the initial hearing of the ancillary matters and the judgment thereby obtained was regular, the onus was upon the Husband to give the Court full and frank disclosure even in his first affidavit. The court’s ability to exercise its statutory discretion under the Women’s Charter rests upon parties’ compliance with their duty of disclosure and respect for the processes of the Court. Secondly, the “catch-me-if-you-can” attitude leads to an inevitable sequence of requests for documents, interrogatories and disclosure by further affidavits. This increases the costs and length of litigation, and is unhelpful to an orderly assessment of evidence and adjudication of issues. Finally, such conduct also increases emotional strain and conflict between parties, often with adverse impact on any children within the family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the circumstances, I found it just to award the Wife the costs of the setting aside and the subsequent hearing of the ancillary matters before me. I fixed these costs, in the round, at $15,000 (inclusive of disbursements).   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In summary, I made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Husband shall transfer his share, interest, and right in the Condominium and the Marsiling HDB to the Wife.
