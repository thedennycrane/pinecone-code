        Chan Seng Onn J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties were married on
                        26<sup>th</sup> August 1995 in Guam. They have three
                    children, aged 7, 10 and 11 years. The wife filed for divorce on 4 October
                    2006 and the husband moved out of the matrimonial home in January 2007. Interim
                    judgment was granted on 16 March 2007 with a consent order as to the joint
                    custody of the children with care and control to the wife and liberal access to
                    the husband (“the Interim Judgment”). The issues before me
                    concern: (a) the manner in which the matrimonial assets are to be distributed;
                    and (b) the amount to be paid as maintenance for the three children of the
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Distribution of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       A preliminary issue is the question of the date
                    at which the matrimonial assets and the parties’ contributions thereto are
                    to be considered for distribution, <em>ie</em>, whether the
                    matrimonial assets in the present case encompass assets existing (a) as at the
                    date of the Interim Judgment (16 March 2007); or (b) as at the date of the
                    ancillary orders for division of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Between the date of the Interim Judgment and the
                    present date, there has been a change both in the value and in the nature of the
                    assets through the acquisition of new assets after the date of the Interim
                    Judgment. The value of the assets has increased due to the accumulation of both
                    parties’ salaries earned after the date of the Interim Judgment. More
                    importantly, after the date of the Interim Judgment, the wife purchased three
                    properties in Malaysia for investment purposes (“the Malaysian
                    properties”) and bought a piece of land in Singapore on which to build a
                    house (“the Singapore property”). In 2008 and 2009, she also
                    exercised some stock options which she had acquired before the date of the
                    Interim Judgment. In addition, some of the proceeds from the sale of a property
                    in South Africa (“the South African Property”) which property had
                    been acquired in the wife’s name before the date of the Interim Judgment,
                    appear to have only been transferred to the wife’s bank account in
                    Singapore in 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In my opinion, apart from assets acquired before
                    the marriage which satisfy the definition of “matrimonial assets”
                    in s 112(10)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed), the matrimonial assets available for
                    distribution should be restricted to the assets acquired in the course of the
                    marriage by both parties up to the date of the Interim Judgment. Hence, all the
                    matrimonial assets (including any valuable accrued rights such as stock options
                    and future bonuses arising from employment prior to the date of interim
                    judgment) which existed as at the date of the Interim Judgment are the relevant
                    assets for distribution. Any asset acquired after the date of the Interim
                    Judgment should not be considered a matrimonial asset to be distributed between
                    the parties. The party choosing to invest in new assets after the date of the
                    Interim Judgment takes the benefit of an appreciation and also the market risk
                    of a fall in the value of those investments. The rationale behind this is that
                    the Interim Judgment puts an end to the marriage contract and indicates that the
                    parties no longer intend to participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial
                    assets nor in any further joint investment in any matrimonial assets with the
                    associated market risk of a fall in the value of those joint investments, unless
                    there is evidence to substantiate a mutual intention to the contrary. As the
                    Court of Appeal observed in <em>Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v
                        Shanmugam Nagaiah and another</em> [1987] SLR(R) 702
                        (“<em>Sivakolunthu</em>”) (at
                    [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The grant of a decree <em>nisi</em> is a recognition
                        by the “court that the marriage is at an end”. When such a
                        decree is pronounced, there is, as Lord Wright said [in <em>Fender v St John-Mildmay</em> [1938] AC 1 at 45-6], no longer any
                        matrimonial home, no <em>consortium vitae</em> and no
                        right on either side to conjugal rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Sivakolunthu</em>, the Court of Appeal
                    held that the jurisdiction to make ancillary orders is founded on the reality of
                    the break-up of a marriage rather than the legal formality of such a break-up
                    and that this is also evidenced by the power of the court to order a division of
                    matrimonial assets upon the granting of a decree of judicial separation.
                    Consequently, the Court of Appeal construed the expression “decree of
                    divorce” in the then s 106(1) of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 1985 Ed) to include a decree <em>nisi</em>.
                    Section 106(1) of the Women’s Charter was subsequently replaced by
                    s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed).
                    Nevertheless, as observed by Kan Ting Chiu J in <em>Yap Hwee
                        May Kathryn v Geh Thien Ee Martin and another</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 663 (“<em>Yap Hwee May
                        Kathryn</em>”), there are strong similarities in s106 of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Ed) and s 112 of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) in that they both set out
                    the power of the court to order the division of matrimonial assets. Section
                    106(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Rev Ed) stated that
                    the court shall have the power “when granting a decree of divorce”
                    while s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev
                    Ed) stated that the court shall have the power “when granting <em>or subsequent to</em> the grant of a decree of
                    divorce” [emphasis added].  Kan J held that the Court of
                    Appeal’s ruling in <em>Sivakolunthu</em> that
                    “decree of divorce” includes a decree <em>nisi</em> should apply to s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) as well. Section 112(1) of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) now states that the court shall have
                    the power to order the division of matrimonial assets “when granting
                        <em>or subsequent to</em> the grant of a <em>judgment</em> of divorce” [emphasis added]. Reasoning
                    by analogy, s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    2009 Rev Ed) should also be interpreted such that the court shall have the
                    power to order the division of matrimonial assets when granting or subsequent to
                    the grant of an interim judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The reasoning in <em>Sivakolunthu</em> was applied by the High Court in <em>Yap Hwee May Kathryn</em> where Kan J stated his preference for
                    the date when the decree <em>nisi</em> was made as the
                    operative date for an order for the division of matrimonial assets. Kan J
                    cited two persuasive reasons for his preference. Firstly, if all the relevant
                    facts are before the court, there is no reason why the actual division of
                    matrimonial assets should not be done when the decree <em>nisi</em> is granted. Secondly, it is impossible to employ the date
                    of the decree <em>absolute</em> as the operative date for
                    division as the date cannot be ascertained when the division is made since a
                    decree <em>absolute</em> is only made when the hearing of
                    all ancillary matters, such as the division of matrimonial assets and custody,
                    are concluded. I agree. I would also add that it would be inconsistent with the
                    intention of the parties to include in the pool of matrimonial assets any assets
                    that they separately acquire <em>after</em> the grant of
                    the interim judgment since, as at the date of the interim judgment, the parties
                    have already “put an end to the whole content of the marriage contract,
                    leaving only the shell, that is, the technical bond” ( <em>Fender v St John-Mildmay</em> [1936] 1 KB 111, per Greer LJ
                    at 115-7). As such, on the facts of the present case, given the clear intention
                    of the parties not to contribute to the pool of matrimonial assets as from the
                    date of Interim Judgment, I would consider the matrimonial assets available for
                    distribution to be the assets existing at the date of Interim Judgment. However,
                    I would stress that the date of the Interim Judgment only determines the assets
                    which are available for distribution and <em>not</em> the
                        <em>value</em> of such assets which would be taken into
                    account when dividing the matrimonial assets. I will elaborate at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> and <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    below on how the net asset values for the purpose of division are to be
                    determined. Any other outstanding liabilities incurred for the welfare of the
                    family (<em>eg</em>, outstanding loans taken to finance the
                    children’s education, family holidays or family expenses during the
                    marriage) would also have to be deducted in order to derive the total net value
                    of matrimonial assets available for distribution, which shall hereinafter be
                    referred to as “S$<em>m</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In some rare cases, a party may have indulged in
                    certain vices involving a large amount of expenditure (<em>eg</em>, excessive gambling or drinking) to the extent that
                    matrimonial assets have been unfairly or unjustly depleted by the unacceptable
                    actions of that party. Should the innocent party to the marriage be made to
                    suffer on account of that or should the guilty party be made to bear the entire
                    amount of that expenditure or at least a part thereof, as if that guilty party
                    had spent his own share of the matrimonial assets when calculating the
                    distribution of matrimonial assets? In my view, the court has a discretion to
                    decide whether or not such a wasteful dissipation of matrimonial assets should
                    be accounted for at all, and if so, the extent to which that wasteful
                    dissipation should be accounted for in order to make the eventual distribution
                    of matrimonial assets just and equitable for the innocent party. Should the
                    court decide that it is just and equitable for the <em>entire</em> amount dissipated to be accounted for as part of the
                    matrimonial assets as if the <em>entire</em> amount had not
                    been dissipated, then the <em>entire</em> amount proved to
                    have been unfairly or unjustly dissipated by that party during the course of the
                    marriage until the date of interim judgment will be notionally added to the
                    total net amount of the matrimonial assets. If the court decides that it is only
                    just and equitable to account for a <em>fraction</em> of
                    the entire amount dissipated by the guilty party, especially where there was no
                    vehement objection from the innocent party at the time the expenditure on the
                    vices were incurred by the guilty party, then only that <em>fraction</em> will be added to the total net amount of the
                    matrimonial assets. The amount notionally added to the total net amount of
                    matrimonial assets to represent the amount that a party to the marriage has
                    dissipated unjustly or unfairly will hereinafter be referred to as
                        “S$<em>n</em>”. The amount dissipated
                    unjustly or unfairly by either the husband or the wife will subsequently be
                    deducted from the share of matrimonial assets to be awarded to him or her. This
                    is set out in greater detail at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>-<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> below. (See steps
                    7 and 8 of the methodology presented in this judgment as a guide to achieving a
                    fair distribution of matrimonial assets.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       There are also some cases—the present case
                    being one of them—where one party, prior to the date of interim judgment,
                    uses money from the pool of matrimonial assets to acquire assets in his or her
                    own name in circumstances in which both parties are aware that the party
                    acquiring such assets is making the investment for his or her own purposes and
                    has no intention that the other party partake in such investment, and where the
                    other party could not reasonably have expected to share in the investment in the
                    event of a divorce. In these circumstances, the court also has a discretion to
                    decide how to account for such expenditure. It may well be just and equitable to
                    order that the party which removed the money from the pool of matrimonial assets
                    be treated as having used that money for his or her own purposes (similar to the
                    scenario where one party unfairly or unjustly depletes the matrimonial assets by
                    engaging in vices as considered at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    above). The amount expended by the party making the investment will notionally
                    be added to the total net amount of matrimonial assets to represent the amount
                    that a party to the marriage has invested for his own benefit and will
                    hereinafter be referred to as “S$<em>p</em>”.
                    The amount invested by either the husband or the wife for his or her own benefit
                    will subsequently be deducted from the share of matrimonial assets to be awarded
                    to him or her. As in the situation described in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, this is set out in greater detail at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>-<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>
                    below. (See steps 7 and 8 of the methodology presented in this judgment as a
                    guide to achieving a fair distribution of matrimonial assets.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As a general principle, in the distribution of
                    matrimonial assets according to the ratio which I shall determine in this
                    judgment, all assets existing as at the date of the Interim Judgment, <em>ie</em>, 16 March 2007, will be considered as part of
                    the pool of matrimonial assets to be distributed. For instance, the amount of
                    monies in the respective bank accounts and CPF accounts of the parties
                    constituting part of the matrimonial assets shall be the amount in those
                    accounts as at the date of the Interim Judgment. If an asset has been sold
                    either before or after the date of Interim Judgment and the net proceeds of sale
                    have not been received and banked into the parties’ bank accounts as at
                    the date of the Interim Judgment, then it will be assigned a notional net asset
                    value equal to the price at which it was sold less any outstanding loan taken to
                    purchase that asset and any incidental expenses incurred in the sale. In other
                    words, its net asset value is its expected net proceeds of sale. If an asset has
                    not been sold, its net asset value will have to be ascertained as at the date of
                    this judgment (and not as at the date of the interim judgment) by independent
                    valuers if the parties cannot agree on its net asset value. Both parties ought
                    to have the benefit of any appreciation and similarly, suffer any depreciation
                    in the value of the asset up to the date of this judgement since the parties
                    themselves have implicitly agreed to keep the matrimonial asset to the present
                    date pending the conclusion of the ancillary hearing. Depending on the
                    circumstances, the court may either objectively determine as a fact what the
                    present net asset value should be having regard to the valuations obtained by
                    the parties from professional valuers or the court may order the asset to be
                    sold within a given timeframe and thereafter, the sale proceeds less repayment
                    of any outstanding loan and incidental expenses incurred in the sale of the
                    property will be entered into the pool of matrimonial assets for division. On
                    the facts of this case, the parties have agreed that the assets which existed on
                    the date of the Interim Judgment are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     A property in Australia (“the
                        Australian Property”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Perth Mint (Gold);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Perth Mint (Silver);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Proceeds from the sale of the South African Property which
                        was purchased in the wife’s name before the date of the Interim
                        Judgment and subsequently sold in 2006, subject to the following
                        considerations:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       If the net sale proceeds
                            have been paid into the wife’s bank accounts <em>prior</em> to the date of the Interim Judgment, then there is
                            no need to consider this property at all as it would already be
                            accounted for within item (f) below.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       However, if any of the sale proceeds
                            are paid into the wife’s bank account <em>after</em> the date of the Interim Judgment, then such
                            proceeds would not be captured by item (f) which is the amount in the
                            wife’s bank account as at the date of the Interim Judgment, in
                            which case such proceeds from the sale of the South African Property
                            will have to be notionally added to the pool of matrimonial assets
                            available for distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_e"></a>(e)     The wife’s stock options which were earned in the
                        course of her employment before the date of the Interim Judgment and
                        exercised in 2008 and 2009 after the date of the Interim Judgment. These
                        stock options were in fact benefits earned by the wife in the course of her
                        employment <em>before</em> the date of the Interim
                        Judgment. In other words, these stock options were benefits granted to the
                        wife on account of her job performance for the period before the date of the
                        Interim Judgment and as such, should comprise part of the matrimonial
                        assets. As they have been exercised <em>after</em> the
                        date of the Interim Judgment, the sale proceeds, less any incidental
                        expenses for the sale and taxes payable on account of the exercise of the
                        stock options, will constitute matrimonial assets. The wife exercised the
                        stock options in 2008 and 2009. She earned US$5,221,511.24 from her exercise
                        of the stock options in 2008 and US$585,059.22 from her exercise of the
                        stock options in 2009. This translates to approximately S$8,129,198.64 in
                        total. Assuming a combined US and Singapore tax rate of 35%, the tax paid on
                        these stock options was approximately S$2,845,219.52. The net amount earned
                        from the wife’s exercise of the stock options is therefore
                        approximately S$5,283,979.12. Since this amount did not form part of the
                        monies in the wife’s bank account as at the date of the Interim
                        Judgment (item (f) below), they would have to be added to the pool of
                        matrimonial assets available for distribution;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_f"></a>(f)     Monies in the wife’s bank accounts as at
                        the date of the Interim Judgment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_g"></a>(g)     Monies in the wife’s CPF Ordinary, Special and
                        Medisave accounts as at the date of the Interim Judgment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_h"></a>(h)     Monies in the husband’s bank
                        accounts as at the date of the Interim Judgment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_i"></a>(i)     Monies in the husband’s CPF
                        Ordinary, Special and Medisave accounts as at the date of the Interim
                        Judgment.</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No"></div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The parties also had outstanding tax liabilities as on the date of
                            the Interim Judgment which were incurred before the date of the Interim
                            Judgment and must be deducted from the total value of matrimonial
                            assets.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Accordingly, the total net value of matrimonial
                    assets available for distribution will be the sum of the values of the assets
                    listed in <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above less any other
                    outstanding income tax liabilities arising from income earned in the course of
                    the marriage up to the date of the Interim Judgment and, as stated above at
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>, will be represented as
                        “S$<em>m</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     If there are any matrimonial assets (including
                    cash) proved to have been unfairly or unjustly dissipated by either party during
                    the course of the marriage until the date of interim judgment which the court
                    finds unacceptable and must be accounted for as part of the matrimonial assets
                    as if they had never been dissipated, then the amount that the court deems to
                    have been unfairly or unjustly dissipated (S$<em>n</em>
                    – see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above), would be notionally
                    added to the total net value of matrimonial assets available for distribution.
                    If there are any matrimonial assets (including cash) proved to have been
                    expended by either party for his or her own investment purposes <em>before</em> the date of the Interim Judgment and both parties
                    did not intend for the other party to partake in the investment, then the total
                    amount expended (S$<em>p</em> – see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above) would also be notionally added to the
                    total net value of matrimonial assets available for distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The <em>notional</em>
                    total net value of matrimonial assets available for distribution is accordingly
                    the sum total of S$<em>m</em> + S$<em>n</em> + S$<em>p</em> and will be represented as
                        S$<em>A</em>. On the facts of this case, S$<em>n</em> is zero as no allegation of unjust depletion has been
                    raised by either party. S$<em>p</em> is S$242,390 since the
                    Wife made three deposits amounting to RM545,358.28 (or S$242,390) between
                    30 January 2007 and 3 February 2007 towards her purchase of the
                    Malaysian Properties just a few months prior to the grant of interim judgment.
                        S$<em>A</em> is therefore the sum of S$<em>m</em> and S$242,390.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Apportioning the assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The husband seeks an equal distribution of the
                    matrimonial assets. The wife submits that the Australian Property, gold and
                    silver should be divided between the parties in the proportion of their
                    respective financial contributions whilst the rest of the assets should be kept
                    by the parties in whose names the assets were registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The basis for the husband’s claim to an
                    equal distribution of assets is that the marriage was a partnership of equals.
                    Both parties had started life in the financial industry and were earning about
                    the same amount initially until the husband subsequently stayed home and became
                    a househusband from 2001 to 2006. According to the husband, the decision that he
                    stayed home to look after the young children of the marriage was a joint one to
                    cater to the needs of the family. The husband claims that it would be fair, just
                    and equitable to grant him 50% net of the wealth which he submits was jointly
                    created and improved upon by the parties. On the other hand, the wife argues
                    against an equal division on the basis that the wife has exceeded the husband in
                    both financial and non-financial contributions such that it would be unjust to
                    order an equal division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Section 112(1) of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a
                        judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order
                        the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any
                        such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale
                        of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks <em>just and equitable</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The High Court in <em>Lau Loon
                        Seng v Sia Peck Eng</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 688, having
                    considered the legislative history behind the enactment of s 112, concluded
                    that the principle of equal division is not preserved in the just and equitable
                    formulation in s 112. Rather, what is just and equitable must be decided on
                    the facts of each case. The principle of equal division has also been rejected
                    in subsequent cases. In <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hong
                        Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520, the Court of Appeal observed
                    that equality of division of matrimonial assets was not the norm and that in the
                    large majority of cases decided by the courts, equality of division was not
                    achievable on the facts. The Court of Appeal noted that it would be contrary to
                    legislative intent to seek to achieve equality as the norm as an end point
                    regardless of the actual facts and merits concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In view of s 112(1) of the Women’s
                    Charter and the existing case authorities, the husband’s contention for an
                    equal division of the matrimonial assets will not be sustained unless it is
                    decided, after an evaluation of all the direct and indirect contributions of
                    both parties, that it would be just and equitable to grant the husband a 50%
                    share in the matrimonial assets. The husband argues that it would be just and
                    equitable to grant him a 50% share in the matrimonial assets as both parties had
                    jointly created and improved upon the matrimonial assets. In particular, from
                    2001-2006, the husband had stayed home to look after the children with the help
                    of two domestic helpers. During this period, the wife excelled in her work
                    whilst the husband looked after the home and children and supervised the
                    construction of the parties’ houses in Australia and South Africa as well
                    as the Perth Mint investments. On the other hand, the wife argues that during
                    the period when the husband did not work, the wife still exceeded the husband in
                    non-financial contributions and that she had a crucial role to play in the
                    selection of the parties’ joint investments and their design of their
                    house in Australia. It is not disputed that the husband was diagnosed with
                    Attention Deficit Disorder (“ADD”) in 2006. The wife claims that
                    the husband was unable to look after the children and that after her work, the
                    wife had to look after the children and the household as well as the husband. I
                    agree with the wife that this is not a case where one marriage partner took care
                    of all the responsibilities of looking after the children and household while
                    the other focused on her career. Rather, this is a case where the partner who
                    was focusing on her career also looked after the household and children.
                    Moreover, the partner who focused on her career amassed a large sum of money
                    which has fallen into the pool of matrimonial assets. I have set out at
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>, <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>, <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>, <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> and <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>
                    below additional evidence of the parties’ respective direct and indirect
                    contributions towards the marriage and the welfare of the family. I find that in
                    all the circumstances of this case, it would not be just and equitable to grant
                    the husband a 50% share of the matrimonial assets. Applying a broad-brush
                    approach, the proportion of the total net value of matrimonial assets available
                    for distribution which it would be just and equitable to award to the husband,
                    is in my view broadly 20%. The wife deserves to get a much larger share of 80%
                    in view of her much greater direct and indirect contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I also disagree with the wife’s
                    submission that a classification approach should be adopted in the division of
                    the matrimonial assets and that the Australian Property, gold and silver should
                    be divided according to the parties’ respective financial contributions to
                    these investments whilst the other assets should be retained by the parties in
                    whose names they are registered. Although both parties have kept separate bank
                    accounts, I find that this does not alter the nature of the monies in the bank
                    accounts as matrimonial assets as there is no clear evidence that the separation
                    of the parties’ respective incomes was made with the view that their
                    assets would be divided along those lines in the event of divorce proceedings
                    (see <em>Foo Tee Sey v Loy Hui Eng</em> [2001]
                    3 SLR(R) 178). Moreover, both parties contributed to the purchase
                    price of the Australian Property, gold and silver, albeit in differing amounts.
                    Although the wife paid the purchase price of the South African Property, the
                    husband claims that he supervised and saw to the completion of this property. In
                    my opinion, during the marriage, the parties treated themselves as a married
                    couple would and treated their properties as matrimonial assets jointly acquired
                    and dealt with. With the exception of the wife’s purchase of the Malaysian
                    Properties a few months prior to the date of the Interim Judgment, it was not
                    intended that each party would keep the assets in his or her own name and divide
                    their joint investments according to their actual financial contribution towards
                    the acquisition of each investment. Thus, it would not be just and equitable for
                    each party to retain the monies in his or her own bank and CPF accounts and for
                    the wife, in addition, to retain the proceeds of the South African Property and
                    the sale of her stock options whilst dividing the Australian Property, gold and
                    silver in the proportion of the parties’ respective contributions to the
                    purchase price of such properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Accordingly, I reject the approach put forth
                    by both parties for the distribution of matrimonial assets. I now explain in
                    greater detail at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> to <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> below the broad-brush approach I have adopted
                    to arrive at a just and equitable division of the net value of the matrimonial
                    assets giving 20% of it to the husband and 80% to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The approach to determining a “just and equitable”
                division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>NK v NL</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<em>NK v
                    NL</em>”), the Court of Appeal stated that it is the duty of the
                    court to recognise the reality of family dynamics and to give due weight to all
                    indirect contributions which are by their nature not reducible to monetary
                    terms. The Court of Appeal held (at [28]) that in the absence of documentary
                    evidence, the court must make a “rough and ready approximation”
                    and avoid falling back on the view that favours financial contribution to the
                    acquisition of property. Apart from reiterating that a broad-brush approach or a
                    holistic assessment must be adopted in the just and equitable apportionment of
                    matrimonial assets with due regard being had to all the circumstances of the
                    case including those factors (not exhaustive) enumerated by s 112(2) of the
                    Act which must also be duly assessed and considered as a whole, the Court of
                    Appeal provided further useful guidance as to <em>how</em>
                    a just and equitable division of the assets shall be arrived at and stressed
                    that the entire process must involve a mutual respect for spousal contributions,
                    whether in the economic or homemaking spheres, as both roles are equally
                    fundamental to the well-being of the marital partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Court of Appeal in <em>NK v
                        NL</em> held that there are two distinct methodologies in the
                    attribution of indirect contributions to the division of matrimonial assets. The
                    first method requires a calculation of the net value of all matrimonial assets
                    followed by a just and equitable division in light of all the circumstances of
                    the case (“the global assessment methodology”). The court’s
                    duty would be to (a) identify and pool all the matrimonial assets pursuant to
                    s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter; (b) assess the net value of the
                    pool of assets; (c) determine a just and equitable division in the light of all
                    the circumstances of the case; and (d) decide on the most convenient way to
                    achieve these proportions of division. Pursuant to this approach, the percentage
                    for <em>indirect</em> contributions is applied without
                    distinction to <em>all</em> matrimonial assets. The second
                    method requires a separation of the matrimonial assets into classes with
                    individual apportionment for each class such as the matrimonial home, cash in
                    bank accounts, shares, and businesses, etc (“the classification
                    methodology”). Any <em>direct</em> financial
                    contributions and <em>indirect</em> contributions are
                    considered in relation to <em>each</em> class of assets,
                    rather than by way of a global assessment. The Court of Appeal in <em>NK v NL</em> held that the methodology that led to a just and
                    equitable division should be applied, although in the vast majority of cases,
                    either methodology would likely achieve the same result. In <em>NK v NL</em>, the second methodology was adopted as the Court of
                    Appeal felt that, on the facts of that case, it was more principled and
                    conducive to a fair and equitable division to consider the assets involved in
                    classes, taking into account the differing financial contributions of each party
                    to the acquisition of different assets, rather than as a vast conglomerate of
                    assets. In its application of the classification methodology, the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>NK v NL</em> held that only the <em>direct</em> contributions may <em>vary</em>. The element of <em>indirect</em>
                    contributions in the context of homemaking and child caring must necessarily
                    remain <em>constant</em> in relation to each class of
                    asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In my opinion, the classification methodology,
                    in varying the <em>direct</em> contributions depending on
                    the asset being considered, must also take into account the fact that parties to
                    a marriage may make <em>direct</em> contributions to the
                    family expenditure in different ways. Some <em>direct</em>
                    financial contributions to the family welfare (<em>eg</em>,
                    food, education and other school fees, medical expenses, public utilities,
                    travel and holiday expenses) are totally unrelated to the acquisition or
                    maintenance of any identifiable matrimonial asset (hereinafter referred to as
                    the “unattributable <em>direct</em> financial
                    contributions”) which are unlike those direct payments made by a party
                    which can readily be traced to the payment of the purchase price of a
                    matrimonial asset or to the repayment of a loan taken to finance the purchase of
                    that matrimonial asset. How then should those unattributable <em>direct</em> financial contributions to the family welfare be
                    accounted for in the just and equitable division of matrimonial assets? Should
                    they be treated in the same manner as the <em>indirect</em>
                    contributions in that the element of such unattributable <em>direct</em> financial contributions made by a party towards the
                    family welfare must remain <em>constant</em> in relation to
                    each class of asset? Logically, it should remain <em>constant</em> as they are unattributable to any particular
                    matrimonial asset just as with the <em>indirect</em>
                    contributions. In my view, such unattributable <em>direct</em> financial contributions are just as important as those
                    attributable and traceable <em>direct</em> financial
                    contributions made towards the acquisition or maintenance of matrimonial assets.
                    However, the computation of the total unattributable <em>direct</em> financial contributions during the whole course of the
                    marriage is no easy task as no accounts or financial records will likely be kept
                    of such financial contributions towards the family welfare. Over the duration of
                    a long marriage, these unattributable <em>direct</em>
                    financial contributions can be very significant if not more significant than the
                    actual direct financial contributions made towards the acquisition and
                    maintenance of matrimonial assets (especially for lower income families where
                    the only matrimonial asset may well be a three-room HDB flat).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Having regard to the fact that in most
                    marriage partnerships it is largely fortuitous as to which party contributes
                    directly towards the acquisition of matrimonial assets (<em>eg</em>, houses, shares, bonds, insurance policies with cash
                    surrender values <em>etc</em>) and which party pays for
                    other family expenditure (<em>eg</em>, food, education and
                    medical expenses <em>etc</em>) which have no asset value, I
                    would prefer to adopt a global assessment approach and work on the basis that,
                    unless disputed, the parties to a marriage have contributed and applied all
                    their respective incomes from employment or business received in the course of
                    the marriage to the overall welfare of the family (be it as unattributable
                        <em>direct</em> financial contributions towards food,
                    education and medical expenses <em>etc</em> or as
                    attributable <em>direct</em> financial contributions
                    traceable to the maintenance or acquisition of matrimonial assets including cash
                    deposits which are the unused monies saved by the parties). The ratio of their
                    total respective incomes during the life of the marriage would <em>prima facie</em> represent or reflect as a whole their
                    respective <em>direct</em> financial contributions (both
                    attributable and unattributable) towards the overall welfare of the family and,
                    accordingly, would <em>prima facie</em> also help to
                    determine their respective <em>direct</em> contributions
                    for the purpose of a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets, which I
                    must stress is only one side of the equation. The other side of the equation is
                    the ratio of <em>indirect</em> contributions made by the
                    parties towards the overall welfare of the family. Both ratios of <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em>
                    contributions by the respective parties will then be factored together to
                    determine, as best as the court can using a holistic and broad-brush approach,
                    the most appropriate final ratio to apply in order to achieve a just and
                    equitable division of the matrimonial assets (as defined in s 112(10) of
                    the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I do not propose to determine with
                    “mathematical precision” the amount of the parties’
                    respective contributions to the marriage and the ratio according to which the
                    matrimonial assets should be distributed. As the Court of Appeal acknowledged in
                        <em>NK v NL</em> (at [28]), “[i]n the absence of
                    documentary evidence, courts must indeed make a ‘rough and ready
                    approximation’”, “it would not profit either party to embark
                    on an exercise with a view to determine with mathematical precision the amount
                    of their respective contributions” and “division is ‘not a
                    pure exercise in arithmetic that would yield some degree of exactitude and
                    certainty’”. In line with the existing judicial approach to the
                    division of matrimonial assets, I have exercised my discretion in broad strokes
                    to determine the division of the matrimonial assets in the ratio of 20%:80% in
                    favour of the wife which in my view best achieves a just and equitable division
                    of the matrimonial assets. For comparison purposes and as a rough check whether
                    I could have made a serious error in the exercise of my discretion, I also used
                    the methodology set out below (at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>), which takes into account the
                    parties’
                    <em>direct</em> attributable <em>and</em> unattributable financial contributions to the marriage as
                    well as their <em>indirect</em> contributions to the
                    marriage. I must emphasise that the methodology is no more than a useful guide
                    and is not a substitute for the judicial approach to the division of matrimonial
                    assets as set out in <em>NK v NL</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In summary, the methodology is as follows. The
                    total contribution (of both parties) to the matrimonial assets consists of a
                    combination of both <em>direct and indirect</em>
                    contributions. I would determine the percentage of the <em>total</em> contribution that is attributable to (a) the <em>direct</em> contribution of the parties; and (b) the
                        <em>indirect</em> contribution of the parties. This
                    depends largely on the court’s view of the relative weight or significance
                    of the <em>total direct</em> contribution <em>versus</em> the <em>total indirect</em>
                    contribution made by the parties towards the overall welfare of the family after
                    considering all the relevant facts and circumstances. Having determined the
                    ratio of <em>total direct</em> contribution to the ratio of
                        <em>total indirect</em> contribution of <em>both</em> parties to the marriage, I would then consider the
                        <em>direct</em> contribution component separately from
                    the <em>indirect</em> contribution component. With regard
                    to the <em>direct</em> contribution component, I would
                    assume that, unless the contrary is proven, each party intended to apply and has
                    indeed applied all his or her earnings towards the accumulation of the pool of
                    matrimonial assets such that the sum of his or her net earnings during the
                    marriage (less taxes payable thereon) combined with the matrimonial assets that
                    he or she had brought to the marriage constitute his or her total <em>direct</em> contribution to the marriage and the proportion
                    of each party’s <em>direct</em> contribution is
                    broadly represented by the fraction of his or her total earnings (plus
                    matrimonial assets brought to the marriage by him or her, if any) over the total
                    combined earnings (plus matrimonial assets brought to the marriage by both
                    parties, if any). As for the <em>indirect</em>
                    contribution, I would take into account broadly the parties’ non-financial
                    contributions to the marriage (<em>eg</em>, the time,
                    effort and commitment looking after the welfare of the family and bringing up
                    the children, the support and assistance that one party may have given to the
                    other to aid that party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business,
                    and their business acumen or investment abilities which may have contributed to
                    an increase in value of the pool of matrimonial assets). Next, I would sum up
                    each party’s <em>direct and indirect</em>
                    contributions to the marriage and determine the ratio of the husband’s
                    total (<em>direct and indirect</em>) contribution to the
                    wife’s total (<em>direct and indirect</em>)
                    contribution. Finally, I would take into account any assets expended by the
                    husband and/or the wife for his or her own benefit which I find must be
                    subtracted from his or her share of the matrimonial assets (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> and <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The methodology</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The precise steps in this methodology are as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 1: The total net value of matrimonial assets to be
                distributed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The <em>notional</em>
                    total net value of matrimonial assets to be distributed will be referred to as
                        S$<em>A</em> (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). I will first determine that
                    full disclosure has been made of all matrimonial assets that the parties have
                    accumulated in the course of the marriage (as defined in s 112(10) of the
                    Women’s Charter) and all such matrimonial assets including any liabilities
                    have been fully accounted for. Basically, the list of matrimonial assets and the
                    outstanding liabilities existing as at the date of the interim judgment must be
                    complete and as clearly identified as possible. This would ensure that the
                    calculation of the total net value of matrimonial assets available for
                    distribution (S$<em>m</em> – see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) is as accurate as
                possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As discussed above, for present purposes, the
                    course of marriage runs from the date of marriage to the date the interim
                    judgment is granted. The value to be taken of any matrimonial asset existing at
                    the date of interim judgment and still in existence now is the net value of that
                    asset as at the date of this judgment, which should preferably be determined by
                    a qualified independent valuer if the asset is not in the nature of cash or
                    fixed deposits. However, if any matrimonial asset (acquired before the date of
                    the interim judgment) has been sold or liquidated either before or after the
                    date of interim judgment and the net proceeds of sale are only received and
                    banked into the parties’ bank accounts subsequent to the grant of interim
                    judgment, then the price at which the asset was sold or the amount obtained
                    after liquidation (less loan repayment and other incidental expenses incurred in
                    the sale or liquidation) will be used as the net value of that asset. The total
                    value of any matrimonial asset (including cash) proved to have been unfairly or
                    unjustly dissipated by a party during the course of the marriage until the date
                    of the interim judgment (S$<em>n</em> – see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> and <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    above), or expended by either party for a personal investment in which the other
                    party cannot reasonably have expected to participate in (S$<em>p</em> – see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), and which must be accounted
                    for as part of the just and equitable distribution of the matrimonial assets as
                    if the assets have not been dissipated, will have to be notionally added to the
                    total net value of matrimonial assets available for distribution, giving
                        S$<em>A</em> as the <em>notional</em> total net value of matrimonial assets available for
                    distribution. This will be accounted for at steps 7 and 8 (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> and <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 2: The percentage of <em>direct</em>
                contributions of both parties (“<em>B</em>%”) and
                    <em>indirect</em> contributions of both parties
                    (“<em>C</em>%”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I reiterate that the <em>total</em> contribution (of <em>both</em>
                    parties) to the matrimonial assets consists of two components, <em>ie</em>, the <em>direct</em> and
                        <em>indirect</em> contribution components. Based on an
                    assessment of the relative importance or weightage of the <em>direct</em> contribution to the <em>indirect</em> contribution towards the overall welfare of the family,
                    I will determine the percentage of the <em>total</em>
                    contribution (of <em>both</em> parties) to the family that
                    represents the <em>total direct</em> contribution (of
                        <em>both</em> parties) (“<em>B</em>%”). I would also determine the percentage of the
                        <em>total</em> contribution (of <em>both</em> parties) to the family that represents the <em>total indirect</em> contribution (of <em>both</em> parties) (“<em>C</em>%”). <em>B</em>% and <em>C</em>% together will add up to 100%, being the <em>total direct</em> and <em>indirect</em>
                    contributions of <em>both</em> parties towards the marriage
                    partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The ratio of <em>B</em>%
                    to <em>C</em>% must necessarily depend on the facts of the
                    case. Examples of some factors which may affect the relative weightage or
                    importance of the total indirect contribution as against the total direct
                    contribution in the division of matrimonial assets and hence the overall ratio
                    to be applied are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     the length of the
                    marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        number of children in the family;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     the existence of a third party carer (<em>eg</em>, maids);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     the extent of the giving of assistance or support to the
                        other party including the extent of the giving of assistance or support
                        which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or
                        business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"></a>(e)     the total amount of time and effort that <em>both</em>
                        parties had spent looking after the welfare of the family, including looking
                        after and improving the home and other matrimonial assets, caring for the
                        family, bringing up each of their children and taking care of any other aged
                        or infirm relative or dependant of either party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    total amount of time and effort that <em>both</em> parties
                    have spent at work or at the business during the course of the marriage in order
                    to earn the incomes that provide the <em>direct</em>
                    financial contributions of <em>both</em> parties towards
                    the welfare of the family must also be factored into the assessment of the
                    relative weightage of <em>direct and indirect</em>
                    contributions by <em>both</em> parties in order to
                    determine the most appropriate ratio of <em>B</em>% to
                        <em>C</em>% to achieve a just and equitable division of
                    the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The further subdivision of both <em>B</em>% and <em>C</em>% into the
                    respective proportions made by <em>each</em> party must
                    still be done and this will be considered separately in steps 3 and 4
                    respectively. If the respective proportions that <em>each</em> party in fact contributed to <em>each</em> of the <em>B</em>% and <em>C</em>% components are not ascertained by carefully
                    considering all the relevant factual evidence provided, then it will not be
                    possible to make any order on the proportion or manner in which to divide the
                    matrimonial assets between the parties. Unfortunately, this can be a tedious
                    exercise and is no easy task. Nevertheless, the court still has to carry it
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 3: The <em>direct</em> contribution of
                    <em>each</em> party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The <em>direct</em>
                    contribution of <em>each</em> party to the pool of
                    matrimonial assets as at the date of interim judgment will be considered.
                        <em>Direct</em> contributions are generally monetary
                    contributions towards the marriage partnership by both parties arising from
                    their employment and/or business. I will determine the husband’s share of
                    the total <em>direct</em> contribution of both parties to
                    be “<em>D</em>%”. I will also determine the
                    wife’s share of the total <em>direct</em>
                    contribution of both parties to be “<em>E</em>%”. <em>D</em>% and <em>E</em>% together should add up to 100%, representing the total
                        <em>direct</em> contribution of both parties towards
                    the marriage partnership. The ratio of the husband’s share to the
                    wife’s share of the total direct contribution is therefore <em>D</em>%:<em>E</em>%. In determining a
                    party’s <em>direct</em> contribution to the family,
                    unless disputed, I will assume that that party has applied all matrimonial
                    assets (as defined in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter) that he or
                    she has received in the course of the marriage to the welfare of the family.
                    This includes that party’s earned salary, other monetary emoluments and
                    other income from business (including stock options earned) and the amount he or
                    she has accumulated in his or her CPF account. I will then multiply both
                        <em>D</em>% and <em>E</em>% by
                        <em>B</em>% separately to obtain <em>DB</em>% as the percentage of matrimonial assets for distribution
                    which is to be awarded to the husband arising from his <em>direct</em> contribution to the family and <em>EB</em>% as the percentage of matrimonial assets for distribution
                    which is to be awarded to the wife arising from her <em>direct</em> contribution to the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is pertinent to point out at this juncture
                    that if a party chooses not to make full disclosure of all of his or her
                        <em>direct</em> contribution (for reasons best known to
                    that party which could perhaps be to avoid having to pay a higher maintenance to
                    the other party by understating any part of his or her own earnings or income
                    during the entirety of the period between the date of the marriage until the
                    date of the interim judgment), then that party will be disadvantaged as its
                    percentage <em>direct</em> contribution will become less
                    than it should otherwise be and accordingly, that party will eventually receive
                    a smaller share of the matrimonial assets that are available for distribution.
                    Hence, parties may well disadvantage themselves if they understate their
                        <em>direct</em> contributions or their earned income
                    and other emoluments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I would also point out that the state of the
                    evidence before the court (perhaps due to the long history of the marriage and
                    the fact that the parties may not have kept every tax assessment or bank
                    statements etc. to prove their precise <em>direct</em>
                    financial contribution to the marriage) will often make it difficult for the
                    court to arrive at a more precise determination of the <em>direct</em> contribution of each party to the marriage. In these
                    circumstances, a rough and ready approximation will be made of the <em>direct</em> contribution of each party to the marriage in
                    light of the available evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 4: The <em>indirect</em> contribution of
                    <em>each</em> party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I will determine the husband’s share of
                    the <em>total indirect</em> contribution of both parties to
                    be “<em>F</em>%”. I will also determine the
                    wife’s share of the <em>total indirect</em>
                    contributions of both parties to be “<em>G</em>%”. Again, <em>F</em>% and <em>G</em>% together should be 100%, representing the <em>total indirect</em> contribution of <em>both</em> parties towards the marriage partnership. The ratio of the
                    husband’s share to the wife’s share of the <em>total
                        indirect</em> contribution is therefore <em>F</em>%:<em>G</em>%. I will then multiply both
                        <em>F</em>% and <em>G</em>% by
                        <em>C</em>% separately to obtain <em>FC</em>% as the percentage of matrimonial assets which is to be
                    awarded to the husband arising from his <em>indirect</em>
                    contribution to the family, and <em>GC</em>% as the
                    percentage of matrimonial assets which is to be awarded to the wife arising from
                    her <em>indirect</em> contribution to the
                family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 5: The value of matrimonial assets to be distributed to the
                husband</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     To obtain the <em>notional</em> value of the matrimonial assets to be distributed to
                    the husband, I will accordingly sum up the total percentage of matrimonial
                    assets for distribution which is to be awarded to the husband arising from
                        <em>both</em> his <em>direct</em>
                    and <em>indirect</em> contributions to the family
                        (<em>DB</em>% + <em>FC</em>%) and
                    multiply this by the <em>notional</em> total value of all
                    the matrimonial assets available for distribution (S$<em>A</em>). The <em>notional</em> value of the
                    matrimonial assets to be distributed to the husband will thus be S$<em>A</em>(<em>DB</em>% + <em>FC</em>%).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 6: The value of matrimonial assets to be distributed to the
                wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     To obtain the <em>notional</em> value of the matrimonial assets to be distributed to
                    the wife, I will similarly sum up the percentage of matrimonial assets for
                    distribution which is to be awarded to the wife arising from <em>both</em> her <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em> contributions to the family (<em>EB</em>% + <em>GC</em>%) and multiply this by
                    the total <em>notional</em> value of all the matrimonial
                    assets available for distribution (S$<em>A</em>). The
                        <em>notional</em> value of the matrimonial assets to be
                    distributed to the wife will thus be S$<em>A</em>(<em>EB</em>% + <em>GC</em>%).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 7: The deduction of the value of assets dissipated or expended
                exclusively for one party’s purposes from the amount of matrimonial assets to
                be distributed to that party responsible for that dissipation or exclusive
                expenditure </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     If any money or asset has been proved to be
                    unjustly dissipated from the pool of matrimonial assets due to certain vices by
                    either the husband or the wife or expended by one party for the acquisition of
                    any personal investment in circumstances in which both parties do not intend the
                    other party to participate in such investment, the total value of such assets
                    (or fraction thereof that is just and equitable) as has been dissipated or
                    expended by the husband or the wife will have to be deducted from the <em>notional</em> total amount that the party receives in Step 5
                    or Step 6 respectively. Assuming the husband has removed S$<em>H</em> worth of assets from the pool of matrimonial assets
                        (S$<em>A</em> as assessed in Step 1), the <em>actual</em> value of the matrimonial assets which will be
                    distributed to him will thus be [S$<em>A</em>(<em>DB</em>% + <em>FC</em>%) - S$<em>H</em>]. If the wife has removed S$<em>J</em> worth of assets from the pool of matrimonial assets
                        (S$<em>A</em> as assessed in Step 1), the <em>actual</em> value of the matrimonial assets which would be
                    distributed to her will thus be [S$<em>A</em>(<em>EB</em>% + <em>GC</em>%) - S$<em>J</em>]. In the absence of any complaint of dissipation from
                    any party, it will be assumed that no such unjust dissipation has occurred
                    during the marriage necessitating a penalisation of the guilty party concerned
                    by the corresponding deduction to be made to that party’s share of the
                    matrimonial assets. For clarity, S$(<em>H+J</em>) is equal
                    to S$(<em>n+p</em>) in <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 8: The final value of matrimonial assets to be distributed to
                    <em>each</em> party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     From the values of the matrimonial assets
                    finally received by the parties as calculated in the steps shown above, the
                        <em>final ratio</em> between the value of the
                    matrimonial assets to be received by the husband and the value of the
                    matrimonial assets to be received by the wife can then be calculated as
                        [S$<em>A</em>(<em>DB</em>% +
                        <em>FC</em>%) - S$<em>H</em>]:[S$<em>A</em>(<em>EB</em>% + <em>GC</em>%) - S$<em>J</em>]. The sum of these two amounts (and this can be proved
                    mathematically) will always be equal to S$<em>m</em>, being
                    the actual total net value of matrimonial assets available for distribution, and
                    not the <em>notional</em> total net value of matrimonial
                    assets available for distribution. In other words, [S$<em>A</em>(<em>DB</em>% + <em>FC</em>%) - S$<em>H</em>] added to [S$<em>A</em>(<em>EB</em>% + <em>GC</em>%) - S$<em>J</em>] always equals
                        S$<em>m</em>. This <em>final
                        ratio</em> in <em>percentage terms</em> will be
                        {[S$<em>A</em>(<em>DB</em>% +
                        <em>FC</em>%) - S$<em>H</em>] ×100
                        ÷ S$<em>m</em>} : {[S$<em>A</em>(<em>EB</em>% + <em>GC</em>%) - S$<em>J</em>] ×100
                        ÷ S$<em>m</em>}. This constant ratio
                    may be applied to the total pool of matrimonial assets actually valued at the
                    total net amount of S$<em>m</em> or to the net value of
                    each and every matrimonial asset that will be distributed between the parties if
                    such assets are to be distributed individually. In my view, so long as the
                    allocation of assets as a whole results in an allocation of the net value of
                    assets to the parties that approximates the <em>final
                        ratio</em>, it does not matter much as to who gets exactly which of
                    the many houses, cars, pieces of jewellery and so on. After the <em>final ratio</em> is ordered by the court, it may be better to
                    leave to the parties to sort out the detailed allocation of assets by themselves
                    to approximate the <em>final ratio</em> set by the court,
                    with liberty to apply to the court if parties cannot agree on the detailed
                    allocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Distribution of the matrimonial assets in the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having considered the submissions of both
                    parties and the affidavits filed in support of their submissions, I am of the
                    view that, on a broad-brush approach, the matrimonial assets available for
                    distribution (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> and <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) should be divided between the husband
                    and the wife such that the <em>actual</em> total net value
                    of the matrimonial assets that the husband and the wife eventually obtains is in
                    the ratio 20%:80% respectively. As shown below, the application of the above
                    methodology to the facts of the present case broadly confirms the
                    appropriateness of the ratio of 20%:80% that I have decided upon by using the
                    broad-brush approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 1: The total value of the matrimonial assets to be
                distributed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The precise total value of all the matrimonial
                    assets (less all outstanding liabilities) existing as at the date of the Interim
                    Judgment that the parties have accumulated in the course of the marriage until
                    the date of the Interim Judgment will be calculated by the parties after the
                    valuation of the assets listed at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above
                    is obtained. For present purposes, this will be represented as S$<em>m</em>. As pointed out at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above, the <em>notional</em> total net
                    value of matrimonial assets available for distribution, S$<em>A</em>, includes the sum of S$242,390 which the wife paid between
                    30 January 2007 and 3 February 2007 as deposits towards her purchase
                    of the Malaysian Properties and is therefore equal to S$<em>m</em> + S$242,390. From indicative figures provided by both parties,
                    this would be in the region of S$20 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 2: The percentage of direct and indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I accept that determining the relative
                    percentage weightage to be apportioned between the <em>total
                        direct</em> contribution of <em>both</em> parties
                    versus the <em>total indirect</em> contribution of
                        <em>both</em> parties (<em>ie</em>, the <em>B</em>%:<em>C</em>% ratio) is a difficult exercise as one has to evaluate the
                        <em>relative</em> importance of the total monetary
                    contribution by <em>both</em> parties vis-à-vis the total
                    non-monetary contribution by <em>both</em> parties to get a
                    sense of the appropriate ratio between the <em>total
                        direct</em> contribution of <em>both</em> parties
                    versus the <em>total indirect</em> contribution of
                        <em>both</em> parties. Some may say that the
                    non-monetary contributions by <em>both</em> parties,
                        <em>eg</em>, in providing the tender loving care given
                    to the children in their growing years is priceless and cannot be converted into
                    monetary terms. Be that as it may, the court has to eventually ascertain in
                    actual percentage figures or in monetary terms how exactly to distribute the
                    matrimonial assets between the two parties to the marriage. Assessing their
                        <em>relative</em> importance unfortunately is an
                    exercise that has to be done no matter how difficult and subjective it may be so
                    as to enable the computation of the percentage distribution to each party to be
                    properly carried out to achieve a just and equitable distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the present case, the parties were married
                    in 1995 and 12 years had passed before interim judgment for divorce was granted
                    in 2007. They have three children and had engaged the services of two domestic
                    helpers (the second domestic helper was engaged in 2002) to care for the
                    children and the home. The impact of having a domestic helper in the evaluation
                    is to lessen to some extent the total <em>indirect</em>
                    contribution in terms of sparing the parties the time and effort expended in
                    cooking, washing and cleaning the home which would otherwise comprise part of
                    the indirect contribution to be taken into account of the party attending to
                    such household chores for the welfare of the family. Between them, the parties
                    have amassed matrimonial assets worth more than S$20 million. They have worked
                    hard at their jobs to earn the monies which enabled them to accumulate those
                    assets. Both parties have also spent much time and effort looking after the
                    children and taking care of their meals and schoolwork. Additionally, the
                    parties have invested in matrimonial assets such as the gold, silver, Australian
                    Property and South African Property. Time and effort have also been spent
                    looking after and improving the properties. In these circumstances, I find that
                    a fair and equitable allocation of the <em>total
                        direct</em> contribution to the marriage (of both parties) is in the
                    region of about 65% of the total contribution to the marriage whilst the
                        <em>total indirect</em> contribution to the marriage
                    (of both parties) is in the region of about 35% of the total contribution to the
                    marriage. The ratio of <em>B</em>% to <em>C</em>% of <em>total direct</em> to <em>total indirect</em> contributions of <em>both</em> parties is therefore 65%:35%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 3: The percentage <em>direct</em>
                contribution of each party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the present case, the <em>direct</em> contribution of each party to the marriage will be
                    treated as all income (less tax liabilities) received by that party during the
                    course of the marriage, together with any amount brought by that party to the
                    marriage and ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties during the marriage
                    within s112(10) of the Women’s Charter. In the calculation of the
                    parties’ direct contribution to the marriage, some degree of approximation
                    and estimation is necessary (such as estimation of the currency exchange rates
                    and the amount of foreign taxes paid etc.). However, this is unlikely to affect
                    the calculation of the ratio of the parties’ earnings in any significant
                    way due to the fact that the <em>total direct</em>
                    contribution is a very large sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The husband was working in Hong Kong from 1994
                    to March 1996. The marriage only took place in August 1995. However, apart from
                    producing his contract of employment and letters regarding bonuses paid to him
                    by his employer in Hong Kong to show that his total earnings between 1994 and
                    March 1996 amounted to HK$2,061,119, the Husband was unable to show the precise
                    amount that he had brought to the marriage in August 1995, <em>eg</em>, the amount standing in his bank account as at the date of
                    marriage. Moreover, the husband was unable to produce copies of his Hong Kong
                    tax assessment. In these circumstances, I would allow the husband to treat 50%
                    of the sum of HK$2,061,119 as part of his <em>direct</em>
                    contribution to the marriage. This amounts to HK$1,030,559.50 or approximately
                    S$187,561.83.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The husband started work in Singapore in April
                    1996. The husband has produced IRAS statements for the Years of Assessment 1997
                    to 2007 to evidence his income earned from employment during the course of the
                    marriage. From these IRAS statements, it appears that the Husband earned a total
                    of S$2,417,350.50 between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006. His tax
                    liabilities incurred for this period was S$425,512.51. The income earned and tax
                    liability incurred by the husband in the year 2007 but before the date of the
                    Interim Judgment (<em>ie</em>, from 1 January 2007 to
                    16 March 2007 but excluding 16 March 2007) will be estimated from the
                    figures stated in the husband’s IRAS statement for the Year of Assessment
                    2008 where his earnings was stated as S$502,659.00 and the tax liability
                    incurred was stated as S$73,971.80. This amounts to estimated earnings of
                    S$101,908.95 and a tax liability of S$14,997.02 pro-rated for the period from
                    1 January 2007 to 15 March 2007 (the day before the date of the
                    Interim Judgment). Summing up his earnings from employment less the tax
                    liabilities he paid on such income from 1996 to the date of interim judgment,
                    and adding the sum of S$187,561.83, the husband’s total <em>direct</em> financial contribution to the marriage is estimated at
                    S$2,266,311.75.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The wife was employed throughout the course of
                    marriage. She produced IRAS statements for the Years of Assessment 1997 to 2007
                    to evidence her income from employment during the course of marriage. From the
                    wife’s IRAS statements, it appears that she had earned a total of
                    S$18,807,777.64 and incurred a tax liability of S$3,935,182.99 between
                    1 January 1996 and 31 December 2006. Since the Interim Judgment was
                    granted on 16 March 2007, the income earned and tax liability incurred by the
                    wife in the year 2007 but before the date of interim judgment (<em>ie</em>, from 1 January 2007 to 16 March 2007 but
                    excluding 16 March 2007) will be estimated from the figures stated in the
                    wife’s IRAS statement for the Year of Assessment 2008 where her earnings
                    was stated as S$3,359,558.00 and the tax liability incurred was stated as
                    S$643,707.60. This amounts to estimated earnings of S$681,115.87 and a tax
                    liability of S$130,505.10 pro-rated for the period from 1 January 2007 to
                    15 March 2007 (the day before the date of the Interim Judgment). The wife
                    also incurred US tax liabilities of approximately US$564,000 (or
                        S$789,600).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In 2008 and 2009, the wife also exercised
                    stock options which were awarded to her during her course of employment and
                    before the date of Interim Judgment. As calculated at [8(e)] above, the amount
                    earned from the wife’s exercise of the stock options, less tax
                    liabilities, is approximately S$5,283,979.12. Summing up her earnings from
                    employment less the tax liabilities she paid on such income from 1996 to the
                    date of the Interim Judgment, the wife’s total <em>direct</em> financial contribution to the marriage is estimated at
                    S$19,917,584.54.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The ratio of the husband’s <em>direct</em> financial contribution (<em>D</em>%) to the marriage to the wife’s <em>direct</em> financial contribution (<em>E</em>%)
                    to the marriage is S$2,266,311.75:S$19,917,584.54 or 10.22%:89.78%. In the
                    absence of evidence showing otherwise, it is safe to assume that the ratio
                    10.22%:89.78% also broadly approximates the ratio of the husband’s overall
                        <em>direct</em> contribution to the marriage to the
                    wife’s overall <em>direct</em> contribution to the
                    marriage. As such, the husband’s <em>direct</em>
                    contribution to the marriage would entitle him to claim <em>DB</em>% or 10.22% × 65% = 6.64% of the total
                    contributions to the marriage and the wife’s <em>direct</em> contribution to the marriage would entitle her to claim
                        <em>EB</em>% or 89.78% × 65% =
                    58.36% of the total contributions to the marriage. As can be seen, 6.64% added
                    to 58.36% equals exactly to 65% (<em>ie</em>, <em>B</em>%), which is the percentage originally estimated as the
                    percentage weightage assigned to the <em>direct</em>
                    contribution of <em>both</em> parties to the marriage (as
                    opposed to the percentage weightage of 35% (<em>ie</em>,
                        <em>C</em>%) assigned to the <em>indirect</em> contribution of <em>both</em>
                    parties to the marriage). The logic is that the <em>direct</em> contribution of <em>each</em> party
                    when added together must exactly equal the <em>total
                        direct</em> contribution of <em>both</em>
                    parties, and this is confirmed by the figures obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 4: The percentage <em>indirect</em>
                contribution of each party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is undisputed that the wife played an
                    important role in the household and the children’s upbringing. In his
                    affidavit, the husband acknowledged that the wife was a “good mother and
                    wife” and described how the wife would, amongst other things, call home
                    when she travelled, look after the husband’s parents when they visited,
                    feed the children during the week during the period 1998 to 2001 when both
                    parties were working, put the children to bed and read them stories when she was
                    not travelling, help with the children’s schoolwork, oversee the
                    family’s meals and make the baby food from scratch, buy most of the
                    children’s clothes, shoes, toys and presents, research the cause of and
                    treatment of the children’s skin conditions and help plan the
                    family’s social schedule. It is also undisputed that the husband was
                    unemployed from May 2001 to March 2006 and that the husband was diagnosed with
                    ADD in 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As alluded to earlier in <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above, what the parties disagree on is the
                    extent to which the husband had indirectly contributed to the family,
                    particularly during the period when he was unemployed. The wife claims that the
                    husband kept to himself, was easily angered and often vented his anger on the
                    family. It is the wife’s position that the husband voluntarily left his
                    job in 2001 as he could not cope with the stress of his job. The wife submits
                    that despite the fact that the husband was unemployed, he did not relieve the
                    wife of the load of the household and the children’s responsibilities but
                    instead added to them as she had to look after his welfare as well. On the other
                    hand, the husband argues that both parties have contributed equally to the
                    wellbeing of the family. In his affidavit, the husband states that he, amongst
                    other things, assisted the children with their homework and projects, helped
                    with the grocery and fruit shopping, bought the heavy household cleaning
                    products and dealt with the personal, health and employment problems of their
                    domestic helpers. Whilst he acknowledged that he worked longer hours than the
                    wife in the period 1998 to 2001 such that he was unable to help with the feeding
                    of the children during the week, the husband claims that during the period when
                    he was unemployed, he supervised the home and children, particularly during the
                    day and when the wife was travelling, and oversaw the parties’
                    investments. He had also supervised the construction of the parties’
                    houses in Australia and South Africa which adds to his <em>indirect</em> contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Counsel for the husband submitted that the
                        <em>indirect</em> contribution of the husband and the
                    wife should be in the ratio 40%:60% respectively for the period 1995 to 2001 and
                    in the ratio 60%:40% respectively for the period 2001 to 2006, averaging at an
                    equal indirect contribution from both parties. Counsel for the wife submitted
                    that the indirect contribution of the husband and the wife should be in the
                    ratio 20%:80% respectively for the period 1995 to 2006 on the basis that even
                    whilst he was unemployed, the husband did not contribute much to the welfare of
                    the family, possibly due to his ADD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Having heard counsel for both parties on this
                    issue, I am of the view that the <em>indirect</em>
                    contribution of the husband and the wife for the entire duration of the marriage
                    is probably in the ratio 40:60 respectively (<em>ie</em>,
                        <em>F</em>%:<em>G</em>%) . At best
                    for the husband, the highest this ratio can go, in my view, is 50:50. Earlier, I
                    have established that the <em>total indirect</em>
                    contribution of <em>both</em> parties is 35% (<em>ie</em>, C%) of the <em>total</em>
                    contributions (both <em>direct and indirect</em>) to the
                    marriage. As such, on the basis of the 40:60 ratio, the husband’s
                        <em>indirect</em> contribution to the marriage is 14%
                        (<em>ie</em>, 40% × 35% or <em>FC</em>%) of the <em>total</em>
                    contributions to the marriage whereas the wife’s <em>indirect</em> contribution to the marriage is 21% (<em>ie</em>, 60% × 35% or <em>GC</em>%) of the <em>total</em> contribution to
                    the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 5: The <em>notional</em> value of
                matrimonial assets to be distributed to the husband</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The <em>notional</em>
                    value of matrimonial assets to be distributed to the husband is the sum of the
                    percentage of his <em>direct</em> (6.64% <em>ie</em>, <em>DB</em>%) and <em>indirect</em> (14% <em>ie</em>, <em>FC</em>%) contributions to the marriage multiplied by the
                    total <em>notional</em> value of the matrimonial assets for
                    distribution (S$<em>A</em> – see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). This amounts to S$<em>x</em> based on the simple calculation S$<em>A</em>(<em>DB</em>% + <em>FC</em>%). Assuming the total <em>notional</em>
                    value of the matrimonial assets for distribution is approximately S$20 million
                    (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above), S$<em>x</em> would amount to S$20,000,000(6.64% + 14%) or
                    S$4,128,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 6: The <em>notional</em> value of
                matrimonial assets to be distributed to the wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The <em>notional</em>
                    value of matrimonial assets to be distributed to the wife is the sum of the
                    percentage of her direct (58.36% <em>ie</em>, <em>EB</em>%) and indirect (21% <em>ie</em>,
                        <em>GC</em>%) contributions to the marriage multiplied
                    by the total <em>notional</em> value of the matrimonial
                    assets available for distribution (S$<em>A</em> – see
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). This amounts to S$<em>y</em> based on the simple calculation S$<em>A</em>(<em>EB</em>% + <em>GC</em>%). Assuming the total <em>notional</em>
                    value of the matrimonial assets for distribution is approximately S$20 million,
                        S$<em>y</em> would amount to S$20,000,000(58.36% + 21%)
                    or S$15,872,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 7: The deduction of the value of assets dissipated or expended
                exclusively for one party’s purposes from the amount of matrimonial assets to
                be distributed to that party responsible for that dissipation or exclusive
                expenditure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     There is no evidence of any dissipation of
                    matrimonial assets on the part of the husband. As such, S$<em>H</em> is S$0 and the <em>actual</em> value of
                    matrimonial assets to be distributed to the husband remains as S$<em>x</em> or S$4,128,000. The wife paid S$242,390 between
                    30 January 2007 and 3 February 2007 as deposits for the purchase of
                    the Malaysian Properties. This amount (S$<em>J</em>) will
                    be deducted from the <em>notional</em> amount of
                    matrimonial assets (S$<em>y</em>) to be distributed to her.
                    The <em>actual</em> value of the matrimonial assets to be
                    distributed to the wife is thus S$(<em>y</em>-242,390). As
                    the total value of the matrimonial assets available for distribution is
                    estimated at S$20 million less S$242,390 (or S$19,757,610), the actual value of
                    the matrimonial assets that the husband is entitled to would be S$4,128,000
                        (<em>ie</em>, S$<em>x</em>) and
                    the actual value of the matrimonial assets that the wife is entitled to would be
                    S$15,629,610 (<em>ie</em>, S$(<em>y</em>-242,390) or S$15,872,000 – S$242,390 =
                    S$15,629,610).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Step 8: The final value of matrimonial assets to be distributed to
                each party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Given that the assets are not held in joint
                    names and instead of distributing each asset individually according to a
                    stipulated ratio, I will distribute the assets as a whole in accordance with the
                    ratio for distribution S$<em>x</em>:S$(<em>y</em> –242,390), which has to be applied to the total actual
                    net value of the matrimonial assets of S$19,757,610 (which is represented by
                        S$<em>m</em> – see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, or S$<em>A</em> - S$242,390, or
                    S$20 million less S$242,390). I have calculated this ratio to be 20.89%:79.11%
                    (which is based on the ratio S$4,128,000:S$15,629,610). This ratio of
                    20.89%:79.11% arrived at through this methodology supports the distribution
                    ratio of 20%:80%, which I have determined by adopting the broad-brush
                    approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Manner in which the assets will be distributed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It will facilitate matters for the parties
                    that assets held in the name of a party are allocated to that party where it is
                    possible to do so (and not to the other party). However the total values of the
                    assets distributed to the respective parties must still conform to the ratio of
                    20% of S$<em>m</em> to the husband and 80% of S$<em>m</em> to the wife. As explained at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, the parties are to work out the
                    values of all matrimonial assets existing as at the date of the Interim
                    Judgment. As stated earlier, S$<em>m</em> represents the
                    total sum of the net values of all such matrimonial assets. The parties will
                    then have to allocate the assets between themselves in such a way that the
                    husband receives 20% of S$<em>m</em> and the wife receives
                    80% of S$<em>m</em>. If parties are unable to agree on the
                    manner in which the assets are to be distributed, they may apply to the court
                    for guidance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A sensitivity analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     A sensitivity analysis will now be conducted
                    to determine the difference between the amount of matrimonial assets that I have
                    decided to award to the husband and the more generous amount which he sought to
                    claim (which I am not prepared to allow). The husband submitted that the ratio
                    of <em>total direct</em> contribution to <em>total indirect</em> contribution of <em>both</em> parties to the marriage (step 2) should be 50%:50% and that
                    the ratio of <em>indirect</em> contribution of the husband
                    to the <em>indirect</em> contribution of the wife should
                    also be 50%:50%. I am of the view that, taking the husband’s case at its
                    highest (which I am not prepared to accept in the present case), at best, the
                    ratio of <em>total direct</em> contribution to <em>total indirect</em> contribution may be 60%:40% whilst the
                    ratio of <em>indirect</em> contribution of the husband to
                    the <em>indirect</em> contribution of the wife may be
                    50%:50%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Taking the best case scenario for the husband
                    (which I am not prepared to accept in the present case), the husband’s
                        <em>indirect</em> contribution to the marriage will
                    then be 20% (<em>ie</em>, 50% × 40% or
                        <em>FC</em>%) of the <em>total</em> contribution to the marriage and the wife’s
                        <em>indirect</em> contribution to the marriage is also
                    20% (<em>ie</em>, 50% × 40% or <em>GC</em>%) of the <em>total</em>
                    contribution to the marriage. However, the husband’s <em>direct</em> contribution to the marriage will remain low at 6.132%
                        (<em>ie</em>, 60% × 10.22% or
                        <em>DB</em>%) whilst the wife’s <em>direct</em> contribution to the marriage will still be much
                    higher at 53.868% (<em>ie</em>, 60% ×
                    89.78% or <em>EB</em>%). The sum of the percentage of the
                    husband’s <em>direct</em> (6.132%) <em>and indirect</em> (20%) contributions to the marriage multiplied by
                    the <em>notional</em> total net value of the matrimonial
                    assets available for distribution, assuming that S$<em>A</em> is approximately S$20 million would amount to S$5,226,400. The
                    sum of the percentage of the wife’s <em>direct</em>
                    (53.868%) and <em>indirect</em> (20%) contributions to the
                    marriage multiplied by S$<em>A</em>, assuming that is S$20
                    million, would amount to S$14,773,600. Deducting the sum of S$242,390 from the
                        <em>notional</em> value of matrimonial assets to be
                    distributed to the wife, she will be awarded matrimonial assets totalling
                    S$14,531,210. The ratio between the <em>actual</em> total
                    value of matrimonial assets to be distributed to the husband and that to be
                    distributed to the wife would be S$5,226,400:S$14,531,210 or 26.45%:73.55%. This
                    is approximately 25%:75%. When compared with the ratio of 20%:80%, this is
                    merely a change of approximately 5%, even when taking the best possible case for
                    the husband. On no account based on the facts of this case can I see a division
                    ratio in the region of 50%:50% which is what the husband is asking
                for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance of the children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The wife has been unemployed since August
                    2009. Her last drawn salary was S$57,000 per month plus bonus stock options and
                    other benefits. She resigned in July 2009. The husband started work in May 2006
                    and is earning S$27,000 per month plus bonus. When the Interim Judgment was
                    granted on 16 March 2007, a consent order was made relating to the three
                    children. It was agreed that there would be joint custody of the children, the
                    wife would have care and control of the children, and the husband would have
                    liberal access to the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The husband has been paying 50% of the
                    children’s school fees plus S$2,000 per month as contribution for the
                    children’s expenses since January 2007. This amounts to a total of S$5,700
                    per month for the three children. The husband is happy to continue to pay as he
                    has been doing. However, the wife claims that the monthly expenditure for each
                    child including school fees is S$4,985. Together, the wife submits that the
                    children cost S$14,955 per month to maintain. The wife argues that since she is
                    not working and is looking after the children full time, the husband should
                    contribute more than half of the children’s expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In determining the amount of maintenance to be
                    paid to the wife by the husband for the maintenance of the three children,
                    s 127 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    provides that the court may order a parent to pay maintenance for the benefit of
                    his child in such manner as the court thinks fit and that the provisions of
                    Parts VIII and IX of the Women’s Charter shall apply, with necessary
                    modifications, to an application for maintenance and a maintenance order.
                    Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter, which is found in Part VIII of the
                    Women’s Charter, provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) The court, when ordering maintenance for a wife or child
                        under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case
                        including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the financial needs of the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the income, earning capacity (if any), property and
                            other financial resources of the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) any physical or mental disability of the wife or
                            child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration
                            of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) the contributions made by each of the parties to the
                            marriage to the welfare of the family, including any
                            contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the
                            family;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child
                            before the husband or parent, as the case may be, neglected or
                            refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g) in the case of a child, the manner in which he was
                            being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be,
                            educated or trained; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(h) the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if
                            the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court  be
                            inequitable to disregard it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Although the wife has resigned from her job,
                    her earning capacity is high, as can be gleaned from her last-drawn salary.
                    Moreover, in view of the fact that she owns several properties, one in Singapore
                    and three in Malaysia which she acquired after the date of the Interim Judgment
                    and has been awarded 80% of the matrimonial assets available for distribution,
                    she has adequate financial resources to provide for herself and the children. As
                    such, I find that it would be just and equitable for the husband and wife to pay
                    an equal amount for the maintenance of the children. I am of the view that a
                    reasonable sum to be paid by the husband for the monthly maintenance of all
                    three children is half of their school fees plus S$2,375. The monthly
                    maintenance of S$2,375 is derived from the following calculation:</p>

                    that covered by medical insurance and visits to an orthodontist (collectively
                    referred to as “Ad-hoc Activities”) may be claimed from the
                    Husband on a reimbursement basis upon production of receipts. Any expenditure on
                    a driver, children’s toys, pets, enrichment books (excluding books
                    required as part of the children’s school curriculum) and holidays will
                    not be shared but will be borne by the party who chooses to incur such
                    expenditure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Thus, I order that the husband is to pay the
                    wife S$2,375 a month for the maintenance of all three children and that he
                    contributes 50% of the children’s school fees and any lump sum expenditure
                    incurred for Ad-hoc Activities on a reimbursement basis upon production of
                    receipts. As there is only a small difference (<em>ie</em>
                    $375 a month) between what the husband has already been paying previously to the
                    wife for the monthly maintenance of the children and the amount that he is now
                    ordered to pay, I will not backdate the maintenance payments to the date of the
                    Interim Judgment. Payment under this order of maintenance is to commence from
                    the date of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I order that the parties distribute the
                    matrimonial assets at the date of interim judgment in such a manner that the
                    husband receives 20% of the total net value of matrimonial assets available for
                    distribution (<em>ie</em>, 20% of S$<em>m</em>) and the wife receives 80% of the total net value of
                    matrimonial assets available for distribution (<em>ie</em>,
                    80% of S$<em>m</em>). The matrimonial assets are those
                    listed at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above and the calculation of
                        S$<em>m</em> should be performed as detailed at
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above. I grant the parties liberty to
                    apply to the Court if they are unable to agree on the detailed allocation of the
                    matrimonial assets. The parties should preferably try to work this out on their
                    own first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The husband shall pay the wife 50% of the
                    children’s school fees plus S$2,375 a month for the children’s
                    living expenses. He will also pay the wife 50% of any other lump sum expenditure
                    incurred for Ad-hoc Activities on a reimbursement basis upon production of
                    receipts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I make no order as to costs.</p>
