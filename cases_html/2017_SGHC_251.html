In January 2012, it invested S$1.5m in ACTAtek, Inc (“AI”), through a convertible loan agreement (“CLA”). In May 2012, Tembusu declared a default under the 2012 CLA. The grounds it relied on were that AI had used the proceeds of the loan extended to it under the 2012 CLA in breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Three months after declaring the default, Tembusu brought this action against AI, its chief executive officer, Thomas Wan, and three other defendants. In this action, Tembusu sought damages for breach of the 2012 CLA and for fraudulent misrepresentation in inducing Tembusu to enter into that agreement. In response, AI and Mr Wan brought a counterclaim for damages against Tembusu. In relation to Tembusu’s claim in contract, their position was that AI did not breach any of the terms of the 2012 CLA and that it was in fact Tembusu who was in breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I allowed Tembusu’s claim against AI and Mr Wan but dismissed its counterclaim. I also dismissed Tembusu’s claim against the three other defendants. The three exonerated defendants are of no further significance in this matter. For convenience, therefore, the term “defendants” in this judgment will be used to refer only to AI and Mr Wan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendants appealed against my judgment to the Court of Appeal. Their appeal succeeded. The Court of Appeal held that AI had committed no breach of the 2012 CLA and that it was instead Tembusu who had committed an anticipatory repudiatory breach of that agreement. The Court of Appeal remitted this action to me to assess the damages which Tembusu must pay by reason of that breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The defendants’ principal claim in the assessment is that Tembusu’s breach derailed AI’s planned initial public offering (“IPO”) and thus caused both defendants to lose an opportunity to own shares in a listed company worth some NZ$30.5m. I have rejected the defendants’ claim. I have held that Mr Wan is not entitled to any damages whatsoever because he is not a party to the 2012 CLA. He therefore has no standing to claim contractual damages from Tembusu under that agreement. AI was Tembusu’s only counterparty to the 2012 CLA. But I have awarded it only nominal damages of S$1,000 for breach of that agreement. I find that it did not suffer any loss as a result of the failed listing. Even if it did, I find also that Tembusu’s breach did not cause the failed listing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the first tranche before me, both liability and quantum were in issue. The parties therefore agreed to proceed on the assessment of damages without a fresh evidential phase. They rely only on the evidence adduced at that tranche.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The defendants have appealed against my decision. I therefore now set out my reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ACTAtek, Inc and Mr Wan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 AI is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It is the holding company for a group of companies referred to loosely as the ACTAtek Group. Its business is to provide identification management solutions. The group consists of wholly-owned subsidiaries of AI which are incorporated in Singapore, Hong Kong, the UK, the US and Canada.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Mr Wan is the chief executive officer and a director of both AI and its Singapore subsidiary. He co-founded the ACTAtek Group in 2007.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tembusu invests in AI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In June 2007, Tembusu and AI entered into a CLA under which Tembusu lent US$1.5m to AI. Towards the end of 2011, Tembusu and AI agreed on a term sheet for Tembusu to extend a further convertible loan of S$1.5m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Around the same time, in November 2011, AI, Mr Wan and Tembusu were introduced to a New Zealand company called Investment Research Group Limited (“IRG”) to discuss AI’s planned IPO. IRG is a firm of investment consultants carrying on business in New Zealand. IRG was represented in these discussions by Brent King, its managing director. Mr King explained to the parties the process for listing AI on the New Zealand Alternative Market (“NZAX”), a stock exchange designed for small to medium-sized businesses. A listing on the NZAX must be supported by a sponsor. The purpose of the sponsor is, among other things, to assess the company’s credibility and to assist the company with regulatory compliance. IRG had acted as a sponsor for other companies listed on the NZAX and was to be AI’s sponsor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In January 2012, Tembusu and AI signed a CLA by which Tembusu agreed to extend a second convertible loan to AI. This time, the amount of the loan was S$1.5m rather than US$1.5m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The key terms of the 2012 CLA were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) By cl 5.1, Tembusu was obliged to convert its loan into shares in AI if an IPO took place before 30 June 2013 and had an option to convert its loan into shares in AI if there was no IPO by that date. In both cases, the conversion price was to be at a 50% discount to the assessed value of AI’s shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The important point to note here is that Tembusu had an <span class="font-italic">obligation</span> to convert its loan into shares upon an IPO rather than an <span class="font-italic">option</span> to do so. This point was critical to the Court of Appeal’s finding that Tembusu was in anticipatory repudiatory breach of the 2012 CLA (see [70]–[81] below).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) By cl 6.2, Tembusu had the right to appoint a non-executive director to AI’s board. Tembusu’s first nominee to AI’s board was one Daniel Lee.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) By cl 8.1(e), Tembusu had the right to declare a default if: (i) AI was in material breach of any of its obligations under the 2012 CLA; and (ii) AI failed to remedy that breach within 30 days of committing it, provided that the breach was capable of being remedied.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) By cl 8.2, a default made Tembusu’s S$1.5m loan to AI immediately repayable together with interest on it at 15% per annum compounded annually.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 To satisfy a condition precedent of Tembusu’s obligation to lend under the 2012 CLA, Mr Wan prepared and delivered to Tembusu a document titled “Use of Proceeds” (“UOP”). That document set out AI’s intention as to how it proposed to use the S$1.5m loan which Tembusu was to extend to it under the 2012 CLA. Upon receipt of the UOP, Tembusu disbursed the loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In February 2012, AI gave IRG its formal mandate to list AI on the NZAX. IRG proceeded to prepare AI for listing. The precise steps to be completed for the listing are set out at [99] below. The important point is that the actual vehicle to be listed was to be a new special purpose vehicle to be incorporated in New Zealand, ACTAtek Ltd (“ACTNZ”). ACTNZ would acquire from AI all of the shares in all of AI’s subsidiaries at a value of NZ$30.5m in exchange for ACTNZ issuing and allotting to AI 121.4m new shares in ACTNZ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tembusu declares a default </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In May 2012, Tembusu discovered that AI had used part of the proceeds of the 2012 CLA to repay a loan of US$260,000 which it owed to a shareholder of AI, Hectrix, Inc. Mr Wan is a shareholder of Hectrix, Inc. Although this loan pre-dated the 2012 CLA, AI had failed to disclose it to Tembusu in the negotiations for the 2012 CLA. Further, the UOP (see [14] above) had made no mention of AI’s intention to use the proceeds of the 2012 CLA to repay this loan. Tembusu was also alarmed because Mr Wan effected the repayment without approval from AI’s board. As a result, Tembusu’s nominee on the board (see [13(b)] above) was not alerted to the repayment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Tembusu considered AI’s use of the proceeds of the 2012 CLA to repay this loan to be a breach of contract. On 16 May 2012, Tembusu’s solicitors wrote to AI declaring a default under the 2012 CLA.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Thomas Wan’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief dated 9 May 2014 at pp 1107 to 1108.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The default was said to be: (a) the failure to disclose the Hectrix loan, constituting a breach of warranty under the 2012 CLA; and (b) AI’s use of the proceeds of the 2012 CLA to repay the Hectrix loan without Tembusu’s consent, the repayment not being a use set out in the UOP. This letter also contained a demand for AI to repay the entire principal advanced under the 2012 CLA by 23 May 2012, failing which Tembusu would commence proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 AI did not repay Tembusu as demanded. In August 2012, Tembusu commenced this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 AI’s listing on the NZAX did not take place. Whether that was caused by Tembusu is one of the principal disputes in this case and is an issue to which I will return.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The litigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Tembusu’s claim which is relevant for present purposes was its claim in contract that AI had breached an express or an implied term of the 2012 CLA which obliged AI to use the proceeds of the 2012 CLA only for the uses set out in the UOP. Tembusu’s case was that this breach entitled it to declare a default, and that the default it had declared on 16 May 2012 had accelerated AI’s obligation to repay the S$1.5m lent under the 2012 CLA. In addition, Tembusu argued that the default under the 2012 CLA had triggered a cross default under the 2007 CLA and had accelerated AI’s obligation to repay the US$1.5m advanced under the earlier CLA as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The defendants ran a common defence. On Tembusu’s breach of contract claim, their principal defence was that there was no express or implied term in the 2012 CLA which restricted how AI could use Tembusu’s loan extended under that agreement. Alternatively, even if there were such a term, the breach of that term did not entitle Tembusu to declare a default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The defendants brought a counterclaim against Tembusu for losses suffered as a result of Tembusu’s acts and omissions. The counterclaim in contract alleged that Tembusu was in breach of the 2012 CLA and had caused AI’s failure to list. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The trial of this matter took place before me on both liability and quantum. I found the defendants to be liable to Tembusu. I held that the 2012 CLA contained an implied term limiting AI’s right to use the proceeds of Tembusu’s loan and that AI’s payment to Hectrix was a material breach of that term which entitled Tembusu to declare a default. I therefore entered final judgment for Tembusu for S$1.5m and interest (being its claim under the 2012 CLA), US$1.5m and interest (being its claim under the 2007 CLA) and costs: <span class="font-italic">Tembusu</span><span class="font-italic"> Growth Fund Ltd v ACTAtek, Inc and others</span> [2015] SGHC 206 (“<span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”). I dismissed the defendants’ counterclaim in its entirety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The defendants’ appeal to the Court of Appeal succeeded: <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic">, Inc and another v Tembusu Growth Fund Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 335 (“<span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”). The Court of Appeal found, amongst other things, that there was no implied term in the 2012 CLA restricting AI’s use of its proceeds. That meant that Tembusu had declared a default on 16 May 2012 without any contractual right to do so. The declaration of default amounted to an anticipatory repudiatory breach of the 2012 CLA because Tembusu thereby evinced a present intention not to comply with a future obligation, namely, its obligation under cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA to convert its loan into equity in ACTNZ upon AI’s listing (see [13(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The task now falls to me to assess the damages, if any, which Tembusu would have to pay to the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26  The defendants’ case on the assessment of damages is that Tembusu’s breach of contract comprises not only the default which it has now been found to have declared without basis on 16 May 2012, but also its course of conduct before and after that declaration, including this very action itself. It is the totality of that conduct, the defendants say, which caused AI’s failure to list. As a result, the defendants either lost the benefit of AI’s listing or lost the chance to benefit from AI’s listing. The defendants refer to this as AI’s “loss of capitalisation” claim. They put the value of this claim at NZ$30.5m for AI and NZ$14m for Mr Wan. AI’s claim is said to represent the value of AI’s subsidiaries which AI would have sold to ACTNZ for NZ$30.5m in exchange for shares in ACTNZ of equal value. Mr Wan’s claim is said to represent the loss which he suffered personally as a result of AI’s failure to list. In addition to the loss of capitalisation claim, the defendants also claim damages of approximately NZ$1.5m for wasted costs incurred in preparing AI for listing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Tembusu’s case in response is that Tembusu’s only breach of contract was declaring a default on 16 May 2012. Given that the Court of Appeal characterised that breach as an anticipatory breach of cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA, the defendants are entitled to compensation only for the loss which they would have suffered if Tembusu, when the time came, failed to convert its shares into equity as required by cl 5.1. Alternatively, even if the defendants are entitled to compensation for the loss flowing from the declaration of default, the defendants suffered no loss at all. AI still owns its subsidiaries, and there is no evidence that they are worth any less than they were on or around 16 May 2012, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, NZ$30.5m. Even if the defendants did suffer an actual loss, AI has failed to prove that Tembusu’s breach caused AI’s failure to list because AI has failed to prove that other actors crucial to the listing process, especially IRG, would have fulfilled their role even if Tembusu had not breached the 2012 CLA. Finally, even if Tembusu did cause AI’s failure to list, the defendants failed to act reasonably to mitigate their losses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I have to determine the following two broad issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What is the character of Tembusu’s breach of the 2012 CLA?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Did the defendants suffer any loss as a result of Tembusu’s breach of the 2012 CLA?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I turn now to consider each of these issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Character of Tembusu’s breach </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It was initially not disputed that my task on the assessment of damages was to quantify the loss which the defendants suffered as a result of Tembusu’s declaration of default on 16 May 2012. Tembusu accepted this point in its final set of written submissions filed in the assessment phase.

</div> Tembusu now submits that its declaration of default on 16 May 2012 was not in itself a breach of contract. Instead, Tembusu says that its only breach of contract is its hypothetical breach of its future obligation under cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA.

</div> It is therefore not unfair to the defendants for me to consider the merits of that submission. The defendants respond by rejecting Tembusu’s characterisation of its breach as being a hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. But they go further than merely arguing that Tembusu’s breach lies instead in its declaration of default on 16 May 2012. Instead, they return to their principal argument (see [26] above) that Tembusu’s breach of contract in fact comprises an “accumulation of events” occurring even before the declaration of default.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the usual case of a breach of contract, the proper characterisation of the breach is significant because it affects the reference point for at least four issues. The first is causation. The whole point of the causation inquiry is to consider whether a contract-breaker ought to be liable for a particular head of loss on the basis that his breach of contract caused it: see <span class="font-italic">Monarch Steamship Co</span><span class="font-italic">, Limited v Karlshamns Oljefabriker (A/B) </span>[1949] AC 196 at 226. It is impossible even to undertake, let alone to determine, the causation inquiry without first identifying precisely what that breach is and when it took place. The second is quantification. The quantification inquiry turns on the date on which the plaintiff’s loss is to be assessed. The choice of date for the quantification inquiry determines the market conditions against which damages will be quantified: see <span class="font-italic">Tredegar Iron </span><span class="font-italic">and Coal Co (Limited) v Hawthorn Brothers and Co </span>(1902) 18 TLR 716. And the general rule is that damages should be assessed as at the date of breach: <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span><span class="font-italic">and Another v Agnew</span> [1980] AC 367 at 400H. Third is mitigation. What is loosely referred to (see [138] below) as the duty to mitigate arises upon breach. In order for the doctrine of mitigation to fulfil its function, therefore, the inception of the duty to mitigate cannot be divorced from the breach. The final issue is limitation. It is the breach of contract which defines when the limitation period for an action in contract begins.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The proper characterisation of Tembusu’s breach in this action is therefore of significant importance to the causation and the quantification inquiry which I must undertake on this assessment of damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In brief, it is my view that Tembusu’s breach in this action was its declaration of default. Tembusu therefore breached the 2012 CLA on 16 May 2012. That conclusion is, in my view, dictated by both the traditional doctrine of anticipatory breach as conceived in <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span><span class="font-italic"> v De La Tour </span>(1853) 2 E &amp; B 678 (“<span class="font-italic">Hochster</span>”) and the modern doctrine as set out in the Court of Appeal’s recent decision in <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>More importantly, it is my view that that conclusion is the actual result reached by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>. I am of course bound by that case both as a matter of precedent but also as setting the parameters in this action for the very assessment which I now undertake. But Tembusu is correct to say that, because this is a case of anticipatory breach, the starting point is that the defendants’ losses should not be quantified as at the date of the breach, as in the usual case, but as at the date fixed for Tembusu’s performance of cl 5.1: <span class="font-italic">Roper v Johnson </span>(1873) LR 8 CP 167 at 180.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I will expand on these propositions below in two main parts, which correspond to Tembusu’s two principal submissions on this issue. The first part considers the issue in the light of the general principles governing the doctrine of anticipatory breach. The second part addresses the proper interpretation of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> in the light of those general principles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General principles of anticipatory breach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  The central difficulty in the doctrine of anticipatory breach is that it entitles a plaintiff to a contractual remedy at a time when the defendant has not failed to perform any of its obligations under the contract. The principle contractual remedies in play are the plaintiff’s entitlement to free himself of his own future contractual obligations to the defendant by terminating the contract and the remedy of damages to vindicate the plaintiff’s economic interest in the contract and in its performance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The doctrine is the common law’s pragmatic recognition that it would be commercially impractical, economically inefficient and, above all, unjust to require a plaintiff in certain circumstances to wait until the defendant fails to perform a contractual obligation in order to be entitled to a contractual remedy. Those circumstances are, broadly speaking, where: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendant has either:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) evinced a “clear” and “absolute” refusal to perform a contractual obligation, which may be inferred from conduct where he has “acted in such a way as to lead a reasonable man to conclude that [he] did not intend to fulfil [his] part of the contract”: <span class="font-italic">Chilean Nitrate Sales Corporation v Marine Transportation Co Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">Pansuiza Compania de Navegacion SA (The “Hermosa”) </span>[1982] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 570 at 572 col 2 and 580 col 1; <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span>”) at [155]; or </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) disabled himself from performing a contractual obligation: <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> at 690–691 and <span class="font-italic">Universal Cargo Carriers Corp v </span><span class="font-italic">Citati </span>[1957] 2 QB 401 at 441; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where a failure to perform that contractual obligation when it fell due for performance would entitle the plaintiff to terminate the contract on ordinary contractual principles: see <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [154] and [156]–[157]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Where these circumstances are established, the common law allows the plaintiff to avail himself of an immediate contractual remedy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 It is apposite at this time to define certain terms which I use in the following discussion. I use the term “performance breach” to describe a failure by a defendant to <span class="font-italic">perform</span> a contractual obligation. Defined in this way, the term by necessity incorporates a requirement that the time for that obligation to be performed has arrived. I use the term “anticipatory breach” to mean the circumstances set out at [39] above which entitle a plaintiff to have immediate access to a contractual remedy even though there is, as yet, no performance breach by the defendant. I use “repudiation” to mean any conduct which entitles a plaintiff to terminate a contract. Defined in this way, a repudiation can come about either because of an anticipatory breach (when the circumstances set out at [39] above are satisfied) or by reason of a sufficiently serious performance breach. I use “renunciation” to mean the conduct which I describe at [39(a)(i)] above, and which can give rise to an anticipatory breach. In <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [155], the Court of Appeal used the cognate word “renounce” to describe this form of repudiation. I use the term “breach of contract” to encompass both performance breach and anticipatory breach. I do not use the term “actual breach of contract” at all, because “actual” adds nothing to “breach of contract” but the possibility of confusion. I prefer instead to use either “performance breach” or “breach of contract”, depending on the sense intended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 While there is broad consensus on the justice and pragmatism of the doctrine of anticipatory breach, and perhaps even on the circumstances which trigger its operation, there is an enduring debate as to the conceptual basis underlying it. Correctly identifying the conceptual basis assists in correctly characterising the defendant’s breach. That, in turn, has the important practical implications which I have outlined at [34] above. Thus, for example, if the conceptual basis of the doctrine suggests that an anticipatory breach takes place upon repudiation, then Tembusu’s declaration of default is a breach of contract and it follows that my task in this assessment is to quantify the loss, if any, which the declaration of default caused to AI. However, if the conceptual basis suggests that the doctrine does no more than create a present right of action for a future and inchoate breach, then that might suggest that AI’s damages ought to be assessed by reference to the loss which it would have suffered as a result of Tembusu’s hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. In the latter case, and by the same token, any conduct by the defendants which unreasonably increased their loss before Tembusu’s hypothetical future breach would be irrelevant to assessing their damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 There are today two competing theories as to the correct conceptual basis for the doctrine of anticipatory breach. The traditional theory posits an implied term in every contract imposing a contractual obligation on each party to do nothing to the prejudice of the other party inconsistent with their contractual relationship while that relationship subsists (<span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> at 689, see below at [47]). The traditional theory thus rests the doctrine’s conceptual basis on the defendant’s repudiation being an immediate performance breach of that implied term. That breach then triggers an immediate right to the usual contractual remedies, including a right to damages assessed on the usual contractual basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The modern theory of anticipatory breach, on the other hand, accepts that each party to a contract has an interest, which subsists throughout the life of that contract, in the counterparty’s continued and ongoing performance of its primary contractual obligations. The modern theory holds that this interest is deserving of legal protection even though it falls short of a contractual right. The modern theory thus treats an anticipatory breach as a <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> contractual wrong necessary to protect that subsisting interest from being defeated by a repudiation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The important point for present purposes is that both theories treat the defendant’s repudiation as a breach of contract. That is so even under the modern theory which treats the repudiation as being a breach of contract without being a performance breach. Tembusu’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span> to argue otherwise is therefore quite mistaken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion in <span class="font-italic">The S</span><span class="font-italic">TX Mumbai</span> after considering and applying both the traditional theory and the modern theory of the doctrine of anticipatory breach. Although the court expressed a clear preference for the modern theory (at [63]), it did not categorically excise the traditional theory from Singapore law. That is no doubt because, on the facts of that case, both theories led the court to the same conclusion. That last point makes it at least arguable that the preference which the Court of Appeal expressed for the modern theory in <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">STX Mumbai</span> is not part of the <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> of that case. I therefore analyse Tembusu’s new submission (see [31]–[32] above) on both the traditional theory and the modern theory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I begin with the traditional theory. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Traditional theory: </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Hochster</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Johnstone</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> v Milling</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span>, the defendant engaged the plaintiff as a courier on a three-month trip to Europe. One month before they were scheduled to leave, the defendant told the plaintiff that he no longer required the plaintiff’s services. The defendant thus repudiated the contract by renouncing it. The plaintiff brought a claim for damages for breach of contract. What made this case one of anticipatory breach rather than performance breach is that the plaintiff brought his action ten days before the trip was to begin, and thus ten days before the defendant was due to perform his obligation to accept the plaintiff’s services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Court of Queen’s Bench allowed the plaintiff’s claim. Its reasoning proceeded by analogy from cases of breach of promise to marry. In those cases, it had been held that a plaintiff was entitled to bring action as soon as the promisor married someone else (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Short v Stone</span> (1846) 8 QB 358): <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> at 688. Those cases could not be explained on the basis that the defendant had, by marrying someone else, rendered it impossible to perform his promise to marry the plaintiff. After all, the defendant’s spouse might die before the date on which the defendant had promised to marry the plaintiff. The cases rested on the defendant’s marriage to another being an immediate breach of an implied obligation to the plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> at 688–689. It is the breach of this implied obligation which Lord Campbell CJ held entitled the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> to sue for damages upon the repudiation, even before a performance breach had occurred. Lord Campbell CJ put it this way (at 689):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]here there is a contract to do an act on a future day, there is a relation constituted between the parties in the meantime by the contract, and … they impliedly promise that in the meantime neither will do anything to the prejudice of the other inconsistent with that relation. As an example, a man and woman engaged to marry are affianced to one another during the period between the time of the engagement and the celebration of the marriage. In this very case, of traveller and courier, from the day of the hiring till the day when the employment was to begin, they were engaged to each other; and it seems to be a breach of an implied contract if either of them renounces the engagement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 To adapt Lord Campbell CJ’s words to the facts of this case, on the traditional theory, Tembusu’s declaration of default was to AI’s prejudice and was wholly inconsistent with any intention on Tembusu’s part to perform its remaining obligations under the 2012 CLA. In fact, Tembusu had only one remaining obligation, which was its obligation to convert its loan into shares in AI upon AI’s business being transferred to ACTNZ and listed. The declaration of default was therefore an immediate performance breach by Tembusu of an implied term of the 2012 CLA that Tembusu would not renounce that obligation. Some would say, along these lines, that Tembusu had a contractual duty under an implied term not to repudiate the contract, and that it breached that duty: see J W Carter, <span class="font-italic">Carter’s Breach of Contract</span> (LexisNexis Butterworths Australia, 3rd Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Carter</span>”) at para 7-20. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the traditional theory, therefore, the court’s task in assessing damages for anticipatory breach is the same as its task in assessing damages in the usual case of a performance breach. The court is required to consider the loss, if any, which Tembusu’s declaration of default on 16 May 2012 caused AI to suffer. It follows that assessing the damages does not require considering the loss caused by Tembusu’s failure to perform the future obligation which it repudiated. This very point was made by Lord Denning MR in <span class="font-italic">Maredelanto</span><span class="font-italic"> Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH, The Mihalis Angelos</span> [1970] 3 WLR 601 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Mihalis Angelos</span>”) at 612H when he said, “Seeing that the renunciation itself is the breach, the damages must be measured by compensating the injured party for the loss he has suffered <span class="font-italic">by reason of</span> the renunciation” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, Tembusu’s new submission fails on a straightforward application of <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 But <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> contained within it an ambiguity. The ambiguity is to do with whether some conduct on a plaintiff’s part is necessary in order to convert the defendant’s renunciation into a breach of contract. A narrow reading of <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> is that it does not. On this view, <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> rests liability for anticipatory breach entirely on a defendant’s performance breach of an implied term. On that reading, therefore, <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> does not require a plaintiff to “accept” the defendant’s renunciation in order for it to give rise to a breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 But Lord Campbell CJ in <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> did accept<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at 693) the argument that the plaintiff in the 1831 case of <span class="font-italic">Planché</span><span class="font-italic"> v Colburn</span> (1831) 8 Bing 14 had succeeded in recovering compensation for the part-performance he had undertaken before the defendant’s renunciation because the plaintiff had “treat[ed] the renunciation of the contract by the defendants as a breach”. On this reading, therefore, the rule in <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> requires some additional conduct by the plaintiff in order to convert a renunciation into a breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Soon after <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span>, the traditional theory explicitly embraced the requirement of acceptance. In <span class="font-italic">Johnstone</span><span class="font-italic"> v Milling</span> (1886) 16 QBD 460, Lord Esher MR denied that a defendant’s renunciation is a breach of contract in itself and asserted that a renunciation constitutes a breach only when accepted by the plaintiff (at 467):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A] renunciation of a contract, or, in other words, a total refusal to perform it by one party before the time for performance arrives, does not, by itself, amount to a breach of contract but may be so acted upon and adopted by the other party as a rescission of the contract as to give an immediate right of action. When one party assumes to renounce the contract, that is, by anticipation refuses to perform it, he thereby, so far as he is concerned, declares his intention then and there to rescind the contract … The other party may adopt such renunciation of the contract by so acting upon it as in effect to declare that he too treats the contract as at an end, except for the purpose of bringing an action upon it for the damages sustained by him in consequence of such renunciation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The requirement for a plaintiff to accept a defendant’s repudiation in order for the repudiation to amount to a breach of contract is now part of the traditional theory: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Golding v London &amp; Edinburgh Insurance Company, Ltd </span>[1932] 43 Lloyd’s Rep 487 at 488 col 2. Modern statements of the traditional theory therefore embed acceptance of the repudiation by the promisee, and thereby a termination of the contract, into the definition of anticipatory breach. Thus, Prof J W Carter defines an anticipatory breach as that which occurs when “a promisee validly terminates the performance of a contract for a repudiation prior to the arrival or expiry of the time for performance by the promisor”: <span class="font-italic">Carter</span> at para 7-08. In his masterly <span class="font-italic">Anticipatory Breach</span> (Hart Publishing, 2011) – a monograph which the Court of Appeal described as “brilliant” in <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span> at [40] – Prof Qiao Liu analyses the common law rule which requires acceptance in order to convert a repudiation into a breach. He calls it the breach-conversion rule and regards it as a rule which ought now to be abandoned (at pp 28–30). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As shall be seen (at [78] below), one of the quirks in the facts of this case is that AI has never explicitly accepted Tembusu’s declaration of default and terminated the contract. The absence of acceptance in this case means that Tembusu may be right to say, <span class="font-italic">pace</span> Lord Esher MR, that its declaration of default was no breach at all, and that the only true breach in this action is Tembusu’s hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. But even on that analysis, the causation inquiry is to be conducted with the repudiation as its reference point: the court must still assess the damage sustained by AI “in consequence of” (in Lord Esher MR’s words) Tembusu’s repudiation of the 2012 CLA, namely, its declaration of default on 16 May 2012. This is so even if the repudiation “does not, by itself, amount to a breach of contract” (Lord Esher MR’s words again). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The reason that the repudiation is treated as the reference point for assessing loss is connected to the reason for the rule in <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> itself. <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> recognised the doctrine of anticipatory breach out of a pragmatic judicial desire to maximise the freedom of labour and capital: Paul Mitchell, “<span class="font-italic">Hochster</span><span class="font-italic"> v De La Tour </span>(1853)” in <span class="font-italic">Landmark Cases in the Law of Contract</span> (Charles Mitchell and Paul Mitchell eds) (Hart Publishing, 2008) at pp 156 to 157; <span class="font-italic">Bunge SA v </span><span class="font-italic">Nidera BV</span> [2015] 3 All ER 1082 (“<span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>”) at [12] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Sumption. If the law postponed the plaintiff’s right to seek a contractual remedy until the time for the defendant’s performance arrived, and forced him to be ready to perform his own obligations in the interim in case the defendant ever reversed his repudiation before committing a performance breach, the law would be positively preventing the plaintiff from redeploying his labour or capital in the meantime by contracting elsewhere. That would be inefficient for the economy as a whole. So the law allows the plaintiff an immediate contractual remedy. But the law allows that benefit to the plaintiff only because the defendant’s repudiation means that the plaintiff has lost his original opportunity under his contract with the defendant. The defendant’s repudiation and consequent non-performance is therefore the event by which that loss is assessed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Assessing the quantum of that loss, however, is a different question. Tembusu is correct to say that in cases of anticipatory breach, quantum is generally assessed as at the time fixed for performance of the obligation which has been anticipatorily breached.

</div> This is the rule laid down in <span class="font-italic">Roper v Johnson</span> ([36] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and affirmed in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span>”) at para 22.009, which Tembusu cites. If the assessment is done before the time for performance has arrived, the court will usually be prepared to make an assessment of the loss sustained based on projections and forecasts: <span class="font-italic">Melachrino</span><span class="font-italic"> and Another v Nickoll and Knight </span>[1920] 1 KB 693 at 699.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In this regard, it may be said that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Roper v Johnson</span> supports Tembusu’s argument that the breach which triggers compensation in cases of anticipatory breach is the hypothetical future performance breach. The usual rule for assessing loss caused by performance breach is that damages are assessed at the time of the breach (see [34] above). If damages for anticipatory breach are to be assessed as at the date of the hypothetical future performance breach, does that not mean that it is that breach which is the breach of contract for which compensation is awarded? The answer is no. The better view is that the doctrine of anticipatory breach is willing to examine the consequences of the repudiation even though the repudiation is not a performance breach. For the point of the doctrine is to permit the plaintiff to turn his labour or capital towards alternative productive endeavours. That is why the plaintiff comes under a duty to mitigate from the time he accepts the repudiatory breach and terminates the contract, not from the time in the future fixed for performance of the obligation which has been repudiated: <span class="font-italic">Bunge </span>at [12]. And to achieve a fair assessment of the losses suffered as a result of the repudiation, those losses ought to be assessed as at the time fixed for performance, where the plaintiff would have obtained what he had bargained for: <span class="font-italic">Robinson v Harman </span>(1848) 1 Ex Rep 850 at 855. The compensatory principle and the duty to mitigate thus work together justly to give the plaintiff what he bargained for less the losses he could reasonably have avoided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The reason for the difference between the reference point for the causation inquiry and the quantum inquiry in cases of anticipatory breach is perhaps best explained by a line of criticism of <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> in the academic literature. It has been said that <span class="font-italic">Hochster</span> could have achieved the goals of the doctrine of anticipatory breach by holding that the defendant’s repudiation gave the plaintiff an immediate right to terminate the contract but no right to sue for damages until there was a performance breach, as there is no necessary connection between these two consequences of the repudiation: Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel</span><span class="font-italic">: The Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2015) at para 17-080. But even if making damages available immediately upon repudiation goes beyond the minimum necessary for the doctrine to achieve its purpose, any injustice which accelerating the right to damages creates is ameliorated by assessing those damages as though the plaintiff had been required to wait for the foreshadowed performance breach to eventuate. Therefore, there is nothing incoherent about the doctrine regarding the repudiation as the event which precipitates the loss on the one hand, and in assessing the quantum of that loss at the time fixed for performance of the repudiated obligation on the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 To sum up, the traditional theory on the doctrine of anticipatory breach offers no assistance to Tembusu’s submission that its only breach of contract is its hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The modern view: </span><span class="font-weight-bold">The STX Mumbai</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Tembusu’s submission also relies on the modern theory of anticipatory breach as set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span> (see [32] above).

</div>
</div> In fact, the shift in <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he STX Mumbai</span> in conceptualising the doctrine of anticipatory breach is fundamental, not slight. But it remains the case that there is no support in that case for Tembusu’s submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The primary question before the Court of Appeal in the <span class="font-italic">STX Mumbai</span> was whether a plaintiff who had performed all of its obligations under a contract – and on whose part, therefore, the contract had become an executed contract – could rely on the doctrine of anticipatory breach to bring an action against a defendant who had evinced an inability to perform an obligation which lay in the future when the action was commenced. The defendant’s argument was that the doctrine of anticipatory breach contained within it an exception which prevented a plaintiff who had no obligations left to perform from suing the defendant until the defendant committed a performance breach. One argument for the exception was that, where a contract – either by its terms or by the way in which the plaintiff has on the facts of a particular case rendered performance – leaves no obligations resting on the plaintiff in the future, the underlying justification for the doctrine of anticipatory breach is missing, A plaintiff who has performed all of his obligations has, by definition, no future obligations to the defendant to be released from performing. There is therefore no need in a case of this nature for the law to promote the objects of the doctrine (see [32] above) by allowing the plaintiff an accelerated right to terminate the contract. Another way of putting the argument is that the doctrine of anticipatory breach cannot apply where there is no interdependency of future contractual obligations between the plaintiff and the defendant, either because the plaintiff had no obligations at all under the contract to begin with or because the plaintiff has, by the time of the repudiation, performed all that it is obliged to do. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he STX Mumbai</span>, the judge at first instance struck out the action, holding that the doctrine of anticipatory breach was not engaged at all because there had been no repudiation by the defendant. However, she accepted <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that the doctrine of anticipatory breach could not apply to a contract which is executed on a plaintiff’s part. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision, holding that on both the traditional and the modern theory, it is not plainly and obviously unsustainable to argue that the doctrine of anticipatory breach applies in exactly the same way to both executed and executory contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>viewed the modern theory of anticipatory breach as its preferred conceptual basis for the doctrine (at [63]). <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span> therefore deprecates the attempt to conceptualise an anticipatory breach either as a real breach of a fictional implied term or as a fictional breach of a real but future obligation. The preferred view sees anticipatory breach as a species of breach of contract even though there is no performance breach. Viewed that way, an anticipatory breach of a contract can take place whether the contract is unilateral, executed or executory. The court considered this direct approach to be a less convoluted and less artificial way to explain how the doctrine allows an immediate right of action in the absence of a performance breach. The repudiation is a present breach of contract, albeit notified to the plaintiff in advance of any performance breach of that contract, which justifies the plaintiff in electing to treat the contract as discharged: <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai </span>at [51]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Once it is accepted that an anticipatory breach is just as much a breach of contract as a performance breach, the difficulties (see [38] above) which beset the doctrine of anticipatory breach are said to disappear. For one, allowing the plaintiff to sue for damages at once is perfectly explicable on the basis that the repudiation is in itself deemed to be a breach of contract. Further, the breach-conversion rule disappears (see [55] above), and with it the anomaly of including an element of the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s</span> conduct in defining anticipatory breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 This conception is strictly speaking not new. As I have alluded to at [50] above, Lord Denning MR expressed a similar view in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Mihalis Angelos</span> at 612F–H:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The cause of action is not the future breach. It is the renunciation itself. I venture to quote the notes to <span class="font-italic">Cutter </span>v.<span class="font-italic"> Powell</span> (1795) 6 Term. Rep. 320 in 2 Smith’s Leading Cases, 13th ed. (1929), p. 30:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“… it is of the essence of every contract that each party thereto should have the right to consider it as of binding force from the moment that it is made and should have the right to base his conduct upon the expectation of its being fulfilled by the other party. If, therefore, the other party, by an unqualified refusal to perform his side of the contract, destroys that expectation, he destroys that which is the basis of the contract; and his conduct may be treated by the opposite party as a breach going to the whole of the consideration.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Seeing that the renunciation itself is the breach, the damages must be measured by compensating the injured party for the loss he has suffered by reason of the renunciation. You must take into account all contingencies which might have reduced or extinguished the loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It should therefore be obvious why <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span> does not assist Tembusu. Even on the modern approach preferred in that case, Tembusu is deemed to have committed a breach of contract on 16 May 2012 when it repudiated the contract by declaring a default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 My task on the assessment is therefore to assess the loss, if any, which the defendants suffered as a result of Tembusu’s declaration of default on 16 May 2012. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">ACTAtek (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 To advance its submission that the only breach of contract relevant in this assessment of damages is its hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA, Tembusu also relies on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>. Tembusu contends that the Court of Appeal viewed Tembusu’s declaration of default, not as a breach of contract, but as mere notice of a future breach, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Tembusu would not comply with cl 5.1. Thus, Tembusu says, the hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1 is the only breach of contract which the Court of Appeal found in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ACTAtek (CA)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It is clear to me that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> considered Tembusu’s declaration of default to be a breach of contract. Tembusu’s submission to the contrary misunderstands the role which cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA played in the Court of Appeal’s analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Tembusu says that its interpretation of <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> is supported by two parts of the Court of Appeal’s judgment. The first is at [106], where the court describes AI’s submission that Tembusu’s breach is its failure to comply with cl 5.1:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The Appellants argue, however, that in the present case, Tembusu’s obligations under the 2012 CLA had not yet ceased. They rely on cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA which provides that in the event that ACTAtek completes an IPO …, Tembusu “shall, immediately … convert the Loan into fully-paid shares … of [ACTAtek] at a fifty per cent. (50%) discount to the Issue Price”. According to the Appellants, by calling the event of default wrongfully and asking for the loan amounts to be repaid immediately, Tembusu had evinced an intention not to comply with this continuing obligation under the 2012 CLA. The Appellants therefore seek to rely on an <span class="font-italic">anticipatory </span><span class="font-italic">repudiatory breach </span>of the 2012 CLA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The second part is at [110], where the Court of Appeal held that the “wrongful declaration of the event of default was accompanied by Tembusu’s manifestation of its refusal to comply with cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA”, and that “this suffices to constitute an anticipatory breach of the 2012 CLA”. Tembusu submits that this describes Tembusu’s breach as a combination of: (a) Tembusu’s declaration of default; and (b) Tembusu’s manifestation thereby of its intention not to comply with cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. Given, however, that the Court of Appeal assumed at [107] and [112] that (a) was not in itself a breach of any express or implied term of the CLA, that leaves (b) as the only breach of contract found by the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Tembusu’s submission is wrong for two reasons. First, at [100], the Court of Appeal posed the specific question whether Tembusu’s declaration of default could, on its own, amount to a repudiatory breach of contract. The court then went on from [101]–[110] to analyse that question by reference to the two competing submissions before it. Tembusu’s submission was that declaring the default could not be a repudiatory breach of contract because there was no express or implied term in the 2012 CLA not to declare a default without contractual basis (at [101]). In other words, Tembusu’s case was that it had committed no performance breach of the 2012 CLA by declaring a default. The defendants did not oppose this submission by arguing the opposite, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by arguing that Tembusu’s declaration of default was indeed a performance breach. Instead, the defendants submitted that the declaration of default was an anticipatory breach (at [106]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Court of Appeal determined the question it had posed for itself by holding that Tembusu’s declaration of default, on the facts of this case, constituted an anticipatory breach and therefore a breach of contract. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal assumed without deciding that Tembusu was correct that declaring an event of default without contractual basis was not a performance breach (at [107] and [112]). On that assumption, Tembusu’s future obligation under cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA was critical to the court’s finding. That future obligation made the CLA an executory contract (at [107]). This meant that Tembusu’s submission that the declaration of default did not amount to a performance breach was no defence to the counterclaim. That is because the declaration of default was a repudiation of cl 5.1 and therefore gave rise to an anticipatory breach (at [110]). The Court of Appeal must also have accepted AI’s submission that Tembusu’s anticipatory breach was an anticipatory <span class="font-italic">repudiatory</span> breach. In other words, the Court of Appeal must have accepted that cl 5.1, if it were the subject of a performance breach when it fell due for performance, would entitle AI to terminate the 2012 CLA on the basis either that cl 5.1 was a condition of the contract or that a breach of cl 5.1 would deprive AI of substantially the whole of benefit which the parties intended that it should obtain from the 2012 CLA: see <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span> at [66]–[67] and [74].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 This is the reasoning expressed at [110] of <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We are satisfied that a key premise undergirding [two English authorities cited by Tembusu to argue that its declaration of default was not a performance breach] was that there was no element of non-performance or future non-performance of the contracts when the event of default was wrongfully declared and in that sense, it could not be said that the lender was repudiating the contract simply because there was no obligation under the contract to be repudiated. Because of that, to find a breach of contract, it seems to have been thought that it had to be established that there was either an express or implied term <span class="font-italic">not</span> to wrongfully call an event of default. We are not faced with the same constraints on our facts since the wrongful declaration of the event of default was accompanied by Tembusu’s manifestation of its refusal to comply with cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. In our judgment, this suffices to constitute an anticipatory breach of the 2012 CLA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It appears that Tembusu reads the last two sentences in this passage as meaning that the Court of Appeal did not find Tembusu’s declaration of default to be a breach of contract in itself but merely evidence from which it could be inferred that Tembusu intended to refuse to perform its obligation under cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA when it fell due for performance. It is this possibility which gives scope to Tembusu’s new submission. But this possibility ignores the preferred approach in <span class="font-italic">The STX Mumbai</span> which treats a repudiation in itself as a breach of contract. It also ignores the fact that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> consistently and deliberately at [100]–[110] refers to the declaration of default as being wrongful (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, contrary to law), even though the Court of Appeal had assumed it not to be a performance breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It is necessary at this point to introduce a factual quirk in this action. AI did not accept what it now characterises as Tembusu’s anticipatory repudiatory breach. Thus, AI’s solicitors responded on 23 May 2012 to Tembusu’s solicitors’ declaration of default by characterising the declaration as premature and a breach of the 2012 CLA while expressly declining to terminate the 2012 CLA for Tembusu’s breach:

</div> Thus, it appears to me that the Court of Appeal has, <span class="font-italic">sub </span><span class="font-italic">silentio</span>, rejected what Professor Qiao Liu has called the breach-conversion rule. That rule is now an essential element of the traditional theory (see [55] above). Instead, <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> appears to have proceeded on the modern theory of anticipatory breach, which sees a breach of contract as being constituted entirely by the defendant’s repudiation, with no requirement for the plaintiff to accept the breach. I make this point not to suggest that the defendants have never accepted Tembusu’s anticipatory repudiatory breach. They have implicitly done so by mounting a counterclaim for damages in this action. But that counterclaim was put forward only on 4 September 2012.

</div> Nobody suggests that Tembusu’s anticipatory repudiatory breach took place on that date. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>proceeded on the basis that Tembusu’s breach of contract took place on 16 May 2012, even though AI has never expressly accepted Tembusu’s repudiation and did not impliedly accept Tembusu’s repudiation at any time before 4 September 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 So when the Court of Appeal refers to the declaration of default accompanied by the implicit refusal to comply with cl 5.1 as constituting an anticipatory breach, the Court of Appeal is not inviting me to assess damages for a hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1. Tembusu’s breach of contract on the modern theory is its repudiation on 16 May 2012. That is why the Court of Appeal made the express finding that Tembusu “had breached” the 2012 CLA (at [111]) and that “the wrongful declaration of the event of default did amount to a breach of the 2012 CLA” (at [116]). The breach of contract found by the Court of Appeal was a historical breach and not a hypothetical one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, the Court of Appeal’s example at [114] of an issue which Tembusu was at liberty to take on this assessment demonstrates that my task now is to conduct the causation inquiry in relation to the declaration of default, not in relation to Tembusu’s hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1. The Court of Appeal expressly gave Tembusu liberty to raise before me the argument that AI had actually suffered no loss even if Tembusu’s declaration of default had caused AI’s listing to fail because AI still owns the subsidiaries which the listing process valued at NZ$30.5m. This reference can only make sense if the Court of Appeal viewed Tembusu’s declaration of default as a breach of contract and, more specifically, the breach of contract which was to form the causative foundation for the assessment which I now undertake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Therefore, I reject Tembusu’s submission that the only breach which the court in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> identified and which is relevant to the inquiries of causation and quantum before me is a hypothetical future breach of cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. The Court of Appeal expressly envisaged my task in this assessment in exactly the way I have set it out at [69] above.

</div> It is true that the 2012 CLA envisaged AI being listed. But the 2012 CLA imposed no obligation on any party to bring about that listing. All that it did was, by cl 5.2, to require AI’s shareholders to endeavour to list AI without any moratorium on Tembusu’s converted shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I reject the defendant’s submission entirely. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) considered that Tembusu’s sole breach of contract was declaring a default on 16 May 2012: <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [110] and [116]. The declaration of default was an anticipatory breach because Tembusu thereby renounced its obligation under cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA. It was an anticipatory repudiatory breach because a performance breach of cl 5.1 would have entitled AI to terminate the 2012 CLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 AI’s case appears to be that the totality of Tembusu’s conduct before and after 16 May 2012 ought to be taken as the renunciation. That was not the case which the defendants ran before the Court of Appeal: <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [106]. Their case then, insofar as it relied on Tembusu’s historical acts, rested only on the declaration of default. So it is not surprising that nothing in the Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> suggests that it regarded any other act on Tembusu’s part as amounting to a breach of contract.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Latif</span>, the plaintiff succeeded in the District Court in a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. The compensation awarded was precisely the sum he claimed in his pleadings. He nonetheless appealed, seeking further compensation based on a higher estimate of his loss set out in an accountant’s report tendered in evidence. MPH Rubin J at [7] of his judgment set out the following principle: “It is a settled principle of law that parties stand by their pleaded cases and any defect in the pleadings cannot be cured by any averments in affidavits, let alone an oblique reference in counsel’s closing speech”. Rubin J then dismissed the appeal on the basis that “[c]ounsel for the plaintiff should have made an application to amend, and having failed to do so it did not lie in his mouth to blame the court to do his homework” (at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I respectfully agree with the statement of principle in <span class="font-italic">Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Latif</span> as a general rule.

However, it would be going too far, I suggest, to infer from Rubin J’s reasoning that a defect in the pleadings with respect to the loss claimed in itself precludes the court from remedying that loss if loss in a different amount is proven at trial. It must be remembered that <br/>“[p]rocedure is not an end in itself, but a means to the end of attaining a fair trial”: <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate</span> <span class="font-italic">of </span><span class="font-italic">Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 (“<span class="font-italic">Nithia</span>”) at [39]. Thus, while the general rule is that a party is bound by its pleadings, the law does permit departure from the general rule, albeit in limited circumstances: where no prejudice is caused to the other party or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to allow the departure: <span class="font-italic">Nithia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [40]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the present case, AI’s principal pleaded loss is that it lost the “benefit” of the failed IPO.

</div> AI has now modified its principal claim to a claim for the loss of a “chance” to obtain that benefit, but continues to value that lost chance at NZ$30.5m. That is obviously quite a different way of characterising AI’s loss of capitalisation claim. Tembusu’s complaint is that AI failed to plead a claim for damages for the loss of a chance and submits that its loss of capitalisation claim should be dismissed on that basis alone. However, I note that the current formulation of its loss of capitalisation claim draws on the same body of evidence adduced at trial in support of its straightforward loss of capitalisation claim. Tembusu’s ability to respond to AI’s loss of capitalisation claim on the footing of a lost chance was therefore not prejudiced, at least not significantly. I am therefore willing to consider the merits of both ways in which AI puts its alleged loss of capitalisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Components of AI’s alleged loss under [92(b)] above were also unpleaded. Just as in <span class="font-italic">Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Latif </span>– where the plaintiff’s enhanced quantum was derived only from an accountant’s report – in the present case, the unpleaded components under this head of claim are taken from IRG’s mandate.

</div> Tembusu points out that it is Mr Wan who ascribed the NZ$30.5m value to AI’s subsidiaries. The NZ$30.5m figure is not the result of an arm’s length objective valuation. Further, out of the NZ$30.5m in value, NZ$22m is attributed to goodwill. This goodwill arises only because ACTNZ was ostensibly willing to accept NZ$30.5m as the value of the subsidiaries in the second and third steps of the listing process: see [98] above. The value of NZ$30.5m ascribed to AI’s subsidiaries is therefore self-generated, circular and unreliable. NZ$30.5m therefore represents neither the true value of AI’s subsidiaries nor the true extent of AI’s loss of capitalisation, assuming that that loss was sustained in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In response, AI says that there is some objective basis – found in Brent King’s testimony – to value the subsidiaries at NZ$30.5m.

</div> I do not agree. Mr King admitted in cross-examination that the figure of NZ$30.5m was not a figure he arrived at independently. AI put the figure to him and he was comfortable with it.

</div>
</div> AI’s other argument is that Tembusu is now estopped from denying that the subsidiaries were worth NS$30.5m because it had previously indicated in an Investment Memorandum that it accepted that valuation.

</div>
</div> But this argument relies on no known principle of estoppel. In any event, in that memorandum, Tembusu said only that “ACTAtek expect[ed] the pre-money market capitalisation of [ACTNZ] to be approximately US$30 million” – not that Tembusu agreed with that estimate or its basis.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> So on the facts, Tembusu did not commit itself to any position on the value of AI’s subsidiaries independently of AI’s assurance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In my judgment, AI has no logical basis to assert that it has suffered a loss of NZ$30.5m. This is because it still owns all of its subsidiaries. They are presumably still worth today what they were worth at the time of the failed listing. Neither party has produced any evidence to prove otherwise. In this regard, one might have expected AI to argue – and to prove – that the value of its subsidiaries fell to zero or near zero as a result of Tembusu’s breach, such that AI is now entitled to take the entire value of those subsidiaries on 16 May 2012 as its starting point on damages. But that is not AI’s case. Even if it were, it would have been unreasonable for AI not to mitigate its loss by making a new attempt to list. It made no such attempt, as I will explain at [138]–[146] below. While this point goes more directly to the issue of mitigation, AI’s inaction reduces the credibility of the value of its subsidiaries because it suggests that no one but ACTNZ would have been willing to accept NZ$30.5m as the value of these subsidiaries. This supports Tembusu’s argument on the circularity and unreliability of the NZ$30.5m valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 It is also significant to me that the structure of the listing was not for the public to be invited to subscribe for new shares in AI. A listing of that nature, if successful, would have resulted in AI enlarging its capital base. That in turn would have given AI more working capital or funds for expanding its business: an opportunity which it has lost. Instead, the structure of the listing was for AI to be allotted shares in ACTNZ and for AI to sell its shares in ACTNZ to the public as vendor shares. The listing was therefore simply a means for AI’s shareholders to exit their investment in AI’s business, and would not have brought additional capital into AI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the premises, I find that AI has failed to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that it suffered a loss of NZ$30.5m. Nevertheless, I turn to address causation, assuming that AI did suffer such a loss. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Causation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The question whether a loss would have occurred “but for” the wrong committed has gained nearly universal acceptance as the test for determining causation in fact. The “but for” test, as it is called, was adopted into the law of contract by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Ming Eric </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“<span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span>”) at [63], where it endorsed the view expressed in <span class="font-italic">The Cherry </span><span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 471 at [68] that the “but for” test was synonymous with the test of “effective” or “dominant” cause adopted in some English cases for determining whether a breach of contract had caused a plaintiff’s loss: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Galoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Bright Grahame Murray</span> [1994] 1 WLR 1360 at 1374G. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Importantly, the “but for” test does not require the breach of contract to be the sole cause of the loss: <span class="font-italic">Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Berger Paints Singapore Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2012] 1 SLR 427 at [40]. As Devlin J has said, “[I]f a breach of contract is one of two causes … it is sufficient to carry a judgment for damages”: <span class="font-italic">Heskell</span><span class="font-italic"> v Continental Express Ltd and Another </span>[1950] 1 All ER 1033 at 1048, disapproved on another point in <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd </span>[1964] AC 465 at 532. Therefore, for the purposes of the causation inquiry, I leave aside for the moment the fact that the success of AI’s listing depended in part on AI’s own efforts through IRG to be listed on the NZAX. That fact is relevant to whether the loss of capitalisation is a contingent loss, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a loss whose certainty is contingent on actions other than those of the defendant: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> at paras 21.022–21.031. I address this issue fully at [114]–[119] below. What matters here is whether AI’s hypothetical compliance with the 2012 CLA was a necessary element of the success of AI’s listing, such that Tembusu’s breach of the 2012 CLA may be regarded as a “but for” cause of the listing’s failure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Accordingly, the specific issue is whether the listing would have proceeded if Tembusu did not breach the 2012 CLA. The burden of proving this counterfactual on a balance of probabilities lies on AI. AI in turn argues that the burden lies on Tembusu.

</div> I reject this argument summarily. It is well-established that the party claiming damages is the party who bears the burden of proving causation on the balance of probabilities: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span> at [71]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In this regard, I emphasise that I have rejected the defendants’ characterisation of Tembusu’s breach of contract as an “accumulation of events”: see [83]–[84] above. So the only act which is relevant to the causation inquiry as being the event which precipitated AI’s compensable loss is Tembusu’s manifestation of its intention, through its declaration of default on 16 May 2012, not to comply with cl 5.1 of the 2012 CLA in the future. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I therefore disregard all other acts which the defendants say contributed to AI’s failure to list, including Tembusu’s refusal to resolve its dispute with AI, Tembusu’s commencing suit against AI in August 2012, and Daniel Lee’s refusal to sign the necessary pre-listing documents.

</div> These acts are distinct from Tembusu’s legally wrongful conduct.

As Tembusu points out, it also appears to be the import of the evidence adduced at trial by the defendants themselves that it was the commencement of this action in August 2012 and not the repudiation in May 2012 which caused the failure to list.

</div> Mr King said in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that “[i]t was not possible for [AI] to continue with their listing in the [NZAX] with the pending legal action commenced by Tembusu”, because AI would allegedly no longer be able to make a positive declaration of non-indebtedness as required by the NZAX regulations.

</div>
</div> But this opinion does not assist the defendants’ case at all, because it does not entail that but for the declaration of default, the listing would have proceeded. In fact it implies the opposite: even if there had been no declaration of default, other events – which do not amount to a breach of the 2012 CLA – may well have derailed AI’s listing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In my judgment, therefore, AI has failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that Tembusu’s declaration of default caused AI’s failure to list on a “but for” analysis. But there is a further aspect to the attribution of AI’s alleged loss of capitalisation to Tembusu’s breach of contract. This has to do with the concept of contingent loss, which may be regarded as reaching into the causation inquiry, but which deserves to be addressed independently. This I turn to now.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Contingent loss</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The law requires a plaintiff to prove his damage with reasonable certainty: <span class="font-italic">McGregor</span> at para 10-002, citing <span class="font-italic">Ratcliffe</span><span class="font-italic"> v Evans</span> [1892] 2 QB 524 at 532–533. A lack of certainty can arise in a variety of ways. One of those ways is where the certainty of the plaintiff’s loss is contingent on the actions of actors other than the defendant. It may safely be said that that type of contingency does not on its own preclude the recovery of damages. But, in order for a plaintiff to succeed where that contingency is in play, there are rules which he must satisfy. Those rules are applicable in the present case because entities including IRG, the NZAX, Mr Wan and AI itself would have had a role to play in bringing to fruition AI’s application to be listed on the NZAX. As a result, AI’s alleged loss of capitalisation is contingent on the actions of actors other than the contract-breaker (Tembusu). Accordingly, to put the matter in general terms, the law needs AI to demonstrate to a certain standard what these entities would have done on the hypothesis that Tembusu did not breach the 2012 CLA by declaring a default on 16 May 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In respect of that standard, the law draws a distinction between losses contingent on the actions of a plaintiff and losses contingent on the actions of a third party. This distinction was articulated in the seminal judgment of Stuart-Smith LJ in <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons (</span><span class="font-italic">a firm) </span>[1995] 1 WLR 1602 (“<span class="font-italic">Allied Maples</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span>”), which was approved by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 661 (“<span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel</span>”) at [47]–[48]. Both parties have cited that case to me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group</span> concerned loss suffered as a result of leasing property in reliance on negligent advice by a solicitor. Stuart-Smith LJ set out three general categories of circumstances which he regarded as defining the border between the causation inquiry and the quantum inquiry when ascertaining recoverable loss (at 1609–1611 and 1614):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the first category fall cases in which the defendant’s negligence consists in some positive act or misfeasance and the question of causation is one of historical fact. Proof on a balance of probabilities prevails here. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the second category fall cases in which the defendant’s negligence consists of an omission where causation depends not upon a question of historical fact but upon an answer to the hypothetical question: “What would the plaintiff have done if there had been no negligence?” How the plaintiff would have reacted is again subject to proof on a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In the third category fall cases in which the plaintiff’s loss depends upon the hypothetical action of a third party, whether in addition to action by the plaintiff or independently of it. Here, the plaintiff need only show that he had a “real or substantial chance” of the third party acting in such a way as to benefit him. Claims falling under this category are those which are properly to be regarded as claims for a loss of chance as an independent head of loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The only aspect of Stuart-Smith LJ’s analysis which has attracted criticism is his method of dividing his first two categories, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the division between a defendant’s acts and a defendant’s omissions. It has been argued that the essence of the second category is not liability based upon omission but the need to ascertain how the plaintiff will react: <span class="font-italic">McGregor</span> at para 10-058. This argument was accepted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel </span>at [48]–[49]. It is also supported by the approach to contingent loss taken in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract </span>at paras 21.022–21.025, which draws the distinction not between a defendant’s act and omissions but simply invites the question whether the plaintiff’s loss is contingent on some action he needs to have taken: see also <span class="font-italic">Sykes </span><span class="font-italic">and Others v Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Co Ltd and Others</span> [1971] 1 QB 113 at 129A and <span class="font-italic">JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm) </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 at [148].--- The consequence of this point is that it is not important whether Tembusu’s breach of the 2012 CLA is to be regarded as an act or an omission. What is important is whether AI’s loss of capitalisation was contingent on the actions of persons other than Tembusu.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The defendants’ case is that AI’s failure to list caused it to suffer a loss of capitalisation, and that Tembusu in turn caused that failure to list. As I have mentioned at [107] above, it is common ground that AI’s listing did not depend only – if at all – on Tembusu. Even if Tembusu did not breach the 2012 CLA on 16 May 2012, AI and IRG would have needed to take steps to apply for AI to be listed on the NZAX – and the NZAX would have had to approve the application – in order for AI’s listing to be successful. What has been shown at [106]–[113] is that Tembusu’s repudiation of the 2012 CLA was not a “but for” cause of AI’s failure to list. But even if it were a “but for” cause, the law as stated in <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group </span>and endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel </span>would still require AI to answer the additional question: whether AI, Mr Wan, IRG and NZAX would have acted to confer on AI the benefit of listing had Tembusu not committed its repudiatory breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 To what standard must AI answer that question? That depends on whether the present case falls into Stuart-Smith LJ’s second or third category. In my judgment, like the case of <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group</span>, this case has elements of both. In <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group</span>, the plaintiff had to show that, had it been properly advised, it would have sought some alternate form of assurance from the vendors in place of a warranty, the absence of which the defendants had failed to advise the plaintiff on. This had to be shown on a balance of probabilities. The question then arose whether it was also necessary for the plaintiff to show that the vendors would have agreed to provide such alternate assurance. The English Court of Appeal decided that the plaintiff needed to show only that there was a real and not speculative chance that they would agree. Thus, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group</span> attracted the application of the rules in Stuart Smith LJ’s second and third categories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Likewise, in the present case, had Tembusu not committed a breach of the 2012 CLA, AI itself would have needed to take certain steps to be listed. Accordingly, AI must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it would have taken those steps. But AI’s intended listing would also have involved IRG and the NZAX taking certain steps. NZAX is without question a third party and therefore within Stuart-Smith LJ’s third category. AI has to prove only that, if Tembusu had not repudiated the 2012 CLA, there was a real and substantial chance that the NZAX would have taken the necessary steps to enable AI to list. As for IRG, AI’s strongest case is that IRG too should be regarded as a third party and in Stuart-Smith LJ’s third category. AI would then have to prove only that there was a real and substantial chance that IRG would have taken the necessary steps for a listing, and not that it would have done so on the balance of probabilities. I will take AI’s case at its strongest. Having said that, I note in passing that there are weighty reasons for saying that IRG, on the basis of IRG’s mandate from AI, ought to be regarded as AI’s agent and therefore not as a third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 What is clear now is that AI’s claim on its pleaded characterisation of loss of capitalisation should be rejected, because it is properly to be understood a claim for a loss of chance. I therefore turn to assess this loss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss of capitalisation II: loss of a chance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The defendants submit that as a result of Tembusu’s breach of contract, AI lost a chance to obtain NZ$30.5m worth of shares in ACNTZ – by then a listed company – as consideration for the sale of AI’s subsidiaries to ACTNZ. Although for present purposes I accept that this is the correct way of characterising AI’s principal claim for loss, there are two fundamental problems with it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Two fundamental problems</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The first fundamental problem is that AI does not bring itself within the defined circumstances under which the law recognises the loss of a chance as itself an identifiable head of loss. The principal requirement for such recognition may be put in one of two ways: (a) the object of the duty that has been breached must have been to provide the chance in question; or (b) the essence of the breach of duty must be to deprive the plaintiff of the chance or opportunity of securing a favourable outcome: <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>at para 10-047. Thus, in the leading case of <span class="font-italic">Chaplin v Hicks</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1911] 2 KB 786 at 795, Fletcher Moulton LJ observed that the very object and scope of the contract was to give the plaintiff a chance of being selected as a prize-winner. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association</span> [1958] 1 WLR 563, the widow was deprived of the chance of succeeding in her Fatal Accidents Act claim, which was within the object of the solicitor’s retainer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In the present case, it cannot be said that the purpose of the 2012 CLA was for Tembusu to give AI a chance of being listed on the NZAX. The purpose of the 2012 CLA was simply for Tembusu to extend an investment loan to AI in the hope that AI would obtain a listing: see [11]–[13] above. This is clear for three reasons. First, Tembusu did not, under the 2012 CLA, undertake even a negative commitment not to jeopardise AI’s chances of listing, let alone any positive commitment to maximise AI’s chances of listing. The only obligation towards listing under the 2012 CLA is an obligation under cl 5.2 on AI’s shareholders, and even then it is an obligation only to “endeavour” to do so without a moratorium on Tembusu’s converted shares. Second, the 2012 CLA expressly contemplated the possibility that AI might not list. Clause 5 of the CLA gave Tembusu an option to convert its loan into shares in AI if AI did not list. Third, AI expressly rejected Tembusu’s offer to act as a paid consultant to facilitate the listing.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 It was obviously the parties’ hope when they entered into the 2012 CLA that AI would list. But that was not the contractual objective of the 2012 CLA. Tembusu’s duty under the 2012 CLA was to lend money to AI in exchange for the prospect of converting that loan into shares. It was not Tembusu’s duty under the 2012 CLA to provide AI a chance of being listed and it was not the essence of its breach of duty in declaring a default on 16 May 2012 to deprive AI of the chance to list. Accordingly, even if Tembusu’s breach did cause AI to lose a chance of obtaining NZ$30.5m worth of shares in a listed company, that loss is not in principle recoverable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The second fundamental problem is that it is difficult to understand why AI equates the value of the chance that it allegedly lost with the value of its subsidiaries. If the value of AI’s subsidiaries is NZ$30.5m, then the value of an opportunity to sell those subsidiaries for NZ$30.5m worth of shares will be worth NZ$30.5m only if the value of the subsidiaries has, as a result of Tembusu’s breach, fallen to zero: see [103] above. AI has adduced no evidence of such a fall in value. So its subsidiaries, on the evidence before me, must be taken still to be worth NZ$30.5m. But if that is the case, then the lost opportunity to sell them is technically worthless. The sale of those subsidiaries through the proposed listing at NZ$30.5m has been presented to me as an exchange for fair value, not as an exchange at an inflated value. The effect of AI’s claim here is equivalent to saying that a person who loses the chance to exchange his ten-dollar note for another person’s ten-dollar note loses not only a chance of adding ten dollars to his wallet, but a 100% chance of doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In the absence of any evidence that the subsidiaries have depreciated in value, the only sensible way AI could frame a loss of chance claim is to say that the sale of its subsidiaries for shares in ACTNZ would have caused a premium to accrue to the value of the shares issued, and as a result of Tembusu’s breach, AI lost the opportunity to obtain that premium. But even on this hypothesis, the value of the shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>NZ$30.5m) could hardly be the right approximate for the value of the premium, much less the value of the chance to obtain it. And in any event, the loss of a chance to obtain a premium is not the way in which AI has characterised its claim for the loss of a chance.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Causation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Leaving aside these two fundamental problems, I turn to consider what AI needs to show in order for its claim for loss of chance to succeed. First, it must show, on the balance of probabilities, that Tembusu’s breach of the 2012 CLA caused it to lose a chance of selling its subsidiaries for NZ$30.5m worth of shares in a listed company: <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group</span> ([115] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 1610A–B. The loss of chance invites the question of causation and not merely quantum because it is itself an identifiable head of loss. As Lord Hoffmann put it in <span class="font-italic">Barker v Corus UK Ltd</span> [2006] 2 AC 572 at [36], “the law treats the loss of a chance of a favourable outcome as compensatable damage in itself”. Second, having established causation for the loss of chance, AI must show that the chance which was lost was “real or substantial” and not merely speculative: <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel </span>([115] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [135] and [139], endorsing <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group</span>. In my view, neither of these requirements is made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 A plaintiff establishes causation for the loss of a chance by showing on the balance of probabilities that he has lost the chance: <span class="font-italic">McGregor</span> at para 10-046. The issue is whether AI has shown that it would have had a chance to sell its subsidiaries for NZ$30.5m worth of shares in a listed company but for Tembusu’s declaration of default on 16 May 2012. In this regard, AI relies on various aspects of Tembusu’s conduct as causative events even though, as I have explained at [109] above, it is not open to AI to do so because that conduct does not amount to breaches of the 2012 CLA. These aspects include Tembusu’s refusal to settle the dispute underlying this action, Tembusu’s commencement of this action against the defendants, and Daniel Lee’s refusal to sign the pre-listing documents as a director of ACTNZ.

</div> Tembusu says that there is no evidence that IRG succeeded in fulfilling this condition precedent. If that is true, then there was no substantial chance of IRG taking the necessary steps to enable AI to list, even if Tembusu had not breached the 2012 CLA on 16 May 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The defendants respond by saying that Mr King “categorically rebutted” this allegation at trial.

</div> But I find no such rebuttal in the record. As Tembusu correctly submits, Mr King was wholly unable during cross-examination to identify any evidence before me which showed that this condition precedent was ever satisfied. The only document he could point to was AI’s disclosure document dated 11 May 2012 which was submitted to the NZAX. But that document is inconclusive. In that document, the figure of NZ$250,000 is listed in ACTNZ’s <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> unaudited statements only on the “assumption” that it had been raised.

</div>
</div> And similarly, he could point to no evidence that the BT$500,000 had been raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In the absence of evidence that IRG would have been able to fulfil a condition precedent for which it was alone responsible in the listing process, the defendants fail to satisfy me that there was a real or substantial chance that IRG would have acted to facilitate AI’s listing had Tembusu not repudiated the 2012 CLA. Given this missing step, there could not also have been a real or substantial chance that the NZAX would have approved AI’s application to list. It is therefore also not necessary to consider whether AI has shown, on the balance of probabilities, that it would itself have taken the necessary steps to facilitate its listing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 But there is a further reason why AI’s lost chance was not real or substantial. This reason arises from the fact that AI, as I have noted at [103] and [126] above, is not claiming the difference between the subsidiaries’ value and the value of its shares in ACTNZ were AI to list. AI’s subsidiaries presumably are still worth NZ$30.5m as they were then, absent any evidence to the contrary. If that is AI’s position, then AI must show that it lost all possibility of ever listing as a result of Tembusu’s repudiatory breach on 16 May 2012. It must show that it lost <span class="font-italic">the</span> chance forevermore to list, not<span class="font-italic"> a</span> chance in 2012 or 2013, to list. If not, AI could well list today and benefit from the capitalisation of a new company’s shares in the value of NZ$30.5m. And if that is the case, then it cannot be said that AI lost a “real and substantial chance” that a third party would facilitate its listing had Tembusu not repudiated the 2012 CLA. But AI has produced no evidence to persuade me its chance of listing was permanently lost by reason of Tembusu’s breach. That is another reason why its claim for damages for the loss of a chance must fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 For completeness, I will turn to consider whether AI mitigated it loss, as this issue was fully argued.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Mitigation of damages</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The principal rule on mitigation of damages is that a plaintiff must take reasonable steps to mitigate the loss he suffers as a result of the defendant’s wrong; if he suffers any avoidable loss as a result of unreasonable action or inaction, he cannot recover damages for that loss: <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>at para 9-004, endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> [2010] 2 SLR 1154 at [24]. This rule has conventionally been referred to as a “duty” to mitigate. But it is well-recognised that the rule does not give rise to a duty in the sense that the plaintiff owes an obligation to the defendant to do so: <span class="font-italic">Darbishire</span><span class="font-italic"> v Warran</span> [1963] 1 WLR 1067 at 1075. Instead, the rule simply bars the plaintiff from recovering damages which he could reasonably have avoided: <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>at [23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 It is well-established that the burden of proof on the issue of mitigation rests on the contract breaker, who in this case is Tembusu: <span class="font-italic">Roper v Johnson</span> ([36] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 181–182; <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> at [24]. So I reject Tembusu’s submission that AI bears the burden of proof on the question of mitigation.

</div> As regards what exactly Tembusu must show, the Court of Appeal has said that the “singular practical focus” of the mitigation inquiry is one of reasonableness, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “whether or not the aggrieved party acted reasonably to mitigate its loss”: <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> at [30].

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Commencing this action is not, however a breach of the 2012 CLA. Nor does the defendants’ counterclaim encompass a claim for damages against the plaintiff for malicious prosecution in bringing this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Leaving that aside, the parties’ submissions on mitigation have centred on the issue whether AI attempted reasonably to mitigate its loss by overcoming the obstacle to listing which this action posed. That assumes, contrary to my findings thus far, that (a) this action is brought in breach of one of Tembusu’s obligations under the 2012 CLA and (b) that breach caused AI to suffer the loss of the sale of its subsidiaries for NZ$30.5m worth of shares in a listed company or the loss of the chance to achieve such a sale. So I will proceed to analyse the issue with these assumptions in mind. It will be seen that even on this hypothesis, AI’s claim must fail because it did not act reasonably to mitigate its loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Tembusu’s contention is that AI could have proceeded with the listing notwithstanding this action but made no reasonable efforts to do so. Tembusu rests this contention on three grounds. First, there is no evidence that the applicable listing rules contained a requirement that a company seeking to be listed had to be able to make a positive declaration of non-indebtedness.

</div>
</div> Thus it could not be said that AI’s inability to make such a declaration – because of Tembusu’s claim in this action that AI’s obligation to repay the sums lent under both the 2007 CLA and the 2012 CLA were immediately due and payable on and from 16 May 2012 by reason of a default – was what prevented it from listing. Second, even if there were such a requirement, AI could have attempted through IRG to avoid its consequence by either choosing not to disclose the litigation to the NZAX or applying to the NZAX to waive the requirement. In this regard, Mr King gave evidence that he had experience with these options when listing another company, MYKRIS Ltd, who had been sued for NZ$4.7m.

</div> However, his evidence also suggests that this was too conclusory a view to take. It appears from his evidence that not even the NZAX took the view that ACTNZ could not be listed when it was informed about the dispute between AI and Tembusu. When asked during cross-examination whether he knew that the NZAX had considered the listing aborted because of the dispute, Mr King demurred and said only that NZAX would not proceed until the pre-listing agreement was signed.

</div> It did not entitle Tembusu to have a nominee director on ACTNZ’s board. So AI owed Tembusu no obligation to keep Mr Lee on ACTNZ’s board. Therefore, as Tembusu argues, if AI had really wanted a director’s signature on the pre-listing agreement so that the listing could proceed, it was entirely open to AI to replace Mr Lee on ACTNZ’s board with its own nominee. But AI of course did no such thing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In my judgment, therefore, Tembusu has succeeded in establishing that AI failed to take reasonable steps to surmount any obstacle which Tembusu’s declaration of default presented to AI’s listing. If the defendants’ case is to be believed, they were in mid-2012 on the brink of losing the benefit of capitalising some NZ$30.5m worth of assets. The size of this incentive, though, apparently was not a sufficient spur to AI to make every effort through IRG to push the listing through. As Tembusu has put it, it appears that after Tembusu’s declaration of default on 16 May 2012, IRG was content simply to “sit on its hands, keep its fee and declare that it was no longer possible to list”.

But the figure of NZ$30.5m does not represent the net value of the benefit or profit that AI would have allegedly obtained had the listing proceeded. That figure represents what the defendants assert to be the actual value of AI’s subsidiaries and also the value of the shares ACTNZ would have issued to AI in exchange for AI’s subsidiaries. NZ$30.5m therefore represents the gross value, not the net value, of the benefit which would allegedly have accrued to AI.

The nature of such damages was explained by the Earl of Halsbury LC in <span class="font-italic">The Owners of the Steamship “</span><span class="font-italic">Mediana” v The Owners, Master and Crew of the Lightship “Comet” (The Mediana)</span> [1900] AC 113 at 116:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… “Nominal damages” is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like real damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term “nominal damages” does not mean small damages …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Thus, on the assessment of damages, having found that Tembusu has breached the 2012 CLA and thus caused an infraction of AI’s legal right to have that contract performed, and having also found that no loss was proved to have been sustained by AI as a result, I order the Tembusu to pay to AI nominal damages on AI’s counterclaim. I fix the quantum of those nominal damages at S$1,000. Tembusu is, however, under no liability to pay any damages to Mr Wan on his counterclaim. As I have explained, he is not a party to the contract on which his counterclaim now stands.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Having foreshadowed my judgment and a summary of my reasons to the parties, I then heard the parties on costs. Tembusu disclosed then that it had served an offer to settle on the defendants under which it had offered to pay the defendants S$2,500 to settle their counterclaim. Accepting that offer would have been a better outcome for both Mr Wan and for AI than pressing ahead with the assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In my decision on costs, I bear in mind the general rule that costs should follow the event and the specific rule applicable here, which is O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The event in the assessment of damages is in AI’s favour. Costs following the event, AI is entitled to the costs of the assessment on the standard basis from the date of its counterclaim, but only up to the date of the offer to settle. Tembusu quantifies these costs at between S$10,000 and S$15,000. AI did not accept Tembusu’s offer to settle and has recovered less than Tembusu offered. So Tembusu is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from the date of the offer to settle to the date of my judgment. Tembusu quantifies these costs at about S$15,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The defendants do not object to Tembusu’s figures. Indeed, they have in large part adopted those figures by suggesting that I order AI to pay Tembusu a net sum of S$4,500 for the costs of the assessment.

If  that position were well-founded in law, he would, like AI, be entitled to at least some part of his costs of the assessment. But the Court of Appeal did not compel or even permit Mr Wan to initiate a wholly misconceived assessment of damages arising from a breach of a contract to which he was not even a party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Mr Wan will therefore have to pay to Tembusu the entire costs of his assessment of damages.

</div> First, the counterclaim raised, at a very late stage, complex issues of fact and law, including how a failed listing could result from a breach of contract. Second, after the defendants brought their counterclaims, I ordered both defendants to furnish S$120,000 as security for the costs of their counterclaims. Out of this S$120,000, Tembusu estimates that S$20,000 to S$30,000 is attributable to Mr Wan’s counterclaim, based on his shareholdings in AI and its associated companies. Mr Wan, on the other hand, invites me to fix these standard costs at S$5,000, although he makes no argument to support that figure.

</div> That implies that the costs which the defendants now pay to Tembusu will not be dissipated, for want of a better word, in the liquidation. Second, as Tembusu has pointed out, its liquidation is in the hands of independent external liquidators. It may safely be assumed that they will not effect a final distribution of Tembusu’s assets without regard to its contingent liabilities, including those arising from this action. That fact is sufficient assurance that the defendants will be able to recover these costs if their appeal succeeds even without a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 I therefore decline to order any stay of execution on any of the awards of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Daniel Chia and Ker Yanguang (Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>S Magintharan, James Liew and Vineetha Gunasekaran (Essex LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
