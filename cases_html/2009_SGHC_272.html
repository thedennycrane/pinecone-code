He was asked to stand against the wall and close his eyes. Zameen then pressed both of his thumbs against the victim’s throat for a few seconds to stop the blood circulation to his head. The victim fell unconscious thereafter and when he woke up, he felt pain all over his body<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>.

They “sparred” for about 15 minutes over three rounds. During these three rounds of “sparring”, towels were again wrapped around their fists. The victim was punched by Iryan many times on his chest. He tried to fight back but “not that much” as Iryan was bigger and taller than him and he was “already in fear”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span>. Unlike the “sparring” session on 26 April 2008, Iryan did not control his strength<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> and used full force on the victim who felt pain in his chest, ribs and hands<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span>. While the victim “sparred” with Iryan, Zameen acted as a lookout<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span>. After this “sparring” session with Iryan, the victim rested for about a minute. Zameen then said that he wanted to “spar” with the victim. The victim took Zameen on as he did not want to “lose face”. They then “sparred”, with towels wrapped around their fists, for about two minutes. The victim felt that Zameen was using full force on him and he could also feel that the force was greater than Iryan’s. The victim did not tell them to use less force as he knew they were doing it on purpose and wanted to punch him hard for bragging.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Zameen punched the victim very hard<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>.

Zameen stopped and the victim sat on the floor and rested<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span>.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_23"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23     Later that evening, after they had washed up, Iryan asked the victim to “try Sonic Blastman”. The victim initially refused but eventually agreed out of fear<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span>. He was asked to sit on the floor, with his back straight and chest out<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>.

After hearing this, Iryan and Zameen stopped punching the victim<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>. Zameen then told the victim to follow him to the toilet area.

He also told the victim that if he “ma[d]e it [a] good one”, he would not beat the victim<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span>. Out of fear, the victim complied<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>. Iryan stood on the “property box” to look out of the utility window and act as a lookout<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span>. While the victim performed the sexual act, Zameen read a magazine in which female models were featured<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span>. After the victim had sucked Zameen’s penis for about five to ten minutes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span>, Zameen pushed his head away and ejaculated into the toilet bowl<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>.</font></p>

<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3    The following day on a Sunday (recorder’s note: 27<sup>th</sup> April 2008), we woke up in the morning at or about 7am for the muster. Afterwhich, we were still inside the cell as there is no going out to the yard on a weekend. We chatted and …one of the topics was about [the victim’s] plan who suggested to Zameen and I to bring one of the inmate from the next cell (recorder’s note: Cell 5-56) into ours. His name was [Sathish], a male Indian around my age. [The victim] told us that his plan was to being [Sathish] into our cell so that we could bully and also force him to suck our cocks. I disagreed with this. At the same time, I was also angry with [the victim] as he was planning to make use of Zameen to persuade [Sathish] to join our cell. Zameen also disagreed with [the victim’s] idea.</font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4    I found [the victim] to be boastful and told him off. I <b>did tell him to find a way to satisfy me</b>. He replied to me that I may kick him if I wished to punish him. Thus., I went over, told him to stand up while placing his arms straight up. He complied and I kicked his once on his left ribcage. He squatted down as I believed that he could felt some pain. Zameen then went to [the victim] and talked to him in Tamil. I do not understand what they were talking about. I did not kick [the victim] thereafter and told him not to ask me to punish him further if he could not take the pain. He replied to me by coming up with suggestions such as giving his food to Zameen and myself, wash the cell for us, massaged our body or fan us. I told him that I do not want all those as my intention was not to bully him but to teach him a lesson once and for all.</font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5    Zameen continued to speak to [the victim] in Tamil. Zameen then turned to me and told me to write down ten different things inside torn pieces of paper. <b>The things Zameen meant are the types of punishment for [the victim]</b>. I agreed and took a piece of white paper and a blue pen from our cell, which belongs to either Zameen or [the victim]. <b>From what I could remember, I wrote down the ten lists as follows: (1) sparring (2) Sonic blastman (3) dance as a girl (4) eat shit (5) drink urine (6) massage our bodies at night (7) split legs (8) fan us at night (9) blackout. I could not remember what I had written for the last punishment. [The victim] asked me what they were. I replied to him that I will give him 5 ‘heavy’ and 5 ‘light’ punishments. He also asked me if anyone of them contains sexual acts. I told him that there is none. I wished to state that none of the punishment acts which I wrote down contains any sexual acts such as lick and suck penis or fuck [the victim’s] backside. Zameen and I came out with the acts</b>. ‘Blackout’ and ‘Massage our bodies at night’ were suggested by [the victim].</font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6…[The victim] picked up 5 of the 10 folded papers randomly. <b>I remembered that they are to eat shit, drink urine, Sonic blastman, blackout and lastly to dance like a girl</b></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7    <b>[The victim] told us that he does not want to eat shit and drink urine</b>. Thus we told him to choose from the remaining five papers. This time, the papers had already been unfolded and [the victim] is able to read from all of them. He selected sparring and massag[ing] our bodies at night. Zameen and I planned that for the night after the last muster ended at or about 6.15pm, we would first start the sparring session, followed by the Sonic blastman, blackout, dance like a girl and lastly to massage our bodies at night. <b>I started the sparring session first with [the victim] while Zameen continued his role to lookout for any incoming prison officers. This time. I did not hold back my punches and gave it my full strength</b>. However, the rules are still the same; both of us still continued to wrap our fists with bathing towels and avoid hitting the face and penis region.</font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8    We sparred longer this time for about 20 minutes or so. I suffered bruises on both of my forearms while I was covering myself from [the victim’s] punches. My collarbone also had some scratches as when [the victim] punched me, his towel rubbed against my skin. <b>However, [the victim] suffered more that I do. I knew that he could not take anymore punches from me as he kept falling down on his own after being punched by me a few times</b>...After I completed my session with [the victim], it was Zameen’s turn. I then took up his role to lookout for any incoming prison officers. I am unsure whether Zameen did use any bathing towels to wrap his fist during their sparring session. However, I do remembered Zameen telling [the victim] that he do not like to use bathing towels to wrap around his fists as he prefers to punch with his knuckles.</font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9    <b>Their session did not last as long as mine. I believed that it was only for about less than 10 minutes as [the victim] seems that he could not take anymore punches. [The victim] kept falling and squatting down after receiving one or two punches from Zameen. Both of us criticised him while he was standing against the wall and appears to be in pain. We then told him to continue to stand against the wall and face us as we wanted to give him a ‘Sonic blastman’. He reluctantly complied with us. I gave a full force punch on his chest area between his breasts. He squatted down in pain. He stood up again on his own and this time Zameen gave [the victim] also a full force punch to the same area. [The victim] squatted down again in pain and he stood up slowly after that.

<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10    <b>Afterwhich, Zameen and I gave [the victim] another ‘Sonic blastman] punch. This went on for about ten rounds each till night time. Subsequently, [the victim] said that he gave up as he could not take anymore punches. We told him that he still needed to complete the remaining acts which he chose earlier. We also told him that we are going to perform the ‘blackout’ on him. However, [the victim] informed that he could not do it as earlier in the day we had also done the ‘blackout’ on him</b>, as he had suggested. I could not remember which part of the day we had done it on him. <b>We continued to criticize [the victim] as he could not complete the acts and in between, we would gave him a ‘Sonic blastman’ each.

I scolded him as earlier he was the one who informed that he does not wished for the sexual acts to be written inside but only now then he started to suggest it again. <b>Thus, we gave him another few rounds of ‘Sonic blastman’. Finally, [the victim] suggested sucking our penises. By this time, I could see that [the victim] was in pain from the punches we gave to him</b>. We thought about his suggestion first. Afterwhich, we agreed since our main intention was to teach him a lesson and by him sucking our penises would make him ashamed of himself. Thus, we told [the victim] and he agreed to it….</font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11    On the same night after lights off, Zameen went over to the toilet area and sat at the small stone wall next to it, while browsing through his ‘Hotstuff’ magazine. <b>At the same time, [the victim] squatted down in front of [Zameen] while sucking his penis</b>.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_40"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40     On the morning of 29 April 2008, there was an indoor yard where the inmates got to watch television. Before this, there was a strip search. The prison officer did not detect any injury on the victim’s body because of his dark complexion<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span>. The victim did not tell the prison officer anything as he was afraid<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, the accused persons were standing beside him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span>. The victim then went to the indoor yard where a Tamil movie was being screened. After watching the movie, the accused persons and the victim went back into cell 5-55<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span>. Although lunch was served, the victim did not eat his as Iryan took it away and asked him to “eat shit”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span>. The victim refused and the accused persons took turns punching him on his chest. They stopped only when the victim agreed to eat faeces<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span>. Hamdan then went to the toilet and defecated beside it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span>. One of the accused persons then asked the victim to eat Hamdan’s faeces. Using his hand, the victim took the faeces and put it in his mouth. One of the accused persons then asked the victim to chew. As he was chewing, the victim felt like vomiting. He was told by one of the accused persons that if he vomited, he would be beaten up more<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_169" id="Ftn_169_1"><sup>[note: 169]</sup></a></span>. The victim swallowed three to four times<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_170" id="Ftn_170_1"><sup>[note: 170]</sup></a></span>. All three accused persons looked at him and make “eee” sounds as they were having their lunch<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span>. The accused persons then asked the victim to rub the faeces around his face and the victim did this<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_172" id="Ftn_172_1"><sup>[note: 172]</sup></a></span>. Later, as the victim was brushing his teeth, one of the accused persons came to the toilet area, handed him a plastic mug filled with urine, and instructed him to drink it. The victim drank this out of fear<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a></span>. After this incident, the victim went to a corner of the cell and sat down to rest as he was in pain; he did not eat that day<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_174" id="Ftn_174_1"><sup>[note: 174]</sup></a></span>.</font></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_98"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">98     In court, Hamdan testified that on 28 April 2008 Zameen had gone to the toilet with the victim first. He did not know whether Zameen sodomised the victim. When Zameen came out of the toilet, he then went in and sat at the modesty wall. The victim squatted down in front of him and started fellating him. However because he was uneasy as it was his first fellatio experience with a male, he pushed the victim’s head away. He also slapped and kicked the victim and told the victim to “get lost”. He then took his shower and told the victim to shower. After the victim had showered, he asked the victim to sit on his left side and “fan for [him]” while he was lying down. According to Hamdan, it was only while the victim was “fanning” him that Iryan went to the toilet<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_343" id="Ftn_343_1"><sup>[note: 343]</sup></a></span>.</font></p>

According to Zameen, the straw mat was needed because he would not have been able to concentrate with Iryan and Hamdan looking at his back while the victim fellated him. While the victim fellated him, it took him “quite long” to achieve an erection because it was “a bit hard” to “fantasise” and “imagine” as he could hear both Iryan and Hamdan talking and Hamdan’s voice, especially, was a bit loud” and “a bit irritating”. In the end however, he fail to get an erection or ejaculate as “emotionally the urge [had] already died down” and because he had already been fellated the day before (<em>ie</em>, 27 April 2008).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_346" id="Ftn_346_1"><sup>[note: 346]</sup></a></span> He subsequently washed himself, came out of the toilet, wiped himself, wore his shorts and lay down on the cell floor on his “sleeping place”.

Instead, he had only seen Zameen’s head “moving forward and backward”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_354" id="Ftn_354_1"><sup>[note: 354]</sup></a></span> in a manner which required Zameen to “take steps”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_355" id="Ftn_355_1"><sup>[note: 355]</sup></a></span>. He also testified that neither Zameen nor the victim had told him about the sodomy incident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_356" id="Ftn_356_1"><sup>[note: 356]</sup></a></span>. When cross examined by Zameen as to why he stated in his statement that Zameen had sodomised the victim, Iryan testified that he had been told to say so. According to Iryan, the accused persons were all isolated on 6 May 2008 – he was in cell 5-46, Hamdan was in cell 5-57 and Zameen was in cell 5-55. On 7 May 2008, he saw “superior [prison] officers” take Zameen out from his cell. The prison officers then came to his cell, started punching and kicking him and also used their batons on him. After they assaulted him, the “first thing they asked [him] was about the sodomy” and whether he had sodomised the victim. When he replied that he had not, they then asked who had sodomised the victim and when he told them that he did not know, they brought him out of the cell, to a staircase where there were no cameras and “whacked” him. He was then asked again about the incident and when he told them that he did not know anything, they put him back into his cell and then went to Hamdan’s cell<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_357" id="Ftn_357_1"><sup>[note: 357]</sup></a></span>. However on the night of 7 May 2008, as he recalled the events of the past days, he knew that something had happened on the night of 28 April 2008 because he had heard a continuous flushing of water for some time and no sound from the shower and because Zameen and the victim “were in the toilet for too long”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_358" id="Ftn_358_1"><sup>[note: 358]</sup></a></span>. According to Iryan, on 9 May 2008, before he made his long statement a “Malay prison IO” had seen him first. The “Malay prison IO” first asked him if he had sodomised the victim to which he denied. He was then asked if the victim had fellated the accused persons and he admitted that all the accused persons had been fellated by the victim. The “Malay prison IO” then showed him a calendar, pointed to the date “28 April 2008” and told him that Zameen had sodomised the victim on that date and that he (Iryan) was aware of it. When he told the “Malay prison IO” that he did not remember anything, the “Malay prison IO” told him not to waste his time and that he was already talking to him “nicely”. He was threatened with a beating and then told again that Zameen had sodomised the victim on 28 April 2008. When he finally said “Yes”, ASP Cindy New<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_359" id="Ftn_359_1"><sup>[note: 359]</sup></a></span> (“ASP New”) took over. In the presence of a Malay interpreter and following his statement that Zameen had sodomised the victim, ASP New then asked him “What does this mean to you?” When he told her that he did not know, the Malay interpreter then asked him “What do you mean you didn’t know? But you know Zameen sodomised [the victim]…on that night, am I right?” When this happened, he then said “Yes, Sir”. According to Iryan, he had only known that Zameen had sodomised the victim on 7 May 2008, and if the “superior officer” did not mention anything to him about the sodomy incident and he had not been “guide[d]” by the Malay interpreter, he would not have known that Zameen had sodomised the victim on 28 April 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_360" id="Ftn_360_1"><sup>[note: 360]</sup></a></span>. When cross examined by Zameen about his second long statement dated 15 May 2008 (see</font> <a href="#p1_35"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[35]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above), Iryan testified that he had not seen the sodomy act and Zameen’s penis entering the victim’s anus. According to Iryan, all that he had meant to say was that he had seen Zameen “bending down” and him “moving forward and backward”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_361" id="Ftn_361_1"><sup>[note: 361]</sup></a></span>. When asked however whether he had concocted the sodomy incident, Iryan however disagreed and said that he would not have been shocked if it had in fact happened given that the victim had masturbated and fellated Zameen before when they were both in Queenstown Remand Prison<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_362" id="Ftn_362_1"><sup>[note: 362]</sup></a></span>.</font></p>

When they asked him if he had sodomised the victim or if he knew who had and he replied that he did not know, he was brought to an office where there were no cameras and further assaulted.

However, when they finished recording the statements of the prison officers and the inmates who were witnesses to the case at about 5.00 p.m. to 5.15 p.m., he was informed by a prison officer that Hamdan wanted to give more facts to the case.

When Hamdan arrived in the interview room, he was asked what additional facts he wanted to give.

After ASP Liyu and Inspector Amelia left the interview room, he asked Hamdan what “karaoke” meant, to which Hamdan replied “suck cock”. As they had been informed by the prison prior to meeting Hamdan that closing muster was at 5.30p.m. and that all inmates had to be in their cell “to account for their presence in their cell”, he told Hamdan that he would go back the next day (<em>ie</em>, 15 May 2008) to record his statement. He did this because Hamdan had just given facts relating to a sexual offence (which had not appeared in his earlier statement dated 9 May 2008) and because he did not want Hamdan to “rush into his statement”.

Such a person also commits an ‘act’ as much as his co-participants actually committing the planned crime. The presence of those who in one way or another facilitate the execution of the common design is itself tantamount to actual participation in the ‘criminal act’: <em>Ramaswami v State of Tamil Nadu</em> AIR 1976 SC 2027.

Secondly, it was reasonable to presume that his physical presence in the circumstances provided encouragement and support for Lee and was therefore in furtherance of their common intention.

However, the recent amendments to the Penal Code neither adopted the definition of “consent” in s 74 of <em>SOA 2003</em> nor the evidential and conclusive presumptions about consent set out in ss 75 and 76 of <em>SOA 2003</em>. Indeed, the only amendment relating to the element of “consent” in the Penal Code was to expand the circumstances under which consent is vitiated under s 90 of the Penal Code, which as Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan &amp; Chan Wing Cheong pointed out in <em>Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2007) (“<em>Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan</em>”) at [19.5] does not define consent in positive terms but:</font></p>

Consent on the part of a woman, as a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only after the exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance and the moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice between resistance and assent. Submission of her body under the influence of fear or terror is not consent. There is a difference between consent and submission. Every consent involves submission but the converse is not true. A woman is said to consent only when she freely agrees to submit herself, while in free and unconstrained possession of her physical and moral power to act in a manner she wanted. Consent implies the exercise of free and untrammelled right to forbid or withhold what is being consented to; it is always a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is proposed to be done by another and concurred in by the former<span class="footnoteref"><a class="remove" href="dhtmled2:#Ftn_417#Ftn_417" id="Ftn_417_1"><sup>[note: 417]</sup></a></span>.</font></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">This ground for vitiating consent is expressly provided for in s90(a). The editors of <em>Ratan[l]al and Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes</em> suggest, without citing authority, that ‘injury’ seems to be limited to physical injury. In reality, such a form of injury will be the most likely type threatened. However, the editors appear to have overlooked s 44 of the Penal Code which states that the term ‘injury’ denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or property. This broad definition of ‘injury’ is wide enough to enable threats of a non-physical nature to vitiate consent….</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Section 90(a) requires the accused to know or have reason to believe that the consent was given under fear of injury. The part concerning ‘reason to believe’ invokes an objective imposition on the accused, such that he or she will be denied the defence if the court determines that he or she ought to have known that [the victim] had consented from fear of injury, even though he or she did not actually know of this. This objective measure may be explained by noting that the accused would have been at least partly to blame for creating the circumstances whereby [the victim] had consented under a fear of injury. Consequently, the law places a duty on the accused to find out if [the victim] was consenting only because of such a fear.</font></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3" xmlns=""><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Whether the victim consented to fellatio under fear of injury?</font></em></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_127"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">127    On each occasion that the victim fellated Iryan and/or Hamdan and/or Zameen on 27 April 2008 (see</font> <a href="#p1_23"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[23]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above), 28 April 2008 (see</font> <a href="#p1_31"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[31]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above) and 4 May 2008 (see</font> <a href="#p1_65"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[65]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above), the victim’s “offer” act was immediately preceded by a situation where the accused persons were assaulting him. On each occasion when he “offered” to fellate the accused persons, the victim did so because he could not take the pain of the accused persons’ beating and wanted them to stop their assaults. These “offers” by the victim were made while the victim was being assaulted by the accused persons. The viciousness and the strength of the accused persons’ assaults were evidenced clearly by the undisputed medical evidence (see</font> <a href="#p1_83"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[83]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">–</font> <a href="#p1_85"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[85]</font></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">). Dr Andrew Tan himself observed that the fracture to the victim’s sternum was usually associated with a significant force consistent with a road traffic accident where the steering wheel hits the driver’s chest<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_418" id="Ftn_418_1"><sup>[note: 418]</sup></a></span> (see</font> <a href="#p1_84"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[84]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above). In these circumstances, the victim could not be said to have freely and willingly offered to fellate any of the accused persons.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_128"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">128    It is clear these “offers” were made only to stop the beatings. Iryan’s long statements provide more than ample evidence on how the victim had made these offers of fellatio because “he could not take [the beatings] anymore”, while “kneel[ing] and ask[ing] for mercy”, while “plead[ing] [with the accused persons] not to beat him any longer” (see</font> <a href="#p1_25"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[25]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">–</font> <a href="#p1_27"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[27]</font></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">,</font> <a href="#p1_34"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[34]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">–</font> <a href="#p1_35"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[35]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and</font> <a href="#p1_67"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[67]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above). Hamdan’s third long statement (see</font> <a href="#p1_38"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[38]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above), cautioned statement (see</font> <a href="#p1_71"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[71]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above) and evidence when cross examined by the prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_419" id="Ftn_419_1"><sup>[note: 419]</sup></a></span> all stated that the victim fellated the accused persons as a “trade” to avoid further beating. The victim was in a dilemma created by the accused persons – if he did not “offer” to fellate the accused persons, the accused persons would continue to beat him up and if he wanted the assaults to stop, he would have to fellate the assailants. Such was the forced “trade” that the victim had to make. That this was also the case is patently clear from the events of 27 April 2008 where Iryan and Zameen stopped assaulting the victim only after the victim had “increased” his offer from one of masturbation to fellatio (see</font> <a href="#p1_25"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[25]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above). In such circumstances, there can be no doubt that the victim never gave a valid consent in law when he fellated the accused persons on the respective dates. A person who has been effectively forced to choose by being presented with two alternatives not of his making and neither of which he is legally bound to do can hardly be said to have given his consent willingly.</font></p>

On this point, the following excerpt from Hamdan’s evidence when cross examined by the prosecution shows clearly that he knew that that the victim consented from fear of injury.</font></p>

In any event, I was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Zameen sodomised the victim on the night of 28 April 2008 for several reasons. First, the victim testified that although he did not see Zameen penetrate his anus with his penis because he (the victim) was on all fours, he assumed this to be the case because Zameen had:</font></p>

<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    after the victim had performed fellatio on Zameen, both stood up;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    instead of showering, the victim turned around and “suddenly” disappeared again; and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    he then saw Zameen moving forwards and backwards.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_135"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">135    In any event, I did not believe that Iryan did not see the victim penetrate the victim’s anus. In court, Iryan contended that he did not state the words “allowed Zameen to penetrate his penis into the [victim’s] asshole” in his second long statement dated 15 May 2008 which was recorded by SSgt Hidayat (see</font> <a href="#p1_35"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[35]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above). If this was indeed the case, Iryan should have amended the statement, which he admitted he was given a chance to by SSgt Hidayat. However, for quite inexplicable reasons, he failed to do so, when, as his first long statement showed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_420" id="Ftn_420_1"><sup>[note: 420]</sup></a></span>, he was more than capable of understanding and amending his statements. Furthermore, when given the chance to clarify the position with SSgt Hidayat, who was called as a prosecution witness (PW40) on the sixth day of trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_421" id="Ftn_421_1"><sup>[note: 421]</sup></a></span>, he again failed to do so and offered the half hearted explanation that he did not know what to ask. Furthermore, if Zameen did not sodomise the victim on 28 April 2008, this begs the question why Iryan would refer again to the incident when answering the fifth question posed by SSgt Hidayat (see</font> <a href="#p1_35"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[35]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above) in his second long statement on whether the accused persons had threatened the victim not to inform the prison officers.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_136"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">136    Third, both Iryan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_422" id="Ftn_422_1"><sup>[note: 422]</sup></a></span> and Hamdan (see</font> <a href="#p1_106"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[106]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and</font> <a href="#p1_108"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[108]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above) sought to explain that they eventually stated that Zameen sodomised the victim in their statements because they did not want to get involved. But, if this was indeed the case, they would have provided as little information as possible of the incident in their long statements. Yet however, both provided detailed accounts of what they had seen between the victim and Zameen (see</font> <a href="#p1_34"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[34]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and</font> <a href="#p1_38"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[38]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above), a move which would surely expose them to even more questions on what they had actually witnessed on 28 April 2008. To my mind, these details could not and would not have been provided unless Iryan and Hamdan actually witnessed the incident. Glaringly also, there was no mention of a straw mat having being placed on the modesty wall, on any day between 27 April 2008 and 5 May 2008, to shield the accused persons from each others’ view, in the six long statements made by Iryan and Hamdan and even in Zameen’s three long statements.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_137"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">137    SSgt Eddie’s evidence that he went to the prison in the afternoon of 14 May 2008 to coordinate the recording of the statements of the prison officers and the inmates who were witnesses to the case and that this only finished at about 5.00p.m. to 5.15p.m. (see</font> <a href="#p1_110"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[110]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above) was also corroborated to some extent by these statements which were shown to Hamdan and which showed that the recording of the last statement only started at 4.55 p.m. on 14 May 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_423" id="Ftn_423_1"><sup>[note: 423]</sup></a></span>.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_138"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">138    For the above reasons, I was of the opinion that Zameen did penetrate the victim’s anus with his penis on the night of 28 April 2008. With my holding that the victim did not consent to fellatio on 28 April 2008 with Hamdan and Zameen, there is no reason why the victim would have consented to Zameen sodomising him immediately after fellatio.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_139"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">139    At the conclusion of the evidence and submissions, I made some amendments to the charges by adding “on or about” before the respective alleged dates of the offences so that the dates of the incidents were not specific (see also</font> <a href="#p1_9"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[9]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">to</font> <a href="#p1_11"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[11]</font></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">above). This was to provide for the possibility that the victim (and even the accused persons) could have been mistaken as the exact sequence of events although there was no doubt that all the alleged incidents (save for Iryan’s 28 April 2008 fellatio charge) did take place during those nine horrific days. As mentioned earlier, the errors in evidence of the victim were probably due to his confusion after the series of traumatic events in cell 5-55. I also amended the charges by deleting all references to “jumping” on the victim’s chest as the evidence adduced showed only punching and stepping on the chest.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_140"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">140    The prison officers were not able to detect the victim’s injuries during the morning inspections for several reasons. The victim has dark complexion, making any external injuries less visible. Most of the injuries were internal in any event and were not immediately visible. The accused persons had taken the precaution of avoiding the infliction of external injuries, especially to the victim’s face. The victim, out of fear instilled by the accused persons, obviously put on a very stoical and convincing front when the prison officers were conducting the inspections. He was also known to be a gang member and as someone who could stand up for himself, having been involved in a fight in prison with someone physically bigger than him. The intercom in cell 5-55 was within his reach at any time. He had ample opportunity to report the assaults at anytime, whether via the intercom or when out during yard time or when the prison officers were on their rounds, but chose to suffer in silence (because of his fear of retaliation from the accused persons or their associates). During the final days of the assault, he avoided going out of the cell for yard time, giving credible excuses. There was no doubt that he would have been taken care of and protected if he had chosen to let the prison officers know of his predicament, as shown by the events that happened after he finally decided to reach for the intercom in the cell. There was no evidence that the prison officers would have disbelieved or ignored him if he had brought the assaults to their attention.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_141"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">141    In the same manner, he avoided telling the medical staff the entire truth and thereby hampered and delayed the medical attention that would have been accorded to him. As stated earlier, most of his injuries were internal and were not immediately obvious on physical examination.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The sentences of the court</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_142"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">142    All three accused persons had antecedents involving some degree of violence, ranging from robbery with hurt to rioting. Where the assault charges under s 323 and 325 of Penal Code were concerned, the accused persons readily admitted that they had beaten up the victim badly and cruelly although they tried to explain that it was the victim’s incessant lies and bragging that had incensed them and, in the case of Iryan, that the victim had actually wanted to make use of Zameen to bring in another inmate into their cell so as to bully that inmate. In respect of the s 324 Penal Code charge, the accused persons did not dispute that it took place – their contention was as to the date and the preceding events. Zameen’s defence to that charge, as noted above, was that he had totally “dissociated” himself from the incident. In respect of the fellatio charges, the dispute arose only because the accused persons, young and unschooled in law, had a simplistic but mistaken understanding of what constituted consent in law. The only real dispute of fact concerned the s 376(1)(a) fellatio charge against Iryan for 28 April 2008 and the sole sodomy charge against Zameen for the same date. Iryan was right to have contested the fellatio charge for 28 April 2008 as he has been acquitted of that charge. Zameen, however, has been convicted despite his strong denial and in spite of the prevarication shown by Iryan and Hamdan in their evidence on this point.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_143"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">143    It would therefore be fair to say that theaccused persons, by claiming trial to the charges, were not seeking to force the victim to recount in court every event that had taken place in the cell between 27 April and 6 May 2008 and thereby adding more pain to the physical and emotional trauma already experienced by the victim. The prosecution had to lead evidence in any case from the victim concerning the physical assaults in order to repel any allegation that the sexual assaults took place with the victim’s consent. The questions posed by the accused persons were generally fair and relevant to what they perceived to be their defence to the charges.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_144"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">144    I noted the sad criminal records of the accused persons. They are highly intelligent young men whose lives could have been a whole lot different from what they are now. I noted also their rather belated expressions of regret and remorse at having committed these anger-fuelled crimes. All of them should really do some serious soul-searching and begin to learn to control their emotions and curb their impulses before something much worse happens to them.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_145"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">145    The atrocities committed by the accused persons in the cell speak for themselves. Their actions were inhumane and repulsive. It is shocking that they allowed themselves to be carried away by their numerical and physical superiority to the extent of bullying a fellow inmate using such sadistic and degrading acts. The execution of the assaults was both crude and cruel. Their relative youth at the time of the offences therefore had to be counterbalanced by the enormity and seriousness of their offences and the fact that they were already in prison and being given a chance at rehabilitation. For the foregoing reasons, I pronounced the following sentences on:</font></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Conclusion</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_146"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">146    The prosecution submitted that Iryan and Hamdan should receive a global sentence of not less than 20 years’ imprisonment coupled with 24 strokes of the cane and that Zameen should receive a total imprisonment term that was higher than that to be imposed on Iryan and on Hamdan, together with 24 strokes of the cane. I did not go as far as the prosecution had urged me to as I believed that the terms of imprisonment and the number of strokes of the cane imposed were already sufficiently severe and should be more than sufficient to punish the young accused persons for what they had done and to make an indelible mark on their consciousness on the need never to stray into violence or any other crime again. My sincere hope for the accused persons is that they will turn this very dark episode of their young lives into a brighter future upon their release. From my observation of them during the trial, they are extremely intelligent, determined and energetic young men who can achieve whatever they set their minds to do. I certainly do not see them as hopeless failures. They were able to grasp legal concepts and court procedures once these were explained to them. They have very agile minds.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_147"></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">147    My closing words for the accused persons are these: put these talents of yours to good use, discipline your minds and study something that interests you. I know you all can study because I have seen the way you memorised the contents of the documents in the Preliminary Inquiry bundle. You can overcome.</font></p>
