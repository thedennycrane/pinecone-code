Indeed, he had, and the phrase “with force” might even be said to be an understatement.

The confidentiality may be provided for in the relevant rules applicable to the arbitration proceedings. However, independent of any such rules, the confidentiality of arbitration proceedings has also found expression as an implied obligation of law: <span class="font-italic">International Coal Pte Ltd v Kristle Trading Ltd </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 945 at [82].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 What of arbitrators’ deliberations? Evidence of deliberations may be given by way of testimony (whether oral or through affidavits) or through the production of the records of deliberations. There is no statutory provision in Singapore that expressly protects the confidentiality of arbitrators’ deliberations. We are also given to understand that this question has not been decided by any Singapore court to date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, it is common ground that the default position is that arbitrators’ records of deliberations are confidential and are therefore protected against production orders. In our view, it can scarcely be argued otherwise. Case law and commentaries confirm the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch v The Metropolitan Board of Works</span> (1872) LR 5 HL 418 (“<span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span>”) at 457, <span class="font-italic">P v Q</span> [2017] EWHC 148 at [59], Gary B Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Wolters Kluwer, 3rd Ed, 2021) at §20.06, Philippe Fouchard <span class="font-italic">et </span><span class="font-italic">al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Fouchard, Gaillard</span><span class="font-italic">, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 1999) at para 1374.

</div>
</div> Prof Jones submitted that it may be appropriate for the court to enquire further in the former case, but not in the latter. For example, an allegation that one arbitrator has been excluded from deliberations would relate to the process and evidence from the arbitrators would be permissible. However, the confidentiality of deliberations must be protected if the allegations concern substantive disagreements. The fact that one arbitrator has been unable to persuade his or her co-arbitrators is simply not enough to override the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations. Prof Jones submitted that the exceptions cannot be articulated with precision but must be focused upon the process, not the substance of the deliberations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We deal first with Prof Jones’ distinction between process issues and substantive disagreements. We agree with Prof Jones that the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations does not apply where the challenge is to what may be described as the essential process rather than the substance of the deliberations. An example of an essential process issue is, as Prof Jones suggested, where the complaint is that a co-arbitrator has been excluded from the deliberations. However, cases involving such process issues are, strictly speaking, not really exceptions to the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations. The protection does not apply to such process issues because they do not involve an arbitrator’s thought processes or reasons for his decision. The policy reasons for the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations are therefore not engaged. The parts of the records of deliberations that need protection do not have to be disclosed. If and when the arbitrator gives oral evidence, his testimony will be limited to the process issues and he may not be questioned as to his thought processes or reasoning. Where the evidence is in the records of deliberations, parts of the records that deal with the arbitrator’s thought processes or reasoning need not be produced or may be redacted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The view that the confidentiality of deliberations does not apply to essential process issues is consistent with case law. In <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span>, the court held (at 457) that an arbitrator may be questioned as to what had taken place before him, including what matters had been submitted to him for decision, but he could not be questioned as to how he arrived at his decision. In <span class="font-italic">Nathan v MJK Constructions </span>[1986] VR 75 (“<span class="font-italic">Nathan</span>”), the Australian Supreme Court of Victoria held that whilst an arbitrator may not be questioned as to his reason for making a particular decision, there was no policy reason why he should not give evidence as to what took place before him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Essential process issues aside, can there be any exceptions to the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations? We are not prepared to go so far as to say, as Prof Jones submitted, that exceptions to the protection must be focused upon the process. In our view, a case would fall within the exception if the facts and circumstances are such that the interests of justice in ordering the production of records of deliberations outweigh the policy reasons for protecting the confidentiality of deliberations. We do not think that we should dismiss the possibility that such a case may arise even though no essential process issues are involved. There may also well be some issues which are described as “process issues” which raise questions of fact and degree as to the extent of consultation between arbitrators which could give rise to the need to explore deliberations, which would require further elucidation, but we do not need to consider that here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 However, we disagree with the plaintiff’s formulation of the scope of the exceptions (see [46] above). The plaintiff’s formulation is far too wide. There are very strong policy reasons for protecting deliberations’ confidentiality. In our view, it would take a very compelling case to overcome these policy reasons. We therefore agree with the defendant and Prof Jones that the exceptions are only to be found in the very rarest of cases. Clearly, the facts and circumstances of the case must be so compelling as to persuade the court that the interests of justice in ordering production of the records of deliberations outweigh the policy reasons for the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations. In our view, such a case would have to involve allegations that are very serious in nature. In addition, it must be shown that the allegations have real prospects of succeeding. For example, allegations of corruption would be serious enough because such allegations attack the integrity of arbitration at its core. If it can also be shown that such allegations have real prospects of succeeding, in our view, the case would fall within the exception to the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations. An order should be made in such a case for the production of the records of deliberations if none of the objections in O 110 r 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies. On the other hand, if the case does not fall within the exception, a production order will <span class="font-italic">not</span> be made even if the documents are relevant or material and none of the other objections in O 110 r 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 We turn next to the three cases referred to by the plaintiff. In our judgment, these cases are of limited or no assistance to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Czech Republic</span>, one of the grounds to annul the arbitration award was an allegation that one of the arbitrators was excluded from crucial parts of the tribunal’s deliberations. All three arbitrators gave evidence on this issue. However, it has been pointed out that under the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure, arbitrators may be called as witnesses in challenge proceedings and may be asked questions about the deliberations (see J Ole Jensen, “The Proof Conundrum” in <span class="font-italic">Tribunal Secretaries in International Arbitration</span> (Oxford University Press, 2019) at para 9.08). <span class="font-italic">Czech Republic</span> is therefore distinguishable. In any event, the issue of exclusion from deliberations was a process issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 <span class="font-italic">FFM</span> concerned a majority arbitration award. The dissenting arbitrator accused the majority of misfeasance and malfeasance. Specifically, the dissenter accused the majority of bias and excluding him from deliberations. To deal with the accusations, the US Southern District Court of New York conducted a hearing in which the arbitrators gave evidence. The Court found that there was nothing more to the extraordinary charges levelled by the dissenter than frustration in failing to convince the majority of his position. In our view, <span class="font-italic">FFM </span>is of limited assistance. The allegation of exclusion from deliberations does not require evidence of the arbitrators’ thought processes and reasoning. As for the allegation of bias, there are no details apart from a reference to the serious nature of the charges by the minority. Further, the judgment does not deal with the arguments or considerations relating to the confidentiality of deliberations at all and any issue of weighing the competing factors for and against disclosure. In the circumstances, <span class="font-italic">FFM </span>is best confined to the facts before the Court. As the Court itself cautioned, the case should not be viewed as a precedent for inquiry into the deliberations of an arbitration panel, noting that such matters should remain confidential and inviolate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Dobish</span>, the basis of the plaintiff’s application to vacate the award was that the arbitrator failed to take into account the fact that the defendant had waived one of its defences during the arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff sought documents (including the records of deliberations) from the arbitrator as evidence of such waiver. The US District Court of Nebraska ordered disclosure of the documents. However, it must be noted that the documents were sought to establish the objective fact of waiver, rather than to enquire into the thought processes of the arbitrator. In coming to its decision, the Court expressly noted the “objective and limited nature of the facts” that the documents were sought to prove. The Court went further to order production of the documents to the Clerk of Court for the magistrate judge’s review in camera in view of the potential for production of irrelevant, sensitive and private materials. In our view, <span class="font-italic">Dobish</span> is consistent with the proposition that arbitrators may be required to give evidence as to matters that took place before them, but not as to their reasons for their decisions, similar to the views expressed in <span class="font-italic">Duke of Buccleuch</span> and <span class="font-italic">Nathan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [51] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff’s case falls within the exception</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As stated in [33] above, the plaintiff seeks production of the records of deliberations to support its case that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Majority in fact decided a key liability issue on grounds or for the true reasons that are not contained in the Final Award (but in the May Award as stated by the Minority) and/or as a result of a breach of the fair hearing rule, which can arise from the chain of reasoning adopted by the Majority.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Majority attempted to conceal the true reasons behind the Final Award (by issuing the May Award for approval by the ICC, before making material changes to it in the Final Award following further concerns expressed by the Minority and despite the May Award having been approved by the ICC).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Majority lacked impartiality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The allegation of breach of the fair hearing rule in [58(a)] above is not sufficient to displace the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations. Besides, this allegation can be decided based on the arbitration record; the records of deliberations are unnecessary (see [32] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The plaintiff’s case in [58(b)] above is difficult to follow. How does issuing the May Award for approval and making material changes in the Final Award following further concerns expressed by the Minority after the May Award had been approved amount to an attempt to conceal the true reasons behind the Final Award? During oral submissions, the plaintiff clarified that the complaint was that the Majority concealed the fact that the revised draft award that was sent to the ICC Secretariat (after the May Award had been approved) was actually substantially changed, although it appeared to have been in response to the comments made by the ICC Court.

</div>
</div> If changes were made in the light of the dissent of the Minority, that is no more than might be expected and is not evidence of any impropriety. The reasons for the Final Award are those that the Majority chose to give to justify the findings they made, and they stand or fall on their own merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The question remains then whether the allegations, that (a) the reasons in the Final Award are not the true reasons, (b) the Majority concealed the fact that the revised draft award included substantial changes that went beyond the ICC Court’s comments, and (c) the Majority lacked impartiality, can constitute an exception to the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations. We doubt whether (a) and (b) are sufficient to constitute an exception. In our view, it seems arguable that lack of impartiality <span class="font-italic">could</span> constitute an exception because impartiality is fundamental to the integrity of arbitration proceedings. Further, as argued in the conclusion in <span class="font-italic">The Partisan Arbitrator</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the “general principle of the secrecy of deliberations exists to protect the arbitrators from undue pressures from the parties and the public, and surely not to facilitate the concealment from the parties of an arbitrator’s partisanship.”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 However, we do not have to come to a definitive conclusion because, in any event, the plaintiff has not shown that these allegations have real prospects of succeeding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As stated in [29]–[30] above, the plaintiff seeks production of the documentary evidence within the Tribunal’s records of deliberations specifically referenced in certain paragraphs/footnotes of the Dissent. The allegations in the relevant paragraphs in the Dissent that are referred to relate to or revolve around the following allegations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Majority was wrong in its findings/reasons and ignored defects that were flagged by the Minority. In some instances, the Majority did not provide explanations or gave reasons that were vague or imprecise, or the Majority was deliberately evasive in discussing crucial issues. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Majority relied on facts/matters that were not pleaded or argued and the defendant was not given the opportunity to comment on the same. In some instances, the Majority did so despite the fact that the Minority had pointed out that they were not part of the parties’ cases. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Final Award does not state the true reasons for the Majority’s decision; instead, the true reasons are to be found in the May Award. The Majority reversed some of its previous views without providing any explanation. The reason that the Majority submitted the draft award to the ICC Court the second time was not that the Majority refused to implement a comment from the ICC Court but that the Majority had revised and amended its reasoning in Part Q1 substantially. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Majority provided an untruthful account of the deliberation history and misstated the record.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Majority lacked impartiality.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The Majority is aware that the reason they provided in the Final Award for the Minority’s refusal to sign is incorrect. The Minority had explained to the Majority that he refused to sign the Final Award because he did not believe that there was honest disagreement between them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The footnotes generally allege that the documentary evidence of the allegations can be found in the records of deliberations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 At the outset, it is clear that the allegations in [63(a)] and [63(b)] above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Majority was wrong in its findings, exceeded the parties’ cases or did not afford the defendant the opportunity to comment, are irrelevant to the Production Applications. Whether the Majority is wrong in its findings is not even a legitimate ground for the purposes of the setting aside application. As for the allegations that the Majority exceeded the parties’ cases or did not give the defendant the opportunity to comment, these allegations can be determined based on the arbitration record, as the plaintiff has itself accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 With respect to the allegations in [63(c)] and [63(d)] above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the true reasons for the Majority’s decision are to be found in the May Award and not the Final Award, and the Majority has given untruthful accounts of the deliberation history and made misleading statements, the plaintiff has provided no basis for these allegations. The plaintiff relies on the Dissent. However, the Dissent does not state any basis for the Minority’s allegations. The Dissent does not explain why the reasons in the Final Award are not the true reasons or why the reasons in the May Award are the true reasons. The Dissent does not even explain how the reasons in the Final Award differ from those in the May Award, or what the untruthful accounts of the deliberation history were, or what the misleading statements were. The Minority’s allegations represent his own subjective views or opinions, as he in part expressly recognised in his Dissent. He has not stated the facts that allegedly support his views or opinions. Clearly, such bare allegations, even if made by a co-arbitrator, cannot be sufficient. This is all the more so when the Minority has made serious allegations tantamount to accusing the Majority of dishonesty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff submitted that the Minority is in an invidious position because that is all that he could say in the Dissent. In our view, the plaintiff’s submission is not borne out by the Dissent. The Dissent includes allegations concerning what happened during the deliberations, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, that the Minority had brought the alleged deficiencies to the attention of the Majority (at para 5 of the Dissent), and that the Majority ignored the Minority’s objections (at paras 8, 9 and 16(a)). In addition, the Minority himself applied the following principles (at para 11 of the Dissent): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An arbitrator is under a duty to disclose misconduct to the parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where an arbitrator witnesses improprieties in the course of the arbitral proceedings, which go to the integrity of the proceedings, he might properly raise these matters in a dissenting opinion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It seems to us that the Minority did not at all feel constrained about disclosing what he alleged to be misconduct and improprieties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The plaintiff also submitted that this Court should order production of the records of deliberations so that the plaintiff can investigate the allegations made by the Minority. We disagree. It is trite that production of documents will not be ordered to support what is nothing more than a fishing expedition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Minority’s allegation of lack of impartiality in [63(e)] above is based on his other allegations set out in [63]. We have dealt with [63(a)] to [63(d)]. The Minority states (in para 251 of the Dissent) that he has “difficulties to avoid the impression that the Majority is determined to have the [defendant] prevail in this arbitration on however untenable the grounds.” First, this statement shows clearly that the Minority’s allegation of bias is based on his “impression”. Second, even if it were to be argued that the Majority was so wrong in its conclusions and reasoning in the Final Award that the only inference is that they lacked impartiality, that argument can be dealt with on the basis of the arbitration record alone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In our view, the allegation in [63(f)] (even if true) does not assist the plaintiff. The reason stated in the Final Award is that the Minority declined to sign the Final Award in the light of his disagreement with the Majority’s conclusions and reasoning. It is correct that the Minority did disagree (vehemently, in fact) with the Majority’s conclusions and reasoning. However, the Minority says that the reason for his refusal to sign the Final Award was his lack of belief that there was honest disagreement between the Majority and him.

</div> The Minority’s stated reason was an accusation that the Majority were dishonest in their conclusions and reasoning. Obviously, the Majority disagreed with this characterisation by the Minority. In our view, the manner in which the Majority chose to describe the reason for the Minority’s refusal to sign the Final Award does not support the allegation that the Majority was partial towards the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As for the plaintiff’s allegation that the Majority concealed the fact that its revised draft award included substantial changes that went beyond the ICC Court’s comments, we note first of all that this allegation is not one of the grounds that the plaintiff relies on in its setting aside applications (see [31] above). In addition, this is another bare allegation. The plaintiff has not stated how the concealment was carried out; neither has the plaintiff given any basis to support this alleged concealment. In fact, as part of the scrutiny process, revised draft awards are submitted to the ICC Secretariat and reviewed by the counsel in charge of the file. The review by the counsel and any subsequent scrutiny by the ICC Court would be a review/scrutniy of the whole revised draft award. It seems to us highly unlikely that the fact that the changes in the revised draft went beyond the ICC Court’s comments would not have been noticed by the counsel in charge or by the ICC Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff’s argument that the May Award is not part of the records of deliberations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 During oral submissions, the plaintiff submitted that the May Award was not part of the records of deliberations as it was not a discussion between the arbitrators.

</div>
</div> However, this position is different from that taken in the Production Applications. Item 2 in the Schedules seeks production of documentary evidence within the records of deliberations and item 2(b) expressly refers to the May Award as one such document. There is no application for production of any document that is not part of the records of deliberations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In any event, we disagree with the plaintiff’s submission. The plaintiff’s notion of what constitutes deliberations is unjustifiably narrow and does not reflect reality. A rule of the confidentiality of the deliberations must, if it is to be effective, apply generally to the <span class="font-italic">deliberations stage</span> of a tribunal’s proceedings; the form or forms the deliberation takes varies greatly from one tribunal to another: Alan Redfern, “Dissenting Opinions in International Commercial Arbitration: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly” in <span class="font-italic">Arbitration Insights</span> (Julian DM Lew QC and Loukas A Mistelis eds) (Kluwer Law International, 2004) at para 18-50.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It is clear from Art 34 of the ICC Rules and the explanation in the Secretariat’s Guide to ICC Arbitration (see [11]–[12] above) that the scrutiny process by the ICC Court forms part of the deliberations stage of the tribunal. Under Art 34, the ICC Court may comment on points of substance. Although the arbitral tribunal makes the final decision on points of substance, it would consider the ICC Court’s comments. Until the award is finally signed and notified to the parties, the award cannot be said to have been finalised. In our view, therefore, the protection of confidentiality of deliberations applies to the May Award as well.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether any of the objections in O 110 r 17(2)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">b</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">i)–(iii) and (v)–(vi) applies?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In view of our conclusions above, it is not necessary for us to deal with the defendant’s submissions on r 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i)–(iii) and (v)–(vi) of the 2014 Rules, save to make the following points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First, under O 110 r 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i), a document is “relevant” if it is connected to (or has a bearing on) an issue in the case so that it might be considered by the court for the purpose of reaching a decision; the term “material” signifies that the document has potential significance beyond mere relevance so that it is necessary for the court to consider it: Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice </span>(LexisNexis, 2023) at para 110/14–21/7. In this regard, we note the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Item 2(d) in the Schedules seek documents “establishing how the Majority incorrectly explained away its findings on issues that Parties were not given an opportunity to comment”. In our view, this item is neither relevant nor necessary. Whether the Majority was correct in its explanations is not relevant for purposes of the Setting Aside Application. Whether the parties were given an opportunity to comment can and should be decided based on the arbitration record. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Items 2(g), 2(h) and 2(k) in the Schedules essentially refer to documents demonstrating the Majority’s reliance on facts/matters that were not pleaded or argued and that the parties had no opportunity to comment. The records of deliberations are not necessary for this purpose and both issues can and should be decided based on the arbitration record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, it seems to us that the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations would be a “legal impediment” under r 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii). In any event, even if it is not, the court still has a discretion to decide whether to order production where none of the objections enumerated under r 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) apply: <span class="font-italic">Arovin</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd and another v Hadiran Sridjaja</span> [2019] 5 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Arovin</span>")<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9]. Therefore, the court can still refuse to order production on the ground that as a matter of law, the confidentiality of deliberations is protected since it has not been shown that the case falls within the exception.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the documents requested have been described with sufficient particularity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Requests for production “must be properly focused on the specific documents or a narrow category of documents”: <span class="font-italic">Arovin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Production Applications seek documents which form part of the record of deliberations “specifically referenced in the Dissent, and which [the Minority] cited in support of various allegations in relation to the procedural irregularities and misconduct”.

</div> of documents which purport to describe the documents sought by referencing allegations in specific paragraphs in the Dissent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The defendant submitted that the Production Applications should be dismissed because the documents sought have not been described with sufficient particularity. As the plaintiff has not persuaded us that its case falls within the exceptions to the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations, it is unnecessary for us to deal with the defendant’s submission in detail. However, we would make the following comments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) We agree with the defendant that the references to specific paragraphs in the Dissent do not therefore mean that the documents are sufficiently identified. Nevertheless, documents that relate to the differences in the Majority’s views or reasoning between the May Award and the Final Award can be identified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, it may be said that some of the documents have not been sufficiently particularised. For example, some of the documents are described as documents evidencing the Minority’s subjective view that the Majority had given an inaccurate/untruthful account of the deliberative history but no particulars of the inaccurate/untruthful accounts have been given. The Majority cannot be expected to be able to identify the documents to be produced.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Applicants for production orders should comply with the requirement to describe the documents sought with sufficient particularity. However, the fact that the documents have not been described with sufficient particularity in an application for production is not necessarily fatal. A production order may still be made in respect of a more defined set of documents where the interests of justice require it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For the reasons stated above, we dismiss Summonses Nos 788 of 2023, 789 of 2023 and 790 of 2023.

However, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">it is not necessary to come to a definitive conclusion in the present case because the plaintiff has not shown that these allegations of impartiality have real prospects of succeeding: at </span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[6</span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">2]–[68]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The court disagrees with the plaintiff’s submission that the May Award was not part of the records of deliberations. The scrutiny process by the ICC Court forms part of the deliberations stage of the tribunal. A draft award submitted to the ICC Court for scrutiny is thus part of the records of deliberations: at </span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[71]</span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">–[73]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Given that the plaintiff has failed to show that the case is an exception to the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations, it is not necessary to deal with the defendant’s other submissions. However, the court notes that it seems</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">that the protection of the confidentiality of deliberations would be a “legal impediment” under O 110 r 17(2)(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">b</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">)(ii) of the 2014 Rules: at </span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[76]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The court also notes that it may be said that some of the documents have not been sufficiently particularised. Some of the documents are described as documents evidencing the Minority’s subjective view that the Majority had given an inaccurate/untruthful account of the deliberative history but no particulars of the inaccurate/untruthful accounts have been given. The Majority cannot be expected to be able to identify the documents to be produced. However, the fact that the documents have not been described with sufficient particularity in an application for production is not necessarily fatal. A production order may still be made in respect of a more defined set of documents where the interests of justice require it: at </span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[79]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.  </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
