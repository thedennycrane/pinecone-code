This would allow the Husband time with the children on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5.00pm to 8.00pm, as well as overnight access from Friday 6.00pm to Saturday 6.00pm, on alternate holidays from 12.00pm to 8.00pm, and during half of the school holidays.

</div> According to the Husband, shared care and control is necessary “so that the Wife does not see herself, and represent herself to the Children, as the parent with the authority to dictate the Children’s relationship with the Husband, and continue to undermine the relationship between the Children and the Husband”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 There is no presumption that shared care and control is always conducive to a child’s welfare, nor is there any legal principle which militates against such an arrangement. Such an order may be made where it is suitable for a child, considering his or her relationship with each parent and all relevant circumstances (<span class="font-italic">TAU v TAT</span> [2018] 5 SLR 1089 (“<span class="font-italic">TAU</span>”) at [20]). This depends on the facts of each case, and there is no general rule of sole care and control such that shared care and control is an exception (<span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span> [2017] 4 SLR 213 (“<span class="font-italic">BNS</span>”) at [73]). Factors relevant to consideration of an order for shared care and control include the child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to cooperate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, given their age and personality, to live in two homes within one week (<span class="font-italic">TAU </span>at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The court will not give much weight to any potential “signalling effect” of a shared care and control order, since orders for care and control engage concerns of workability to a far greater extent than – and are of a different nature from – custodial orders, which courts do take into account the signalling effect of (<span class="font-italic">BNS</span> at [75]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 First, I am unconvinced that the arrangement proposed by the Husband can accurately be described as a shared care and control order. As noted in <span class="font-italic">TAU</span> at [11], cases of shared care and control would normally involve the child spending about three days of the week with a parent and the remaining four days with the other parents, with each parent being responsible for day-to-day decision making for the child when the child is living with him or her. The child will effectively have two homes and two primary caregivers in the arrangement. Contrary to the above, it is striking that neither the Husband’s submissions nor his position in the Joint Summary suggest any way in which the Husband’s responsibilities or care of the Children would in any way differ from an arrangement of access where the Wife has sole care and control. In this connection, I agree with the Wife’s submissions which point to <span class="font-italic">VJM</span> at [19] as saying that calling any arrangement in which a child spends some time with both parents a “shared care and control” arrangement does not fit the current law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Second, the sole reason offered by the Husband for why shared care and control should be ordered is unconvincing. As highlighted in <span class="font-italic">BNS </span>at [75], the court will not give much weight to any potential “signalling effect” of a shared care and control order. The Husband offers no legal basis for why this ought not to be the case, save for the Family Court case of <span class="font-italic">BLX v BLY </span>[2013] SGDC 324 which pre-dates <span class="font-italic">BNS</span>

The Wife has not offered any good reasons for why she now does not trust the Husband to bring the Children overseas, nor has she pointed to any change of behaviour or act of the Husband that would constitute reason to reconsider the Husband’s fitness to bring the Children overseas without the Wife.

This was premised on the court considering separately cash and properties which had supposedly been derived from the Husband’s pre-marital assets, such as the LA Apartment.

This court has also clarified that such evidentiary questions are to be resolved by the burden of proof; that is, the party who asserts that an asset has been acquired through gift or inheritance and is therefore not a matrimonial asset bears the burden of proving this on the balance of probabilities (USB ([33] supra) at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71     In our judgment, the general approach to tracing as stated in Lee Edwin and argued for by the Wife should continue to apply. As marriage is an equal co-operative partnership of efforts, it is inevitable that parties’ assets may become intertwined or co‑mingled during the course of their marriage. In the context of a long marriage, for example, it is unrealistic to expect the married couple to keep detailed records of their fund transfers over time (<span class="font-italic">UNE v UNF</span> [2018] SGHCF 12 at [89]). Nevertheless, we consider instructive the following principles that have been gleaned from the cases in other jurisdictions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72     First, a party claiming that an asset has been acquired by gift or inheritance must adduce sufficient evidence to show linkage between a currently owned asset and an asset acquired by gift or inheritance (<span class="font-italic">CM v NL</span> [2020] BCJ No 8 (“<span class="font-italic">CM</span>”) at [173]). Where money in a bank account is concerned, this could include details on the source of contributions into the account as well as the specific use of the withdrawals (<span class="font-italic">MacLean v MacLean</span> [2019] NSJ No 554 (“<span class="font-italic">MacLean</span>”) at [23]). For example, in MacLean, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court found that the husband was unable to establish that certain moneys in a bank account which the parties had agreed was a matrimonial asset should be returned to him, as they were inheritance moneys. The court noted that there was no detailed accounting of the account, with other moneys having been deposited therein from other sources, including the parties’ joint chequing account. There were also times when the funds in the account fell below the amount of the inheritance moneys, and various withdrawals over the years without specific accounting as to what had been done with them. The court observed that it was therefore impossible to assume that the disbursements from the account were done with matrimonial funds only, leaving the inheritance moneys intact (at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73     In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">GB v LR</span> [2017] BCJ No 1523, which concerned pre-marriage assets, the British Columbia Supreme Court was satisfied, on the basis of detailed banking and investment records, that the husband had, to the wife’s advantage, undervalued his property that was traceable to his pre-marriage assets, and that it was not open to the wife to argue that all of the funds he had deposited in their joint bank account lost their character as excluded property and became hers (at [411]–[412], [415]–[418], [458] and [460]–[464]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Laskosky v Laskosky</span> [1999] AJ No 131 (“Laskosky”), the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench accepted that, where the wife’s inheritance funds were placed in the parties’ joint account and applied to certain purchases, she had satisfied the onus of tracing most of her claim (at [66]). On the facts, these purchases were made immediately or not long after the funds became available for the transactions in question.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74     Second, equitable rules of tracing (as advocated by the Husband in the present case) may guide the court in tracing an asset, such as particular moneys in a bank account, to an asset acquired by gift or inheritance (<span class="font-italic">CM</span> at [173]). That said, the tracing exercise is “not meant to be overly complicated or burdensome” (<span class="font-italic">CM</span> at [174]). Where it is asserted that an excluded property has changed character, each “link in the chain” required to trace the property into the currently-owned asset must be established (<span class="font-italic">CM</span> at [173]–[174]). This suggests “a common sense approach to tracing” dependent on sufficient linkage between a non-matrimonial asset and an asset existing at the time of divorce (CM at [173]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75     Third, the court is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from evidence that is less certain or precise in order to do justice between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Shih v Shih</span> [2017] BCJ No 109 at [44]). However, it would not be sufficient to, for example, point to evidence of a decrease in one account that is concurrent with an increase in another and have the court draw the inference that funds can be traced from one to the other (<span class="font-italic">Liapis v </span><span class="font-italic">Keshow</span> [2021] BCJ No 559 at [326]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76     Fourth, the question of the co‑mingling of matrimonial assets and assets acquired by gift or inheritance is a question of the identifiability of the latter (<span class="font-italic">S v W</span> [2006] 2 NZLR 669 at [57]). Thus, the use to which certain property is put cannot be a basis for co‑mingling. Such co‑mingling of the two types of assets in a bank account does not in itself mean that the latter type has ceased to retain its character as a gift or inheritance as such, although it is likely to make the task of tracing more difficult.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77     Fifth, where an asset acquired by gift has been dissipated or consumed, it would naturally follow that it can no longer be traced (<span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee</span> ([31] supra) at [58]; <span class="font-italic">Lovich v Lovich</span> [2006] AJ No 1271 at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I reject the Husband’s submissions. My reasons are as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, to the extent that the Husband asserts that the LA Apartment was acquired with his pre-marital assets, the onus is on him to adduce sufficient evidence to show a linkage between the two (<span class="font-italic">CLC </span>at [72]). For the reasons explained at [34]–[36] below, I find that he is unable to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">CLC</span> in [76] that co-mingling of assets would not change their character is specifically confined to the issue of co-mingling assets acquired by gift or inheritance with matrimonial assets. This is distinct from assets acquired pre-marriage which have been commingled with matrimonial assets. The Husband has not produced any authorities or any compelling reasons for why the latter should be treated in the same way as the former. In this regard, there is case law which establishes that such commingling would cause pre-matrimonial assets to be no longer separately identifiable (<span class="font-italic">UYP v UYQ </span>[2020] 3 SLR 683 at [14], <span class="font-italic">VPH v VPI </span>[2021] SGHCF 22 at [35]). In any event, even if commingling <span class="font-italic">per se </span>did not cause pre-matrimonial assets to cease to retain their character as such, it would nevertheless in the absence of adequate documentation make it difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain with certainty which moneys were used in each transaction where moneys were disbursed from a bank account containing both kinds of assets (<span class="font-italic">VJR v VJS and another matter </span>[2021] SGHCF 10 at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Third, even assuming for the sake of argument that there is some principled basis for the Husband’s position, the methodology he adopts is unreliable. Specifically, the Husband’s claim is premised on the amount of pre-marital income being a specific fraction (86/100) of the total incomings into the Hong Kong bank accounts from 5 May 2010 to the present. In order for this figure to be reliable, the Husband needs to establish that the denominator of that fraction is true. This would necessitate him proving that the incomings he states are <span class="font-italic">exhaustive </span>of all incoming amounts to the Hong Kong bank accounts from 5 May 2010 to the present. Importantly, to show that the incomings he claims are exhaustive, it is not enough that the Husband shows that there is evidence of the specific incomings he claims: he must also show on a balance of probabilities that <span class="font-italic">no other incomings occurred</span>. If he cannot show this, the denominator he relies on would not be reliable; it would not be safe for the court to accept his submitted percentage of 86%. On the facts, the Husband has failed to show this. As the Wife rightly points out,

</div> it is not sufficient for the Husband to merely provide bank statements from 2010 alone, and statements showing outflows from those bank accounts for those individual transactions. In my view, his failure to produce bank statements for the period 2011 onwards means that he has failed to show on a balance of probabilities that the sum of $7,590,759.62 represents 86% of all the incoming funds that ever entered the Hong Kong bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Fourth, in the present case there is evidence that the Husband treated outgoings from the Hong Kong bank accounts as routinely constituting contributions towards the marriage. By the Husband’s own account, he spent around S$744,946 from these bank accounts between May 2010 and March 2012 on family expenses such as furniture and household items, birthday parties for the children, and groceries.

</div> This demonstrates that beyond the fact that there were commingled funds in the Hong Kong bank accounts, the Husband treated the funds therein as freely available for the payment of household expenses. This provides an additional reason to treat the commingled funds as collectively having been incorporated into the pool of MAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For the above reasons, I find that the Husband is unable to show that the LA Apartment was purchased with funds which comprised 86% of his pre-marital assets. There is thus no basis to accept the Husband’s argument that only 14% of the value of the LA Apartment should be included in the pool of assets for division. Given that the funds in the Husband’s Hong Kong bank accounts should be treated as fully part of the MA pool, there is also no reason to deal with the assets funded by moneys from these bank accounts in a separate category from other matrimonial assets, contrary to the Husband’s arguments.

The Joint Valuer was, in my view, justified in pointing out that the scope of this mandate did not encompass having to respond to the Wife’s query.

</div> The Husband has put forward several criticisms of the Joint Valuer’s approach: I do not find any of his criticisms persuasive, and I address them below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Husband claims that there is a discrepancy between the date that the Joint Valuer was assigned to assess Company R’s value (23 March 2022) and the date at which the financial position of Company R was assessed (24 March 2022).
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-c49ced88-979a-428e-a962-dce50bf85724" data-toggle="modal" type="button">96</button></sup>

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Husband claims that there is not merely a discrepancy in the dates, but that this difference in dates is significant because the Joint Valuer assigned a nil value to Company R’s principal investment of 12,626 shares in Company J, which had been disposed of on 24 March 2022.

</div>
</div> This omission to include the value of the shares in Company J, according to the husband, makes the valuation unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, both these criticisms are based on a misunderstanding of the Joint Valuer’s report. It is clear that the Joint Valuer did not rely on the figures in the table cited by the Husband. The Joint Valuer correctly assessed the valuation of Company R as of 23 March 2022. The assessment of Company R’s net assets at SGD$381,238 was derived from calculations which valued Company R’s shares in Company J at SGD$526,419 as of 23 March 2022 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the correct date).

</div>
</div>
</div> There was thus no discrepancy in the valuation date, nor was any erroneous nil value attributed to the value of shares in Company J. What the Husband’s criticism also fails to appreciate that even after attributing significant value to Company R’s shares in Company J, the Joint Valuer then needed to consider that the net assets of Company R would have to be distributed among Series A Preference Shares before any remaining assets could be distributed among the ordinary shareholders (including Company R). The Husband does not appear to dispute that taking into account this hierarchy of distribution would leave nil value for distribution to the holders of ordinary shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In light of the above reasons, I decline to disturb the Joint Valuer’s assessment of the R Shares’ value as being nil.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged dissipations by parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I now address each party’s allegations of a lack of full and frank disclosure of assets and/or dissipation of assets by the other party and their arguments for adverse inferences to be drawn against each other. In <span class="font-italic">UZN v UZM</span> [2021] 1 SLR 426 (“<span class="font-italic">UZN</span>”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”) set out at [18] (citing <span class="font-italic">BPC v BPB and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 608 at [60]) that an adverse inference may be drawn where: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The CA in <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> went on to give guidance on the issue of alleged dissipations and adverse inferences. As summarised in <span class="font-italic">VMO</span> at [13]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The court’s duty is “to ensure that the matrimonial pool reflects the full extent of the material gains of the marital partnership”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [59].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) One means of doing so is to draw adverse inferences against a party who has failed to make full and frank disclosure of assets. The drawing of an adverse inference is based on the notion that “there is concealment of matrimonial assets which should be included for a fair division under s 112 of the Women’s Charter”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [61].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Another conceptually different means of ensuring that the matrimonial pool reflects the material gains of the marriage is to add the values of certain assets into the pool on the basis that a party has expended substantial sums when divorce proceedings are imminent: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [62]. This is based on the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL</span>”) at [24] (which the Court of Appeal referred to as the “<span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Further distinct from either of these two approaches is the wrongful dissipation provision in s 132(1) WC. It is distinct from the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span> as the latter does not require “culpability” – the expenditure may be for entirely innocent reasons: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [65]. It is distinct from adverse inference for non-disclosure because the latter is concerned with disclosure, whereas wrongful dissipation is concerned with the act of dissipation itself. The Court of Appeal recognised the possibility of drawing adverse inferences based on concealment of assets or wrongful dissipation, based on conduct even prior to when divorce proceedings are imminent: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [66]. However, this would generally be difficult to justify – “it is difficult to believe that the parties would have intended to withdraw assets for the purpose of concealing or putting them out of reach of the other spouse during a time when their marital relationship was still functioning”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [66]. Since this is a matter of proof, the possibility remains open nevertheless, but the facts must justify such an approach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) These categories may overlap – one party may expend money in such a manner as to satisfy the requirements of the <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> and also amount to wrongful dissipation, while also failing to disclose the movement of these assets, thereby justifying an adverse inference. These categories are, however, also conceptually distinct: see <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [68].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) In general, therefore, the position in relation to expenditure of assets by one party can be summarised as follows (<span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court is not concerned with the justifiability of expenses stretching indefinitely into the past, but rather with what assets there were at the relevant time (usually, at the IJ date). As we explained at [22]–[24] above, in respect of accounting for how a spouse’s income has been expended, their expenses shed light on whether the earnings have in fact been used up, or have instead been concealed. Restrictions on the parties’ disposal of large quantities of matrimonial assets, meanwhile, generally only come to the fore after divorce proceedings are imminent, as explained in the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span> (see [62]–[65] above). On the other hand, if a party appears to be spending significant sums of money which the other spouse does not support (say, on gambling activities) <span class="font-italic">before</span> divorce proceedings are imminent, the argument is instead one of financial irresponsibility, which will impact the question of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions to the marriage in applying the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>structured approach (see [67] above). This argument would have no impact on the identification or quantification of the matrimonial assets themselves.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Husband’s dissipations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The first alleged dissipation by the Husband concerns the proceeds of sale of a property in Vietnam (“the Vietnam Property”) which had originally been purchased in 2015.

I agree with the Wife that the burden of proof is on the Husband to show that the Vietnam Property, despite having been acquired during the couple’s marriage, is not a matrimonial asset. The Husband has not adduced contemporaneous evidence to show that the moneys involved in its acquisition were entirely from his pre-marriage income. At best, the Husband has only referred to the affidavit of his brother-in-law, who has said that he was told by the Husband in 2018 that the Vietnam Property had been purchased as an investment for the Husband’s mother.

</div> This statement by the brother-in-law cannot, in my view, constitute objective evidence for the Husband’s version of events. Apart from this statement, there is no evidence to support the Husband’s version of events. Further, as the Wife has pointed out, the proceeds of the Vietnam Property were transferred to the Husband’s family at a time when divorce proceedings were imminent in June 2018. On the Husband’s own evidence, the couple had already moved out of their shared bedroom since 2016, and had agreed to “keep the family together for at least 2 years while [they] worked on the divorce paperwork” at that point.

</div> The Husband does not appear to dispute that the Wife was not informed of the transfer of the sales proceeds. Given the above, as well as the absence of any consent from the Wife to the transfer of the sale proceeds, the expenditure of a substantial sum by way of gift must be returned to the MA pool even if it was for the benefit of children or other relatives (<span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [62]).

First, the Wife’s claim that she was a self-perceived sole breadwinner, even if taken at face value, does not in itself show either that she was in fact the sole breadwinner, or that the money she earned in fact went towards household expenses. Second, her claim to having been the sole breadwinner is undercut by her assertion that the Husband pressured her to leave her job. If the Husband was genuinely not making financial contributions to the household and the Wife was the one paying for household expenses, it seems to me illogical and anomalous that the Husband would have exerted pressure on her to stop working. Third, and significantly, apart from the payments for C2’s school fees, the Wife has not adduced evidence of any payments made by her for any household expenses. Fourth, as the Husband points out, the Wife has in her own affidavits affirmed that prior to 2020, the Husband would normally be the one paying for food or household expenses.

</div> I stress that the point here is not that the Wife’s contribution should therefore be disregarded, but that it would be unfair for the Wife to cite the availability of domestic help as a reason to deprecate the Husband’s contributions when the Wife relied on the same support herself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I note, in addition, that the Wife herself was working during most of the Children’s childhoods. By her own admission, she was absent from Singapore for one out of every five days for a two-year period between 2014 and 2015, because of work trips.

</div> While this text reflects well on the Wife’s support for the Husband at that point in their marriage, it does also substantiate the Husband’s claims as to the effort he had put in to the Children’s upbringing during the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Finally, while parties have alleged misconduct by each other, it is unnecessary to deal with these allegations in any detail. Mere misconduct is generally insufficient to warrant an adjustment of division (<span class="font-italic">VMO</span> at [159]), and the allegations in this case are neither extreme nor undisputed. The court, not being equipped to scrutinise the conduct of the parties to assign blame, would be ill-placed to deal with these allegations (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</span> [2015] 2 SLR 195 at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the circumstances, and having regard to both the indirect financial and non-financial contributions of parties, I find that the percentage contribution of the Husband and Wife in respect of indirect contributions should be 40% and 60% respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The MA pool is thus apportioned as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct Contribution (50%)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">29.68%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">70.32%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect Contribution (50%)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">60%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">40%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Overall Ratio</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">44.84%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">55.16%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Share of the Matrimonial Asset Pool of $13,239,640.90</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">$5,936,654.98</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">S$7,302,985.92</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Apportioning the joint assets between the parties in this ratio, the Wife would be holding on to S$3,928,614.20 of assets in her sole name, as well as S$983,544.99 constituting her notional stake in the joint assets. To give effect to the above division of the MA pool, I order that the Husband transfer an amount of S$1,024,495.79 to the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I also recognise that much of the Wife’s assets are in the form of shares in private companies which do not provide her with a liquid source of funds.

As Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) noted in <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1172 (“<span class="font-italic">TNC</span>”) (at [66]), an order of maintenance under s 113 of the Women’s Charter supplements the order for the division of matrimonial assets: maintenance is based on need (see also <span class="font-italic">BUX v BUY</span> [2019] SGHCF 4 at [55]). In <span class="font-italic">TNC</span> (at [68]), Ong JC decided not to award the wife any maintenance – but this was in view of the fact that the wife had been awarded the “massive” sum of $10.7 million in the division of matrimonial assets. On appeal, the Court of Appeal left Ong JC’s orders on maintenance undisturbed (see <span class="font-italic">TND v TNC and another appeal</span> [2017] SGCA 34 at [104]). In practice, courts have routinely varied the maintenance sum ordered to account for the matrimonial assets divided between parties (see for example <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520</span>; <span class="font-italic">Oh</span><span class="font-italic"> Choon v Lee Siew Lin</span> [2014] 1 SLR 629 at [21]<span class="font-italic">; Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</span> [2012] 2 SLR 506 at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Considering the share of matrimonial assets awarded to the Wife, her current employment and level of income, and having regard to the factors enumerated in s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter, I find that no order as to maintenance for the Wife is necessary.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the Children</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The duty to maintain children is shared by both parents. They have a shared responsibility to provide for their children, although “their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities” (<span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1137 at [61]). In <span class="font-italic">WOS v WOT </span>[2023] SGHCF 36 (“<span class="font-italic">WOS</span>”), Choo Han Teck J found that despite the wife being a homemaker with no income, after receiving a share of over $8 million in matrimonial assets she would have no financial issues bearing a fair share of the child’s expenses, and it would therefore be fair for both parties to share this burden equally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Having regard to the means of both parties and the amount the Wife is set to receive as part of division of the MA pool, it would be fair for both parties to share equally in the Children’s expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In assessing the reasonableness of the Children’s expenses submitted by both parties, <span class="font-italic">WOS </span>at [50] sets out the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50     In my view, a child’s reasonable needs are not determined solely by the financial capabilities of its parents. The focus of the enquiry should be on whether the expense itself is needed for each child. Although wealthy parents may indulge their children beyond what they reasonably need, they can expend the largesse at their pleasure. The court is only concerned with what a child in the circumstances reasonably needs. In this connection, the full expenses of a tertiary education at an overseas institution are not reasonable expenses that parents should be mandated to pay for — simply on the basis that they can afford it. Instead, they are luxury expenses that parents can choose to indulge their children in. A much more reasonable expense is the costs related to tertiary education at a local university or a portion thereof. Furthermore, there is no reason why children who wish to pursue an overseas education cannot take on some responsibility for their decision, for instance by either off-setting some of their unnecessary expenses, obtaining scholarships, grants, and student loans, or contributing to their own expenses by working part-time. Children should not simply expect their parents to provide for every desire.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Parties’ declared monthly incomes are $2,640 and $6,000 for the Husband and Wife respectively.

Although C2’s school fees are currently being paid for by the Wife, this is balanced by the Husband paying for C1’s school fees. There are only three areas of difference. First, while C1 goes for drum classes, C2 goes for piano classes. The Wife’s position on C2’s piano classes is that the expenses are $300, while the Husband’s position is that he ought not to have to pay for the classes as he was not consulted on them and the expenses have been incurred without his agreement.

</div> In the circumstances, I find that it will be reasonable for a similar arrangement to apply for C2 as for C1.

</div> This is unsupported by evidence in the Wife’s affidavit.

The Husband also claims that he has already paid for half of the expense of C2’s braces, although no evidence has been produced for this claim either.
