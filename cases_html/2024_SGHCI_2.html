</div> With reference to the Suit 3 Judgment, the Court of Appeal stated: “We agree with the comprehensive judgment of the court below. In our view, we see no reason to disturb any of the findings made therein, or the orders made.” (see <span class="font-italic">Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others</span> [2022] 3 SLR 103 (the “ASI Judgment”) at [24])</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The ASI Judgment and ASI Appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 After Baker sued the Defendants in Singapore in November 2017, on 8 August 2019, BCS sued Baker and BCS Pharma corporation (“BCS Pharma”) – one of Chantal’s US companies – in California (the “Californian Proceedings”). In the Californian Proceedings, BCS alleged, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that Baker and BCS Pharma had interfered with the contractual relationship between BCS and Nu Skin (the “Initial Complaint”). By agreement, BCS, Baker, and BCS Pharma thereafter agreed to a stay of the Californian Proceedings pending the outcome of the Defendants’ appeal against the Suit 3 Judgment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CA 76, and the Californian Proceedings were stayed on 30 June 2020. As mentioned, CA 76 was dismissed on 19 January 2021. On 26 March 2021, the stay on the Californian Proceedings was lifted. On 16 June 2021, Baker applied by SIC/SUM 37/2021 (“SUM 37”) for an ASI to restrain the prosecution of the Californian Proceedings. On 19 November 2021, the SICC granted the ASI against the Defendants by way of the ASI Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 BCS filed various versions of its Complaint which set out its claim in the Californian Proceedings (the full details of which may be found in the ASI Judgment at [29]–[42] and <span class="font-italic">BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others v Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased)</span> [2023] 1 SLR 1 (the “ASI Appeal”) at [27]–[28]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) on 8 August 2019, BCS filed its Initial Complaint;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) on 27 April 2021, BCS filed a “First Amended Complaint”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) on 27 August 2021, BCS filed a “Second Amended Complaint”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) on 7 April 2022 (after the ASI was issued on 19 November 2021), BCS filed a “Third Amended Complaint”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the ASI Judgment, the SICC found as follows (at [91]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… many of the claims pursued by BCS in the Californian Proceedings amount to an attempt at relitigating matters already decided by this court, and thus vexatious and oppressive and amount to an abuse of process. We also find that BCS’s claims are vexatious and oppressive towards the Estate. Moreover, these claims relitigating the same issues that have been decided by this court amount to a collateral attack of this court’s Judgment … This justifies the issuance of an ASI against BCS, to restrain BCS from relitigating the subject-matter of the Suit against the Estate <span class="font-italic">and</span> the US Defendants through the Californian Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The SICC thus issued the ASI, in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) [BCS] is hereby <span class="font-italic">restrained, whether acting by itself, its officers, its servants or agents or otherwise, from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute proceedings</span> under Case No. 2:19-cv-06914-JWH-JPR [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Californian Proceedings], commenced by [BCS] in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in the United States of America on 8 August 2019, against [Baker], both in his individual and personal capacity and as well as his capacity as the Executor of the Estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased, and against [BCS Pharma], Heika Burnison (“Heika”), Birka Burnison (“Birka”), Grey Pacific Labs, LLC (“Grey Pacific Labs”) and Grey Pacific Science, Inc (“Grey Pacific Science”), insofar as such proceedings relate to the existence, validity and/or enforceability of the Trust in the Ethocyn Rights and assets held on behalf of [Chantal] and now, her estate (“Estate”), and <span class="font-italic">any issues relating to the reliance on and/or assertion of the said Trust or any issues litigated before the Singapore Courts in SIC/S 3/2018, the Judgment dated 29 April 2020 and CA/CA 76/2020</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) [BCS] shall not be restrained in Case No. 2:19-cv-06914-JWH-JPR, commenced by [BCS] in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in the United States of America on 8 August 2019, from pursuing claims against [Baker], BCS Pharma, Heika, Birka, Grey Pacific Labs and Grey Pacific Science for claims against [Baker] for allegedly holding himself out as an officer of [BCS] or for signing of the assignment agreement transferring the trademark rights, and the settlement agreement with Nu Skin, and for claims against Heika, as an officer of Grey Pacific Labs, for allegedly willingly entering into the assignment agreement for the trademark rights knowing that [Baker] is not an officer of [BCS], or for claims related thereto, provided always that they do not relate to the existence, validity and/or enforceability of the Trust in the Ethocyn Rights and assets held on behalf of [Chantal] and now, her Estate, and any issues relating to the reliance on and/or assertion of the said Trust or any issues litigated before the Singapore Courts in SIC/S 3/2018, the Judgment dated 29 April 2020 and CA/CA 76/2020. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) [BCS] and [Renslade (HK)] are hereby <span class="font-italic">restrained, whether acting by themselves, their officers, their servants or agents or otherwise</span>, and [Weber] is hereby <span class="font-italic">restrained, whether acting by himself, his servants or agents or as a director, officer or servant or agent or shareholder of </span>[<span class="font-italic">BCS</span>]<span class="font-italic"> and </span>[<span class="font-italic">Renslade (HK)</span>]<span class="font-italic"> or otherwise</span>, <span class="font-italic">from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute proceedings</span> in the United States of America or anywhere else in the world against [Baker], whether in his personal capacity and/or his capacity as the Executor of the Estate, Heika and/or Birka, insofar as any such proceedings relate to the existence, validity and/or enforceability of the Trust in the Ethocyn Rights and assets held on behalf of [Chantal] and now, her Estate, and <span class="font-italic">any issues relating to the reliance on and/or assertion of the said Trust or any issues litigated before the Singapore Courts in SIC/S 3/2018, the Judgment dated 29 April 2020 and CA/CA 76/2020</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) Costs are awarded to [Baker] to be borne by the Defendants, jointly and severally…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) There shall be liberty to apply, and generally.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 We refer to the claims that BCS, Weber, and Renslade (HK) were injuncted by the ASI from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute in the Californian Proceedings, as the “Injuncted Claims”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 By CA/CA 70/2021 (“CA 70”), the Defendants appealed against the ASI Judgment. The appeal was dismissed on 21 September 2022. In its judgment, the Court of Appeal stated (ASI Appeal at [28]) that the claims made under the Second and Third Amended Complaints could essentially be grouped into four categories:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the “Intercepted Payment Claims”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the “Trademark Claims”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the claim in judicial estoppel; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the “Wrongful Settlement Claims”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Court of Appeal found (ASI Appeal at [61] and [63]) that “the claim in judicial estoppel was in substance raised and decided in Suit 3” and that “the claim in judicial estoppel pursued by BCS in the Californian Proceedings amounts to an undermining of the key findings in the Suit 3 Judgment as regards the existence and enforceability of the Trust.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Court of Appeal stated (ASI Appeal at [87]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We agree with the assessment of the SICC that BCS’s pursuit of the Intercepted Payment Claims as well as part of the Trademark Claims also amounts to a relitigation of the issues as regards the existence and enforceability of the Trust which were determined in Suit 3. It follows that this would also undermine the Suit 3 Judgment on these key findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As for the Wrongful Settlement Claims, the Court of Appeal agreed with the SICC that those claims were not raised and therefore not strictly decided in Suit 3 (ASI Appeal at [42] and [89]), but commented that “it remains open to [Baker] to assert in the Californian Proceedings that the Wrongful Settlement Claims ultimately relate to the Ethocyn Rights that belong to [Baker] or the Estate” (ASI Appeal at [89]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Court of Appeal thus upheld the ASI, stating: “[i]n the light of our decision, the [Defendants] are to take steps to withdraw from the Californian Proceedings the claims which are within the ambit of the ASI [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Injuncted Claims].” (ASI Appeal at [94])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 BCS, however, did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether BCS and Weber had committed contempt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 BCS and Weber did not file any reply affidavits to oppose the contempt application against them, other than an affidavit from a US lawyer representing BCS in the Californian Proceedings seeking to explain why certain statements made by him (BCS’s US lawyer) during the Californian Proceedings did not amount to admissions of breach of the ASI. Nor did BCS and Weber put forward written or oral submissions to dispute that they had <span class="font-italic">committed </span>contempt. Their submissions are only on the potential <span class="font-italic">punishment</span> for contempt: they contend that a fine would be appropriate for both BCS and Weber, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Weber should not be punished with imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 BCS and Weber clearly knew of the ASI: they appealed against it. It is also clear that the ASI had been breached in that the Injuncted Claims had not been withdrawn from the Californian Proceedings, but were continuing to be prosecuted there. As the Court of Appeal noted in the ASI Appeal, the ASI was breached in that three Injuncted Claims that were in the Second Amended Complaint of 27 August 2021 (prior to the ASI of 19 November 2021) were retained in the Third Amended Complaint of 7 April 2022 (after the ASI), namely: the “Intercepted Payment Claims”, the part of the “Trademark Claims” within the ASI, and the claim in judicial estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Despite the dismissal of CA 70, the Court of Appeal calling on the Defendants “to take steps to withdraw from the Californian Proceedings the claims which are within the ambit of the ASI” (ASI Appeal at [94]), and Baker’s lawyers’ demand for compliance the next day (22 September 2022), BCS and Weber continued to prosecute the Injuncted Claims in the Californian Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Instead, BCS proposed to file a Fourth Amended Complaint which would still not withdraw the Injuncted Claims from the Californian Proceedings. In BCS’s motion for leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint, filed on 25 January 2023, BCS acknowledged that it <span class="font-italic">had not complied</span> with the ASI, and that the proposed Fourth Amended Complaint <span class="font-italic">would still not comply</span> with the ASI. BCS stated in its Memorandum of Points and Authorities:

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Affidavit of Hartono Sianto dated 6 July 2023 at paras 7–8.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Weber was named in the ASI and expressly restrained “whether acting by himself, his servants or agents or as a director, officer or servant or agent or shareholder of BCS and Renslade (HK) or otherwise, from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute proceedings in the United States of America” against Baker and others, in respect of the Injuncted Claims (above at [13]). We find that Weber committed contempt of court as set out in Baker’s Statement of Committal dated 7 February 2023, in that Weber intentionally disobeyed (or breached) the ASI.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Punishment for contempt under the AJPA – BCS and Weber</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Under s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA, a person who commits contempt of court shall be liable to be punished with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Baker seeks a fine of at least $70,000 in relation to BCS, and imprisonment for a term of at least 12 months for Weber. BCS and Weber submit that a fine would be appropriate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Weber should not be punished with imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Preliminary point – relevance of matters after the Statement of Committal which sets out the alleged contempt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 We found BCS and Weber to have <span class="font-italic">committed</span> contempt as set out in the Baker’s Statement of Committal dated 7 February 2023. In determining <span class="font-italic">punishment</span>, however, Baker says it is relevant to also consider the continuing conduct of BCS and Weber after the date of the Statement of Committal, whereas BCS and Weber contend that the court should not look beyond the Statement of Committal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 There are three aspects to BCS’s and Weber’s subsequent conduct that are potentially relevant to a determination of the appropriate punishment:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, the breach of the ASI continues, in that BCS and Weber have not withdrawn the Injuncted Claims but continue to prosecute them in the Californian Proceedings;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, on 14 July 2023, BCS filed an application in the Californian court for an ASI (the “US ASI”) to enjoin Baker from prosecuting this very contempt application or otherwise enforcing the (Singapore) ASI – that US ASI application was heard on 11 August 2023 and dismissed on 5 September 2023; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, on 24 July 2023, BCS filed an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application in the Californian court for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) in the same terms as its US ASI application – that TRO application was dismissed on 26 July 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 BCS and Weber cite <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>”) at [61] for the proposition that the statement of committal filed pursuant to O 52 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “ROC 2014”), which sets out the grounds for the application for leave to apply for an order of committal, “serves a crucial role in enabling the respondent to know the case that has been put forth against him. It also functions as the boundaries of the applicant’s case, such as to prevent the applicant from relying on grounds that have been omitted from the statement.” In finding that BCS and Weber had <span class="font-italic">committed</span> contempt, we did not go beyond Baker’s Statement of Committal – it was unnecessary for us to do so. It does not, however, follow that conduct beyond the Statement of Committal is irrelevant to the question of <span class="font-italic">punishment</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the proposition stated in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span> at [61] is not an absolute one – in the same paragraph, the Court of Appeal recognised that, pursuant to O 52 r 5(3) of the ROC 2014, the court may give the applicant leave to rely on grounds other than those set out in the statement of committal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, as the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Tay Kar Oon v Tahir</span> [2017] 2 SLR 342 at [44], “[i]t follows from the principle that the court has the power to order committal on its own motion that the court must also have the power to grant an order for committal on matters not within an O 52 r 2(2) statement (or indeed, when there is no O 52 r 2(2) statement).” The court may, on its own motion, pursue an allegation of contempt not contained in an applicant’s contempt statement (O 52 r 4 of the ROC 2014).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, conduct occurring after a statement of committal is filed may constitute aggravating or mitigating circumstances relevant to the court’s decision on <span class="font-italic">punishment</span> for contempt. In <span class="font-italic">STX Corp v Jason Surjana Tanuwidjaja</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1261 at [85], the court considered a contemnor’s lack of requisite deference in respect of the court orders binding him, as “demonstrated in the nonchalant manner in which he responded to questioning during cross-examination” during the committal proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Wang Xiaopu v Goh Seng Heng and another</span> [2021] SGHC 282 at [31], the court likewise considered the contemnor’s conduct in the contempt proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 4 SLR 828 (“<span class="font-italic">Sandipala</span>”) at [83], the court looked at events occurring after the breaches of the relevant court orders, for the purposes of assessing whether the contemnors had taken steps to mitigate and/or purge their contempt, and found that they had not shown any genuine remorse or taken real and substantial steps to address the breaches. See also <span class="font-italic">Ae</span><span class="font-italic">ro-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 822 at [92] where the Court of Appeal recognised that facts not set out in the statement of committal can be considered as part of the background facts for the charges that are made out when it comes to considering the appropriate sentence for those charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 BCS’s and Weber’s subsequent conduct is therefore relevant to the question of <span class="font-italic">punishment</span> for their contempt. This conduct was squarely put in issue by Baker’s evidence and submissions, and BCS and Weber filed an affidavit from BCS’s US lawyer that addressed the US ASI application and TRO application. BCS and Weber were accorded, and took, the opportunity to address their subsequent conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Punishment for contempt under the AJPA - BCS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We consider that the circumstances in the present case justify a higher fine than the $70,000 fine imposed in <span class="font-italic">WestBridge Ventures II Investment </span><span class="font-italic">Holdings v Anupam Mittal</span> [2022] SGHC 270 (“<span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span>”). We discuss this in greater detail in the next section. We impose a fine of $80,000 against BCS.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Punishment for contempt under the AJPA - Weber</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For Weber, the key issue is whether he should be punished with imprisonment, or whether a fine would suffice. The court in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v Aurol Authony Sabastian</span> [2013] 1 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Aurol</span>”) framed the issue as follows (<span class="font-italic">Aurol</span> at [67]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The various factors taken into account for a custodial sentence are different ways of answering one question: Is a fine adequate to punish and deter contemptuous behaviour? The nature of that behaviour, the motives for it, and the ameliorative and deterrent effect of a fine are all relevant factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the same case, the court listed various (non-exhaustive) considerations (<span class="font-italic">Aurol </span>at [68]), including the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the contemptuous act. In that regard, the court will consider to what extent the contemptuous act was egregious; and in assessing the gravity of the act, the court will consider the purpose of the order breached and the impact of that breach on that purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Baker cited the English decision in <span class="font-italic">Mobile Telecommunications </span><span class="font-italic">Co KSC v HRH Prince Hussam Bin Abdulaziz Au Saud</span> [2018] EWHC 3749 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Mobile Telecommunications</span>”) where a 12-month term of imprisonment was imposed for breach of an ASI. The court recognised the importance of ASIs; they are, in many ways, just as important as freezing orders, they seek to preserve the rights of claimants who have valid dispute resolution clauses and may have valid awards of judgments, and if ASIs are broken, that is a most serious matter and in many respects just as serious as a breach of a freezing order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In similar vein is <span class="font-italic">Dell Emerging Markets (EMEA) Ltd and others v Systems Equipment Telecommunications Services SAL and others</span> [2020] EWHC 1384 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Dell</span>”) where the court stated at [16]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Contemptuous breaches of anti-suit injunctions are to be treated for sentencing purposes as analogous to breaches of freezing injunctions. In both cases a breach of the court's order is a serious attack on the administration … As the Court of Appeal emphasised in <span class="font-italic">McKendrick </span>[<span class="font-italic">Financial Conduct Authority v McKendrick</span> [2019] 4 WLR 65], the inherent seriousness of a breach of a freezing order is such that it is likely that nothing other than a prison sentence will be sufficient to punish it ... Similar considerations apply in my view to serious breaches of an anti-suit injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The gravity of a breach of a freezing order is well accepted in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Technigroup Far East </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd and another v Jaswinderpal Singh s/o Bachint Singh and others</span> [2018] 3 SLR 1391 (“<span class="font-italic">Technigroup</span>”), the court stated at [110]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Deliberate and substantial breaches of the disclosure provisions of a freezing order tend to be treated as a serious matter because any subsisting non-disclosure increases the risk that assets may be dissipated without accountability, which in turn undermines the very purpose of a freezing order and the other party’s ability to satisfy his claim. For this reason, such a breach normally attracts an immediate custodial sentence (<span class="font-italic">JSC BTA Bank v Solodchenko (No 2)</span> [2012] 1 SLR 350 at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In that case, the court imposed a term of four months’ imprisonment on the first and second defendants, suspended for four weeks to give them a final opportunity to fully comply with their discovery obligations (under the specific discovery orders in that case).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan Uray (</span><span class="font-italic">alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 60, the court imposed imprisonment terms of six months for (among other things) breaches of a freezing order in relation to disclosure of assets and accounting for expenditure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">BTS Tankers Pte Ltd v Energy &amp; Commodity</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and others </span>[2021] SGHC 58, the court imposed imprisonment terms of seven months and five months, respectively, on the two contemnors, for breach of disclosure obligations under freezing orders, but suspended those for seven days to give them an opportunity to comply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Weber, however, contends that we should not follow the English cases (like <span class="font-italic">Mobile Telecommunications</span>) in drawing an analogy between breaches of an ASI and breaches of a freezing order. Weber submits that in those English cases, imprisonment is viewed as a matter of first resort, whereas it is recognised in Singapore that imprisonment for contempt is usually a matter of last resort (<span class="font-italic">Sandipala</span> at [68]; <span class="font-italic">Technigroup</span> at [104]; <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span> at [96]; <span class="font-italic">WestBridge </span>at [165]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We reviewed the English cases in the manner stated in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span> (at [105]), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not for sentencing benchmarks, but for factors taken into consideration by the court in deciding on the appropriate sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The English cases could not be distinguished in the way Weber suggested: the English cases were not decided based on imprisonment being a matter of first resort. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Mobile Telecommunications</span>, the court considered whether there was any practical alternative to imprisonment (at [33]), and in <span class="font-italic">Dell</span> the court expressed the sentences of imprisonment imposed as being “necessary” (at [18], [21], and [24]); in both decisions, the court was mindful of imposing the shortest period of imprisonment necessary (<span class="font-italic">Mobile Telecommunications</span> at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Dell</span> at [18], [21], and [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As a matter of principle, we agree with the observations in the English cases that breaches of ASIs are analogous to breaches of freezing orders. An ASI seeks to protect a claimant’s rights to have its dispute decided in the appropriate forum, and to protect the eventual judgment where that has been entered (as it has in the present case). An ASI is similar in purpose to a freezing order, both seek to protect a claimant from being deprived of the fruits of successful litigation. Moreover, the Court of Appeal held in its CA 70 judgment (ASI Appeal at [53] and [54]) that the issuance of the ASI was justified on <span class="font-italic">two</span> jurisdictional bases: first, to prevent an abuse of the forum court’s process, or the need to protect the processes, jurisdiction or judgments of the forum court; and second, to halt vexatious and oppressive conduct, in that it would also be vexatious and oppressive to Baker for BCS to seek to relitigate in the Californian Proceedings matters which were already decided between them in the Suit 3 Judgment and in CA 76. The fact that a final and unappealable judgment had already been entered, which BCS and Weber continue to seek to undermine in the Californian Proceedings, makes their contempt even more serious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Besides seeking to distinguish the English cases, Weber relies on <span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span>, where the court had considered a fine to be the appropriate punishment for the breach of an ASI in that case (at [169]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The court in <span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span>, however, noted that the appropriate punishment for contempt is fact specific: it “will depend on the facts of the <span class="font-italic">individual case</span> and the nature of the contempt” (<span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span> at [166]). The court agreed with the decision in <span class="font-italic">Aurol</span> (at [67]) that “the underlying question is whether a fine would be adequate to <span class="font-italic">punish</span> and <span class="font-italic">deter</span> contemptuous behaviour” (<span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span> at [166]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The court’s reasons for not imposing a punishment of imprisonment in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge </span>were expressed as follows (at [169]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Applying these factors [set out at [167] – [168]], in my judgment, a fine would be appropriate in this case. While I accept that the defendant’s breaches are deliberate and continuing, this feature does not automatically justify or necessitate an imprisonment term (at least in this case). Most of the other grounds for a custodial sentence are not engaged – for instance, the defendant has not previously been found to be in contempt of court, be it for breach of the interim ASI granted in ORC 1463 or otherwise. Neither has the plaintiff shown that a fine would be any less of a deterrent than a term of imprisonment, particularly for a contemnor resident abroad like the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Various differences with the facts in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span> may be noted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 First, Weber is not “resident abroad” like the contemnor in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span>: in 2002 Weber obtained permission to work in Singapore, and since 2003 he has been a permanent resident of Singapore – as noted in the Suit 3 Judgment (at [2]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Weber did not put forward any evidence or even submit that he was no longer resident in Singapore, albeit holding permanent residency status here. It appears that Weber still has a place of residence here, at which service was attempted. Moreover, Weber recently (on 2 May 2023) took over from Sianto as the sole director of BCS, and s 145(1) of the Companies Act requires every company to have at least one director who is ordinarily resident in Singapore. Weber’s taking office as BCS’s sole director was a representation that he was ordinarily resident in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To a contemnor like Weber who is ordinarily resident in Singapore, a term of imprisonment can have a greater deterrent value than a fine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, the conduct in the present case was more active than that in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span>. Although the contemnor in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span> did not withdraw proceedings as required by the ASI, he did not seek to expedite their resolution either, but kept the prohibited proceedings alive by repeatedly adjourning them. Furthermore, by the time the court came to deal with the contempt, the proceedings were still pending (see <span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span> at [14] and [59]–[60]). Here, BCS and Weber:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) amended the Complaint in the Californian proceedings <span class="font-italic">after</span> the ASI had been ordered, in a manner which retained the Injuncted Claims in the earlier Complaint;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) applied for a US ASI on 14 July 2023 to enjoin Baker from prosecuting this contempt application or otherwise enforcing the (Singapore) ASI – that US ASI application was heard on 11 August 2023 and dismissed on 5 September 2023 (above at [32(b)]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) applied <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> on 24 July 2023 for a TRO in the same terms as its US ASI application, which TRO application was dismissed on 26 July 2023 (above at [32(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span> at [110], the Court of Appeal noted that the imposition of a higher sentence would be warranted “in cases where the alleged contemnor acts in contumelious disregard of the judgment or order and makes <span class="font-italic">no</span> attempt whatsoever to effect compliance, or worse still, takes <span class="font-italic">positive steps</span> to frustrate the effect of the order of court.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The applications for the US ASI and US TRO struck at the (Singapore) ASI against BCS and Weber, and the present contempt application to enforce it. Moreover, BCS and Weber sought an early decision by the Californian court on those applications in the hope of pre-empting the Singapore contempt hearing. The Californian court did indeed decide those applications before the Singapore contempt hearing, but those applications were decided <span class="font-italic">against</span> BCS and Weber.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span>, the contemnor had earlier sought an anti-enforcement injunction (“AEI”) from the foreign court in relation to an <span class="font-italic">interim</span> Singapore ASI issued against him. After the Singapore court granted a <span class="font-italic">permanent</span> ASI (which was the relevant court order for the contempt proceedings in <span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span>), he then amended the reliefs sought in the injuncted foreign proceedings (including the AEI) to refer to the permanent ASI. This was a contumacious and persistent breach that was orchestrated to undermine or ignore the effect of the Singapore ASI. However, the contemnor did not press those reliefs to a decision by the foreign court prior to being held in contempt in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span> at [11]–[19], [150]–[153], and [175]). Concomitantly, Baker and the others protected by the ASI have been prejudiced in terms of the time, trouble, and expense of responding to the <span class="font-italic">active</span> steps taken by BCS and Weber in the Californian Proceedings, besides having to face the ongoing risk of an adverse outcome in the Californian Proceedings. The ASI was issued on 19 November 2021 (above at [10]), and by the time of the hearing before us on 6 September 2023, some 20 months had elapsed, but BCS and Weber remained recalcitrant and persisted in their disobedience.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Third, the ASI in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span> protected <span class="font-italic">pending proceedings</span>, but the ASI here was issued when the Singapore proceedings in Suit 3 had already culminated in <span class="font-italic">judgment</span><span class="font-italic"> on the merits</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Suit 3 Judgment, which had moreover been upheld by the Court of Appeal in CA 76 on 19 January 2021, before the ASI was issued). In the present case, the ASI protects the unappealable substantive determination in the Suit 3 Judgment, but there was no equivalent in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Fourth<span class="font-italic">, </span>the contempt proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span> took place at a time when the ASI there was under appeal (see <span class="font-italic">WestBridge</span> at [1] and [59]), whereas here, the contemnors’ appeal against the ASI had already been dismissed in CA 70. In <span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span>, the court’s comment (at [176]) on the pending appeal against the ASI there, was that the contemnor had not evinced that he was opposed to ever complying with the ASI (for example, persisting in disobedience even following an unfavourable outcome in his appeal against the ASI). Here, the contemnors have continued to disobey the ASI despite their appeal against the ASI having failed in CA 70, and despite the Court of Appeal calling on them to comply with the ASI (ASI Appeal at [94]). That is aggravating conduct. Moreover, it is clear from what was said in the motion for leave to file BCS’s Fourth Amended Complaint (see [24]–[25] above) that the contemnors acknowledged that they <span class="font-italic">had not</span> complied with the ASI, but also said that they <span class="font-italic">would not</span> do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Fifth, Weber procured BCS to breach the ASI. Procuring others to commit the contemptuous act is an aggravating factor (see <span class="font-italic">Aurol</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [68(h)]). Not only was Weber the owner and controller of BCS, and the one instructing BCS’s US lawyers, but Weber also replaced Sianto as the sole director of BCS for the purposes of furthering the contempt. On 2 May 2023, Sianto expressed his view to Weber that the Injuncted Claims should be withdrawn from the Californian Proceedings and that BCS’s US lawyers should be instructed to do so as soon as possible. Weber responded by taking Sianto’s place as BCS’s sole director the very next day.

The Californian court has made no decision against the Suit 3 Judgment, the (Singapore) ASI, or these contempt proceedings. By way of contrast, in<span class="font-italic"> Mobile Telecommunications</span>, the foreign proceedings that were continued in breach of an ASI had resulted in an adverse foreign judgment (<span class="font-italic">Mobile Telecommunications</span> at [9]–[10]), and an imprisonment term was imposed for the contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the circumstances, we impose on Weber the maximum fine of $100,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For completeness, we considered whether the penalties against BCS and Weber should be suspended, although they did not submit that this should be done, and there was no suggestion that they would comply with the ASI if given “one last chance”.

The issue is whether such contempt is an “offence” for the purpose of s 154 of the Companies Act, as that term is used in that section. However, the Companies Act does not itself define the term “offence” as used in that section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Baker relies on the definition of an “offence” under s 2(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”): “an act or omission punishable by any written law”. As a person found liable for contempt may be punished by imprisonment and/or a fine, Baker submits that Weber has committed an “offence” for the purposes of s 154 of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The CPC does not, however, purport to define “offence” where that term is used in <span class="font-italic">other statutes</span>; the definition of “offence” in s 2(1) of the CPC is, like the other definitions, for the purposes of interpreting phrases used “[i]n this Code, unless the context otherwise requires”. Thus, the definition of “offence” in the CPC is expressly for the purposes of the CPC itself, and even so, that definition only applies “unless the context otherwise requires”. Subjecting contempt cases to the full application of the CPC would go against the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu</span> which recognised that <span class="font-italic">civil</span> procedure and processes have always been used to establish jurisdiction over any contemnor, whether the contempt complained of was civil contempt or criminal contempt (at [115]–[121]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The AJPA itself only makes limited express provision for the application of the CPC. Specifically, other than in relation to investigations under s 22 of the AJPA, the AJPA does not provide for the application of the CPC. Under ss 23 and 24 of the AJPA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Attorney-General may authorise a police officer to exercise, <span class="font-italic">for the purposes of investigations under </span><span class="font-italic">s 22</span>, powers in relation to police investigation under Part 1 of the Schedule to the CPC; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) for the purposes of any such investigation under s 22, the provisions of Part 2 of the Schedule to the CPC apply “as if the alleged contempt were an arrestable offence”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) statements made to a police officer in the course of any such investigation are admissible as evidence in accordance with ss 258 or 259 of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 22 investigations involve scandalising contempt (under s 3 of the AJPA) or the intentional causation or abetment of contempt by a non-party (under s 4(8) of the AJPA). Civil contempt by disobedience under s 4(1) of the AJPA is not a basis for the application of the CPC under ss 23 and 24 of the AJPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Moreover, applying the CPC definition of “offence” to that term as used in the Companies Act would mean that where a person is subject to the imposition of a civil penalty under s 232 of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “SFA”) (which allows for disqualification under s 154(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Companies Act), that would amount to him being convicted of an offence (which might allow for disqualification under s 154(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), or (2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>), or (<span class="font-italic">c</span>), as the case may be). However, the Companies Act itself draws a distinction between conviction of any offence under Part 12 of the SFA (governed by s 154(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Companies Act) and a person being subject to the imposition of a civil penalty under s 232 of the SFA – which is within Part 12 of the SFA (governed by s 154(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Companies Act). Furthermore, if, as Baker contends, “offence” under s 154(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) means “an act or omission punishable by any written law”, that too would cover civil penalty cases under the SFA; and it would have been unnecessary for the legislature to have amended s 154 of the Companies Act to specifically cover such civil penalty cases by way of s 154(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the context of s 154 of the Companies Act, we thus do not accept that the imposition of a civil penalty under s 232 of the SFA means there has been a conviction of an offence under the Companies Act – the Companies Act draws a distinction between the two, and indeed so does the SFA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Liang Joo John v Attorney-General</span> [2020] 5 SLR 1314 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Liang Joo</span>”) the court found that <span class="font-italic">criminal</span> contempt would fall within the concept of “offence” under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (the “Constitution”), but expressly left open the position regarding <span class="font-italic">civil</span> contempt because of its potentially different nature: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Liang Joo</span> at [11] and [29]. Under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Constitution, a person shall not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament if they have been convicted of an <span class="font-italic">offence</span> by a court in Singapore or Malaysia and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or to a fine of not less than $2,000, and has not received a free pardon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In arriving at its decision, the court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Liang Joo</span> noted the use of the word “offence” in another Article of the Constitution, Art 35(8), which states: “[t]he Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.” The court stated that the term “offence” in Art 35(8) includes <span class="font-italic">criminal</span> contempt, and noted that there was force in the argument that the same word is to bear the same meaning throughout a particular statute (<span class="font-italic">Tan Liang Joo</span> at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The present case involves <span class="font-italic">civil</span> contempt by intentional disobedience of a court order pursuant to s 4(1) of the AJPA. These proceedings have been initiated by Baker, not by the Attorney-General. Under s 30(1) of the AJPA, no proceedings for contempt of court as defined in s 3 (scandalising contempt) or s 4(8) (the intentional causation or abetment of contempt by a non-party) may be instituted except by or with the consent of the Attorney-General, but such consent is not necessary for proceedings for contempt under s 4(1) of the AJPA. This is an indication that <span class="font-italic">civil</span> contempt by disobedience of a court order under s 4(1) of the AJPA is not regarded as an “offence” for the purposes of the AJPA, and should not be so regarded for the purposes of disqualification under the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 A further indication is found in s 4(4) of the AJPA, which provides that: “[s]ubject to subsections (5), (6) and (7), any contempt of court referred to in subsection (1) or (2) may be waived by the aggrieved party and such waiver relieves from liability the person who commits the contempt”. Section 4(5) gives the court the discretion to disallow such waiver of contempt of court in prescribed circumstances. However, the fact that contempt under s 4(1) can be waived, relieving the erstwhile contemnor of liability, also suggests that s 4(1) contempt is not an “offence” for the purposes of the AJPA, and should not be so regarded for the purposes of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 There are also authorities predating the enactment of the AJPA to the effect that <span class="font-italic">civil</span> contempt is not an offence. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Beow Hiong</span>, the court stated (at [23]–[24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is fairly clear that breach of a coercive (ie, prohibitory or mandatory) court order or judgment is a civil contempt (see the speech of Lord Oliver in <span class="font-italic">Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd</span> [1992] 1 AC 191 at 217), and does not amount to a criminal offence … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the better view is that, as <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contempt</span> [Nigel Lowe and Brenda Sufrin, <span class="font-italic">Borrie &amp; Lowe: The Law of Contempt</span> (Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 1996)] states at p 662: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[C]riminal contempt is, for all its peculiarities, a crime, whereas a civil contempt despite its criminal characteristics is not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 <span class="font-italic">Tan Beow Hiong</span> was cited in <span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Tay Sien Djim and others</span> [2014] SGHC 227 (“<span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping</span>”) (at [134]), for the proposition that “[d]espite its quasi-criminal nature, a civil contempt does <span class="font-italic">not</span> amount to a criminal offence”. Thus, the court in <span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping</span> doubted whether the court had the power, in a case of civil contempt, to exercise any power under Part XVII of the CPC to impose a community sentence, such as a Mandatory Treatment Order or probation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Section 154(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act requires that the director be “convicted” of an “offence”. The term “convicted” is also found in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Constitution, and this was considered in <span class="font-italic">Tan Liang Joo</span> (at [33]), where the court said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As for the reference to a conviction in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), this could point to a narrow meaning. However, the term “convict” has always been used in relation to criminal contempt, specifically for the offence of contempt by scandalising the court: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">AG v Shadrake Alan</span> [2011] 2 SLR 445 at [137]; <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang v AG</span> [2016] 1 SLR 992 at [9].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As the present case is concerned with civil contempt, we considered that use of the word “convicted” in s 154(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) does point to a narrow meaning, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a person found to have committed <span class="font-italic">civil</span> contempt, in particular contempt by intentionally disobeying a court order, has not thereby been “convicted” of an “offence”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Ultimately, the question before us is whether a finding of civil contempt by intentional disobedience of a court order under s 4(1) of the AJPA is a “conviction” for an “offence” for the purposes of potential disqualification under s 154 of the Companies Act. For the above reasons, our conclusion is that a finding of such civil contempt is not a “conviction” for an “offence” in that context. For avoidance of doubt, we leave open the question of whether other types of contempt – in particular, <span class="font-italic">criminal</span> contempt – might be regarded differently, as this issue is not before us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Accordingly, we dismiss SUM 22, and we do not make a director disqualification order against Weber.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Sianto had committed contempt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Baker also seeks a finding of contempt and consequent sanctions against Sianto, a former director of BCS.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Sianto was a director of BCS from 5 March 2019 to 3 May 2023:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) from 5 March 2019 to 30 September 2019, Sianto was a director together with Weber;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) from 30 September 2019 to 21 September 2022, Sianto was a director together with one Chuah Lay San (“Chuah”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) from 21 September 2022 to 3 May 2023, Sianto was the sole director; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) from 3 May 2023 (after Sianto ceased to be a director) Weber has been the sole director of BCS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 When the ASI was issued on 19 November 2021, the directors of BCS were Sianto and Chuah. However, it is undisputed that Weber solely owned and controlled BCS, and it was Weber who instructed BCS’ US lawyers in relation to the Californian Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 On 28 September 2022, Baker’s lawyers wrote to Sianto enclosing a copy of the ASI together with a penal notice informing him that if BCS neglected to obey the ASI, Sianto as a director of BCS would be liable for contempt for the purpose of compelling BCS to obey the ASI. The letter informed Sianto that BCS had not withdrawn the Injuncted Claims from the Californian Proceedings and demanded that Sianto procure BCS’s full compliance with the ASI by noon on 5 October 2022, failing which contempt proceedings might be commenced against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Sianto says that he forwarded Baker’s lawyers’ letter and enclosures to Weber and BCS’s US lawyers and requested that they look into Baker’s demand. Sianto says that his expectation was that they would consider if there was basis for the demand, and if so, that Weber would have BCS take steps to comply with the demand. Sianto acknowledges, however, that he did not expressly state that expectation to Weber or the lawyers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 On 13 March 2023, Baker’s lawyers wrote again to Sianto, this time enclosing the SUM 9 contempt application and related documents. Sianto says that after considering the documents, he informed Weber that he was of the view that BCS should withdraw the claims in the Californian Proceedings that were prohibited by the ASI (above at [61]). Sianto says that he asked Weber for Weber’s urgent confirmation that Weber would be instructing BCS’s US lawyers to carry out the withdrawal of the Injuncted Claims as soon as possible. Sianto says that he told Weber that he would otherwise not be in a position to continue being a director of BCS and that he would resign. Weber asked Sianto to resign as a director and so Sianto did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Sianto exhibited in his affidavit his email of 2 May 2023 to Weber, in which Sianto said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am of the view that BCS should withdraw the claims in the Californian action that are prohibited under the ASI soonest possible.

Otherwise, I would not be in the position to continue my position as director of BCS and will have no choice but to resign as director of BCS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Weber promptly replied to Sianto the same day to say, “[a]s you know Baker is a [criminal] and has created [with] his lie a big damage to me and BCS. I can not accept that. In any case I understand you and please resign as Director from BCS And replace it [with] me. Sorry if this [legal] case create you any problem.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On 3 May 2023, Sianto resigned as a director of BCS with immediate effect, and he was replaced with Weber as BCS’s sole director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Baker seeks a finding of contempt against Sianto under s 6(2) of the AJPA, on the basis that Sianto was an officer of BCS (a corporation which had committed contempt) who “knew or ought reasonably to have known” that BCS’s contempt was being committed, and had, at the very least, “failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of that contempt of court” as stipulated in s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(iii) of the AJPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Sianto contends that he <span class="font-italic">had</span> taken all reasonable steps to prevent or stop BCS’ commission of contempt, but that Weber had nevertheless persisted in maintaining the Injuncted Claims in the Californian Proceedings, a matter which was outside his control.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Sianto says he first became aware of Suit 3 sometime in May 2018, and of CA 70 (BCS’s appeal against the ASI Judgment), sometime around December 2021. He says he cannot recall when he first learnt of the Californian Proceedings, but he knew that Weber wanted to pursue legal action against Baker in America. Sianto also says he was aware that BCS had failed in Suit 3, SUM 37 (which resulted in the ASI), CA 76 (against the Suit 3 Judgment), and CA 70 (against the ASI Judgment), and that Weber wanted to continue with the Californian Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 From what Sianto says, we are satisfied that he was aware of the ASI – at least by December 2021 when he became aware of CA 70 which was BCS’s appeal against the ASI Judgment. It does not, however, follow that Sianto was aware that BCS <span class="font-italic">had not complied</span> with the ASI, prior to him receiving Baker’s lawyer’s letter of 28 September 2022 informing him of this, together with a copy of the order and a penal notice. Although Sianto says he knew Weber wanted to continue with the Californian Proceedings, the ASI did not require BCS to withdraw the Californian Proceedings, but only the Injuncted Claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Bearing in mind that the burden is on Baker to establish contempt beyond reasonable doubt, we find it is not proven that Sianto knew, prior to the 28 September 2022 demand letter from Baker’s lawyers, that BCS had disobeyed the ASI. On a related note, under O 45 r 7(4) of the ROC 2014, it is generally a prerequisite for enforcement of an order by contempt proceedings that a copy of the order with a penal notice be served on the person to be committed – Sianto only received that on 28 September 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Prior to that date, it was not unreasonable for Sianto and Chuah – as directors of BCS – to let Weber (the owner and controller of BCS) instruct BCS’s US lawyers, and for them as directors to have expected Weber to have procured BCS’s compliance with the ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 When Sianto received the 28 September 2022 demand letter, he says he forwarded it to Weber and BCS’s US lawyers requesting that they look into the demand, expecting that – if there were basis for the demand – Weber would have BCS comply with the demand. Baker contends that we should not accept Sianto’s evidence on this, because Sianto has not produced the communication by which he forwarded the demand letter to Weber and BCS’s US lawyers. However, Baker issued no notice requiring Sianto to produce that communication (as Baker might have), nor did Baker apply for Sianto to be cross-examined on his affidavit. We accept Sianto’s evidence as to his response to the demand letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 We also accept Sianto’s evidence (in this regard substantiated by documents) as to his response to the letter of 13 March 2023 which was accompanied by the SUM 9 contempt application and other documents – that he expressed his view to Weber that BCS should withdraw the Injuncted Claims from the Californian Proceedings or Sianto would resign; and that Sianto promptly did resign and was replaced by Weber.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 We find that Baker has not established that Sianto “failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of [BCS’s] contempt of court” under s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(iii) of the AJPA. Baker submits that Sianto ought to have done more, such as directly instructing BCS’s US lawyers to withdraw the Injuncted Claims. We do not, however, believe that would have been effective: if Sianto in his capacity as BCS’s director had purported to countermand Weber’s instructions, we expect Weber in his capacity as BCS’s owner would simply have removed Sianto and taken his place as BCS’s sole director, and reiterated his instructions to BCS’s US lawyers to maintain the Injuncted Claims. In essence, that is what happened, save that Sianto resigned rather than was removed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 For completeness, on the evidence before us, we do not find that Sianto “consented or connived, or conspired with others, to effect the commission of the contempt of court” under s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the AJPA or that he is “in any other way, whether by act or omission, knowingly concerned in, or is party to, the commission of the contempt of court by the corporation” under s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In the circumstances, we find that Baker has not established any of the grounds under s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the AJPA for holding Sianto in contempt as a director of BCS, in relation to BCS’s contempt. The contempt application against Sianto is thus not made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 For the above reasons, our decision is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) BCS is in contempt of court and we impose a fine of $80,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Weber is in contempt of court and we impose a fine of $100,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) SUM 22 is dismissed as our finding of civil contempt against Weber under s 4(1) of the AJPA is not a conviction of an offence for the purposes of s 154 of the Companies Act, such that a director disqualification order could be made against Weber; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) we do not find Sianto to be in contempt of court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Unless the parties can agree on costs, they shall file and serve written submissions on the appropriate costs orders to be made (both as to incidence and quantum), limited to ten pages (excluding any schedule of disbursements), within 21 days.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Dominique T Hascher<br/>International Judge</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Christopher Scott Sontchi <br/>International Judge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Woo Shu Yan, Tay Hong Zhi Gerald, Mok Hin Kyong Jonathan (Mo Xianqiang), and Foo Hsien Li (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chua Han Yuan Kenneth (Cai Hanyuan) and Ang Kai Le (TSMP Law Corporation) for the first and second defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kam Su Cheun Aurill (Legal Clinic LLC) and Seow Wai Peng Amy (Adroit Law LLC) for the non-party.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
