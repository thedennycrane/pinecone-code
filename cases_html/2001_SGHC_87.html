<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1.    This was an appeal against the decision of the Registrar

dismissing the application of the Defendant, Sky Technology Pte Ltd (Sky Technology) for an

extension of time (EOT) to file affidavits of evidence-in-chief (AEICs). The Registrar

also struck out the defence and dismissed the counterclaim of Sky Technology with costs.</p>
<p align="justify">2.    After hearing arguments, I allowed the appeal but I ordered

Sky Technology to pay costs of the appeal and of two applications below on a standard basis which I

fixed at $14,000.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    The Plaintiff S3 Building Services Pte Ltd (S3) has

appealed against my decision.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">BACKGROUND</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">4.    In this action, S3 seeks to rescind an agreement it had with

Sky Technology pursuant to which Sky Technology had assigned the patent rights of its invention to

S3. S3 is alleging that Sky Technology had intentionally suppressed material information relating to

the patent rights. I was not informed as to what Sky Technologys counterclaim was about.</p>
<p align="justify">5.    On 25 November 2000, the Writ of Summons was filed.</p>
<p align="justify">6.    On 5 December 2000, S3 served an application for summary

judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">7.    On 15 January 2001, Sky Technology was granted unconditional

leave to defend by SAR James Leong.</p>
<p align="justify">8.    On 30 January 2001, S3 served its Notice of Appeal to a

judge in chambers. On 31 January 2001, Sky Technology served its Defence and Counterclaim.</p>
<p align="justify">9.    On 13 February 2001, Lai Siu Chiu J dismissed the appeal of

S3. On 14 February 2001, S3 served its Reply &amp; Defence to Counterclaim.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    On 27 February 2001, S3 wrote in for further arguments

before Lai J.</p>
<p align="justify">11.    On 28 February 2001, the parties Counsel appeared before

the Registrar for further directions. By that time, the list of documents had been filed by Sky

Technology, and presumably by S3 too, in compliance with earlier directions. Furthermore, Sky

Technology had served an Amended Defence &amp; Counterclaim and S3 had filed and served an Amended

Statement of Claim.</p>
<p align="justify">12.    At the hearing before the Registrar on 28 February 2001,

various directions were given. The pertinent ones were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The AEICs were to be exchanged by 30 March 2001 and objections thereto were

  to be taken by 6 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Leave was granted to Sky Technology to adduce the evidence of the following

  witness orally at the trial of this action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) A representative from Allen &amp; Gledhill,</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) A representative from Chu Chan Gan &amp; Ooi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) Trial be fixed for five days from 27 April 2001 to 4 May 2001 and to be set

  down by 9 April 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">13.    Mr Lok said that as at 28 February 2001, he was not aware

of S3s request for further arguments. After he was aware, Sky Technology submitted further

written arguments to Lai J on 3 March 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">14.    On 5 March 2001, the parties Counsel attended before Lai

J for further arguments. The judge then ordered that Sky Technology be granted conditional leave to

defend instead. The condition was that Sky Technology was to provide $600,000 security for S3s

claim by 26 March 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">15.    On 9 March 2001, Sky Technology wrote to request further

arguments before Lai J. The judge declined to hear further arguments and the parties solicitors

were informed of this in writing also on the same day.</p>
<p align="justify">16.    On 16 March 2001, Sky Technology filed an appeal to the

Court of Appeal, as well as an application for an expedited appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">17.    The parties Counsel attended before Chao Hick Tin JA for

this application to be heard at 3 pm of the same day.</p>
<p align="justify">18.    The application was granted and directions were given. The

appeal was subsequently heard on 22 March 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">19.    The appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful. Sky

Technology then orally sought and was granted an extension of time of two weeks by the Court of

Appeal to provide the security of $600,000, ie two weeks from the original dead-line of 26 March

2001 under Lai Js decision. The new dead-line for provision of security was therefore 9 April

2001.</p>
<p align="justify">20.    Thereafter Sky Technology and its solicitors attempted to

prepare and finalise the AEICs by 30 March 2001 but they were unable to do so.</p>
<p align="justify">21.    On 30 March 2001, S3s solicitors Manjit &amp; Partners

sent a fax to Sky Technologys solicitors Rodyk &amp; Davidson to arrange a time for the exchange

of the AEICs.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    <font face="Times New Roman">In response, Mr Lok Vi Ming of

Rodyk &amp; Davidson called Mr Govind Menon of Manjit &amp; Partners to say that Rodyk &amp;

Davidson would need an extension of about two weeks to exchange the AEICs. The reason given was that

Ms Winnie Tham of Allen &amp; Gledhill was overseas. This implicitly meant that Rodyk &amp; Davidson

were trying to contact her to get her evidence but were unable to do so by 30 March 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    This request drew a riposte from Manjit &amp; Partners who

quickly sent a telefax to Rodyk &amp; Davidson to state, inter alia, that:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns=""></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> Our clients find this last minute adjustment totally astonishing and

  unsatisfactory. No proper regard has been given to the learned Registrars Order or the proper

  administration of the Courts, not to say anything about the prejudice you are occasioning to our

  clients by our inability to prepare for trial without your affidavits.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="3" xmlns=""></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    Rodyk &amp; Davidson replied the same day stating, inter

alia:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">As explained, Ms Winnie Tham from Messrs Allen &amp; Gledhill is one of the

  witnesses whom our clients had indicated they wish to call. She is currently overseas at a

  Conference and will only be back after 4 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">We will be grateful for your kind indulgence in this matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    Thereafter, Rodyk &amp; Davidson filed a Notice for Further

Directions also on 30 March 2001 for an EOT to file the AEICs by 14 April 2001 and consequential

orders.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.    There was one supporting affidavit (the 2<sup>nd</sup>

affidavit) from Lim Yeow Beng, the Intellectual Property and Contracts Director of Sky Technology.

It said, inter alia:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns=""></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">2. This action involves an agreement ("the Agreement") pursuant to

  which the Defendant assigned the patent rights of their invention to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff

  seeks to rescind the Agreement on the basis inter alia that the Defendant had intentionally

  suppressed material information relating to the patent rights.</p>
<p align="justify">3. At a hearing before the learned Registrar on 28 February 2001, the following

  directions, inter alia, were made:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a) That the Affidavit of evidence-in-chief be filed by 30 March 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">b) That the objections to the Affidavits be made by 6 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">c) That the action be set down for trial by 9 April 2001; for trial from 27

    April 2001 to 4 May 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">4. The directions provided a short time frame for the preparation of the

  affidavits. Meanwhile, the Defendants efforts to prepare the affidavits expeditiously have been

  affected by the following circumstances:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The Plaintiff obtained leave, subsequent to the giving of the directions,

    to make further arguments before Justice Lai Siu Chiu in respect of her earlier dismissal of

    their appeal for summary judgment. The further arguments were heard on 5 March 2001 and, at the

    end of a lengthy hearing, the learned Judge gave conditional leave to defend.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the learned Judges

    order, and the appeal was heard on an expedited basis on 22 March 2001. The appeal was

    unsuccessful. Much of the Defendants attention and effort were taken up by the hearing of the

    further arguments and the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The Defendant had also previously indicated that they may call a lawyer

    from M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill to testify. In this regard, Ms Winnie Tham of M/s Allen &amp;

    Gledhill, who acted for the Defendant in the subject patent application, has been out of the

    country since 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2001 and is understood that she will only return to

    Singapore after 4 April 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font size="3" xmlns=""></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.    The application for EOT was served on 2 April 2001 at about

3.35 pm. By then, Manjit &amp; Partners had filed S3s application on 2 April 2001 at 3.19 pm to

strike out the Defence &amp; Counterclaim with a supporting affidavit from Ho Kah Meng executed on 2

April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.    Sky Technologys application was fixed for hearing on 4

April 2001. S3s application was fixed for hearing on 6 April 2001 but was subsumed in the hearing

on 4 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.    As I have mentioned, the Registrar dismissed Sky Technologys

application and ordered that its Defence be struck out and its Counterclaim be dismissed with costs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.    On the same day, Rodyk &amp; Davidson filed an appeal to

the judge in chambers. This was fixed for hearing on 10 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.    Mr Lok Vi Ming for Sky Technology informed me that, as it

turned out, the AEICs of two principal witnesses ie Gordon and Loewe Goh were completed and signed

in the evening of 4 April 2001, ie on the same day that the Registrar dismissed the application for

an extension of time. On that very day he was at an arbitration hearing, a lawyer from his firm was

presenting arguments before the Registrar and a third lawyer was attending to the witnesses. Mr Lok

said the AEICs for Sky Technology were voluminous and one was in three volumes. A statement of

intended evidence from Mr Gan Choon Beng of Chan Gan &amp; Ooi had been prepared and a similar

statement from Winnie Tham had also been prepared.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.    On 5 April 2001, another affidavit (the 3<sup>rd</sup>

affidavit) of Lim Yeow Beng was filed for the appeal to the judge-in-chambers. S3 responded by

filing the 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit of Dr Yang Jian Ling on 9 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.    In response, another affidavit, this time by Joanna Foong,

a solicitor with Rodyk &amp; Davidson, was served on Manjit &amp; Partners on 9 April 2001 at 6.55

pm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.    According to the 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit of Mr Lim and/or

the affidavit of Joanna Foong, Gordon and Loewe Goh were supposed to attend at Rodyk &amp; Davidsons

office in the week commencing 26 March 2001 to prepare the AEICs. They were however unable to attend

on 26 March 2001 due to urgent business commitments.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.    On 27 March 2001, they attended at Rodyk &amp; Davidsons

office from the morning up to 8 pm with a lunch break in-between. On 28 and 29 March 2001, Joanna

Foong and another lawyer were in the office until 1.30 am to complete the drafts. Drafts of the

AEICs were going back and forth.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.    In the meantime, Ms Foong had contacted Winnie Thams

office on 27 March 2001 and learned that she was away in Melbourne at a patent seminar and would not

be back until 4 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.    The AEICs could not be completed by 30 March 2001 although,

by then, substantive draft AEICs had been prepared.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">THE LAW</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.    Mr Manjit Singh for S3 repeatedly emphasized that the

paramount consideration is the efficient administration of justice. According to him, a litigant who

seeks any EOT is affecting the efficient administration of justice which would cause public

prejudice. Such a litigant must show extenuating circumstances or that his is a special exception to

justify an EOT.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.    Mr Singh also repeatedly submitted that there was no

material before the Registrar to grant an EOT. He said that even the new affidavits filed for Sky

Technology, after the Registrars decision and without leave of court, were not sufficient to

persuade the court to allow the appeal for an EOT.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.    On the other hand, Mr Lok cited <i>The Tokai Maru </i><nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 105</nobr>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.    In that case, an order was made for AEICs to be exchanged

by 11 October 1996.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.    The applicants filed their AEICs only on 1 July 1997, about

nine months after the dead-line, and served a copy on the respondents solicitors who refused to

serve their clients affidavits in exchange. The applicants applied for an EOT and the respondents

applied to strike out their defence. Both applications were heard on 15 July 1997 by a judge who

disallowed the application for an EOT and ordered the defence struck out and the applicants to pay

the respondents whatever sum might be found due to them on their claim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.    The applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal on both the

decisions and both appeals were allowed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.    The judge in <i>The Tokai Maru</i> case had adopted the

principle from the judgment of Lord Guest in <i>Ratnam v Cumarasamy</i> [1965] 1 WLR 8 at p 12 that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed, and in order to justify a

  court extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken there must be

  some material upon which the court can exercise discretion. If the law were otherwise, a party in

  breach would have an unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of

  the rules, which is to provide a time table for the conduct of litigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45.    However Tan Lee Meng J, delivering the judgment of the

Court of Appeal in <i>The Tokai Maru, </i>pointed out that in <i>Ratnam v Cumarasamy</i>, Lord Guest

had made a point which distinguished an application for an EOT to file a notice of appeal and other

applications for EOT. Lord Guest said, at p 12:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In the one case, the litigant has had no trial at all; in the other he has

  had a trial and lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46.    <font face="Times New Roman">The judgment of Tan Lee Meng J

then went on to cite with approval the judgment of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <i>Costellow v Somerset

County Council</i> [1993] 1 All ER 952 at 959:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">As so often happens, this problem arises at the intersection of two

  principles, each in itself salutary. The first principle is that the rules of court and the

  associated rules of practice, devised in the public interest to promote the expeditious dispatch

  of litigation, must be observed. The prescribed time limits are not targets to be aimed at or

  expressions of pious hope but requirements to be met. This principle is reflected in a series of

  rules giving the court a discretion to dismiss on failure to comply with a time limit: O 19 r 1, O

  24 r 16(1), O 25 r 1(4) and (5), O 28 r 10(1) and O 34 r 2(2) are examples. This principle is also

  reflected in the courts inherent jurisdiction to dismiss for want of prosecution.</p>
<p align="justify">The second principle is that a plaintiff should not in the ordinary way be

  denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits because of procedural default, unless the

  default causes prejudice to his opponent for which an award of costs cannot compensate. This

  principle is reflected in the general discretion to extend time conferred by O 3 r 5, a discretion

  to be exercised in accordance with the requirements of justice in the particular case. It is a

  principle also reflected in the liberal approach generally adopted in relation to the amendment of

  pleadings.</p>
<p align="justify">Neither of these principles is absolute. If the first principle were rigidly

  enforced, procedural default would lead to dismissal of actions without any consideration of

  whether the plaintiffs default had caused prejudice to the defendant. But the courts

  practice has been to treat the existence of such prejudice as a crucial, and often a decisive,

  matter. If the second principle were followed without exception, a well-to-do plaintiff willing

  and able to meet orders for costs made against him could flout the rules with impunity, confident

  that he would suffer no penalty unless or until the defendant could demonstrate prejudice. This

  would circumscribe the very general discretion conferred by O 3 r 5, and would indeed involve a

  substantial rewriting of the rule.</p>
<p align="justify">The resolution of problems such as the present cannot in my view be governed by

  a single universally applicable rule of thumb. A rigid, mechanistic approach is inappropriate .</p>
<p align="justify">Cases involving procedural abuse (such as <i>Hytrac Conveyors Ltd v Conveyors

  International Ltd</i> [1982] 3 All ER 415, [1983] 1 WLR 44) or questionable tactics (such as <i>Revici

  v Prentice Hall Inc</i> [1969] 1 All ER 772, [1969] 1 WLR 157) may call for special treatment. So,

  of course, will cases of contumelious and intentional default and cases where a default is

  repeated or persisted in after a peremptory order. But in the ordinary way, and in the absence of

  special circumstances, a court will not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to dismiss a plaintiffs

  action for want of prosecution unless the delay complained of after the issue of proceedings has

  caused at least a real risk of prejudice to the defendant. A similar approach should govern

  applications made under O 19, O 24, O 25, O 28 and O 34. The approach to applications under O 3 r

  5 should not in most cases be very different. Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances,

  it can rarely be appropriate, on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny the

  plaintiff an extension (where the denial will stifle his action) because of a procedural default

  which, even if unjustifiable, has caused the Defendant no prejudice for which he cannot be

  compensated by an award of costs. In short, an application under O 3 r 5 should ordinarily be

  granted where the overall justice of the case requires that the action be allowed to proceed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47.    Tan Lee Meng J then stated the following principles:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) <font size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify">(b) The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and litigants towards the

  just resolution of the case and should of course be adhered to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not

  be deprived of his opportunity to dispute the plaintiffs claims and have a determination of the

  issues on the merits <u>as a punishment</u> for a breach of these rules <u>unless</u> the other

  party has been made to suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated for by an appropriate order as

  to costs.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) <u>Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances</u>, it can rarely be

  appropriate then, on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny a defendant an

  extension of time where the denial would have the effect of depriving him of his defence because

  of a procedural default which, <u>even if unjustified</u>, has caused the plaintiff no prejudice

  for which he cannot be compensated by an award of costs.</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48.    The distinction between an application to appeal out of

time and other applications to extend time was reiterated in the judgment of Lai Kew Chai J for the

Court of Appeal in <i>Lim Hwee Meng v Citadel Investment Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 601</nobr> which cited <i>The

Tokai Maru</i> with approval.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49.    <font face="Times New Roman">Since then, the observations

of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in <i>Costellow</i> have been cited again with approval in the judgment of

<p align="justify" xmlns="">50.    <font face="Times New Roman">It was therefore clear to me

that the arguments of Mr Singh were departing from the principles as laid down by our Court of

Appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51.    <font face="Times New Roman">Mr Singh was bringing to the

forefront the principle about the public interest in the efficient administration of justice while

pushing back to the background the other competing principle that a litigant should not be denied an

adjudication of his position on its merits because of procedural default.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52.    <font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, Mr Singhs

repeated emphasis on the public interest was really to advance the interest of his own clients.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53.    <font face="Times New Roman">After citing the legal

principles, Tan Lee Meng J then considered the following questions:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Was the delay of nine months (in <i>The Tokai Maru</i>) justified?</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Was prejudice caused to the respondents?</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Were there exceptional circumstances to warrant dismissing the application

  for extension of time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">WAS THE DELAY BY SKY TECHNOLOGY JUSTIFIED?</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54.    Adopting a similar approach, the first question I

considered was whether the delay by Sky Technology was justified.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55.    <font face="Times New Roman">The first and only reason

given by Mr Lok in the telephone conversation of 30 March 2001 with Mr Menon and in the written

reply of Rodyk &amp; Davidson (see para 24 above) was the absence of Winnie Tham of Allen &amp;

Gledhill. This was also one of the reasons stated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit of Lim Yeow Beng

but it was not the only reason.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56.    <font face="Times New Roman">I noted that when the

directions were given by the Registrar on 28 February 2001, leave had already been granted to Sky

Technology to adduce the evidence of a representative from Allen &amp; Gledhill orally.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57.    <font face="Times New Roman">Mr Lok said that, even so, the

Registrar had directed that a statement of the intended evidence should be filed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58.    <font face="Times New Roman">The draft Order of Court of 28

February 2001 which has been approved by both solicitors does not reflect this requirement, although

it is a common requirement when leave is granted to adduce the evidence of a witness orally.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59.    Besides, even if Mr Lok were correct, the AEICs of the two

principal witnesses of Sky Technology, and the statement of intended evidence from Gan Choon Beng

could and should still have been completed on time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60.    Had this been done, leaving only the statement of intended

evidence from Winnie Tham to be done, Mr Singh might not have objected to an EOT for that statement

to be furnished later. Even if Mr Singh were to object, Sky Technology would have had a much better

chance of persuading the Registrar to grant an EOT for this sole outstanding item, although I saw no

reason why the statement of intended evidence from Winnie Tham should await her return. The very

reason why Sky Technology had to obtain leave to adduce her evidence orally was, presumably, because

she might not co-operate. That should not stop Sky Technologys solicitors from filing a statement

of the intended evidence that they were seeking from her. The statement would only identify the

areas of fact on which her evidence was sought.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61.    <font face="Times New Roman">The truth of the matter was

that Rodyk &amp; Davidson and Sky Technology had used the absence of Winnie Tham to seek an EOT when

the real reason was something else. To this extent, their conduct was unsatisfactory.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62.    <font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, theirs is not

the only instance of such conduct.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63.    <font face="Times New Roman">Solicitors who have misjudged

the amount of time required to carry out a task and/or who have been too busily engaged in other

matters or who have overlooked a matter should have the courage to admit this in an application for

EOT. I appreciate that some may fear that this will encourage their own clients to take action

against them should the application for EOT fail, but, all things considered, I am of the view that

it is preferable that they be candid with their opponents, the court and their clients.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64.    <font face="Times New Roman">The true reason for the delay

was that Rodyk &amp; Davidsons time and attention had been taken up and distracted by the

hearings before Lai J and the Court of Appeal in respect of the application for summary judgment and

conditional leave. They had misjudged the time required to prepare the AEICs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65.    <font face="Times New Roman">Although I had some sympathy

for the situation they found themselves to be in, the true reason was still not satisfactory. After

all, S3s AEICs were ready by 30 March 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66.    <font face="Times New Roman">Hence, the delay was

unjustified.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">WAS UNDUE PREJUDICE CAUSED TO S3?</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67.    The prejudice must be other than having to meet the case of

Sky Technology if an EOT is granted. Otherwise, every application for an EOT will be doomed from the

start.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68.    I make this point because I am aware of submissions by

counsel in other cases that an EOT should be denied simply because, if it were to be granted, their

clients would have to meet a case which they would not otherwise have to meet if the extension were

not granted.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69.    <font face="Times New Roman">I prefer to use the label undue

prejudice to emphasize the point that an EOT will often prejudice the other side to some extent,

but that, per se, is not sufficient to deny an EOT. It depends on the nature of the prejudice and

this is encapsulated in the principle that the prejudice must be one that cannot be compensated by

an appropriate order as to costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70.    <font face="Times New Roman">Mr Singh took exception to Mr

Loks argument based on such a principle. He argued that to sanction such a principle would mean

that the efficient administration of justice can be bought off or overreached by an award of costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71.    <font face="Times New Roman">I was of the view that Mr

Singhs argument was an exaggerated one. The principle relied on by Mr Lok has been endorsed by

the courts in England and Singapore. Furthermore, no one has suggested that costs can be a cure-all.

Indeed, the <i>Costellow</i> and <i>The Tokai Maru</i> have cautioned that in special or exceptional

circumstances, the payment of costs will not be sufficient to obtain an EOT.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72.    <font face="Times New Roman">As for prejudice, Mr Singh

argued that there was prejudice to S3 because although Sky Technology was not asking for the trial

dates to be vacated, S3 would be compelled to do so in view of Mr Singhs other commitments.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73.    <font face="Times New Roman">Mr Singh said that on 11 April

2001, he had another hearing. On 17 April 2001, he was due to see a Queens Counsel in London on

an unrelated matter. He would be back in Singapore by 23 April 2001. That would leave him with 23

April 2001 to 26 April 2001 (four days) before the trial starting on 27 April 2001. He pointed out

repeatedly that his was a small firm.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74.    <font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, when Mr

Singh was submitting that there was no valid reason for Sky Technology to fail to comply with the

original dead-line for the exchange of AEICs, he had submitted that the case was simple. He also

submitted that in the light of the proceedings for summary judgment, Sky Technology already knew

what was the substance of the case before the court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75.    <font face="Times New Roman">These very arguments of Mr

Singh militated against his argument that he would not have sufficient time to prepare for trial if

an EOT were granted to allow Sky Technology to exchange AEICs by 14 April 2001. Furthermore, as

their AEICs, and statements of intended evidence, were ready by the time of the hearing before me,

they could be exchanged with the AEICs of S3 immediately or the next day ie 11 April 2001. Mr Singh

should have some time before he was to fly to meet Queens Counsel on 17 April 2001 and some time

after his return by 23 April 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76.    <font face="Times New Roman">It was clear to me that Mr

Singh was blowing hot and cold.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77.    <font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, although Mr Singhs

firm is a small one, he is assisted by Mr Menon who appeared to have been involved with the case for

some time already if not right from the beginning.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78.    Mr Menon could continue to take the witnesses of S3 through

the AEICs and statements of intended evidence for Sky Technology and prepare them for

cross-examination when Mr Singh was away in London.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">79.    <font face="Times New Roman">Besides, as S3 is the

plaintiff, Mr Singh would not have to do any cross-examination on the first day of trial. Mr Lok

would have to do that.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">80.    <font face="Times New Roman">As 27 April 2001 would be a

Friday, there would be a weekend for Mr Singh to do some more preparation, if that was necessary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">81.    <font face="Times New Roman">In the circumstances, the

argument that S3 would be compelled to seek a vacating of the trial dates was without merit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">82.    <font face="Times New Roman">This is reinforced by another

point.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">83.    <font face="Times New Roman">On 10 April 2001, Mr Singh had

two matters before me. One was the appeal of Sky Technology in the present action. The other was an

appeal in another action ie Suit No 229 of 200 between Les Placements Germain Gautheir Inv c Hong

Pian Tee (the Other Action). Mr Singh was representing the defendant in the Other Action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">84.    The appeal in the Other Action was listed for hearing

before the hearing of Sky Technologys appeal. However it was adjourned to a special date to be

fixed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">85.    <font face="Times New Roman">When I was considering the

directions I should make about that special date, Mr Singh requested that I direct that the appeal

(in the Other Action) be fixed for hearing on a date after the trial dates of the S3 action against

Sky Technology. He explained that if Sky Technologys appeal was successful, he would then be

engaged in the trial of S3s action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">86.    <font face="Times New Roman">In the light of Mr Singhs

request, I directed accordingly. Yet he was arguing emphatically before me in Sky Technologys

appeal as to how S3 would have to seek a vacating of the trial dates because of his tight schedule

if an EOT was granted to Sky Technology.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">87.    <font face="Times New Roman">I stress that even if Mr Singh

had not made the request I have mentioned, my conclusion about the lack of merits in his argument

about the vacating of the trail dates would have been the same.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">88.    <font face="Times New Roman">In the circumstances, the

cases cited by Mr Singh, ie the unreported decision of Chan Seng Onn JC in Suit No 320 of 1997 and <i>Chan

Kern Miang v Kea Resources Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 145</nobr> were not applicable because these were cases

in which a party was applying for the trial dates to be vacated.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">89.    <font face="Times New Roman">I was of the view that there

was no undue prejudice to S3 if EOT was granted to Sky Technology to exchange the AEICs by 11 April

2001 ie one day after the hearing before me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">WHETHER THERE WERE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO WARRANT DISMISSING THE

APPLICATION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">90.    The affidavits filed for S3, the written submissions and Mr

Singhs oral submissions advanced numerous arguments about the conduct of Sky Technology and/or

their solicitors.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">First Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">91.    First, Mr Singh argued that the excuse about Winnie Tham

was not a true one. I have already dealt with that and need say no more on it, except to add that

while I found the attempt to rely on the Winnie Tham excuse unsatisfactory, I would stop short of

calling it deplorable.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Second Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">92.    (a) Mr Singh stressed that Rodyk &amp; Davidson should have

informed his firm much earlier that they were unable to complete the AEICs in time. He even pointed

out that at the hearing before the Court of Appeal on 22 April 2001, Rodyk &amp; Davidson had asked

for an EOT to provide the $600,000 security but did not do so for the AEICs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) However, as Mr Lok put it, Rodyk &amp; Davidson did not have prior knowledge

that they would be unable to meet the dead-line for the AEICs. They were trying their best to meet

the dead-line but were unable to do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) The fact that they informed Manjit &amp; Partners on the very last day and

only after they had received a fax from Manjit &amp; Partners is immaterial. I have no doubt that if

they had informed Manjit &amp; Partners just the day before about their predicament, he would still

have objected to an EOT.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Third Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">93.    (a) Mr Singh argued that if Sky Technology was granted an

EOT, this would mean that it would have had more time to prepare its AEICs than S3. I was of the

view that while this is true as a fact, it was not a valid argument. If S3s AEICs had not been

ready by the dead-line, S3 would be in no position to object to the application for an EOT by Sky

Technology.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) While it is to the credit of S3 and their solicitors that they have met the

dead-line, notwithstanding all the distractions in-between, this did not in turn mean that the

application of Sky Technology for an EOT should be rejected. It is in the very nature of an

objection to such an application that the party who is objecting has met the dead-line whereas the

other has not.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) Besides, Mr Singh was not suggesting that if an EOT was to be granted to Sky

Technology, then S3 should have the same EOT to file supplementary AEICs if S3 thought fit to do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Fourth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">94.    (a) Mr Singh argued that he was not informed that the AEICs

of the principal witnesses had been signed by the evening of 4 April 2001. He only learned about it

at the hearing before me. He went on to say that had he been informed, the AEICs could have been

exchanged before the hearing of the appeal on 10 April 2001. While he was implying that he would

have agreed to such an exchange then, he stopped short of actually saying so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) However, I note that in para 6 of the 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit of Mr Lim

executed on 4 April 2001, and filed on 5 April 2001, Mr Lim had said that Sky Technology was in a

position now to file and serve the affidavits of Gordon Goh and Loewe Goh. This 3<sup>rd</sup>

affidavit was served on Manjit &amp; Partners on 5 April 2001 at 4.30 pm whereupon they prepared and

eventually filed an affidavit, ie the 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit of Dr Yang Jian Ling, in response on

9 April 2001. Manjit &amp; Partners were therefore aware some time before the hearing on 10 April

2001 that the AEICs for Sky Technology had been completed on 4 April 2001. Yet they did not suggest

that the AEICs be exchanged before 10 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Fifth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">95.    (a) An argument was also raised that Sky Technologys

representatives were more interested in crucial business negotiations than in meeting the courts

dead-line.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) This argument was raised because Sky Technology had sought to explain why

Gordon and Loewe Goh were unable to attend at Rodyk &amp; Davidsons office for the preparation of

their AEICs on 26 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) I was of the view that Sky Technology was trying to be candid but S3 sought

to turn this explanation against it by the argument I have mentioned. S3 even labelled the

non-attendance, for one day, as disgraceful.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(d) I was of the view that this was an exaggeration by S3.</p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Sixth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">96.    (a) Mr Singh complained that his firm was not even informed

on 30 March 2001 that Rodyk &amp; Davidson were filing an application for an EOT. He knew about it

only when it was served on 2 April 2001 at 3.35 pm but by then his firm had already filed S3s

application against Sky Technology for its failure to meet the dead-line.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) While Rodyk &amp; Davidson should have informed Manjit &amp; Partners that

they were filing an application for extension, I did not read as much into it as Mr Singh wanted me

to. Obviously Rodyk &amp; Davidson were themselves hard-pressed and inadvertently omitted to give

Manjit &amp; Partners advance notice of their intention.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) Besides, their omission was immaterial.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Seventh Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">97.    (a) After Lim Yeow Bengs 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit was

filed for Sky Technologys application for EOT, and a 3<sup>rd</sup> one was filed thereafter for

the appeal before me, Mr Singh complained that the Gohs should have executed these affidavits and

not Mr Lim who had no knowledge about the dispute.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) I was of the view that this complaint was not a valid one. Mr Lim is the

Intellectual Property &amp; Contracts Director of Sky Technology. There was no material to suggest

that only the Gohs can sign affidavits for an application for EOT. Such affidavits were not the

AEICs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Eighth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">98.    (a) Mr Singh drew my attention to paragraph 4 of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

affidavit of Mr Lim which began with this sentence:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The directions provided a short time frame for the preparation of the

  affidavits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr Singh said that this was an implied criticism of the courts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) In Mr Lims 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit, he said that no disrespect was

intended to the court by the sentence I have mentioned. However, this did not satisfy Mr Singh. He

stressed that there was no retraction of the offending sentence and no apology to the court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) As the parties had been given slightly over a month to prepare the AEICs, I

was of the view that Mr Lims sentence should have been more carefully worded. However, I was also

of the view that in the light of his 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit, nothing more should turn on it. Also,

even if his 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit had not been filed, I was of the view that offence should not

be taken too quickly as his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit was obviously prepared in a rush and should be

read in the context of the other matters that occupied the time and attention of Rodyk &amp;

Davidson.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(d) I was also of the view that it was not for Mr Singh to take umbrage on behalf

of the court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Ninth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">99.    (a) Mr Singh also submitted that the two new affidavits by

Mr Lim and Joanna Foong should have been brought to the attention of the Registrar in the context of

further arguments so that the Registrar could deal with the new material in these affidavits. He

said it was unfair for Sky Technology to require me to reverse the Registrars decision not on

material placed before the Registrar but on new material consciously not pleaded before the

Registrar.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) I did not accept this argument. In the first place, the two affidavits were

primarily to elaborate on points already taken in Mr Lims 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) Moreover, Sky Technology was not consciously withholding the material in the

two new affidavits. They had filed Mr Lims 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit on an urgent basis to support

its application for EOT. When this application failed, the only natural step was to file a Notice of

Appeal to the judge on an urgent basis if the trial dates were not to be jeopardised. Pending the

hearing of the appeal, the two new affidavits were filed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(d) Furthermore, if Sky Technology had sought further arguments before the

Registrar and was unsuccessful again, precious time would have been wasted and the appeal to the

judge would have been heard even later.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(e) Indeed, if Sky Technology had sought further arguments before the Registrar

and was unsuccessful, I would not have been surprised if Mr Singh was then to argue that Sky

Technology should not have sought further arguments and should have appealed immediately to the

judge.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Tenth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">100.    (a) Mr Singh argued that when Sky Technology chose to move

quickly, it could do so. Hence, the application for EOT was filed on the same day when Rodyk &amp;

Davidson had informed his firm that they were unable to exchange the AEICs on time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) I was of the view that this too was not a valid argument. On that day, Rodyk

&amp; Davidson knew that they were unable to complete the AEICs on time and also knew that they were

not going to get any quarter from Manjit &amp; Partners in view of their strong objection. The

application for EOT had to be filed immediately.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) Besides, I did not agree that Sky Technology and Rodyk &amp; Davidson had in

the past been dragging their feet as Mr Singhs argument was suggesting.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Eleventh Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">101.    (a) Mr Singh also pointed out that when Rodyk &amp;

Davidson were seeking an urgent date for the hearing of the appeal to the judge, they did not give

the right reason to the Duty Registrar and instead gave some unconnected reason.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) I was of the view that while that was true, it was neither here nor there

since Mr Singh was not suggesting that there was any attempt to deceive the Duty Registrar.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Twelfth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">102.    (a) Mr Singh said that when the hearing date of 10 April

2001 was obtained for the appeal before me, Rodyk &amp; Davidson did not check whether that date was

suitable for him. He complained that they were only acting to suit themselves.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) I did not agree. Rodyk &amp; Davidson themselves had no advance knowledge

what date would be given for the appeal. Besides, developments were occurring quickly and they had

to move even more quickly. They did not have the luxury of contemplating whether to keep Manjit

&amp; Partners informed of each and every development. Also, they were not legally obliged to keep

Manjit &amp; Partners so informed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) Mr Singh also said that previously as regards Sky Technologys application

for an expedited appeal to the Court of Appeal against Lai Js decision, he was given less than

two hours notice to appear before Chao JA and he was being required to work to the timetable of

Sky Technology.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(d) Again I did not agree. It was the Duty Registrar who had fixed the

appointment before Chao JA in view of the intention to have an expedited appeal. The Duty Registrar

was being helpful and solicitors from both sides had to work on an urgent basis. This was not a

situation of Mr Singh having to work to the timetable of Sky Technology.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Thirteenth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">103.    (a) Mr Singh argued that the Notice of Appeal against the

Registrars decision on EOT still sought a fourteen day extension in defiance of the Registrar.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) I was of the view that this was not a valid argument. Sky Technology had

originally sought a fourteen day extension and the Notice of Appeal had sought the same extension.

There was no question of defying the Registrar as Sky Technology was exercising its right to appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Fourteenth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">104.    (a) Paragraph 4 of the affidavit of Ho Kah Meng for S3 to

resist the initial application for EOT accused Sky Technology of unilaterally deciding to vary the

directions of the Registrar given on 28 February 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) Again, this was not a valid argument. Sky Technology had not unilaterally

decided to do anything. It was unable to meet a dead-line and had to apply for EOT.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Fifteenth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">105.    (a) Mr Singh stressed repeatedly that Rodyk &amp; Davidson

still had not listed the names of their witnesses notwithstanding his requests to them to do so as a

result of which he could not extract the order of 28 February 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) However, I did not think this was deliberate on the part of Rodyk &amp;

Davidson. So many things were happening, the most important of which was the appeal to the Court of

Appeal and, on the conditional leave, the provision of the security thereafter and the preparation

of the AEICs. The action was only required to be set down by 9 April 2001. If the AEICs (for Sky

Technology) could have been completed on time, Rodyk &amp; Davidson would no doubt have provided the

list of their witnesses upon being reminded that it was still outstanding.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Sixteenth Argument</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">106.    (a) The submissions of S3 also pointed out another

instance of alleged delaying tactic on the part of Sky Technology. Apparently, on or about 14 March

2001, Manjit &amp; Partners had sought copies of correspondence for preparation of AEICs for S3 and

these copies were not provided promptly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) The letter dated 14 March 2001 was not produced to me.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) In any event, as a general rule, an instance of delay in responding to a

request cannot be categorised as deplorable conduct and there is no evidence before me that the

delay was deliberately intended to hinder the preparation of the AEICs for S3.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Summary</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">107.    Ultimately, I was of the view that S3 and Mr Singh were

just trying to find fault with every act or omission of Sky Technology and of Rodyk &amp; Davidson

so that they would be punished by a denial of EOT.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">108.    S3 and Mr Singh also used a plethora of words like deplorable,

disgraceful, cavalier, lackadaisical, no apology, no retraction, offensive,

consciously, in defiance and unilaterally deciding for their mission. However, I

was unmoved.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">109.    Their arguments were not valid and the use of such

language did not advance their position any further.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Order 25 Rule 3(2) Rules of Court</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">110.    Mr Singh pointed out that the Singapore Rules of Court O

25 r 3(2) states:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns=""></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Where any party fails to comply with the Courts directions for the filing

  and exchange of affidavits, an application may be made by summons at any time after the default

  for an order to enter judgment or to dismiss the action, as the case may be, or for such other

  order as to costs or otherwise that the Court thinks just in the circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="3" xmlns=""></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">111.    He stressed that this provision was peculiar to Singapore.

He was suggesting that a failure to exchange AEICs on time would lead to more drastic consequences

than a failure to comply with any other provision in the Rules of Court in time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">112.    I did not agree. <i>The Tokai Maru</i> also involved a

case of the late filing or exchange of AEICs. Indeed the length of the delay there was much longer

and the reason for delay there was even less justifiable. I presumed that the Court of Appeal in <i>The

Tokai Maru</i> was aware of O 25 r 3(2).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">113.    <font face="Times New Roman">In any event, in the absence

of any express provision to the contrary, I was not prepared to treat the failure to exchange AEICs

in time as an exception to the principles laid down in <i>The Tokai Maru</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">114.    In the circumstances, there was no exceptional reason to

warrant the dismissal of the application for EOT.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">115.    Indeed, as Mr Lok submitted, this was not a situation

where Sky Technology was in the habit of allowing dead-lines imposed by the court to pass without

doing anything.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">116.    Furthermore, the parties had gone through an application

for summary judgment before a registrar, an appeal to a judge in chambers, further arguments

thereon, an expedited appeal to the Court of Appeal and Sky Technology had provided the security of

$600,000. It was also ready with its AEICs before the appeal to me was heard.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">117.    I would add that my decision would have been the same even

if the two fresh affidavits (ie Mr Lims 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit and Joanna Foongs affidavit)

were not filed after the Registrars decision on 4 April 2001. I allowed arguments thereon because

they contained primarily elaboration. Furthermore, S3 had filed an affidavit of Dr Yang Jian Ling in

response to Mr Lims 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit and Mr Singh was, to his credit, in a position to

advance arguments in response to Joanna Foongs affidavit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Interference with the Registrar decision</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">118.    Mr Singh cited the case of <i>Wright Norman v

Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 710</nobr> for the principle that in the absence of clear

error of law or principle, an appellate court should not interfere.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">119.    I noted that that principle was said in the context of an

appeal to the Court of Appeal and not an appeal from a registrar to a judge.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">120.    Mr Singh further submitted that the Registrar had acted on

established principles, meaning the principle he was advocating.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">121.    However, he stopped short of saying that the Registrar had

acted on the principles laid down in <i>The Tokai Maru</i> and the subsequent decisions of the Court

of Appeal that I have mentioned.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">122.    I was of the view that the principles laid down in those

decisions lead to the inevitable conclusion that an EOT should be granted to Sky Technology.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">123.    As the hearing of the appeal concluded at about 6.30 pm, I

granted an EOT for the AEICs of both sides to be exchanged by the next day with consequential orders

for the date for objection to be taken and for setting down to be extended.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">COSTS</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">124.    In Mr Singhs request for further arguments, he said,

inter alia, that S3 could not appreciate why it was not awarded costs (of its application before the

Registrar, Sky Technologys application before the Registrar and Sky Technologys appeal before

me) on an indemnity basis. I rejected the request for further arguments.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">125.    I was of the view that the argument that S3 could not

appreciate my decision on costs was an emotional argument and, hence, irrelevant. A partys

argument is not augmented by its failure to appreciate the courts view or decision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">126.    The usual rule is that costs are granted on a standard

basis, in the absence of a contractual provision to the contrary.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">127.    Hence, even if a defendant is dragged to court through no

fault of his own, he is still awarded costs on a standard basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">128.    Another illustration is where one party seeks to amend his

pleading. The costs of that application and any costs consequential on the amendment are, again,

usually awarded to the other side on a standard basis even though the amendment arises through no

fault of the other side.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">129.    As for applications for EOT, these are not uncommon and

are usually again met with an order for costs on a standard basis. The nature of such applications

and the legal principles are not novel or complex.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">130.    The facts of the application of Sky Technology for EOT

were also not complex.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">131.    I also did not think that the conduct of Sky Technology

and/or Rodyk &amp; Davidson was so bad that it warranted an order for costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">132.    It is true that there was considerable urgency, but that

did not warrant an order for costs on an indemnity basis. Besides, I took into account the element

of urgency before I fixed the quantum of the costs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">133.    As for the length of the hearing before the Registrar,

there was no suggestion that it was particularly long.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">134.    As for the hearing before me, this took about three hours.

This was mainly because of the numerous, but invalid, arguments advanced by Mr Singh and also

because he repeated some of his arguments from time to time. In view of that I had contemplated

whether S3 should even be awarded full costs on a standard basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">135.    However, as Mr Lok did not dispute that S3 should be

entitled to full costs on such a basis, I awarded S3 its full costs on a standard basis and fixed it

at $14,000.</p>
