</div> When Symphony first attempted to remit the first tranche of US$6m to the Plaintiff on 24 December 2013, it was unsuccessful. This was because the Defendant had provided Symphony with DDPTE’s Bank Account details but named the Plaintiff as the payee. Thus, DBS informed Symphony that for that particular bank account number, the corresponding named payee should have been DDPTE and not the Plaintiff. Symphony then enquired with the Defendant as to the discrepancy, and asked for the Defendant to provide the details of a bank account held in the Plaintiff’s name.

First, in relation to the DDAS Payments, the Liquidators argued that there was no evidence of any management services ever having been provided by DDAS to the Plaintiff – there were no detailed invoices, work reports, breakdowns, disbursement accounts, or any other documentation which would justify the payment of fees. Yet, the Defendant caused the Plaintiff to make the DDAS Payments out of the Borrowed Funds, even where it had been represented to creditors that the Borrowed Funds would be used to pay the deposit for the purchase of the <span class="font-italic">Somnath</span>. The Liquidators argued that the Defendant’s act of procuring the Plaintiff to enter into an agreement to pay out of the Borrowed Funds to DDAS, his own wholly-owned company, for non-existent management services was not only fraudulent conduct, but also a breach of directors’ duties to act honestly in the interests of the company, to prioritise the interests of creditors as well as the “actual conflict” rule.

It was argued that the Defendant had signed on behalf of all three parties. It was also pointed out that DDPTE had not provided any consideration to the Plaintiff and was not even a party to the agreement between First Marine and PT Harmoni (the rights under this agreement being the subject of the Novation Agreement) and yet, DDPTE stood to reap the largest benefit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the DDPTE Loan with favourable terms and a further 1.15% commission payable for each rig sourced to the Plaintiff under the Novation Agreement). With respect to the Business Services Agreement, the Liquidators argued that the monthly payment of US$50,000 was not justifiable – DDPTE had no employees and there were no documents evidencing that any work had been done by DDPTE. The Liquidators thus argued that both the DDPTE Loan and the monthly payments were made pursuant to a fraudulent scheme or were made without good faith in breach of the Defendant’s duties to act in the best interests of the Plaintiff, to prioritise the interests of the creditors as well as the “actual conflict” rule.

The Liquidators adduced evidence to show that the TY Global Payments had been made pursuant to an arrangement between the Defendant and Abraham, whereby Abraham agreed to run the Plaintiff’s US$3.25m through his entities before taking a cut of US$15,000 and remitting the remaining sum of US$3.235m to Rocky Point, a US-incorporated company controlled by the Defendant.

The appellant’s duty of honesty, which is said to require him to “act honestly in the discharge of his duties as a director”, appears to be a reference to the statutory duty imposed on directors under s 157(1) of the CA. This duty is the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">statutory </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">equivalent</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>which exists at common law: see <span class="font-italic">Cheam Tat Pang v PP </span>[1996] 1 SLR(R) 161 at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Weng Kee v PP </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 848 at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Vita Hea</span><span class="font-italic">lth Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Meng </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 at [14].

The question is whether an “honest and intelligent man in the position of the directors, taking an objective view, could reasonably have concluded that the transactions were in the interests of [the company].” This test was re-affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng </span>at [38], where the Court of Appeal added a qualification (at [37]) that the court will be slow to interfere with a director’s commercial decision which has been made honestly even if it turns out, on hindsight, to be financially detrimental to the company. The Court of Appeal also made it clear (at [38]) that just because the court will be slow to interfere, it “does not mean that the court should refrain from exercising any supervision over directors as long as they claim to be genuinely acting to promote the company’s interests.” For instance, where the transaction is “not objectively in the company’s interest”, the court may draw an inference that the director did not act honestly: <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng </span>at [38], citing with approval <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span>”) at para 8.36. Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [39])<span class="font-italic"> </span>referred to [17] and [19] of the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd and others v Pang Seng Meng </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 and remarked that “the requirement of <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or honesty will not be satisfied if the director acted <span class="font-italic">dis</span>honestly even if for the purported aim of maximising profits for the company” [emphasis in original]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 After I rendered my decision, these principles were re-affirmed in the Court of Appeal’s recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 592, where the court emphasised at [35]–[36] that even if the director in question had subjectively believed his actions to be in the company’s best interests, he would still be held to have breached his duty if, on the <span class="font-italic">Intraco</span> test, his actions on an objective view were not in the company’s best interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is imperative to note that a director owes duties even if he is the sole director and the owner or effective owner of the company. Such a director may breach his directors’ duties even if creditors’ interests have not been impinged on, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in a solvent company (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Bee Chew v Ong Shu Lin</span> [2017] SGHC 285 at [86]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Defendant argued, citing <span class="font-italic">Intraco</span>, that the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of the company does not preclude a director from considering the interest of a group of companies as a single economic entity and act for the benefit of the group as a whole. On this basis, it was permissible for the Defendant to also take into account the interests of the other companies (including Treatmil, DDPTE and DDAS) when making commercial decisions for the Plaintiff.

This flows from the fact that a company is a separate legal entity, and the fact that the liabilities of the company do not ordinarily attach to its shareholders or officers. The advantages of corporate personality must be in return for certain obligations. The same applies for groups of companies since each company within the group can have its own separate set of creditors (see <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> at para 8.31). While some commercial leeway may be given to those who act as directors of associated companies within a group, the obligations owed to each company do not disappear. As such, a director must not act with the intention of furthering the interests of the group as a whole to the prejudice or detriment of a company within the group (see <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> at para 8.31). This much is clear from the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Golden Village Multiplex Pte Ltd v Phoon Chiong Kit </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 307</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, which (at [36]) endorsed and applied the approach laid out by Pennycuick J in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Charterbridge Corporation Ltd v Lloyds Bank Ltd </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1970] Ch 62 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at 74 in relation to directorship of companies within a group: </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Each company in the group is a separate legal entity and the directors of a particular company are not entitled to sacrifice the interest of that company.</span> This becomes apparent when one considers the case where the particular company has separate creditors.

The Defendant instead argued that the DDAS Payments were legitimate, commercially justifiable payments for services rendered, which the Defendant honestly and reasonably believed the Plaintiff was required to pay.

The Defendant’s answer to the lack of evidence was that it was not “industry practice” to keep such documentary records and that since he was personally involved in the work done, he “obviously knew what work had been done”.

While directors may be accorded considerable leeway to exercise commercial judgment in their specific fields, where concerns have been raised about the decisions made, it is not sufficient for a director to merely invoke his expertise and experience as a justification. In other words, if the director’s judgment is in issue, a claim of expertise or experience would in many instances need to be buttressed by independent evidence. The court would otherwise be left to rely exclusively on evidence from the very person whose judgment is impugned. That is not only improper but also insufficient to establish an acceptable and legitimate practice in the vast majority of cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For the year 2015, the Defendant claimed that the Plaintiff had incurred US$300,000 in management fees to DDAS.

To secure that the work related to the sourcing of the three units was secured. If we would give something over, we have to make sure that, er, the---the---the work of actually doing this was continued and not stalled. It’s quite common in many industries that you---you hand over rights, but you make sure that, so when the rights are handed over, that the financing of these rights is being taken care of, and that was the basics for this contract. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q:  Now, I won’t belabour the point.

First, it was not clear to me why DDPTE had to be the party that had to undertake this project. Second, the Defendant failed to convince me that the allegedly beneficial Novation Agreement could not have taken place without the grant of the DDPTE Loan, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the DDPTE Loan was a precondition or a condition precedent to the Novation Agreement. Most tellingly, the Defendant himself admitted in evidence that the DDPTE Loan was not beneficial to the Plaintiff which went towards proving his lack of <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in causing the Plaintiff to grant the DDPTE Loan, thereby acting contrary to the Plaintiff’s interests:

The DDPTE Loan was for US$1.7m. Yet, the Defendant said in his statement of defence (in the context of accounting for the US$10.5m) that the DDPTE Loan was S$1,566,561,

</div> which is equivalent to US$1,118,972 (again applying the exchange rate of US$1 to S$1.40). There was no conceivable reason why that DDPTE Loan figure should have been reduced, other than if a set-off had been applied. It was clear that the Defendant had unilaterally reduced the amount owed by DDPTE to the Plaintiff under the DDPTE Loan by applying a set-off. If the DDPTE Loan taken in November 2014 was US$1.7m and if the balance remaining in DDPTE’s account after the liquidation was S$1,566,561 (as stated in the statement of defence), it would mean that the amount used as a set-off to pay down the DDPTE Loan under the Business Services Agreement was approximately US$581,028. This is equivalent to about 12 months’ worth of service (at US$50,000 per month under the Business Services Agreement) rendered for the Plaintiff. In other words, this would mean DDPTE had provided services for 12 months since 14 November 2014 (see [11] above), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, until October 2015. This would have been well after the winding-up order was made against the Plaintiff in June 2015. This clearly could not be possible and showed that the Defendant had been dishonest in connection with the Business Services Agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TY Global Payments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Liquidators argued that the TY Global Payments amounted to fraudulent misappropriation of the Plaintiff’s monies. It was their case that the Defendant conspired with Abraham, the person behind TY Global, to move the Plaintiff’s monies through Abraham’s companies and for such monies to eventually end up in the bank account of Rocky Point, a company controlled by the Defendant.

</div> The Defendant then forwarded Turall’s email to Abraham – this gave rise to a reasonable inference that the monies referred to by Turall in her email was the US$3.235m that the Defendant expected to enter Rocky Point’s bank account. More tellingly, the Defendant was clearly anxious that Rocky Point should receive those funds. This was evident from his reaction when Turall informed him by email that the funds had still not been received.

The Defendant (through Rocky Point) stood to gain significantly from his arrangement with Abraham. As can be seen from the exchange of correspondence above, the Defendant was clearly agitated that Abraham did not appear to be holding up his end of the bargain. To be clear, even though US$3.25m was transferred from the Plaintiff’s funds to TY Global, only US$2m was eventually transferred to Rocky Point. Abraham had pocketed the remaining sum of $1.25m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Separately, to justify the payments made to Rocky Point, the Defendant relied on an alleged cash pooling arrangement between Rocky Point and DDAS, under which both entities shared a common pool of funds which could be used to pay off their creditors.

It is accordingly impossible to conclude that the Treatmil Payment was made in the best interests of the Plaintiff since the Plaintiff reaped no corresponding benefit from making this payment to Treatmil. In all likelihood, the Liquidators’ version of events – that this was a ploy by the Defendant to transfer the Plaintiff’s monies to his other companies – seemed more plausible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 For these reasons, I found that each of the Four Transactions was in breach of the Defendant’s duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of the duty to take into account the interest of creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It is uncontroversial that when a company is insolvent, or even in “a parlous financial position”, directors have a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s <span class="font-italic">creditors</span> when making decisions for the company (see <span class="font-italic">Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen Holdings Ltd</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1089 (“<span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span>”) at [48]). As expressed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span>, the rationale for this duty is as follows (at [52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]hen a company is insolvent, the creditors’ interests come to the fore as the company is effectively trading and running the company’s business with the creditors’ money. Because of the limited liability principle, the risks (of trading when the company is insolvent) on shareholders would be minimal as they would at worst lose only what they have already invested in the company in their capacity as shareholders. Unsecured or partially secured creditors on the other hand may never recover any monies due to them. Unlike shareholders who have the most to gain from risky ventures, unsecured creditors, in particular, have everything to lose when illegitimate risks are taken. As such, it is only right that directors ought to be accountable to creditors for the decisions they make when the company is, or perilously close to being, insolvent …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The greater the concern over the company’s financial health, the more weight the directors must accord to the interests of creditors over those of the shareholders: <span class="font-italic">Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Liu Cheng Chan and others </span>[2017] SGHC 15 at [62] (“<span class="font-italic">Parakou Shipping</span>”), citing <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal</span> [2014] 3 SLR 277 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty</span>”) at [34].

In <span class="font-italic">Parakou </span><span class="font-italic">Shipping</span>, the High Court recognised that when deciding whether a director has a duty to take creditors’ interests into account, the company need not be <span class="font-italic">technically insolvent</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [65]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [F]or the purposes of deciding whether a director has a duty to take creditors’ interests into account, <span class="font-italic">the company need not be technically insolvent</span>.

[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These observations were not disturbed on appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Parakou </span><span class="font-italic">Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and other appeals</span> [2018] SGCA 3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The purpose of applying a broad-based assessment is to prevent errant directors of a company from relying on the technical balance sheet and/or cash flow tests to escape liability for their breach of duties in relation to the interests of the company’s creditors. Indeed, this concern for protecting creditors’ interests was echoed in <span class="font-italic">Dynasty</span>, where the Court of Appeal held at [34]–[35] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… this [broad-based] assessment would include a consideration of all claims, debts, liabilities and obligations of a company.

For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Colin Gwyer &amp; Associates Ltd v London Wharf (Limehouse) Ltd</span> [2003] 2 BCLC 153, Mr Leslie Kosmin QC (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) observed as follows (at [74]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where a company is <span class="font-italic">insolvent or of doubtful solvency or on the verge of insolvency</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and it is the creditors’ money which is at risk the directors, when carrying out their duty to the company, must consider the interests of the creditors as paramount and take those into account when exercising their discretion. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Balance sheet and/or cash flow insolvency is thus not required, rather the question is whether the company is in fact financially imperiled. It is in such situations that the directors come under a fiduciary duty to take into account the creditors’ interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Based on the facts before me, I accepted the Liquidators’ argument that this state was reached <span class="font-italic">at the latest</span> by 27 December 2013.

A director can be in breach of the rule even though his or her own conduct has caused no loss to the company (<span class="font-italic">Company Directors: Duties, Liabilities, and Remedies </span>(Simon Mortimore ed) (Oxford University Press, 2009) at para 14.11, citing <span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver </span>[1967] 2 AC 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings)</span>”) at 134 and 153).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54  The no-profit rule obliges a director not to retain any profit which he has made through the use of the company’s property, information or opportunities to which he has access by virtue of being a director, without the fully informed consent of the company. The rule is again a strict one and liability to account arises simply because profits are made (see <span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings) </span>at 144).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55  The rule against self-dealing prohibits a director from entering, on behalf of the company, into an arrangement or transaction with himself or with a company or firm in which he is interested (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Hup Thye v Refco (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1069 at [29]). There is “self-dealing” because the director essentially acts on behalf of both parties in such a transaction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56  It can be seen that there is indeed overlap between the no-conflict rule, no-profit rule and rule against self-dealing. A director who enters into a self-dealing transaction would inevitably be in a position of conflict and, if a profit is made, would be in breach of the duty not to make a profit out of his position. For that reason, the no-profit rule and rule against self-dealing have been described as particular instances of the broader duty of a director not to place himself in a position of conflict (see <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law </span>at para 8.45). In turn, there is overlap between the no-conflict rule and a director’s duty to act in the best interests of the company, “for when a director makes his interests paramount, invariably he will not be acting in the best interests of his company” (<span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law </span>at para 8.39).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 From these observations, it becomes clear that the two relevant duties in the present case are the “no-conflict rule” and the “rule against self-dealing”, both of which are part of the “broader duty” of a director not to place himself in a position of conflict. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 From my findings above, it was apparent that the Defendant had breached both these duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Defendant had clearly breached the rule against self-dealing because he purported to represent the interests of all parties or more than one party in the following agreements/transactions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Management Fee Agreements for the years 2013 and 2014 between DDAS and the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Novation Agreement between First Marine, DDPTE and the Plaintiff where the Defendant represented all three parties; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the DDPTE Loan agreement and the Business Services Agreement, where the Defendant signed on behalf of DDPTE and the Plaintiff; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the Tripartite Agreement between the Plaintiff, Treatmil and AMS SG where the Defendant signed on behalf of the Plaintiff and Treatmil (and where AMS SG <span class="font-italic">did not </span>sign<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Tripartite Agreement). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 From these facts, the Defendant also contravened the no-conflict rule in respect of the Four Transactions – he placed himself in situations where his personal interest might conflict with those of the Plaintiff, whose interest he was bound to protect, giving rise to a risk that he may prefer his interest over the Plaintiff’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Defendant was a director of the Plaintiff and the chairman of Treatmil,

A breach also existed with respect to the TY Global Payments: the Plaintiff’s money was transferred (albeit via an indirect route) to Rocky Point, a company wholly and ultimately controlled and owned by the Defendant. As for the DDPTE Loan and the DDAS Payments, the Defendant also contravened the no-conflict rule because he had used the Plaintiff’s funds essentially to extend loans to and/or engage the services of companies of which he was the ultimate beneficial shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In particular, with respect to the DDPTE Loan, the Defendant caused the Plaintiff to enter into the Business Services Agreement purportedly for the provision of DDPTE’s services to ensure that the novation of First Marine’s rights to the Plaintiff would be successful.

</div>
</div>
</div> This argument was a non-starter. A director’s statutory obligation to disclose interests to the company’s board under s 156 of the CA is independent of the general duty to avoid conflicts of interests stemming from the no-conflict rule and the rule against self-dealing (see also <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> at para 09.084 and <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> at para 8.52). In fact, s 156(14) of the CA expressly provides that s 156 “shall be <span class="font-italic">in addition to and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not in derogation</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">of</span> the operation of any rule of law” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. As such, the Defendant’s submission conflated the director’s statutory obligation to disclose his interests in related entities with the director’s obligation to avoid conflicts of interest at general law. If anything, disclosure pursuant to s 156(5) of the CA would only mean that the Defendant would not incur civil and criminal liability under s 156 of the CA which was, in any event, not the Plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Instead, at general law, a breach of the no-conflict rule will be avoided only where there is full disclosure to all the shareholders of all the material facts and shareholders’ approval is subsequently obtained (see <span class="font-italic">Dayco Products Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Ong Cheng Aik</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 318 at [13], citing with approval the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Gwembe Valley Development Co Ltd v Koshy (No 3)</span> [2004] 1 BCLC 131 at [65]). This is clearly distinct from the statutory obligation under s 156 of the CA: disclosure under the CA is made to the company’s <span class="font-italic">board </span><span class="font-italic">of directors</span> and is governed by the parameters stipulated in s 156 of the CA, while disclosure under general law is to the <span class="font-italic">shareholde</span><span class="font-italic">rs</span> and full disclosure of all the material facts is required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Accordingly, the Defendant could have avoided a breach of the no-conflict rule only if full disclosure had been made to the Plaintiff’s shareholders of all the material facts relating to the Four Transactions. I now turn to address this alternative submission, which is also germane to the other breaches of duties allegedly committed by the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevance of shareholders’ ratification </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Defendant submitted that he ought to be excused from the alleged breaches because he had obtained the informed consent of Treatmil, its majority shareholder.

</div>
</div> Even if majority shareholder approval is sufficient to excuse a director from his breaches as a matter of law (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng</span> at [59]), I found that there was no such ratification on the facts for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 First, Treatmil’s consent was purportedly obtained on 3 December 2013, at a time when it had yet to become the majority shareholder of the Plaintiff. In fact, the very purpose of the meeting was to approve Treatmil’s subscription to a 51% share in the Plaintiff.

</div> there was no evidence as to what had actually been disclosed for me to conclude that Treatmil’s informed consent had been obtained. In any event, this disclosure would have been in the Defendant’s capacity as Treatmil’s director to Treatmil’s board, and not in his capacity as the Plaintiff’s director to its majority shareholder. This is especially in light of the fact that the context of the meeting involved Treatmil’s acquisition of shares in the Plaintiff – any disclosure would likely have pertained to that order of business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Third, even where full disclosure is made, where creditors’ interests are at risk, the shareholders’ purported ratification of a director’s actions is ineffective. The Court of Appeal briefly considered this question in <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter</span> [2013] 1 SLR 374 (“<span class="font-italic">Raffles Town</span><span class="font-italic"> Club</span>”) at [45]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, in the absence of any factor that would disqualify shareholders from ratifying unauthorised or unlawful acts of directors, we see no reason why a company may not waive any claims it may have against its directors for any kind of liability <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">where the company is solvent</span>. As Street CJ said in [<span class="font-italic">Kinsela v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd</span> (1986) 4 NSWLR 722 (“<span class="font-italic">Kinsela</span>”)] (at 730 and 732): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In a solvent company the proprietary interests of the shareholders entitle them as a general body to be regarded as the company when questions of the duty of directors arise. If, as a general body, they authorise or ratify a particular action of the directors, there can be no challenge to the validity of what the directors have done. But where a company is insolvent the interests of the creditors intrude. They become prospectively entitled to, through the mechanism of liquidation, to displace the power of the shareholders and directors to deal with the company’s assets … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is … legally and logically acceptable to recognise that, where directors involved in a breach of their duty to the company affecting the interests of shareholders, then shareholders can either authorise that breach in prospect or ratify it in retrospect. <span class="font-italic">Where, however, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">interests at risk are those of creditors</span><span class="font-italic"> I see no reason in law or in logic to recognise that the shareholders can authorise the breach</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In my judgment, I do not think the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town</span> intended to confine its decision solely to cases of technical insolvency, to the exclusion of cases of near insolvency or “parlous financial state”. This can be discerned from its endorsement of Street CJ’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Kinsela </span>that the relevant yardstick is whether the creditors’ interests are at risk and not whether the company was technically insolvent. This reading is also in line with the Court of Appeal’s previous decision in <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span> which observed that directors have a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s creditors <span class="font-italic">even when</span> the company is not technically insolvent but in a “parlous financial position” (see [83] above). Further, two of the three judges who decided <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span> were in the <span class="font-italic">coram</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>which decided <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span> two years later. Most importantly, the rationale as to why ratification by shareholders should not be given effect in cases of actual insolvency is similarly applicable to cases where the company is <span class="font-italic">near</span> insolvency. When creditors’ interests may be compromised in the future, it is not the proper role of the shareholders to ratify the actions of directors which might otherwise expose these directors to liability – this is because the duties held by the directors are not just for the benefit of the shareholders, but also for the benefit of its creditors. Accordingly, I took the view that shareholders cannot ratify the wrongdoings of the company’s directors where the company is insolvent or where the creditors’ interests are endangered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 This rule was infringed in this case. As mentioned, the Defendant relied on the Minutes which were dated 3 December 2013. This pre-dated the latest possible point in time that the Plaintiff entered a parlous financial state, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 27 December 2013 (see [92] above). Any prior consent by the shareholders would have been subject to a consideration of the creditors’ interests by that time.

In my view, this mere fact was insufficient to support the Liquidator’s conclusion that the Defendant had intended to defraud Symphony by “ring-fencing” its funds to prevent recovery in enforcement proceedings. The Defendant’s use of DDPTE’s Bank Account was not for want of trying – there was some documentary evidence that the Defendant did try to open a new bank account in the Plaintiff’s name.

</div> For relief under s 391 of the CA to be granted, the director must show that (1) he has acted honestly, (2) he has acted reasonably, and (3) that it is fair to excuse him for his default (see <span class="font-italic">W&amp;P Piling Pte Ltd v Chew Yin What</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 218 at [77]). Based on my findings above, since the Defendant had made payments out of the Plaintiff’s coffers to his related companies and failed to provide any evidence of corresponding benefits that were received by the Plaintiff, his breaches could not properly be excused under s 391 of the CA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 For completeness, I note that at the start of the proceedings, the Liquidators had sought to admit two hearsay statements in support of their claim against the Defendant.

</div>
</div> These were affidavits made by two witnesses in the US proceedings, Abraham and one Gwendolyn Rosales (“Rosales”). Primary reliance was placed on s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(iii) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”). However, I found that the Plaintiff had failed to establish that it was not practicable to secure the attendances of both witnesses, as required under that section. On what was before me, I could not find that the Plaintiff had expended proportionately reasonable efforts to secure their attendances. In addition, I found that the alternative ground for admissibility under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the EA was not made out with respect to Abraham as there was inconclusive evidence of the statements made by him indicating any adverse interests. There remained other equally plausible explanations for what had transpired. In respect of Rosales, the Plaintiff additionally relied on the grounds for admissibility contained in s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(iv) of the EA and in the alternative, O 38 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). I did not think that there was sufficient evidence to establish that Rosales was recalcitrant, nor did I find that there were sufficient grounds to exercise my discretion to admit the hearsay evidence. The Plaintiff accordingly failed on both grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For the above reasons, I ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff the sum of US$7,579,960 flowing from the Defendant’s breaches of director’s duties. No declaration or order was made under s 340(1) of the CA. I ordered costs and disbursements to be fixed at S$180,000 to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Letchamanan Devadason and Bernice Leong Huiqi (LegalStandard LLP) for the Plaintiff;<br/>Kronenburg Edmund Jerome, Ho Mingjie Kevin and Tan Po Nin Jeslyn (Braddell Brothers LLP) for the Defendant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
