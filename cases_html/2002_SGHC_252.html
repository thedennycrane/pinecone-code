<p xmlns="">HELD, JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFF :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The key document in this case was the purchase order. The signature

  by JB Lee, inserted without prior consultation or knowledge of the plaintiffs, did not in

  any way alter the character of the contract entered into, where the first defendants were

  unequivocally identified and described as the vendors. If the first defendants were indeed

  the sourcing agents, they should have, before the return of the purchase order to the

  plaintiffs, pointed out that their role was merely that of sourcing agents or

  intermediaries. From the e-mail exchanges, it would seem that the first defendants were at

  all times seen to be projecting themselves as vendors of the goods. Furthermore, their

  contention that they were only sourcing agents did not seem to cohere with their

  representation that the second defendants were their branch office in US in their e-mail

  dated 26 August 2000. Another unsettling aspect in the first defendant’s case was

  that although JB Lee of the second defendants was admittedly in Singapore on 3 and 4

  September 2000, Philip Loh who met JB Lee, did not even arrange for JB Lee to meet with

  the plaintiffs’ representatives. Having regard to all the evidence and arguments, the

  conclusion was that the first defendants did indeed enter into the contract with the

  plaintiffs, not as sourcing agents or intermediaries, but on the basis that they were the

  contracting party (See [41]-[44], [47], [49]).</p>
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs were not estopped from proceeding against the first

  defendants as a result of paragraph five of their statement of claim because there had not

  been any election by the plaintiffs, which must be unequivocal. Final election would not

  take place until the party had obtained judgment against one party (See [55])</p>

        In this trial, the following facts by and large

were not in dispute. The plaintiffs are a company incorporated in the Republic of China.

They wanted to purchase 1,920 pieces of computer chips (model Intel E28F320J5-120) for

resale to their customers. In this they enlisted the assistance of a Singapore commission

agent, one Sean Lim Chong Jin (PW-1) (‘Sean Lim’). Sean Lim became the

plaintiffs’ local representative since early January 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        Sean Lim for his part sent out a mass

electronic mail (‘e-mail’) to prospective suppliers. The result was that he

received an e-mail on 11 August 2000 from the first defendants, a company incorporated in

Singapore. The said e-mail (DB-8) read thus:</font></p>

        Some aspects of the said purchase order need

highlighting here. The purchase order which was forwarded to the attention of Philip Loh

of the first defendants named the defendants as vendors. At the bottom left-hand corner of

the purchase order, there was a space for signature under the notation ‘confirmed

by’. This was reportedly signed by one JB Lee describing himself as the president of

one T &amp; M International and returned to the plaintiffs. At the time the plaintiffs

forwarded the purchase order to the first defendants, the plaintiffs had admittedly no

clue as to the actual relationship between the first defendants and the said T &amp; M

International.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The plaintiffs next wrote to the defendants on

25 August 2000 stating that they would be arranging for telegraphic transfer of the sale

amount on 28 August 2000 and requested the first defendants to arrange shipment of the

goods by Fedex immediately after receipt of payment. Following the said communication, the

plaintiffs, on 28 August 2000, remitted US$134,400 to T &amp; M International as advised

by the defendants’ Philip Loh in his e-mail dated 28 August 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        Contrary to expectation, the goods were not

despatched to the plaintiffs. On 30 August 2000, JB Lee of T &amp; M International

reportedly wrote to the first defendants that payment for the goods had already been made

to ‘Intel U.S.’ and that T &amp; M International expected delivery of the goods

by 6 September 2000 latest. On 31 August 2000 the plaintiffs protested to the first

defendants regarding the delay. They warned the first defendants that if the

plaintiffs’ customers were to insist on cancelling the order because of the delay,

the plaintiffs would look to the first defendants not only for the return of the amount

paid but also for compensation for any resulting loss. On 4 September 2000, the plaintiffs

wrote to the first defendants again, this time conveying their customers’ demand for

compensation as a result of the delay in the delivery of the goods. This letter was

followed by a letter from the plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 12 September 2000 in which

the plaintiffs’ solicitors said that the non-delivery of the goods by 30 August 2000

constituted a breach of the agreement entered into between the parties and that the amount

paid towards the purchase of the goods be refunded to the plaintiffs within three days

from the date of the letter together with a sum to be determined in respect of losses

suffered by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        On 20 September 2000, the first

defendants’ solicitors replied to the plaintiffs’ solicitors. In this letter,

the first defendants’ solicitors stated that their clients were not liable to the

plaintiffs in any way as they were only acting as an intermediary between T &amp; M

International and the plaintiffs and the role of the first defendants was no more than

mere sourcing agents.</font></p>

        The second defendants did not file any defence

and neither did they take any steps to contest the plaintiffs’ claim. As for the

first defendants, their defence in sum, was that they acted only as sourcing agents and as

intermediaries between the plaintiffs and the second defendants. Their defence insofar as

was material (paras 1 to 5), read thus:</font></p>

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Evidence</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        The facts which were not in dispute have

already been summarised earlier. I now propose to highlight some aspects of the

parties’ evidence which were at variance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        Sean Lim, a sales executive who was the

plaintiffs’ local representative and the person who was charged with the task of

procuring the goods under reference for the plaintiffs, testified on behalf of the

plaintiffs. After narrating the events and the e-mail exchange which led to the placing of

the purchase order referred to, he said that following the plaintiffs’ complaint that

they had yet to receive the goods despite their remitting the purchase price, he met

Philip Loh of the first defendants on 30 August 2000. At that meeting, Philip Loh told him

amongst other things that ‘the second defendants were the branch office of the first

defendants in the US and that the boss of the second defendants was a good friend of his

boss and that shipment of the goods would be delayed until the 5 or 6 September 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        Subsequently, he met Simon Tan the marketing

manager of the first defendants on 1 September 2000. At that meeting, Sean Lim told Simon

Tan that the plaintiffs’ customers were threatening to cancel their contract with the

plaintiffs on account of the non-delivery of the said goods and were demanding an

immediate refund of the purchase price as well as compensation from the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        Simon Tan assured Sean Lim at that meeting that

the goods would be delivered by 6 September 2000. At that meeting, Simon Tan suggested to

Sean Lim that the plaintiffs ought to look to the second defendants or the manufacturers

of the goods for compensation for the late or non-delivery of the said goods. Nonetheless,

Simon Tan also assured Sean Lim that there would not be any problems or difficulties for

the first defendants to make refund of the sum of US$134,4000 or to meet any compensation

sought by the plaintiffs’ customers arising from the late or non-delivery of the

goods.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        As it transpired, on 4 September 2000, the

plaintiffs demanded from the first defendants, a sum of US$14,000 as compensation for the

delay in delivery of the goods contracted to be supplied. But the demand went unheeded by

the first defendants. Not only that, the first defendants in fact sought to shift the

blame for such non-delivery of the goods on to the plaintiffs, stating that the delay was

due to late remittance of the purchase price by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        On 8 September 2000, the plaintiffs’

General Manager Kao Wen Teng arrived from Taiwan. He, together with Sean Lim and another

person by name Tony Tang, called at the offices of the first defendants. Later, they had a

fruitless meeting with Simon Tan who suggested they go after the second defendants or the

manufacturers of the goods. Simon Tan also stated at that meeting that he would be flying

to the US to check on the situation and to collect the sum of US$134,400 from the second

defendants. Since nothing seemed to be materialising, the plaintiffs sought legal advice

and the upshot was a demand letter from their solicitors dated 12 September 2000,

addressed to the first defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        On 13 September 2000, the plaintiffs received a

letter of demand from their customers, one Component Sourcing House, demanding the return

of a sum of US$149,760 being the sum paid by them to the plaintiffs for the purchase of

the said goods. This sum of $149,760 was subsequently paid over by way of instalments to

Mitkem Technologies who are the customers of Component Sourcing House.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        According to Sean Lim, the plaintiffs were sent

a copy of a letter dated 27 September 2000 from the first defendants to T &amp; M

International. It appeared from that letter that the first defendants had asked T &amp; M

International to deal with the plaintiffs directly stating that the first defendants’

‘role as a middleman is limited and [they were] in no position to reply [to the

plaintiffs] on the refund of money.’</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        There were other details recounted by Sean Lim

which do not require mention here save for the aspect that the second defendants were

apparently willing to assume responsibility for the fiasco and in the process were seen to

be blaming one Malaysian Corporation known as Nikiwa for the default.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        It must be mentioned presently that Sean

Lim’s assertion that Philip Loh told him on 30 August 2000 that the second defendants

were the branch office of the first defendants in the US was not disputed by the defence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        The testimony of Kao Wen Tang (PW-2), the

General Manager of the plaintiffs was confirmatory of the account narrated by Sean Lim.

Additionally, Kao Wen Tang averred how the plaintiffs arranged to pay Mitkem Technologies

their claim for refund of the sums paid by them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        Anita Kuo Hsiu-Chin (PW-3), Assistant Manager

of the plaintiffs, in her testimony adopted what was narrated by Sean Lim and Kao Wen

Tang.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

       Philip Loh Wei Siang (DW-1), sales manager was the

only person who testified for the defence. His evidence can be summarised as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        The first defendants’ business included

import and export of goods in the electronic field. The first defendants also acted as

intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Between 31 July and 23 August 2000, he had a

number of telephone conversations with the plaintiffs’ representative Sean Lim. In

one of his conversations - he could not quite recall when it was – he told Sean Lim

that the first defendants were only sourcing agents and that they would try to source for

the goods the plaintiffs wanted. He told Sean Lim that the first defendants would not be

supplying goods themselves but would be middlemen or intermediaries between the plaintiffs

and sellers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        Philip Loh claimed that the plaintiffs knew or

ought to have known that the first defendants would not enter into any contract with the

plaintiffs and the contract would be between the plaintiffs and the actual supplier of

goods. He then recounted the e-mail exchanges between the parties culminating in the

purchase order from the plaintiffs. He added that he sent the purchase order to the second

defendants and after it was signed by the second defendants below the column

‘confirmed by’ he forwarded the confirmed purchase order to the plaintiffs. He

further claimed that the purchase order thus confirmed by the second defendants ought to

have made the plaintiffs aware that the second defendants were the sellers of the goods to

the plaintiffs and the first defendants were only the intermediaries. Further, according

to him, the second defendants had also given the plaintiffs a proforma invoice dated 23

August 2000 (DB-15).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        According to Philip Loh, unfortunately the

goods were not delivered by the second defendants to the plaintiffs after payment from the

plaintiffs had been received by the second defendants. He disclosed that the first

defendants even made a report to the police on 7 September 2000 casting aspersions on the

plaintiffs’ motives. In the said police report (DB-24/25), the first defendants’

Philip Loh and Simon Tan described the second defendants as their ‘US contact

point’. In the last two sentences of the first paragraph of the report, both Philip

Loh and Simon Tan said: ‘<i>In the meantime we find it highly suspicious the default

of the Malaysian supplier coincided exactly with Trigen (sic) urgency for delivery. We

have refused to pay compensation to Trigen as we think they are in league with the

Malaysian supplier and are trying to make off with the compensation</i>.’</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        As it transpired, the Commercial Affairs

Department of Singapore informed the first defendants on 28 December 2000 that they had

carefully considered the matter and that they were of the view that no criminal offence

had been disclosed (DB-27).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        In cross-examination, Philip Loh reiterated

that he told Sean Lim on 31 July 2000 before the issuance of the purchase order that the

first defendants were a trading company and they would like to source for the plaintiffs

for the items under reference (page 240 of the NE). He was then referred to an e-mail

dated 26 August 2000. The said e-mail reads as follows:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        When questioned by the court (page 280 of the

NE) whether the first defendants had indeed a branch office in the US, he replied in the

negative. When asked why then he used the phrase ‘our branch office in U.S.’ in

his e-mail dated 26 August 2000 addressed to the plaintiffs, his reply was: ‘In this

market, it is common to use counterparts’ branch office to show the close link with

the supplier’ (page 280 of the NE, lines 24-26). He admitted however that his

representation was untrue (page 281 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32

        His answers in cross-examination suggested

(pages 303 and 304 of the NE) that the first defendants were contemplating paying

compensation to the plaintiffs after the police had concluded that there was no criminal

offence. He added that they would have paid the compensation provided there was a second

purchase order from the plaintiffs. The evidence in this respect (pages 303 and 304 of the

NE) reads as follows:</font></p>

        The main issue in this case was whether there

was in fact a contract for sale of goods between the first defendants and the plaintiffs

or whether the contract, if any, was between the plaintiffs and the second defendants, the

first defendants acting only as an intermediary or sourcing agents. The next issue related

to a pleading point. The issue here was whether the plaintiffs in framing a claim against

the second defendants in the alternative, as pleaded in para 5 of the statement of claim,

were prevented from proceeding against the first defendants.</font></p>

        Let me first summarise the first

defendants’ contentions as advanced by their counsel. His submissions as contained in

the concluding part of his closing submission read thus:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        The first defendants’ counsel’s

supplemental submission insofar as was material, was as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Pleading Point:</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) The specific point requiring

    address here is:-</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"whether or not, the

      Plaintiffs are bound by paragraph 5 of the amended statement of claim"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) Paragraph 5 starts off with

    the words:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Alternatively, by a

      contract in writing as evidenced by a proforma Invoice No. 1-2308 from the Second

      Defendants addressed to the Plaintiffs dated the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of August 2000 but

      sent by the First Defendants to the Plaintiffs, the Second Defendants agreed to sell and

      deliver 1920 pieces of computer chips Model: Intel E28F320J5-120 at US$70.00 per piece to

      the Plaintiffs on the following terms .…."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) In essence, this paragraph

    states that it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants who agreed to sell and deliver the goods

    in question.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(4) As it turned out, on the

    special facts in this particular case, what the Plaintiffs had pleaded in paragraph 5 is

    in fact what the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants say are the true facts of the matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(5) It is well established that

    pleadings have a binding effect. The Plaintiffs (and the Defendants) are bound by their

    respective pleadings.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(6) The need for and the very

    purpose of pleadings make it crucial that the rule whereby parties are bound by the

    respective pleadings be adhered to strictly. Otherwise the position would be quite

    chaotic. Parties in a civil case would be at large to wander as they wish and justice

    would not be done.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(9) The nett effect … is

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        The plaintiff’s counsel’s closing

submission in brief was that the plaintiffs, in the first instance entered into a contract

for the supply of goods with the first defendants as vendors. It was further submitted

(see page 32 of plaintiffs’ written submission) that when DB-14 (the purchase order)

was returned by the first defendants to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs had no reason to

doubt that there was in fact a contract between the plaintiffs and the first defendants as

vendors and not otherwise. Plaintiffs’ counsel also highlighted the aspect that

Philip Loh in his e-mail (DB-18) addressed to the plaintiffs, intimated to them that the

first defendants’ branch office in US had found the goods under reference for sale

and their ‘branch office’ were encountering difficulties in answering their

suppliers on account of the delay in payment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37

        In relation to the pleading point, counsel for

the plaintiffs argued that the alternative plea in para 5 of the statement of claim did

not prevent them from seeking judgment against the first defendants. He submitted that the

plaintiffs had made it clear at the commencement of the trial that they were pursuing

their claim only against the first defendants (see page 21, para 3.3 of their written

submission) and so long as the plaintiffs had not entered judgment against the second

defendants, they were not precluded under law from seeking relief and obtaining judgment

against the first defendants.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Conclusion</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        As mentioned by me earlier, there were two main

issues to be decided in this case. The first issue was whether there was in fact a

contract between the plaintiffs and the first defendants for sale by the first defendants

to the plaintiffs, of 1920 pieces of computer chips (marked Intel E28F 320 J5-120) or

whether the first defendants acted purely as sourcing agents or intermediaries between the

second defendants and the plaintiffs in relation to the said sale. The other issue was

whether the plaintiffs’ claim framed in the alternative against the first and second

defendants, barred the plaintiffs from claiming relief against the first defendants in

this action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39

        In determining who is entitled to sue or liable

to be sued on a contract, a useful point as suggested by Diplock LJ (as he then was) where

the contract is in writing, is to look at the contract itself (<i><b>Teheran- Europe Co

Ltd v S T Belton (Tractors), Ltd</b></i> [1968] 2 All ER 886 at 890G). He further said at

page 893B:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    … The task of the court in construing any contract is to look at the words used in

    the contract and at what has passed between the contracting parties before it was made,

    and to determine what it was that the party alleged to be in breach, by the words of the

    contract and his conduct, induced the other party to believe he was accepting a legally

    enforceable obligation to do or to refrain from doing. …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40

        The key document in this case was the purchase

order (DB-13). Dealing with this document, the first defendants’ counsel’s

submission was that the purchase order DB-13 was to be regarded as an offer and that offer

was accepted not by the first defendants but by the second defendants and hence the

contract, if any, was between the plaintiffs and the second defendants and not with the

first defendants. In my determination, having regard to the manner in which the parties

were dealing with each other and the exchange of the e-mails between them, the argument

presented by the defendants’ counsel did not appear to possess much cogency.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41

        Much was spoken by counsel for the first

defendants on the significance of the signature under the confirmation column of the

purchase order (DB-14) by J B Lee of T &amp; M International. In my view, the said

signature - that too inserted without prior consultation or the knowledge of the

plaintiffs – did not in any way alter the character of the contract entered (between

the plaintiffs and the first defendants) where the first defendants were unequivocally

identified and described as the vendors. If the first defendants indeed were the sourcing

agents, then they should have, before they returned the purchase order to the plaintiffs,

pointed out to the latter that their role was merely that of sourcing agents or

intemediaries. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42

        Counsel for the first defendants attempted his

best to argue his clients’ case by characterising them as sourcing agents and

intemediaries between the plaintiffs and the second defendants. But the documents produced

to the court, viewed in their proper perspective did not support his contention. On the

contrary, the first defendants were at all times seen to be projecting themselves all

along as the vendors of the goods. This was evident from the first defendants’ e-mail

dated 11 August 2000 (DB-8) – which commenced with the opening line: ‘We are

pleased to offer as follow. (sic)’ The said e-mail also ended with this line:

‘Kindly let us know your decision soon as our <i>supplier </i>can only hold (sic) for

24 hours (highlight added).’ Again in the first defendants’ e-mail dated 23

August 2000 (DB-11) with a subject heading ‘quotation’, the first defendants

after stating, ‘we are pleased to offer as follow’ (sic), seemed to be

requesting the plaintiffs to forward them the purchase order and T/T documents ‘in

order for [the first defendants] to secure these cargo.’ Similarly, in another e-mail

dated 23 August 2000 (PB-6), the first defendants were seen to be urging the plaintiffs to

issue the purchase order to Sinko – the first defendants - urgently.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43

        Furthermore, the first defendants’

contention that they were only sourcing agents or intemediaries did not seem to cohere

with their representation that the second defendants were their branch office as contained

in the first defendants’ e-mail dated 26 August 2000 (DB-18). When asked by the court

why they chose to describe the second defendants as their branch office, Philip Loh could

only say: ‘In this market, it is common to use counterparts’ branch office to

show the close link with the supplier.’ (page 280 (lines 24-26) and page 281 (lines

8-9) of the NE). In my evaluation, if the first defendants were in fact acting as sourcing

agents or intemediaries, there was no reason for Philip Loh to portray the second

defendants as their branch office in their e-mails.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44

        It would also appear from the evidence of Sean

Lim - which I accepted as cogent and having a persuasive ring to it - that even after the

non-delivery, Philip Loh of the first defendants was trying to assuage the plaintiffs by

saying that the first defendants’ branch office ie, the second defendants could not

meet the agreed delivery deadline and the goods would be delayed to the 5 or 6 of

September 2000. There was no mention even at this stage that the second defendants were

the contracting parties with the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs should look to the

second defendants and not to the first defendants for relief.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45

        Counsel for the first defendants submitted that

since the branch office aspect was not pleaded by the plaintiffs, the court should

disregard any submissions based on it. I found this argument totally disingenuous since

the very assertion that the second defendants were the branch office of the first

defendants was contained in the e-mails sent by the first defendants to the plaintiffs and

these documents were included in the defence bundle (DB-18) and admitted in evidence

without any qualification by the parties. In my opinion, there was no validity in the

argument by the first defendants’ counsel that a litigant cannot rely on an

uncontroverted document to add weight to his claim or cast doubt on the veracity of the

opponent. In the circumstances, the argument so advanced by counsel for the first

defendant ought to fail <i>in limine</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46

        Another unsettling aspect in the first

defendants’ case was that although J B Lee of the second defendants was admittedly in

Singapore on 3 and 4 September 2000 (pages 284 to 285 of the NE), Philip Loh who met J B

Lee did not even arrange for J B Lee to meet with the plaintiffs’ representatives.

This aspect strengthened the plaintiffs’ contention that the first defendants were

treating the second defendants as part of the latter. Furthermore, the first

defendants’ complaint to the police on 7 September 2000 (page 290 of the NE) seemed

to suggest that the first defendants were not mere sourcing agents or intemediaries. If

they were indeed such sourcing agents, they would not have made the complaint in the form

in which it had been made; and they would have in fact required the second defendants to

make the complaint.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47

        Moreover, the report itself contained a passage

which implied that the parties who would be liable to pay compensation were the first

defendants. The passage adverted to reads: ‘We have refused to pay compensation to

Trigen as we think they are in league with the Malaysian supplier and are trying to make

off with the compensation.’ In this regard, Philip Loh let slip in his explanation to

the court (page 300 of the NE, lines 1 to 12) that at that stage they were expecting

another order from the plaintiffs and if such a second order materialised, the first

defendants would have paid the compensation. In my determination, this explanation did not

seem to lend any credence to the first defendant’s stand that they were just sourcing

agents for the goods and at this juncture, I must also observe that I did not find the

evidence of Philip Loh that the first defendants were only sourcing agents or

intemediaries, as worthy of any credit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48

        Having considered all the evidence and

arguments presented in regard to the first issue, my conclusion was that the first

defendants did indeed enter into the agreement bespoken with the plaintiffs in the first

instance, not as a sourcing agents or intemediaries, but on the basis that they were the

contracting party. The first defendants’ subsequent acts in disclosing the name and

identity of their suppliers, ie the second defendant, requiring the plaintiffs to make

payment to the second defendants and making the second defendants sign the purchase order

as a confirming party, did not, in any way, absolve the first defendants of their

liability to the plaintiffs. In my view, even if the first defendants were to be held as

agents, it is a settled principle of law (see para 168, Vol 1(2) <i><b>Halsbury’s

Laws of England</b></i>, 4<sup>th</sup> Edn, reissue) that where a person makes a contract

in his own name without disclosing either the name or the existence of a principal, he is

personally liable on the contract to the other contracting party though he may be in fact

acting on a principal’s behalf. He will continue to be liable even after the

discovery of the agency by the other party unless and until there has been an election by

the other contracting party to look to the principal alone.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The pleading issue</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49

        As regards the second issue ie the pleading

issue raised by the first defendants in relation to para five of the statement of claim

which was framed in the alternative and the plaintiffs’ prayers for reliefs in the

alternative, plaintiffs’ counsel was on record from the outset that the plaintiffs

were not intent on applying for judgment against the second defendants and that the

inclusion of the second defendants in the statement of claim was merely to set out both

defendants’ respective liabilities. The plaintiffs’ counsel also made it clear

that the present hearing was directed only against the first defendants and that the

plaintiffs had not availed themselves of the opportunity to enter interlocutory judgment

against the second defendants, although they could have done so much earlier. In my view,

inasmuch as the plaintiffs had not so far elected to obtain judgment against the second

defendants, they were not precluded from praying for judgment against the first

defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50

        In the case before me, the first defendants

claiming to be the suppliers of goods and later projecting the second defendants as their

branch office were in a position akin to persons acting on behalf of undisclosed

principals. The liability of such agents came for discussion before the English Court of

Appeal in <i><b>Clarkson, Booker Ltd v Andjel</b></i> [1964] 3 All ER 260. The facts of

the case as appear in the headnotes of the case are as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51

        Acting on behalf of his undisclosed principals,

an agent (the defendant) for a travel agency company, contracting as if he were principal,

booked flights from Athens to London with the plaintiffs and received credit from them for

the tickets, having previously done business with them on credit terms. The

plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote letters to both the defendant and the company stating

that failing payment, proceedings for recovery from the recipient of the letter might be

commenced. They subsequently wrote further to the travel agency company stating that they

had instructions to obtain judgment against the company ‘to safeguard [the

plaintiffs’] interests’, and subsequently they issued and served a writ against

the company. Being later informed that the company was insolvent and was going into

voluntary liquidation, the plaintiffs did not proceed with the action, but brought an

action against the defendant. The defendant contended that there had been a binding

election by the plaintiffs to pursue their remedy against the principals, the company.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52

        Affirming the decision of the court below, the

Court of Appeal held that although the commencement of proceedings by the plaintiffs

against the principals was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of election, the issue of the writ

against them was not necessarily an abandonment of the plaintiffs’ cause of action

against the defendant, the agent; and, on the facts in the present case, there had not

been any final election by the plaintiffs to rely on the liability of the company in

exoneration of the defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53

        It was further held in that case (per curiam)

if judgment had been obtained by the plaintiffs against the principals, the cause of

action would have merged in the judgment and the plaintiffs could not subsequently have

recovered against the defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54

        It would appear from the views expressed in <i><b>Clarkson

Booker Ltd</b></i> that election had to be unequivocal and final election would not take

place until the party had obtained judgment against one party. I am also of the same

opinion and in the premises, the argument by the first defendants’ counsel that the

plaintiffs were estopped from proceeding against the first defendants as a result of para

five of the statement of claim and the attendant prayers for relief in the alternative,

was in my determination, ill-founded.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55

        There was one other detail which ought to be

mentioned at this stage. The plaintiffs’ claim was for the refund of the amount paid

for the goods, ie US$134,400 under prayer 1 and a further sum of US$15,360 under prayer 2

of the statement of claim against the first defendants. There was no dispute raised as to

the figures stated by the parties and the evidence of the plaintiffs’ witnesses, in

this connection, stood uncontroverted.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56

        Following the principles articulated by Chua J

in <i><b>Bulsing Ltd v Joon Seng &amp; Co</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=834&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1972] 2 MLJ 43</a>, that the general rule

in the case of breach of contract is that the plaintiffs by way of damages are entitled to

be put in the same position as he would have been if the contract had been completed, I

awarded judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of US$134,4000 under prayer 1 and a further

sum of US$15,360 under prayer 2 of the statement of claim against the first defendants

together with interests thereon at the rate of 6% per annum on the said sums from the date

of writ until judgment, and costs to be taxed, if not agreed upon.</font></p>
