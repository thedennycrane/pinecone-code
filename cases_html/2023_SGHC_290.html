Mr Salgaocar passed away intestate on 1 January 2016 and Mdm Lakshmi has continued the action as sole administratrix of the Estate. The assets that are the subject of S 821 fall within a larger group of the Estate’s assets referred to as “the Non-India Assets”.

Disputes arose between Ms Purnima and Mdm Lakshmi, including about the amount of information the former was given about the Estate’s assets.

</div> 2SA is the agreement relevant to this matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Broadly, the bargain struck in 2SA was that, in return for Mdm Lakshmi providing certain accounts in relation to certain assets and making certain payments, Ms Purnima would not commence further litigation against the Estate until the final determination of S 821 (and any appeal arising therefrom).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I start by elaborating on the obligation concerning the provision of accounts. Under cl 7 of 2SA, Mdm Lakshmi was obliged to provide an account of the Non-India Assets for the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 (the “Accounts”). These Accounts were to be drawn up by an independent and qualified accountant, and placed at the office of one Mr Gurbachan Singh of GSM Law LLP (“Mr Singh”) by 1 December 2021. Ms Purnima was entitled to inspect the Accounts with advance notice given but was not to take photos, video, or audio recordings of any material and/or information during the inspection. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Ms Purnima alleges that Mdm Lakshmi breached cl 7. First, the Accounts were not provided on 1 December 2021, even though cl 7 specifies this deadline and cl 20 of 2SA stipulates that “[t]ime shall be of the essence in the performance of this Agreement”.

Instead, it was a thin report by an accountant which purported to set out valuations of the Non-India Assets, excluding the assets which are the subject of S 821, on two dates, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2020. Ms Purnima’s grievance was not that the report should have included the assets which are the subject of S 821. Rather, even for the other Non-India Assets, the report did not contain any information on Mdm Lakshmi’s dealings with them between 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2020. I will say more about this contention later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Accordingly, on 27 April 2022, Ms Purnima filed HCF/OSP 6/2022 (“OSP 6”) in the Family Justice Courts under r 786 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 principally seeking the Accounts but also other ancillary orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Instead of filing an affidavit in reply to OSP 6, Mdm Lakshmi filed this action on 18 May 2022, alleging that by filing OSP 6, Ms Purnima herself was in breach of 2SA. Mdm Lakshmi contends that, by operation of cll 11 and 18 of 2SA, Ms Purnima was precluded from commencing any action, other than an action for breach or enforcement of 2SA, until S 821 was finally determined.

The AD considered cll 11 and 18 to be poorly drafted and inconsistent. The AD resolved this inconsistency by holding that cl 11 prevails over cl 18 such that Ms Purnima could commence OSP 6 even if it does not come within cl 18. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The AD then expressed “the view that, if [Mdm Lakshmi] has breached cl 7, [Ms Purnima] is not precluded from commencing OSP 6”: <span class="font-italic">Purnima Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar (AD)</span> at [44]. The AD reasoned that OSP 6 relates to matters in cl 11, which prevails over cl 18, and Ms Purnima is, accordingly, not precluded from commencing OSP 6 if Mdm Lakshmi had breached cl 7.

Ms Purnima complains that the Accounts had not been provided, a complaint that raises two issues: the first concerning the Accounts not being provided on time, and the second concerning whether what was eventually provided for inspection fulfilled the obligation to provide an account. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Delay </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 2SA was entered into on 27 May 2021, a clear six months before the date stipulated in cl 7, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 1 December 2021.

</div>
</div> There was thus no waiver of the delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Notwithstanding, if Mdm Lakshmi had provided a compliant account late, then it would be difficult for Ms Purnima to contend that the proviso to cl 11, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, full compliance with the terms of 2SA, had not been met (albeit late). If so, Ms Purnima would remain bound by the obligations in cl 11, including the obligation not to commence further litigation in relation to the Non-India Assets. It is significant that the proviso adopts the language of <span class="font-italic">compliance</span> rather than the <span class="font-italic">absence of breach</span>, which suggests that the parties’ concern was with substantive compliance, even if late. In my view, once a compliant account is provided, the terms of 2SA would properly be said to have been “fully complied with” by Mdm Lakshmi notwithstanding that there had been a breach of the temporal requirements for performance. This does not mean that the breach would be cured, as potentially there might be loss suffered by Ms Purnima arising from the delay, only that the proviso would have been fulfilled by the later provision of the account. In this context, it is worth recalling that both parties have affirmed 2SA, and neither sought to terminate 2SA for the other’s alleged breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Thus, I now turn to the issue whether what was provided late was indeed the account required by cl 7. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Nature and quality of the Accounts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Clause 7 required Mdm Lakshmi to, among other things, “procure and provide an account of the Estate’s Non-India Assets for the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 to be drawn up by an independent and qualified accountant”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my view, such an account must include an account of the movements in the covered assets during that period. It should include debits and credits in respect of funds held by the Estate. It is accepted that this was not provided and that instead what was provided were values against the assets at the beginning and end of the period. Such a limited exercise does not fit with the reference in the clause to an independent and qualified accountant, a professional whose expertise would be needed for the drawing up of accounts showing debits and credits and the movements of assets. Valuing two static lists of assets would not necessarily require an accountant’s assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Much of the argument concerned whether cl 7 substituted by agreement a more limited form of account than what is required of the administrator of an estate. It has been aptly stated in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span><span class="font-italic">Laws of Singapore – Probate, Administration and Succession</span> <span class="font-italic">Vol 15</span> at para 190.102 that such accounts should show “the monies and assets received by the personal representative and how he had dealt with these monies and assets”. It is of course true that where an estate owns shares in a company, the account to be given is of those shares and not the underlying accounts of the company <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. However, as an aside, a personal representative may have, by virtue of the estate’s shareholding in the company, possession of such documents including financial statements that the company provides to shareholders and such documents would potentially be trust documents that a beneficiary would be entitled to inspect or otherwise would be amenable to discovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, cl 7 has to be interpreted in its own terms. That is what I did at [30] above. Clause 7 adopted the general language of “an account” and did not impose any limitation on this, whether to balance sheets as of specific dates or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 To any submission that there would be no benefit for Mdm Lakshmi to remain obligated to provide an account that in substance was the same as what she had to provide as an administratrix while making payments to Ms Purnima, the short answer is that cl 11, subject to its proviso, precludes, pending final determination of S 821, much more than just administration actions for accounts. It precludes any further litigation against the Estate, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, for distribution, for breaches by the administratrix, or indeed litigation against other beneficiaries, a category which included Mdm Lakshmi, herself. Thus, on the face of 2SA, there are other contemplated benefits for Mdm Lakshmi and accordingly, this argument is not a good reason to read cl 7 of 2SA restrictively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Moreover, when questioned at trial about this exercise of providing an account, Mdm Lakshmi confirmed that her understanding of cl 7 was that it required an account such as an estate’s administratrix should keep and provide to beneficiaries.

</div> The significance of this evidence is that this is not a case where the ability of an administratrix to provide a full account is in question such that allowances should be made in assessing the sufficiency of an account that is given.

</div> The Rejoinder to para 16(c)(vi) of the Reply expressly averred at sub-paras (14), (17), and (18) that what was provided late did not comply with cl 7 of 2SA. However, this objection is misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Ms Purnima pleaded in her Defence at para 16(c)(ii) that “[i]n breach of Clause 7 of [2SA], [Mdm Lakshmi] failed to provide an account of the Non-India Assets of the Estate on 1 December 2021”. Thus, Ms Purnima had put in issue the failure to provide the Accounts by the stipulated date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Logically, it was then for Mdm Lakshmi to plead that she complied with cl 7 of 2SA after the stipulated date, such that cl 7 was subsequently “fully complied with”. Mdm Lakshmi duly did so by pleading that inspection of the Accounts was arranged for and took place on two subsequent dates, allegedly without complaint on Ms Purnima’s part until 28 March 2022. Ms Purnima’s Rejoinder then responded to the Reply’s assertion of late compliance by asserting that what came late was not sufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I am accordingly satisfied that the sufficiency of the Accounts was in issue and Ms Purnima is entitled to raise it as part of her contention that the proviso to cl 11 of 2SA was not fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I should deal specifically with two contentions of Mdm Lakshmi’s counsel directly.

The question of the sufficiency of the account may be dealt with by the witnesses recalling what its nature is and in broad terms the nature does not even seem to be in dispute. I do not consider the other categories to be material to the issues in dispute. In my view, the proper and proportionate approach to this dispute is to consider Clauses 7 and 11 in the context of the factual matrix as known to both parties and then consider whether providing lists of assets at the start and end of the period stated in Clause 7 was broadly sufficient at this stage of the estate’s administration in the light of the ongoing Suit 821. I have read the pleadings and the issues are very limited. Indeed, permitted scope and time for cross-examination of the witnesses is likely to be short. I keep front and centre the Ideals of ROC 2021. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Following the trial of this matter, I have answered the question I posed at the time of the discovery appeal, namely whether providing lists of assets at the start and end of the period stated in cl 7 was broadly sufficient at this stage of the estate’s administration in the light of the ongoing S 821, in the negative. It was not sufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The second contention is that Ms Purnima had not called Mr Masood or any expert evidence on the nature of the accounts required under 2SA.
