An additional 400,000 shares in the third defendant were also issued, which were never offered to the plaintiff, and both of these actions were in breach of the third defendant’s articles of association. Further, the first and second defendants, as directors of the third defendant, chose to pay a large amount of directors’ remuneration for the financial year 2012 without the concurrent declaration of any dividends, thus preferring the directors’ interests at the expense of shareholders. The court found that there had been a breach of the plaintiff’s legal rights under the articles. In an oral judgment dated 3 December 2015 (<span class="font-italic">Seaquest (GD) </span>at [1]),

We do not expect these vendors to be required to retain records which would be relevant to the Four Invoices (i.e. sales to Exquisite/Agile on or before 23 November 2015), as it has been more than 7 years since the relevant transactions. In addition, more recent transactions will be less relevant, and we consequently have used them only where necessary.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Basis for the court’s intervention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Original Valuation was to be made in relation to s 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Companies Act (see [12] and [26] above). Ramesh J’s further order of 13 February 2020 was made pursuant to the original judgment. The plaintiff’s current application was made pursuant to para 1(b) of the order of 13 February 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Neither para 1(b) nor any other part of Ramesh J’s order of 13 February 2020 required any information made available by the third defendant to KPMG to be disclosed to the plaintiff. It merely stated that no such information shall be disclosed to the plaintiff unless otherwise directed by the court. In that regard, I did not see how the plaintiff can rely on this paragraph alone (and no such submission was made) as grounds that she should be entitled to disclosure of the Four Invoices without also asking the court to exercise its powers to intervene and grant such disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Feen, </span><span class="font-italic">Bjornar and others v Viking Engineering Pte Ltd and another appeal and another matter</span> [2021] 1 SLR 497 (“<span class="font-italic">Feen</span>”) confirmed at [21] that, in cases where there was a court order for the buyout of shares at a price to be valued, even though the appointment of the independent valuer was made by the parties, there remains a basis for judicial intervention derived from s 216(2) of the Companies Act (so the basis of the court’s powers in this regard did not derive solely from the parties’ contractual bargain). The facts of <span class="font-italic">Feen</span> bear resemblance to the current case, so it was worth exploring them in brief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 <span class="font-italic">Feen</span> was a case where the respondent, Viking Engineering, had succeeded in its minority oppression action brought against the appellants, one of whom was Mr Feen. The court below had ordered Mr Feen to purchase Viking Engineering’s shares in a joint venture company at a price to be determined by an independent valuer (<span class="font-italic">Feen </span>at [3]–[5]). An expert valuer, one Mr Hayler, was jointly appointed by the parties to conduct the valuation. The appellants in <span class="font-italic">Feen </span>contended that Mr Hayler had materially departed from his instructions when preparing his expert report, and that his valuation was in manifest error (<span class="font-italic">Feen </span>at [2]). The appellants thus sought an order to set aside the expert valuation. The appellants’ complaints against Mr Hayler’s valuation were discussed by the Court of Appeal at [26]–[31] of <span class="font-italic">Feen</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 First, the appellants contended that Mr Hayler had relied on assumptions to arrive at his valuation, and that this was inconsistent with certain paragraphs of the court’s buyout order. The Court of Appeal found that Mr Hayler’s mandate was to have regard to such financial information as was necessary for him to carry out the valuation and the buyout order did not stipulate what specific information he was to have regard to. The determination of what financial information was necessary for the valuation was a matter entirely within Mr Hayler’s discretion (<span class="font-italic">Feen </span>at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Second, the appellants submitted that Mr Hayler materially departed from his instructions when he relied on assumptions to adjust the valuation to account for the business that a party had diverted from the joint venture company. The Court of Appeal noted that Mr Hayler had stated that he was not able to identify “the exact dates, amounts, and the entities involved” in relation to the business diverted from the company, and further that the buyout order did not require Mr Hayler to have regard to the “actual value” of business diverted. The buyout order gave Mr Hayler a wide discretion to make the necessary adjustments when carrying out the valuation, and Mr Hayler did not exceed his terms of reference (<span class="font-italic">Feen </span>at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Third, the appellants had complained that Mr Hayler had allegedly failed to take into account certain information in his assessment of the business that a party had diverted from the joint venture company. Some of this information had been raised by the appellants to Mr Hayler by way of a letter dated 7 September 2018, which was before the valuation report was finalised by Mr Hayler on 2 November 2018 (<span class="font-italic">Feen </span>at [6]). The Court of Appeal found that Mr Hayler had properly considered the appellants’ submissions in their 7 September letter. In Mr Hayler’s valuation report, he addressed the appellants’ key arguments in the letter and had considered the relevant evidence before him (<span class="font-italic">Feen </span>at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Importantly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Feen</span> at [22] and [23] decided that where a buyout order from the court did not provide for an independent valuation to be final and binding and where the parties had appointed the independent valuer by consent, the principles applicable to challenging an expert’s determination before a court ought to apply by analogy. In the Court of Appeal’s view, these principles had been set out by the court in <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 385 (“<span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance </span>at [47], the court had opined that a long line of authorities supported the proposition that “short of fraud, corruption, collusion, dishonesty, bad faith, bias or the like, the only two main grounds on which this court can set aside [an independent adjudicator’s] determination are as follows: (a) where the [independent adjudicator] materially departed from his instructions; or (b) where there is a manifest error in his determination that justly requires judicial intervention”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Court of Appeal also made the following comments at [23] of <span class="font-italic">Feen </span>when discussing the principles in <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … The court can intervene if the valuation is not in accordance with the terms of reference, or if the valuation is patently or manifestly in error. However, the court will be slow to find that the valuation is in error, since by delegating the task of valuation to an expert, the court has taken the position that the matter is best left to the expert … That the court should not readily overturn court-ordered valuations also promotes the public interest in the finality of litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Feen</span> made reference to how the valuation exercise by an independent valuer should, by analogy, be considered to be akin to an expert determination (see [53] above). In that regard, the decision by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann Development Pte Ltd v Takashimaya Singapore Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 627 (“<span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann</span>”) was also relevant. In <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann</span>, the Court of Appeal laid out the principles that would apply in a situation “where the court’s involvement is sought <span class="font-italic">before</span> the expert has made his determination” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann </span>at [41]). The Court of Appeal explicitly noted at [41]–[42] that <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span> and related cases set out the principles that apply where the court was invited to intervene <span class="font-italic">after </span>an expert’s determination had been rendered. This suggests that <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann</span> is part of the same line of case law as <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance </span>relating to the principles undergirding curial intervention in the work of experts. Since the <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance </span>principles on <span class="font-italic">post-valuation </span>interventions were held to be applicable in the context of a s 216(2) Companies Act share valuation, the <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann </span>principles on <span class="font-italic">pre-valuation </span>interventions applied similarly by analogy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann</span> at [43] opined that Hoffmann LJ in <span class="font-italic">Mercury Communications Ltd v The Director General of Telecommunications</span> [1994] CLC 1125 (“<span class="font-italic">Mercury Communications</span>”) had “set out a useful statement of principle” on the permissible scope of curial intervention. The Court of Appeal went on at [44] to cite the relevant passage from Hoffmann LJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Mercury Communications </span>at 1139–1140. For present purposes, the relevant portion of Hoffmann LJ’s decision is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the other hand, even in cases in which the parties have agreed principles of valuation, their application may involve questions of judgment which they have left to the decision of the accountants. In the last example, the question of what counts as ‘net profits’ may be something on which different accountants could hold different views. Here again, as a matter of substantive law, the court will not interfere. As a matter of contract, the parties have agreed that ‘net profits’ are to be whatever the accountants honestly consider them to be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">So in questions in which the parties have entrusted the power of decision to a valuer or other decision-maker, the courts will not interfere either before or after the decision.</span> This is because the court’s views about the right answer to the question are irrelevant. On the other hand, <span class="font-italic">the court will intervene if the decision-maker has gone outside the limits of his decision-making authority</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in <span class="font-italic">italics</span> added by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann</span>]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Court of Appeal’s endorsement of Hoffmann LJ’s statement of principle ties in well with the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>at [23] of <span class="font-italic">Feen</span>, which has been extracted above at [54]. Both <span class="font-italic">before </span>and <span class="font-italic">after </span>an expert’s valuation has been completed, the professional competence of the expert still, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>level, deserves respect from the parties and from the court. By delegating the task of valuation to an expert, the court and, where the parties have consented to the appointment of that expert, those parties too, take the position that the matter is best left to the expert. A cautious attitude towards interfering in or overturning court-ordered valuations would promote the public interest in minimising unnecessary litigation by allowing the experts to do their work, bar extraordinary circumstances such as fraud, manifest error, or an excess of jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is the Court’s intervention justified in this case?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The RPT Review was derived from the Original Valuation where KPMG was appointed to carry out the valuation of the plaintiff’s shares in the third defendant following the original trial of HC/S 170/2014. Neither the court order for the Original Valuation nor the court order for the RPT Review provided that the respective valuations were to be final and binding. Pursuant to para 2 of Leow JC’s 3 December 2015 oral judgment, KPMG was appointed by the parties for the Original Valuation on an agreed basis.

</div> Even though an additional court order was required to finalise the scope of KPMG’s work for the RPT Review (see [17] above), this focused on specific issues in KPMG’s Engagement Letter which could not be considered fundamental, and so did not detract from the parties’ agreement to KPMG’s engagement. In this regard, I noted that in HC/SUM 2735/2019, under prayer 3 (which was granted by the court), the plaintiff had in fact specifically prayed for <span class="font-italic">KPMG’s</span> scope of work in performing the Original Valuation to be expanded to include the RPT Review. Evidently, the plaintiff had considered KPMG’s professional expertise to be useful in conducting the RPT Review. I further noted that the first defendant, in his affidavit filed to resist the present summons, had annexed a copy of the finalised engagement terms, bearing the signatures of the first and second defendants, for KPMG to carry out the RPT Review.

KPMG knew that these invoices were from identified third parties (Staco, Sungmi and Morgan Technical Ceramics) who were suppliers to Exquisite, but chose not to contact them. That was a decision that KPMG made as forensic investigators. Crucially, it bears mention that KPMG had the benefit of considering the plaintiff’s solicitors’ 7 June 2023 e-mail stating the plaintiff’s suggestion, with accompanying reasons, that the said suppliers should be contacted by KPMG,

</div> and conveying that the plaintiff could help put KMPG in touch with the suppliers if needed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 KPMG’s e-mail of 26 June 2023 to the plaintiff made it clear that KPMG did not expect that these vendors would have kept records dating so far back and that more recent pricing was less relevant to the RPT Review. KPMG therefore did not find it useful to seek any blanket confirmation of prices relevant at the time of the RPTs. The situation that I had before me bore some resemblance with the situation in <span class="font-italic">Feen </span>(see [52] above), where the Court of Appeal noted that the valuer in that case had properly considered submissions made by one of the parties via letter before finalising his valuation report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Following the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Feen</span> (at [23]), I was slow to find error on KPMG’s part as the court had delegated the task of forensic investigation in this instance to them as experts and their decisions should not be readily overturned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In a similar vein, as <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann</span>, where an expert was acting within the parameters of his terms of reference, I also avoided interfering with the expert’s judgment in how it made its valuation decision. KPMG had been appointed as independent experts in a detailed forensic exercise in connection with the RPT Review. So long as they acted within their terms of reference, they should be allowed to carry out their work independently and without interference from the parties or the courts. The decision not to pursue further queries with Exquisite’s vendors (Staco, Sungmi and Morgan Technical Ceramics) was a judgment call that KPMG was allowed to make under their terms of reference (see at paragraph [62]) and the court should not question this decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 There is a final point to be made to close the discussion on the Data Loss Incidents (see [41]–[42] above). Even if the plaintiff had made a fair case that any additional information or inputs she could provide might be relevant to KPMG in the RPT Review, KPMG’s e-mail of 26 June 2023 showed that KPMG, in not inviting further information from the plaintiff, had weighed the potential for additional useful insights that could be gleaned from further investigations, against the insights and conclusions that could already be arrived at using the available information, and came to the conclusion that the RPT Final Report could stand ready. Again, this was a judgment call that KPMG should be allowed to make without interference from the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For these reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For completeness, while my decision to dismiss the application did not turn on these issues, I briefly address some of the other points raised in arguments by counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendants raised the concern that the plaintiff’s attempt to obtain the Four Invoices was an indirect way to obtain the third defendant’s confidential and proprietary pricing information (see [21(b)] above). There had been a specific order by Ramesh J that information made available by the third defendant to KPMG was not to be disclosed to the plaintiffs by KPMG without the court’s sanction for this specific reason. This was acknowledged by the plaintiff and the plaintiff conceded that it would be willing to review the Four Invoices with any confidential and proprietary information redacted. The plaintiff however doubted if pricing information that was seven or eight years out of date would retain any commercial sensitivity. It would have been open to me to review and order the redaction of any sensitive information on the Four Invoices if the plaintiff had succeeded in its application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The defendants also contended that this application was the latest in a long line of applications that had delayed the Original Valuation (see [21(a)] above). This was not a consideration relevant to my decision to dismiss this application, as the fact that there were earlier applications by the plaintiff does not, in this case, detract from the merits of other applications.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It has been more than seven years since KPMG was first appointed as independent valuers (albeit a shorter period of time had been spent on the RPT Review) and eight years since the conclusion of the trial in HC/S 170/2014. $440,000 has been spent on the RPT Review alone – almost ten times the original cost estimate ($45,000) of the entire valuation exercise.

Bearing in mind the frustration caused by the lack of documentation for the RPT Review occasioned by the Data Loss Incidents and bearing in mind that the RPT Review itself has been ongoing for a comparatively short period of time (compared to the Original Valuation), I was of the view that the plaintiff was not on the wrong side of the line of good faith when she made this application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Wong Li Kok, Alex<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Derek Kang Yu Hsien and Ashok Kumar Rai (Cairnhill Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lakshanthi Kumari Fernando, Tan Wei Ming and Os Agarwal (Holborn Law LLC) for the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
