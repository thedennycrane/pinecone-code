The essence of the case is this. The plaintiffs are very wealthy individuals. The defendants are experienced asset managers. The plaintiffs and defendants were family friends who agreed to embark on a venture together to grow the plaintiffs’ wealth for mutual profit. The plaintiffs provided the capital and the defendants provided the financial expertise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The parties’ relationship soured. In April 2012, the plaintiffs brought this action to compel the defendants to account for their dealings with the plaintiffs’ assets and to return those assets. The defendants brought a counterclaim for management fees and related expenses incurred in managing and administering the plaintiffs’ investments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the liability phase of this action, I allowed the plaintiffs’ claim and dismissed the bulk of the defendants’ counterclaim. The defendants appealed my judgment, but only to their counterclaim for management fees and related expenses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Court of Appeal dismissed the bulk of the defendants’ appeal.  The Court of Appeal did, however, award the defendants A$2m on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> for a particular project known as Project Plaza. The Court of Appeal left undisturbed the remainder of my findings dismissing the defendants’ counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The parties now appear before me in the second phase of this action, the purpose of which is for the defendants to render the account which was ordered in the liability phase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The accounting phase of this dispute comprises two judgments. This is because I had to deal with a preliminary issue. The preliminary issue was whether the defendants are precluded from asserting in the accounting phase that there was an overarching agreement for the plaintiffs to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the defendants in managing and administering the plaintiffs’ investments. I took the view that the defendants were precluded from arguing that issue again. I gave oral judgment accordingly before the evidential hearings in the accounting phase began. The defendants have appealed against that decision. The grounds of my decision on that preliminary issue is the subject matter of <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others </span>[2018] SGHC 130 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span><span class="font-italic"> (Res Judicata)</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After receiving evidence in the accounting phase, I reserved judgment on the merits of the account. This judgment now deals with those merits, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the taking of the account on the wilful default basis which the defendants were ordered to render in the liability phase. The plaintiffs assert that the account, properly taken on the wilful default basis, establishes that the defendants must pay the plaintiffs a sum of just over US$12m (excluding interest).

</div>
</div> The plaintiffs arrive at that figure by falsifying certain disbursements made by the defendants as being unauthorised use of trust monies and surcharging the account for monies that they say should be credited to the <span class="font-italic">corpus</span> of the trust. Additionally, the plaintiffs also claim that certain monies received by the defendants as trustees were secret commissions which properly belong to the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 After hearing parties’ submissions, I now hold substantially in favour of the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The facts have been set out in detail in the first instance and appellate judgments in the liability phase: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2015] SGHC 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (HC)</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal</span> [2016] 4 SLR 728. The facts have also been summarised in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (Res Judicata).</span> I will not repeat the facts in detail or in brief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Consistently with those judgments, I use “the Wees” to refer to the plaintiffs and “the Engs” to refer to the defendants. Where it is necessary to identify a party individually, I use “WBK” to mean the second plaintiff, “WBT” to mean the third plaintiff”, “ECS” to mean the first defendant, “SL” to mean the second defendant, and “CSP” to mean the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Characterisation of the parties’ relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The proper characterisation of the parties’ relationship is essential to understanding the duties which the Engs owe to the Wees. To this end, I summarise my findings in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I found that the Engs were trustees of the Wees’ monies under a presumed resulting trust (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (</span><span class="font-italic">HC</span>) at [32]–[36]). This is because the Engs had been given the Wees’ monies to invest, but the Wees had no intention to make the Engs the beneficial owners of those monies. Alternatively, I was also prepared to find that the Engs became the legal owners of the property which the Wees wished to invest in through them in the Engs’ sole capacity as agents for the Wees. However, that was only an <span class="font-italic">alternative</span> finding, that I <span class="font-italic">would have</span> made, had I not already found that the Engs were presumed resulting trustees (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (</span><span class="font-italic">HC</span>) at [32] and [36]). This judgment proceeds on my primary finding in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (</span><span class="font-italic">HC</span>). The analysis that follows is therefore on the basis that the Engs are presumed resulting trustees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Additionally, I also found that the Engs owed fiduciary duties to the Wees (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (</span><span class="font-italic">HC</span>) at [32] and [35]). The reason for this was that they had used the Wees’ monies to make investments on the Wees’ behalf, and had managed and administered those investments. That relationship gave rise to the incidents of a fiduciary relationship, and thus the Engs properly bear fiduciary consequences for their acts and omissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Engs did not appeal against my finding that the Engs were presumed resulting trustees and fiduciaries (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (</span><span class="font-italic">HC</span>) at [29]). Those findings are, therefore, unaffected by the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoon</span><span class="font-italic">g (CA)</span>. Those findings therefore stand. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I briefly set out the parties’ arguments here as a preliminary indication of the issues in contention. I will set out the parties’ arguments more comprehensively when I deal in turn with each issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Wees’ claim is essentially that an account on the wilful default basis shows that the Engs owe the Wees just over US$12m, excluding interest. The Wees argue that certain items in the Engs’ account should be falsified. They also argue that the Engs’ account should be surcharged with certain other items.

</div> As such, all evidence given in the liability phase remains available to me now in the accounting phase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The significance of this observation is as follows. The Wees filed affidavits of evidence in chief for the liability phase of this action. They were cross-examined at length on those affidavits in the liability phase. They also filed affidavits of evidence in chief for the accounting phase of this action. However, they elected not to be cross-examined in the accounting phase on these latter affidavits of evidence in chief. The consequence is that the contents of these latter affidavits of evidence in chief are not in evidence before me. But the Engs ask me to go further and invite me to draw an adverse inference against the Wees for refusing to be cross-examined on the latter set of affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I decline to draw an adverse inference against the Wees for the following reasons. On matters on which the Engs bear the burden of proof in the accounting phase, they must discharge their burden by adducing positive evidence as part of their own case in chief. They cannot discharge that burden by pointing to an absence of evidence from the Wees. That amounts, in effect, to an impermissible attempt to reverse the burden of proof.  On these matters, an adverse inference cannot assist the Wees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Even on matters for which the Wees bear the burden of proof in the accounting phase, the only persons who are in a position to give direct evidence on many of those matters – as mandated by s 61 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) – are the Engs and not the Wees. Only the Engs can give direct evidence as to much of their dealings with the Wees’ monies and assets. Only the Engs can give direct evidence as to how they came to incur many of the disputed expenses. Hence, the failure of the Wees to be cross-examined in the accounting phase of this action on aspects of the Wees’ case on which they cannot give direct evidence does not justify an adverse inference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Finally, to the extent that there remain some matters in the accounting phase on which the Wees bear the burden of proof and on which the Wees <span class="font-italic">can</span> give direct evidence, their evidence in the liability phase on those matters remains available as evidence in the accounting phase. That suffices to discharge any evidential burden and also to prevent it being said that any assertion of fact by the Engs in the accounting phase has been left uncontradicted by the Wees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On any view, therefore, an adverse inference is either inappropriate or of no assistance to the Engs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Role of experts in the accounting phase</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 My second observation concerns the expert evidence given in the accounting phase. Both parties engaged and adduced expert evidence from forensic accountants. The accountants have expressed views on whether an expense was incurred, in the sense that money was actually paid out; whether that money was paid out for a valid reason, in the sense that it was connected either directly or indirectly to the Wees’ investments; and whether the expense claimed was reasonable in amount. They have even expressed views on whether a disputed expense should be allowed or disallowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In expressing these views, both experts have ventured beyond the remit of an expert. These issues are not matters of accounting practice but issues of fact or law which the court has to decide. Both experts have also regrettably shown themselves too ready to adopt the views of the party who engaged them as to whether a disputed expense should be allowed or disallowed.

</div>
</div> In other words, the experts were wrong to express a view on an issue of fact or an issue of law and were even more wrong in being too ready to adopt a view that was not their own. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This is impermissible on several levels. First, it is impermissible because the question whether any specific expense should be allowed or disallowed when taking an account on a wilful default basis in equity is outside the realm of a forensic accountant’s expertise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Second, and flowing from the first, expressing a view on this issue essentially contravenes the ultimate issue rule. That rule prohibits an expert from giving his opinion on the very issue which the court has to decide. While the rule has lost some force today, especially in civil cases, it remains live. On this point, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Eu Lim Hoklai v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 167 at [44] bear repeating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ultimately, all questions – whether of law or of fact – placed before a court are intended to be adjudicated and decided by a judge and not by experts. An expert or scientific witness is there only to assist the court in arriving at its decision; he or she is not there to arrogate the court’s functions to himself or herself...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Third, the expert’s duty to the court is to express his own <span class="font-italic">independent</span> view and not merely to adopt the views of the party engaging him. This is made explicit by O 40A r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), which provides that an expert’s duty is to “assist the Court on matters within his expertise” and that this duty to the Court “overrides any obligation to the person from whom he has received instructions or by whom he is paid”. Experts do not assist the court on matters within their expertise by merely adopting their client’s view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I therefore wish to make clear that both experts’ views carried no weight with me insofar as the expert was stating an assertion of fact or a conclusion of law. The former is not evidence of opinion. The latter is for the Court to decide. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I now address the issues in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: The overarching agreement issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The gist of the Engs’ argument on the overarching agreement issue is that the Wees and the Engs agreed that the Wees would bear all expenses which the Engs incurred in managing the Wees’ investments including all of CSP’s operating expenses. My decision, briefly summarised, is that there was no such overarching agreement. As this forms the subject of my grounds of decision in<span class="font-italic"> Cheong Soh Chin (Res Judicata)</span>, I need say no more here.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The specific agreements issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Engs’ alternative argument is that each of the contemporaneous documents they cite in support of the overarching agreement nevertheless suffices to constitute a specific agreement as to a particular expense.

</div>
</div> This argument is made in two ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The first way is as follows. The Wees conceded in the liability phase that they did reach specific agreements with the Engs which bound the Wees to pay certain expenses to the Engs. The Engs now argue that the correspondence and documents which they now cite as establishing a specific agreement are essentially equivalent in nature, or meet the same threshold, as those specific agreements conceded in the liability phase.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I hold that there were no specific agreements between the parties that the Wees would bear particular expenses. The reason for this is that the Engs are in fact precluded from arguing that additional specific agreements exist apart from those which I have found to exist in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span>. To recapitulate, I held in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>that the parties had approached the overall WWW Concept as joint risk runners, which was inconsistent with the argument advanced by the Engs then (and now) that there was an overarching agreement. Additionally, I specifically held that the existence of any overarching agreement is contradicted by the evidence that shows that the parties had entered into specific agreements from time to time for particular expenses on Project Plaza (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>at [99]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The fact that I found only certain specific agreements to exist implies that I rejected all other specific agreements. Because this issue of specific agreements has been raised and considered in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (HC)</span>, or ought to have been raised and considered there, the Engs cannot re-open the issue now.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The above analysis suffices to dispose of this issue. I am also of the view that each argument now advanced by the Engs fails in any event. The first argument on apparent equivalence fails because the standard which the Engs are comparing their documents against, namely, the specific agreements which the Wees have conceded, is not a sufficient standard to find a binding agreement. The reason is simply that these latter specific agreements were <span class="font-italic">conceded</span> as binding by the Wees,

</div> which obviated any analysis in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin (HC)</span> as to whether and why they were binding as a matter of law. Conversely, the Engs now have the burden of making a positive case that there were binding specific agreements as a matter of law. They cannot discharge that burden by referring to agreements which were <span class="font-italic">conceded</span> to be binding without argument or analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The second argument, that the contemporaneous documents would also suffice to constitute separate and discrete contractual agreements in relation to particular expenses, also fails. The Engs have failed to particularise and identify each individual specific agreement which they allege to exist. And in any event, they have failed to identify how, in respect of any and each alleged contractual agreement, the necessary elements for a contract to exist are satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: The estoppel by convention issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Engs’ third argument is that an estoppel by convention has arisen from the parties’ dealings over the years, such that the Wees are now estopped from denying the Engs’ right to deduct the disallowed expenses in the account which they now render. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The necessary elements for an estoppel by convention were set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Telecommunications Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Starhub Cable Vision Ltd</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 195 at [28], and reaffirmed in <span class="font-italic">Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine and others </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at [31].

In support of this contention, the Engs cite various examples, including amongst others how the Wees requested information about CSP’s staff and expenses, how the Wees were involved in setting up and renting CSP’s Thong Teck office, how the Wees were given bank statements and cash flow statements that would have informed them about CSP’s expenses and salary costs, and how the Wees were closely involved in the process by which CSP hired new staff.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I reject this argument. I find that the elements necessary for an estoppel by contention to arise are not made out. In the first place, I do not accept that the parties acted on an assumed set of facts in their course of dealing or that the Wees acquiesced to the Engs doing so. The fact that the Wees asked for information and were informed of certain actions being taken, or were given bank statements or cash flow statements, is neither here nor there. That scenario is equally consistent with the Wees co-operating with the Engs as risk runners in the WWW Concept, and therefore requesting information or being informed as to the progress of the Engs’ commitments and expenses towards that concept. The same can be said of the Wees’ involvement with the hiring of staff or the setting up of the Thong Teck office. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Further, the Engs’ own actions and evidence seem to be inconsistent with such a shared assumption. There are several examples of this. In an email from SL to WBT dated 7 July 2010, SL essentially said that the Wees had not paid the expenses incurred by CSP for several years:

In fact, the very complaint that SL levelled against the Wees in these emails is that the Wees were <span class="font-italic">not</span> paying those expenses and were not <span class="font-italic">expected</span> to pay those expenses. This suffices to show that there was, in fact, no assumed set of facts on which parties operated.

They argue that they had no reason to incur these expenses otherwise than in order to manage the Wees’ investments, and indeed, that they derived no personal benefit from incurring these expenses.

What the Engs are doing now is to raise this argument as a justification for deducting the disputed expenses in the account which they have been ordered to render and to resist the Wees’ claim to falsify those deductions. A claim framed this way could not therefore have been the subject of their counterclaim in the liability phase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In any event, it also bears noting that counsel for the Wees, Mr Jeyaretnam, expressly indicated that aside from the overarching agreement argument, the Wees were not arguing that the Engs were precluded from running other arguments in the accounting phase to reduce their liability to account, which presumably would include this argument.

</div>
</div> I therefore consider that it is open to the Engs to argue that the expenses might conceivably be trustees’ expenses properly incurred, regardless of the findings against them at the liability phase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I turn now to the law on a trustees’ right to be indemnified out of the trust property. The general principle is well stated in Lynton Tucker, Nicholas Le Poidevin &amp; James Brightwell (eds), <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Lewin</span>”) at para 21-003:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A trustee is, subject to the terms of the trust, entitled to be indemnified out of the trust property in respect of liabilities, costs and expenses properly incurred by him in connection with the performance of his duties and the exercise of his powers and discretions as trustee:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">”Persons who take the onerous and sometimes dangerous duty of being trustees are not expected to do any of the work on their own expense; they are entitled to be indemnified against the costs and expenses which they incur in the course of their office; of course, that necessarily means that such costs and expenses are properly incurred… The general rule is quite plain; they are entitled to be paid back all that they have paid out.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[citing <span class="font-italic">Re Grimthorpe</span> [1958] Ch 615 at 623,<span class="font-italic"> per </span>Danckwerts J]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The corollary to this general principle, however, is that the trustee is generally not entitled to be indemnified for costs and expenses incurred without authority, either in the trust instrument or from the beneficiaries. <span class="font-italic">Lewin </span>at para 21-042 spells this out: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In general, a trustee is not entitled to indemnity if he incurs costs or liabilities in a transaction which is unauthorised by the terms of the trust instrument and without the request or implied assent of the beneficiaries. However, if the trustee acts in good faith, and the transaction benefits the trust estate, he may be entitled to indemnity to the extent that the transaction benefits the trust estate, though whether the indemnity is a matter of right rather than of discretion of the court is not clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 What the above two passages from <span class="font-italic">Lewin </span>make clear is that a trustee has no right to be indemnified out of the trust property for unauthorised expenses because they have not been properly incurred. The latter half of the second passage does suggest an exception to this general principle: a trustee may nevertheless be entitled to claim an indemnity out of the trust property for unauthorised transactions which benefit the trust estate and which the trustee incurred in good faith. The caveat, however, is that the law is uncertain on this point as to whether the indemnity in these circumstances is a matter of right or lies at the court’s discretion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my judgment, a trustee’s indemnity in these circumstances is not a matter of right but within the Court’s discretion. In the exercise of its discretion, the Court can have regard to the totality of the trustee’s behaviour. The Court is not confined to considering only how the trustee has behaved in relation to that one specific unauthorised transaction. In other words, it may be the case that in respect of one unauthorised transaction, the trustee did indeed incur the expense in good faith for the benefit of the trust estate. But if the same trustee has incurred a string of other unauthorised expenses which have not benefited the trust estate or otherwise than in good faith, it is right that the court retains a discretion to deny the trustee an indemnity even in respect of the apparently untainted transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The above principles are of great relevance to the present case. I have found several instances of egregious behaviour by the Engs as trustees. I made an express finding of one such instance in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>at [46], where I observed that the Wees were wholly entitled to have all 20 of their SPVs transferred back to them, and the Engs’ refusal to transfer seven of them could only have been driven by a desire to hold the SPVs hostage for their counterclaim against the Wees. Other instances are elaborated in greater detail below at [92]–[96], where I elaborate on my finding that the Engs were in wilful default. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 At this point, however, it suffices to note that because of these instances of egregious behaviour, I would have held that the Engs are not entitled to any indemnity whatsoever in respect of any unauthorised transactions, even if such transactions might have benefited the trust estate and were done by the Engs in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It therefore follows that the Engs are entitled to be indemnified only in respect of <span class="font-italic">authorised</span> transactions or, to put it another way, only in respect of expenses properly incurred. However, if the transaction is already authorised, there would ordinarily be no grounds for the Wees to disallow it and falsify the account in respect of that transaction. The finding that the transaction is authorised will therefore be enough on its own to satisfy the Engs’ desire to resist falsification. The inquiry into whether an expense was properly incurred is therefore relevant only where the transaction was authorised but the Engs cannot show that all aspects and components of that expense were properly incurred.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As the question of whether a specific expense claimed or cost incurred was properly incurred depends on the particular transaction, this question is best left to be considered when each item is dealt with separately below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Falsifying and surcharging</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The final issue relates to whether the Wees’ claims of falsification or surcharging in respect of each specific item should be allowed. I shall first set out the law on the taking of accounts on a wilful default basis, including the law as to burdens of proof and causation. I then set out instances of the Engs’ misconduct that ground my finding that they were in wilful default. I then consider out what duties the Engs owe the Wees by virtue of their position as accounting parties due to their status as trustees and fiduciaries. I then apply the law to the specific items in dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on taking of accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It is first important to appreciate the taxonomy within this branch of the law. There are broadly two categories of account as noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah”</span>) at [21]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a general or common account, where no misconduct has been alleged (“the common account”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an account on the footing of wilful default, which involves a breach of duty on the part of the fiduciary (“account on wilful default”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The common account </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 A common account, otherwise known as the general account, or the account in common form, does not depend on wrongdoing. The practical significance of this is that the beneficiary is entitled ‘as of right’ to be given an account in common form of the trustee’s stewardship of the trust assets, without the beneficiary having to show that the trustee has committed a breach of trust (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 339 at [87]; Lord Millett NPJ’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments Ltd v Hall </span>(2013) 16 HKCFAR 681 (<span class="font-italic">“Libertarian Inves</span><span class="font-italic">tments</span>”) at [167]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The reason for this was elaborated upon by Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</span> [2017] SGHC 90 (“<span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span>”). At [16] of <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span>, Abdullah JC explains that a critical aspect of the custodial fiduciary relationship is the duty of the trustee to keep accounts of the trust, and to allow the beneficiaries to inspect them as requested. This accounting procedure serves two purposes – firstly, the informative purpose of allowing the beneficiaries to know the status of the fund and what transformations it has undergone, and secondly, the substantive purpose that ensures that any personal liability a custodial fiduciary may have arising out of maladministration is ascertained and determined (citing Steven Elliott, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee QC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 20-013). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The claim for a common account is divided into three phases (<span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span> at [22]). First, the question is asked whether the claimant has a right to an account. Second, the taking of the account. Third, the court grants consequential relief. It can thus be observed that the taking of an account is a <span class="font-italic">process</span>. It is not, in itself, a remedy (see also <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span> at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The duty to account is continuous, on demand, and is not confined to being discharged only at the time of distribution of the trust assets (<span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span> at [20]). However, the court has the discretion not to order an account where it is oppressive to require the trustee to do so, or for some other good reason (<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo and another v Foo Jhee Tuang and </span><span class="font-italic">others</span> [2016] SGHC 260 at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The extent of disclosure required in furnishing an account is fact-specific in nature. However, the trustee must by the accounting process give proper, complete, and accurate justification and documentation for his actions as a trustee (<span class="font-italic">see Lalwani</span> at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 A trustee’s account, once furnished, may disclose discrepancies. The beneficiary can then decide whether he wishes to falsify a discrepant entry, or to surcharge the account. A recent article by Prof Matthew Conaglen “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Trust, Off <span class="font-italic">Target</span>” (2016) 40 MULR 126 (“<span class="font-italic">Conaglen</span>”) gives a helpful and illuminating account of this process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 By falsifying an entry in the account, the beneficiary essentially asserts that that entry on the credit side should be struck out of the account, and the trustee should not be given credit for that entry. The trustee then bears the burden of proving that that disbursement was in fact an authorised one, being one within the scope of the trust terms (<span class="font-italic">Conaglen</span> at 130). If the trustee cannot do so, the beneficiary by falsifying the account essentially disclaims any interest in the property, and the investment is treated as if it was bought with the trustee’s own money (<span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments</span> at [169]). However, the beneficiary is not <span class="font-italic">obliged</span> to falsify the entry. If the disbursement was made for an asset that has in fact <span class="font-italic">risen</span> in value, the beneficiary is entirely within his rights to adopt the transaction, the result of which is henceforth treated as forming part of the trust fund (see <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments</span> at [169]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Conversely, where a beneficiary seeks to surcharge a common account, the beneficiary essentially asserts that the trustee has received more than the account records. In this case, the burden lies on the beneficiary to show that the trustee in fact received more than the account records (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at paras 20-017 and 20-018). An example would be a beneficiary showing that the trustee had received income from the trust property (such as rent on real property or dividends from shares) that was not recorded in the trust accounts. The beneficiary is then entitled to surcharge the account to include that income on the debit side of the account (<span class="font-italic">Conaglen</span> at 130). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Account on a wilful default basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 An account taken on the wilful default basis is distinct from a common account because the former requires the trustee to have committed some sort of misconduct while the latter does not: see <span class="font-italic">Partington v Reynolds </span>(1858) 62 ER 98 at 99; <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span> at [25]. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and others</span> [2005] SGCA 4 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>observed at [61], this means that the beneficiary seeking an account on the wilful default basis must allege and prove at least one act of wilful neglect or default. Unlike the common account, the taking of an account on a wilful default basis is therefore not available to beneficiary ‘as of right’. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 An instance of wilful default can be shown when custodial fiduciaries “do that which it is their duty not to do; or omit to do that which it is their duty to do”: see <span class="font-italic">Re Owens</span> (1882) 47 LT 61. It is not a requirement for the trustee to be conscious of his misconduct, or indeed to appreciate that his behaviour is a breach of trust. Instead, it is sufficient that the trustee has been guilty of a want of ordinary prudence: see <span class="font-italic">Armitage v Nurse</span> [1998] Ch 241 at 252 (Millett LJ); <span class="font-italic">Meehan v Glazier Holdings Pty Ltd</span> [2002] 54 NSWLR 146 (“<span class="font-italic">Glazier Holdings</span>”) at [65] (Giles JA). Practically, this is achieved if the beneficiary can show that trustee has <span class="font-italic">failed to obtain</span> for the trust that which <span class="font-italic">would have been </span>obtained if the trustee’s duties had been discharged: <span class="font-italic">Glazier Holdings</span> at [65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The scope of an account on a wilful default basis is wider than that of an account on the common account basis. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca </span>at [55], on a common account the trustee need only account for what was actually received and for its disbursement and distribution. Conversely, on an account on a wilful default basis, the trustee has to account not only for what was actually received, but also for what he <span class="font-italic">might have</span> received had it not been for the default. The trustee’s potential liability on the common account is therefore limited to what has <span class="font-italic">actually </span>been received and paid out; while on the wilful default basis, the trustee’s exposure to liability is far greater, as he is liable not only for what he has <span class="font-italic">actually </span>received, but is also additionally liable for what he <span class="font-italic">might have</span> received. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The trustee’s exposure to liability is also broadened on the wilful default basis because the trustee is subject to what has been called a “roving commission” by the master taking the accounts (<span class="font-italic">Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(No 2)</span> [1980] 1 Ch 515, 546 (Brightman LJ)). What this means is that the judge or registrar taking the account is entitled to look into all aspects of the trustee’s management of the trust property and the trustee will be required to explain any suspect transactions, even if the particular transaction has not been complained of by the beneficiary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The effect of this, as the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Reb</span><span class="font-italic">ecca</span> observed at [55], is that the accounting party will carry a much more substantial burden of proof than that which applies to him in the case of a common account. This is because the trustee has engaged in misconduct, and consequently ought to bear a greater burden in proving that the transactions he has carried out are within the scope of his duties and powers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As for the process of how an account on the wilful default basis is actually taken, it becomes apparent that such an account covers the same ground as a common account but, <span class="font-italic">in addition</span>, the trustee is also liable to account for what he might have received if he had been diligent in his duty (see also <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 20-025). Falsification and surcharging therefore apply as they would under a common account, subject to a caveat as to differing principles of causation as set out below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Causation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 It is clear that questions of causation do not enter into the picture when an account is falsified. Where the beneficiary falsifies an entry in the trustee’s account, and the trustee cannot show that the disbursement or transaction was in fact justified or authorised, the entry is disallowed and the disbursement effectively treated as if it had not happened (see <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Fielding</span> [2005] EWHC 1638 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span>”) at [1513]). The transaction is instead treated as having been made by the trustee out of his or her own funds. The trustee then becomes personally liable to restore the original asset, or, if that is not possible, to reimburse the fund for the value missing (see Graham Virgo, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equity </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Trusts</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 18.2.1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 It is not quite so clear whether questions of causation apply when an account is surcharged. The leading cases thus far seem to have confined the process of “surcharging” only to cases where the account is taken on a wilful default basis (see <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments</span> at [170]; <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span> at [1513]). Questions of causation then arise because the inquiry when an account is taken on a wilful default basis is concerned with compensation for loss. As the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (at para 20-027) note, the “governing concept [for surcharges for wilful default] is compensation for loss caused by breach of duty, although this has not always been appreciated.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 However, there can also be surcharges when an account is taken on the common basis. In my judgment, surcharges on the common account should not involve questions of causation. As has been pointed out above, the distinction between the common account and an account on the wilful default basis is that the former concerns only monies that the trustee has <span class="font-italic">actually received</span>, while the latter extends beyond that to monies that the trustee <span class="font-italic">would have received</span> if he had properly dealt with the trust property. This, to my mind, makes all the difference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 There is no requirement to establish causation for surcharges on the common account because it is not disputed that the trustee has <span class="font-italic">actually </span>received monies that should properly be regarded as forming part of the trust fund. As Prof Conaglen convincingly argues, no causal analysis is required to show what the reasonable trustee in that trustee’s position would have received; it is already clear what this trustee has already received: see <span class="font-italic">Conaglen</span> at 143.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In contrast, as Prof Conaglen instructively points out, causation is much more relevant when surcharges arise when an account is taken on the wilful default basis. This is because these surcharges “necessarily require a hypothetical assessment of what a prudent investor would have done, in order to establish the manner in which the trustee should have acted”: <span class="font-italic">Conaglen</span> at 146. A causal inquiry is therefore necessary to identify what the trustee <span class="font-italic">would have</span> received, as opposed to what the trustee has already <span class="font-italic">actually</span> received. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 What this means, practically, is that when accounts are taken on a wilful default basis, two types of surcharges are available. This can be illustrated by an example. If the trustee has actually received income that should properly be credited to the trust, for example, dividends for shares held on trust, then a surcharge may be taken against him on a common account, and no causal inquiry is necessary. However, if the same trustee has in fact failed to invest within the range of authorised investments, a surcharge is taken against him when accounting on the wilful default basis. In this case, questions of causation do arise as to how a reasonable trustee would have behaved, and what investments a reasonable trustee in this trustee’s position might have made for the trust.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Engs’ wilful default</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I found in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [42] that the Engs were in wilful default. One instance of such behaviour I cited in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [46], and referred to in this judgment at [66] above, is the Engs’ refusal to return seven of the Wees’ 20 SPVs with no legal basis whatsoever, effectively holding the SPVs hostage as leverage for their counterclaim in the liability phase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Other instances abound. I cite two more examples. The first concerns the Engs’ deceptive behaviour in relation to disclosing the Wees’ actual interest in Agis Pte Ltd (“Agis”), one of the direct investments which the Engs made for the Wees.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In this file, the Engs prepared a table showing that the Wees’ shareholding in Agis had been diluted from an initial 45.8%, to 2.4%. This table referred to a shareholder called “B1” whose stake in Agis was ultimately reduced to 2.4% in the last column of the table. A footnote indicated that “B1 represents Wee family”. This dilution was consistent with the Engs’ apparently having complied with the Wees’ instruction not to take up rights issues in Agis. The table also showed that other investors, notably “B2” and “B3”, held 33.9% each, while “non-BIL” shareholders held the remaining 29.8% shareholding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 This table was deliberately deceptive. The truth was that “B2” and “B3” also represented the Wees’ investment, via their SPV ‘Berners’. In other words, the Wees’ shareholding in Agis was not just the 2.4% represented in the table as being held by “B1”. The Wees in fact had a combined 70.2% shareholding which the table deceptively showed as being held separately by “B1”, “B2” and “B3”. This was a deception perpetrated on the Wees. It is clear evidence of misconduct by the Engs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 A second example of misconduct involves the Engs’ concealment of availability of existing funds to meet capital calls. In brief, what the Engs did in response to repeated queries was to misrepresent to the Wees repeatedly that the Engs did not have funds available to meet capital calls falling due on the private equity funds which the Engs controlled for the Wees. Instead, the Engs repeatedly asked the Wees to supply fresh funds to meet those capital calls. This is a failure of the trustee’s duty to account, which includes a duty to inform the beneficiary as to the status of the trust accounts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The duties owed by the Engs to the Wees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As noted earlier at [11]–[14], I found in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> that the Engs were resulting trustees and fiduciaries. I now elaborate as to how this finding shapes the kinds of duties the Engs owed the Wees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In most cases, a presumed resulting trustee will owe only a few essential duties to the beneficiary of that trust. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan</span><span class="font-italic"> and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”) at [190], “a resulting trust… is very often a bare trust and, as such, only requires the trustee to convey the trust property when called upon to do so.” That this is the main duty of the presumed resulting trustee is therefore beyond doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I add, however, that until the trustee has executed that main duty, he is also subject to other duties. These are the duty to retain or preserve the trust assets and the duty to account to the beneficiaries when called upon to do so. This much can be discerned from the following extract from <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 10-004:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The basic duty of a trustee, in the absence of any power or duty to deal with the trust assets, is to retain the assets and account for them to the beneficiaries in due course in accordance with the terms of the trust. That is only a default rule, operating in the absence of other terms of the trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Although that extract concerns the default duties of an express trustee, it stands to reason that until the resulting trustee under a bare trust has conveyed the trust property to the person properly entitled to it, he must also retain or preserve that property, and if he deals with it, he is liable to account for that to the beneficiary. The Engs are subject to these basic duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>also observed at [196] that “[a]s a matter of principle, the idea that a fiduciary relationship is possible sits uncomfortably with the fact of a resulting trust”. The reason for this is that fiduciary obligations are typically voluntarily undertaken (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [194]), but the resulting trust is imposed by law. That being said, the Court of Appeal did not foreclose the possibility that a resulting trustee could owe fiduciary obligations: it also observed at [196] that “it may well be that the <span class="font-italic">facts and circumstances</span> leading to the imposition of a resulting trust may also disclose an undertaking by the trustee – whether <span class="font-italic">express </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span><span class="font-italic"> implied</span> – to act in a certain way” [emphasis in original]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I found that the Engs were fiduciaries here, even though they held the monies and investments under a presumed resulting trust. As this is a departure from the typical scenario identified by the Court of Appeal above, I elaborate on my reasons for doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I found that the Engs stood in a fiduciary relationship with the Wees because their relationship exhibited the essential hallmark of the fiduciary relationship: an obligation to act in the interests of the Wees. There are several examples of this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 First, in SL’s affidavit of evidence in chief for the liability phase, she explained that:

We have, from all these eight years, we have been taking care of their interests. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The above evidence shows how the hallmark of a fiduciary relationship has been amply satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 That the Engs owe the Wees fiduciary obligations is also confirmed by other aspects of their relationship. In the High Court of Australia decision of <span class="font-italic">Breen v Williams</span> (1996) 186 CLR 71, Brennan CJ at 82 indicated that fiduciary duties can arise where there is a “relationship of ascendancy or influence by one party over another, or dependence or trust on the part of that other”. I find that this is also made out here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 While the Wees may be sophisticated investors in several respects, I found in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [12] that they were unfamiliar with private equity funds as an asset class. Conversely, ECS was experienced in this field, and tutored them in these investments. The Wees came to see him as their “trusted mentor” in this field: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [12]. This supports a finding that the Wees were in a position of dependence or trust on ECS, and consequently fiduciary obligations would arise. Indeed, this is true even though the parties were engaged in a commercial venture together. As the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments </span>at [70], it is plain that fiduciary duties may well arise as aspects of a commercial relationship. This is exactly the case here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I would also add that the finding that the Engs were fiduciaries who owed a duty to act in the interests of the Wees is in no way inconsistent with the finding that the Engs and Wees were also joint risk runners under the WWW Concept. To my mind, the Wees’ advances of monies to the Engs activates a proprietary relationship of resulting trust over the initial monies advanced. Conversely, the finding that the parties were risk runners relates to how they would eventually make profits from the sale of their respective interests in successful PE funds, if they had indeed ultimately turned out to be successful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Further, I note that the Court of Appeal did insert a caveat that a resulting trustee cannot be said to owe fiduciary duties until he is affected with the knowledge that he is not entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, because until then, his conscience is not affected such that the equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts can be invoked to impose fiduciary duties on him: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [198]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I wish to address the caveat as to timing. In this case, the understanding between the Wees and the Engs was that the Engs would not merely be passive trustees holding on to the Wees’ monies for them. The shared expectation was that the Engs would invest those monies on the Wees’ behalf, and manage and administer the monies or the investments made therefrom: see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [35]. Further, because this was their shared expectation from the beginning of the WWW Concept, it would also have been obvious to the Engs that they were not entitled to any beneficial interest in the monies or investments. Hence, fiduciary obligations were owed at all times by the Engs to the Wees, in relation to the items claimed in this trial now. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 There are two key consequences to finding that the Engs were not simply bare trustees, but instead were fiduciaries. The first is that the Engs will owe fiduciary duties in addition to the duties set out at [98] above. The second is that their fiduciary obligations modify the Engs’ basic duties to preserve the trust property and to account. Let me elaborate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Fiduciary duties owed by the Engs to the Wees </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Having found that the relationship between the Wees and the Engs is a fiduciary one, it is now incumbent upon me to specify what particular fiduciary duties the Engs owe. This flows from the Court of Appeal’s ruling in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok </span><span class="font-italic">Koon</span> at [206] that “[t]he duties that are applicable to each resulting trustee will vary significantly, and are very fact-specific” [emphasis in original omitted]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Here, I am of the view that the Engs owed the Wees the specific duties not to make a profit out of their trust; and not to place themselves in a position where their duty to the Wees and their personal interests might conflict. The Engs stand in a position of considerable ascendancy and influence over the Wees. The Wees advanced more than $100m to the Engs for the Engs to hold and invest. The Wees were relative novices in this field, and took guidance from the Engs. They gave the Engs a great deal of discretion, and effectively allowed the Engs to control the investments. The no-profit and no-conflict rules are properly called upon in this situation to control this discretion, and protect the Wees from abuse.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Modification of basic duties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The second key consequence is that the basic duties to preserve the trust property and to account are modified by the fiduciary obligation, which controls the discretion the Engs had to manage and administer the Wees’ investments. Let me elaborate. In the typical presumed resulting trust scenario, a resulting trustee under the duty to preserve the trust property cannot simply disburse the funds, as to do so would be an unauthorised use of trust monies. He should retain the trust property and seek to execute his main duty of returning the trust property to the person who is entitled to it when called upon to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The difference in the present case, however, is that the monies were advanced <span class="font-italic">precisely</span> for the purpose of investment, whether to create funds or participate in ventures under the WWW Concept. It would therefore be unfair to the Engs to find that they had to hold on the monies at all times, as this ignores the essential reason why the Wees advanced the monies in the first place. Nor would it have made sense to ask the Engs to convey the trust property to the Wees, when they had not been called upon to do so, and in fact, had been instructed by the Wees to invest the monies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The situation is further complicated, however, by the fact that here, there is no contract governing the parties’ respective rights and obligations regarding these investments (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [16]), and, more importantly, no trust instrument spelling out exactly the scope of authorised investments. This directly impacts the taking of accounts, as it is now difficult to determine what is an unauthorised or authorised disbursement of the funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In my view, the means by which the Court is able to identify whether an expenditure was authorised or not, and consequently, whether it should be disallowed or not, is therefore an assessment of what the parties agreed was allowed in respect of that particular transaction, and, following from that, whether the Engs have in respect of that transaction fulfilled their fiduciary obligations. This will also be the means by which I consider whether the items claimed might be trustees’ expenses properly incurred, for the purposes of determining Issue 4 above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 However, I also wish to make clear that on this unique factual matrix, the question whether an expenditure was authorised or not may already have been answered by the finding that the parties worked together as risk runners, with the consequence that the Engs are not entitled to claim management fees and expenses. Where this finding applies, there is no need to inquire into whether or how the fiduciary obligations which the Engs owe the Wees control the Engs’ discretion in management, and in turn, the nature of items claimed as being authorised or not. This is <span class="font-italic">not</span> because the Engs will not owe the Wees fiduciary obligations in respect of such transactions, but rather is because the Engs have already made this claim for fees and expenses once, and failed in it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 For the sake of completeness, I wish to make clear that a resulting trustee’s main duty of conveying the trust property when called upon to do so nevertheless continues to subsist, and is <span class="font-italic">not</span> modified by the obligation to invest or their fiduciary obligations. It is therefore clear beyond peradventure that the Engs’ holding back on returning seven of the Wees’ 20 SPVs (see [66] above) was an egregious instance of misconduct that grounded a finding that the Engs were in wilful default. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I now turn to consider each transaction in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Item no longer in contention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Before turning to items which the Wees seek to falsify or surcharge, I pause to note that the Wees are not seeking to claim withholding tax in Australia,

For the sake of clarity, the result of the above analysis are these steps:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the question must be asked whether the item claimed might be characterised as a fee or expense incurred under the WWW Concept. If it is, then the Wees will be entitled to falsify in respect of that item, because of my finding that the Engs had worked with the Wees as joint risk runners, and thus performed their services and incurred expenses speculatively in anticipation of being compensated or reimbursed out of the profit in the overall venture. Because they expected to be paid these expenses out of anticipated profits, they could not justifiably expect to be paid these expenses by the Wees. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the item claimed does not fall within the first category above, the question that must then be asked is what the parties understood as being allowed in respect of particular transactions, and whether the Engs have discharged their fiduciary obligations in respect of those transactions. This is a fact-sensitive inquiry, and the Engs bear the burden of proof. If they have, the result is that the transaction was an authorised one.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, even if the transaction was an authorised one, the Engs must also show that the expenses incurred in respect of the transaction were reasonable, and could be said to be trustee’s expenses properly incurred. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Disputed salaries expenditure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 This item comprises expenditure incurred by the Engs in respect of salaries.

The Engs’ arguments on the existence of an overarching agreement, or multiple specific agreements, or an estoppel by convention, have all failed. That leaves them only the final argument: that these were trustees’ reasonable expenses. However, they are unable to succeed on this argument. This is because I agree with the Wees that these salaries were speculatively incurred under the overall WWW Concept. To recap, with the exception of Project Plaza, for which the Court of Appeal has awarded the Engs compensation, the Engs otherwise worked with the Wees as joint risk runners, hoping to be rewarded and to recoup expenses out of the potential profits of the concept. The salaries would have been recouped out of such rewards, if any had materialised. That unfortunately has not turned out to be the case.

Even if Ironbridge, as the lead investor in the Seaglow Investment Structure, had sought to liquidate the Structure, Azure Swan Sarl was not jointly held with Ironbridge, and there was therefore no need to incur the unnecessary expense of liquidating Azure Swan Sarl.

They say that the sum was taken out of one of their SPVs to pay a subsidy of S$8,000 towards the S$18,000 monthly salary for TCH, and that they had only agreed to pay this S$8,000 monthly sum for two years. However, the Engs continued paying out for a period longer than the agreed two years. Monies actually transferred have therefore been applied towards an unauthorised purpose.

For example, in an email dated 4 July 2011, SL emailed WBK, WBT and ECS, stating that “The family originally supported CSP through partial payment of [TCH’s] salary of S$8000 (That lasted for about 2 years and stopped)”.

</div> While the numbers are divergent, the substance of the evidence is that at the very least, a substantial part of the monies were indeed transferred over. Certainly, the evidence does not suggest that the S$108,000 had not been paid. In the circumstances, I prefer the Wees’ evidence that the S$164,000 had been paid over. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I hold that the Wees are not entitled to falsify this payment. Following my finding that the Engs received this money, they are under a duty to account for it. The evidence is that they applied these monies towards paying for TCH’s salary. The Wees say they agreed to pay his salary for only two years and no more, and therefore seek to falsify the excess. But if this is true, why did the Wees even transfer the excess $164,000? In my view, the monies could only have been transferred because the Wees had the continuing intention that TCH be paid. The Engs did so accordingly, and so the disbursements were authorised. The Wees are therefore not entitled to falsify this amount. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Agis rights issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Another sum that the Wees seek to falsify against the Engs is the amount of US$904,995 used to subscribe for additional shares in Agis in three tranches under rights issues.

</div> To recap, the Engs attempted to show through this table that they had complied with the Wees’ refusal to take up the rights issues, as represented by the Wees’ shareholding denoted by shareholder “B1” having been reduced from an initial 45.8% to 2.4%. A footnote to this table indicated that “B1 represents Wee family”. The reality, however, was that the other investors on the table, B2 and B3, each holding 33.9% each, were actually the Wees’ SPV, Berners.

</div> This was conveniently left unmentioned, leading to the impression that these entities belonged to some other investors. In truth, the Wees actually held 70.2% of Agis, which properly reflects the result of the Engs actually taking up the rights issue on the Wees’ behalf instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The Engs’ case has never been that they could act over the objections of the Wees to take up the rights issues. Rather, the Engs’ case has always been that the Wees did not explicitly disagree, as shown by their examples of the Wees being informed, and the apparent absence of explicit objection by the Wees. This shows that the Engs always understood that the Wees’ refusal to take up the rights issue must be respected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The above evidence shows that the Engs knew that the Wees did indeed refuse to take up the rights issues. The evidence of disclosure having been made is therefore neither here nor there. On their own evidence, the Engs acted in direct contravention of what they themselves understood to be allowed. Indeed, they knew they were doing so, as they would not otherwise have sought to conceal the Wees’ actual shareholding in Agis in the 12 May 2012 report. I therefore hold that the Wees are entitled to falsify this sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 It is true that Berners has now been transferred back to the Wees. By accepting the return of Berners, even when Berners still holds shares in Agis, it might seem as if the Wees have adopted the transactions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, adopted the shares acquired under the rights issues. I find however, that this is not necessarily the case. The Wees are entitled to have their SPV, Berners, returned to them, but they are still also entitled to examine the accounts of Berners, and falsify transactions that have not been authorised. The rights issues were precisely these transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 That said, for the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the effect of falsification is that the unauthorised transactions will be taken <span class="font-italic">as if</span> they were made by the trustee on his own account. To falsify, the Wees will therefore have to transfer the Agis shares obtained without their authority as a result of the rights issues back to the Engs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Stone’s adjustment in his fourth report</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Another item the Wees have indicated they wish to falsify is US$60,816, described as “Stone’s adjustment in Stone’s 4th Report”.

</div> They say that it is highly suspect that the payments were made by Ironbridge in 2008 only after the Wees had committed capital to the Seaglow Investment Structure. They say that it is even more suspect that the agreement to pay the fees was entered into in August 2006, which is about the same time as the Wees committed to joining Seaglow.

The Monitoring Fee Agreement, dated 21 January 2008, indicates that the recipient of this fee should be the Wees’ SPV, Berners, and not CSP. CSP is merely meant to receive the fee on Berners’ behalf. This is made explicitly clear by Clause 1.2, which bears reproduction:

This is because the Monitoring Fee Agreement itself indicates that Berners would be providing services to Agis Pte Ltd, but Berners ultimately did so through CSP’s employees. This much is evident from the fact that cl 4.4 of the Agreement recognises CSP to be the advisors of Berners, and moreover provides that if CSP no longer advises Berners, the agreement should terminate:

The rule is a strict one and liability to account arises simply because profits are made… The no-profit rule can be seen as a particular application of the no-conflict rule, that a fiduciary may not obtain profit in connection with his position without the informed consent of the person he is duty-bound to protect…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 The Court of Appeal further observed at [54] that the rule captures profits obtained by the fiduciary so long as they were obtained in connection with his position as fiduciary:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… payments that flout the no-profit rule need not strictly flow to the fiduciary <span class="font-italic">qua</span> director.

To make full disclosure, the fiduciary must inform the claimant company/beneficiary that payment for the services would be made to the fiduciary personally, and must also disclose the details of the services to be rendered, including the amount of payment.

</div> This means that the Engs did not find themselves in a position to award themselves fees by virtue of their position as fiduciaries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Indeed, the decision of Harman J in <span class="font-italic">Re Gee</span> [1948] Ch 284 bears noting. There, Harman J observed at 295 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it appears not to be the law that every man who becomes a trustee holding as such shares in a limited company is made ipso facto accountable for remuneration received from that company independently of any use by him of the trust holding, whether by voting or refraining from so doing. For instance, A who holds the majority of the shares in a limited company becomes the trustee of the estate of B, a holder of a minority interest; this cannot, I think, disentitle A to use his own shares to procure his own appointment as an officer of the company, nor compel him to disgorge the remuneration he so receives, for he cannot be disentitled to the use of his own voting powers, nor could the use of the trust votes in a contrary sense prevent the majority prevailing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 The present facts, to my mind, are also a case where the Engs could not have exploited their control over the Wees’ shareholding to vote themselves the fees, even if I accept that it is because they were fiduciaries to the Wees that they had the power to appoint directors or control the shareholding. I therefore do not take the view that the fees were obtained as a result of their fiduciary position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 In any event, however, I find that the Engs gave sufficient disclosure, and moreover, received the Wees’ informed consent.

To that end, the law is that the burden lies on the fiduciary to show that the profit is not one for which he should account, as observed in the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Murad v Al-Saraj</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 959 at [77], and as applied by the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Warman v Dwyer</span> (1995) 182 CLR 544 at 561. Here, it suffices that the service fees fell within the category of ‘Agis fees’ and moreover were incurred at about the same time as the advisory fees. The Engs therefore bear the burden of showing that the profit was not one for which they should account. They have been unable to do so.

In support of this, they point out that the only party that required any substantial amount of money at the time was CSP, and thus the Engs’ retention of the funds, presumably to ensure that there was sufficient money to pay themselves, was a case of preferring their own interests over the Wees.

</div> I therefore find that the Wees indeed instructed the Engs to use whatever funds remained available to meet the capital calls. Once again, the Engs were and are being disingenuous. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 The next question that arises is whether the Engs were under any obligation to obey such instructions, such that a failure to comply with the instructions might constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. Fiduciaries are not generally required to comply with <span class="font-italic">each and every</span> instruction given to them by their principals. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> noted at [194], a fiduciary undertaking is voluntary in the sense that it arises “as a consequence of the fiduciary’s conduct”, which does not mean that the fiduciary “must be subjectively willing to undertake those obligations”, but rather, “the undertaking arises where the fiduciary voluntarily places himself in a position where the law can objectively impute an intention on his or her part to undertake those obligations”. On the present facts, however, I find that the Engs undertook to comply with the Wees’ instructions, and that this was a fiduciary obligation. The very essence of the arrangement between the Wees and the Engs was that the Engs had to carry out any express instructions which the Wees might give them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 In the first place, this is what the Engs have themselves testified on the stand.

This is evident in their responses to the Wees’ queries on the bank balances. The Engs’ response was not that there were sufficient balances to meet the capital calls, but that the Engs were not required to comply with the Wees’ instructions. Instead, the Engs simply and dishonestly said they did not have available funds. For example, in response to WBK’s email of 24 February 2010, SL’s reply was that she “only [had] a few hundred thousand US$ left (Not sufficient for PEP/FLC) (<span class="font-italic">would have used them if I could</span>)” [emphasis added].

I find that the Engs preferred their own interests by failing to disclose to the Wees that there were ample funds available to meet capital calls. Instead, it is obvious to me that the Engs were seeking to preserve those funds to pay the salaries of staff at CSP

</div>
</div>
</div> By making these payments, they sacrificed the interests of the Wees in favour of their own interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 This then brings us to the question of causation. As I have noted above, surcharges when taking an account on a wilful default basis are subject to proof of causation. This is because the wrongdoing fiduciary’s conduct is being contrasted against what a reasonable and prudent trustee or fiduciary might have done in this scenario. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 The plaintiffs have in their arguments pointed to the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Beyonics Technology Ltd and another v Goh Chan Peng and others</span> [2016] 4 SLR 472 as setting out the applicable law on causation in the context of equitable compensation. In that decision, Hoo Sheau Peng JC (as she then was) observed that the first approach would be the traditional “but for” test set out in <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns</span> [1996] 1 AC 421. The second approach is the less strict approach in <span class="font-italic">Brickenden v London Loan &amp; Savings Co of Canada</span> [1934] 3 DLR 465, where a claim for equitable compensation would succeed so long as the wronged party could show that the fiduciary’s breach of duty was “in some way connected” to the loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 Although those cases do set out the respective approaches for causation in the context of equitable compensation, it appears to me that an important prior question has been glossed over. That question is whether a surcharge on the wilful default basis is effectively the same as equitable compensation for a breach of trust or fiduciary duty. It appears to me that equitable compensation in the context of an account should be more limited in scope than equitable compensation for a breach of trust. This is so even though the basic aim of a surcharge on the wilful default basis is compensation for loss. The reason for this is that a surcharge as an accounting mechanism is concerned with what the <span class="font-italic">trust</span> would have had if the trustee had behaved as he ought to have done. It is not, in this sense, concerned with whatever additional outlays the trustee or the fiduciary has incurred because of the underperformance of the trust, such as loans having to be taken out. As Prof Jamie Glister has observed, “the interposal of the account means that the trustee’s liability is limited to the assets under management” (Jamie Glister, “Breach of Trust and Consequential Loss” (2014) 8 J of Eq 235 at 237). In other words, the beneficiary cannot claim consequential loss by way of a surcharge when an account is taken on the wilful default basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 The effect of this is that the Wees’ claims for the interest and mortgage charges incurred in respect of the mortgage of WBK’s residence are necessarily excluded as a surcharge. These are consequential losses that flowed from the Wees being told, falsely, that the trust did not have enough available funds to meet the capital calls. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 However, the question that then follows concerns the appropriate principles of causation that apply in respect of the late payment charges and the forced sale charges. These were losses incurred in respect of assets within the trust. I take the view that here, the principles of equitable compensation continue to apply. As the underlying principle in a surcharge for wilful default is compensation for loss, there is no reason to depart from these established principles, subject to the caveat above as to consequential loss. As for whether it is the <span class="font-italic">Target</span> approach of “but-for” causation or the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span> approach that applies, this depends on the classification of the relationship between the parties. In <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing</span> [2013] 3 SLR 631, and <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon v Arjun Permanand Samtani </span>[2014] 1 SLR 245, I held that the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span> approach should apply to a fiduciary who is in one of the well-established categories of fiduciary relationships, who commits a culpable breach, and who breaches an obligation which stands at the very core of the fiduciary relationship. In other situations, the test remains “but-for” causation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 I hold that the proper approach to apply on the present facts is the “but for” test. To my mind, it is not clear that the Engs’ relationship with the Wees falls within one of the “well-established categories” of fiduciary relationships. The present case is a novel one where I have found that the Engs as presumed resulting trustees nevertheless owed fiduciary obligations as they were allowed and expected to invest. This does not fall within any familiar categorisation of fiduciary relationships. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 Turning to the “but-for” test, this test provides that the trustee is liable to make good a loss to the trust estate if, but for the breach, such loss would not have occurred. I find that here, the Engs are liable to make good the losses in respect of the late penalty charges and the forced sale charges. I find that the Wees have provided ample evidence showing that there were no other immediate uses for the existing funds held by the Engs, and that these funds were more than sufficient to meet the capital calls as they fell due. The Engs’ refusal to use the existing funds therefore caused the loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 The Engs’ arguments on causation can also be quickly dismissed. The argument that they were holding on to the funds to meet future capital calls is not a good reason to meet the urgent and pressing obligations that were already due. Nor do I find that the evidence supports a conclusion that the Wees would have sold down the funds in any case, even if there were existing funds available to meet the calls – as was the case here. Further, it is no defence for a trustee to say that the beneficiary could have coughed up more funds of the beneficiary’s own to meet a liability that arose because of the trustee’s default. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 I therefore hold that the Wees are entitled to a surcharge over the losses on the late penalty charges and the forced sale charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interest on TCH loan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Another item the Wees seek to surcharge is a sum of S$14,000 which represents interest payments on a loan they advanced to the Engs for them in turn to lend to one of their employees at CSP, Tan Choon Hong.

The Engs have argued that the original principal sum of S$500,000 was not held on trust for the Wees because these were spent on staff salaries. In this respect, their arguments for TCH’s salary are essentially the same as those for salaries in general. This was the subject of the Wees’ falsification claim on the disputed salaries expenditure above. I have held that for that category of claims, those monies were indeed held on trust (see [129]–[132] above). This means that the interest earned by the Engs on the TCH loan was, in fact, interest earned on trust property. I hold that this should properly be regarded as income earned on trust property for which the Engs must account to the Wees.
