<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION ON REVIEW OF

TAXATION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">          This was a

review of taxation of a ‘party and party’ Bill of Costs arising from a judgment

dated 7 August 2001, in which costs of this action, including the assessment, were ordered

to be agreed or taxed and to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff. The Bill came up

for taxation before me and for a review of taxation. Being dissatisfied with the review,

the plaintiff has filed for a review of taxation before the Judge in Chambers. I shall now

set out the grounds of my decision.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The facts</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        This was a claim for

damages arising out of personal injuries suffered as a result of an industrial accident at

her employer’s (the defendants) premises. On 12 April 2000, the plaintiff was

punching metal work pieces using a power press machine, when her hands were crushed

against the tooling die by the ram of the machine. Both her hands had to be amputated. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        The action was commenced in

the District Court, but was later transferred to the High Court on 11 December 2000 by

consent pursuant to section 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321). The trial was set

down for one day with two witnesses for the plaintiff and six witnesses for the

defendants. On the day of the trial, the parties came to a settlement and the defendants

admitted liability for the accident on a 100% basis. Interlocutory judgment with damages

to be assessed was recorded by the court. The assessment of damages before the assistant

registrar took one and a half days, with one day for the taking of evidence from the

witnesses, followed by half a day of arguments by counsel. The plaintiff was awarded a

total of $729,659.10 in damages.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The law with respect to taxation of costs</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        The procedure and rules

with regard to taxation of costs is governed by Order 59 of the Rules of Court (Revised

Edition 1997). The fundamental tenet on a taxation of costs is that of reasonableness,

whether on a standard or indemnity basis. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Appendix 1 to Order 59 sets

out the principles which the taxing Registrar should apply in awarding costs. Paragraph

1(1) states that the amount of costs allowed is in the discretion of the Registrar.

However, in exercising this discretion, the Registrar is to have regard to all the

relevant circumstances, and in particular, to the matters listed in paragraphs 1(2)(a) to

(f).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        In coming to my decision on

the costs to be awarded for the Bill, I was guided by and applied the legal principles

espoused above.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        At the taxation hearing

before me, the main argument put forth by the defendants’ solicitors was that the

action was a straightforward one which involved no complex issues of law or fact. The

authorities relied on were similar to those used in numerous other cases of the same

nature. The plaintiff’s solicitor, on the other hand, submitted that the amount of

$85,000 sought in Section 1 was justifiable – first, quantification of the

plaintiff’s damages was difficult as the plaintiff could not decide whether to opt

for hand transplantation or myo-electric hands. There were also no precedents which were

directly on point, which necessitated much research into both local and English case law.

In addition, much groundwork had been done for the trial and assessment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        The court noted that the

present case, although not complicated in its facts, was unique in that it involved the

amputation of both hands, for which there was no clear and direct case authority. I

accepted that the plaintiff’s solicitors had to carry out more detailed research

before they could arrive at an appropriate figure of damages in this regard. Even though

the case did not go on for the one-day trial, all the preparatory work towards the trial

had already been completed. The plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence was 56 pages. The

bundle of pleadings was 25 pages. The bundle of authorities was 77 pages. The 9-page

opening statement was also prepared. For the getting-up work up to entering of the consent

interlocutory judgment, I awarded $14,000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        The hearing for the

assessment of damages lasted one and a half days in total, including arguments by counsel.

The plaintiff’s counsel’s opening statement was 21 pages. The defendant’s

counsel’s opening statement was 43 pages. Four witnesses, including one expert

medical witnesses, gave evidence. I awarded $26,000 for the work done in respect of the

assessment of damages. In total, I awarded $40,000 for Section 1.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        Both the plaintiff and the

defendants filed reviews of taxation. At the hearing of the review of taxation, the

arguments presented were essentially a re-hash of those put forth at the initial hearing

for taxation. I found no reason to disturb my earlier findings. Hence, I dismissed both

reviews.</p>
