Having considered the parties’ submissions, I allow the appeal for reasons I will elaborate on below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In particular, this appeal turns primarily on a question of principle: if a claimant’s own expert evidence, which he adduced to rebut the defendant’s expert evidence on a critical issue of fact, in reality <span class="font-italic">supports</span> the defendant’s version of events, is there still a triable issue of fact for a trial judge to decide? Although the learned AR thought that there remained a triable issue, I respectfully disagree and find that there is no longer a triable issue. The result is that the claimant’s claim should be struck out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The events leading up to OC 179</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I begin with the brief background facts. The second defendant, UHP Holdings Pte Ltd (“UHP”), is a special purpose vehicle that was incorporated on 23 November 2018 for investment purposes. It is beneficially owned by Hector Capital Holdings Pte Ltd, which is one of the entities under Hector Capital Partners (“Hector”). The first defendant, Mr Vikash Kumar, is the Chief Investment Officer of Hector. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Since late 2015, Hector has invested in the alternative energy industry. Then, beginning from July 2017, Hector invested in a solar energy development company in Singapore known as Entoria Energy Pte Ltd (“EEPL”). In 2018, Hector, through EEPL, began to consider an investment in Sun Electric Pte Ltd (“SE”) and three of its subsidiaries. The claimant, Mr Matthew Peloso, is the founder of SE. He has been a shareholder and director of SE since its incorporation but ceased to be a shareholder on 18 June 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Between January and June 2019, EEPL and SE continued discussions regarding EEPL’s potential investment in SE. Eventually, on 29 June 2019, UHP, SE, and three of its subsidiaries entered into an investment agreement (the “29 June Investment Agreement”). Under this agreement, UHP would acquire 51% of shares in SE and three of its subsidiaries for consideration of $21,000 each, with the total consideration to the four companies being $84,000. In return, UHP would use its best efforts to arrange a further capital injection of at least US$10m in the form of a debt facility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 After the 29 June Investment Agreement was signed, the claimant informed the first defendant that SE needed more than US$10m in funding. The parties agreed that UHP would provide an increased credit line of US$100m on a best-efforts basis. However, this facility would not be fully disbursed upfront, but instead in stages upon SE and its subsidiaries reaching certain agreed milestones. In return, UHP would be entitled to 80% (an increase from the original 51%) of shares in SE and its three subsidiaries. The consideration was to remain the same at $21,000 each. On 2 July 2019, the parties entered into a revised investment agreement on those terms (the “2 July Investment Agreement”). Then, on 3 July 2019, UHP and SE entered into a loan facility agreement that provided for a secured credit facility of up to US$100m (the “3 July Loan Facility Agreement”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It is important to note for present purposes that the claimant does not dispute the existence and validity of the three documents mentioned above, namely, the 29 June Investment Agreement, the 2 July Investment Agreement, and the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement. Indeed, the claimant had listed all three documents in his List of Documents that he provided to the defendants pursuant to the court’s direction for the parties to exchange documents that they would be relying on in OC 179. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Subsequently, as the claimant claims in OC 179, the first defendant allegedly signed an investment agreement dated 18 November 2019 (the “Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement”). Under this agreement, the first defendant allegedly agreed on behalf of UHP to acquire 51% of the shares in SE for a consideration of $5.15m. This forms the basis for the claimant’s action in OC 179 against the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Notwithstanding the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement, on 25 November 2019, SE issued and passed the Share Application Form and Directors’ Resolution, respectively, by allotting 51% of the ordinary shares of SE to UHP for a consideration of $21,000. On 27 November 2019, the shares were allotted to UHP. This allotment was supposedly done pursuant to the 2 July Investment Agreement, which provided that these forms could not be filed earlier than 1 October 2019. However, this was clearly a mistake as the 2 July Investment Agreement provided for an allotment of 80% of the shares in SE and three of its subsidiaries. The mistake arose because SE had used the wrong share allotment forms from the superseded 29 June Investment Agreement instead of the 2 July Investment Agreement. SE fixed this mistake on 23 December 2019, by issuing and passing the correct Share Application Form and Directors’ Resolution, respectively, to allot an additional 322,050 of the ordinary shares in SE to UHP. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The commencement of OC 179</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 5 August 2022, the claimant commenced OC 179. He claims for the sum of $5.15m that the defendants had allegedly failed to pay pursuant to the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement. The claimant’s pleading in the Statement of Claim on the formation of this agreement is in the following terms: “[b]y a written agreement dated 18 November 2019, the [c]laimant, with the consent of the existing shareholders of [SE] at the time, and the [d]efendants agreed to a dilution of the shares in [SE] and for the [second] [d]efendant to be issued a majority of ordinary shares in [SE] for the amount of S$5,150,000.00”.

On 18 October 2022, the claimant’s solicitors replied to state that “[w]e are instructed that the <span class="font-italic">original wet ink</span> version of the Investment Agreement dated 18 November 2019 … was retained by either of [the defendants] and that [the claimant] was only provided with a copy of the Agreement” [emphasis in original].

On 23 November 2022, the defendants submitted the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement, as well as the 3 July Loan Facility (which the parties accept to be genuine), to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for handwriting analysis. On 24 February 2023, HSA concluded that the first defendant’s signatures on both the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement and the 3 July Loan Facility were “almost superimposable” with “no exclusionary difference” in both the length of the signature line beneath the signature and even the position of the signatures relative to the signature line.

</div> In short, the claimant’s own expert agreed with the defendants’ expert that the first defendant’s signature on the two documents are practically identical. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Subsequently, the defendants filed HC/SUM 1656/2023 (“SUM 1656”) to seek further and better particulars of the Statement of Claim from the claimant.

For clarity, Hector Capital Pte Ltd is a distinct entity from Hector Capital Holdings Pte Ltd. The claimant’s version of events must also be seen in the light of his reply affidavit dated 18 April 2023 in SUM 597, where he said the following: “I wish to state that I do not have the original version of the [Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement] <span class="font-italic">with wet ink signatures </span>… as it was retained by the [first] [d]efendant and/or the [second] [d]efendant” [emphasis added].

Among other arguments, the defendants’ primary case is that the first defendant’s signature on the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement had been copied and inserted from the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement. Therefore, the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement was forged and unenforceable. The learned AR heard and dismissed SUM 2670 on 6 October 2023.

In brief, the learned AR dismissed SUM 2670 for two principal reasons. First, she held that whether the first defendant’s purported signature on the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement was copied and inserted from the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement “cannot be determined at this interlocutory stage without cross-examining [the experts] on their reports, as well as cross-examining [the claimant] and the [first defendant]” since such a task “strictly belongs to a trial judge who will have the benefit of all the fact-finding processes in a full trial”.

The learned AR explained that the contemporaneous documents “may affect the strength of [the claimant’s] claim in OC 179 or [the claimant’s] credibility”, which must be tested at trial. Accordingly, she “[did] not think the only possible conclusion is that the [Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement] was forged and that the SOC should be struck out”.

First, their primary case is that the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement was forged and that they did not enter into such an agreement. In this regard, the defendants understandably emphasise that both parties’ experts agree that the first defendant’s signatures on the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement and the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement are “almost superimposable”, “almost identical”, and that it is “almost impossible for a human to sign 2 identical signatures”.

</div>
</div>
</div> The defendants say that this is significant because the claimant’s own pleaded position is that the first defendant had physically signed the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement. Indeed, the claimant’s own case is that this “wet ink” version of the document was later scanned, and a copy provided to the claimant. Therefore, the objective evidence shows that the claimant’s case that the first defendant had signed the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement in wet ink is factually unsustainable.

Therefore, it would not make sense for the defendants to purchase 51% of the shares in SE for $5.15m when they have <span class="font-italic">already</span> purchased 80% of the shares.

Thus, it has been said in <span class="font-italic">Wing Joo Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 814, where the Court of Appeal cited its previous decision in <span class="font-italic">Ko Teck Siang v Low Fong Mei </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 22, which in turn endorsed the English Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Wenlock v Moloney </span>[1965] 1 WLR 1238, (at [172]) that the power to strike out is “very sparingly exercised, and only [applied] in very exceptional cases” and would not be justified “merely because the story told in the pleadings was highly improbable, and one which it was difficult to believe could be proved”. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26  Second, pursuant to the above, the applicant in a striking out application bears the burden of proving that the claim is “obviously unsustainable, the pleadings [are] unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed before the court will strike it out” (see the High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck v Credit Suisse</span><span class="font-italic"> AG, Singapore Branch </span>[2015] SGHC 52 at [21] as well as <span class="font-italic">Bank of China Ltd, Singapore Branch v BP</span><span class="font-italic"> Singapore Pte Ltd and others</span> [2021] 5 SLR 738 at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In the present case, the defendants do not rely on the ground in O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) because O 9 r 16(2) provides that no evidence can be admitted on an application to strike out under that ground. Indeed, as the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span><span class="font-italic">2021 </span>observe in relation to the identical O 18 r 19(2) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (the “ROC 2014”), the reason why no affidavit can be filed in support of an application to strike out under this particular ground because “it is essentially a question of law and the pleaded facts are presumed to be true in favour of the claimant” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2021 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 18/19/5). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Turning now to the two grounds in O 9 rr 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), the High Court has held that there would be an abuse of process (which is the ground under r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) if a claimant knowingly pursues a case that is “doomed to fail” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Kim Hok Yung and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank) (Lee Mon Sun, third party) </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [17]). In such a case, the claimant would, in effect, be wasting the court’s time and this would amount to an abuse of process as the proceedings serve no useful purpose. As for the broad ground under r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC has observed that this is a new provision that has no counterpart in O 18 r 19 of the ROC 2014 (see Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>(LexisNexis, 2022) at para 24-113). Instead, the learned author notes that this provision is “residuary in nature and is intended to empower the court to terminate action or dismiss a defence or make any other appropriate order if this outcome is necessary to achieve the interests of justice”. Thus, the inclusion of this provision means that “if there are circumstances which do not fall within paras (a) and (b) of r 16(1), they may be caught by para (c) of r 16(1)” (at para 24-113). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The claimant’s claim should be struck out as being an abuse of process or because it is in the interests of justice to do so</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my judgment, the claimant’s claim should be struck out for being an abuse of process or because it is in the interests of justice to do so. In coming to this conclusion, I respectfully agree with Hri Kumar Nair J’s important observations in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Asian Eco Technology Pte Ltd v Deng Yiming </span>[2023] SGHC 260 (at [18]) that “the grounds of ‘abuse of process’ and ‘interests of justice’ under O 9 r 16 of the ROC 2021 should not be construed too widely” because “[a]n overly liberal interpretation of the grounds under O 9 r 16 may invite a deluge of striking out applications and appeals arising out of these applications”. However, in my respectful view, the learned judge was certainly not suggesting that a striking out application cannot succeed in an appropriate case. This constitutes one such case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 First, it is clear that a claimant is bound by its pleadings when a striking out application is made against him. Although I agree with the claimant’s reliance on the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Jiangsu New Huaming International Trading Co Ltd v PT Musim Mas and another </span>[2023] SGHC 27 (at [15]) for the proposition that “[p]leadings are meant for parties to establish facts, and discovery and interrogatories are meant for parties to gather evidence”, this does not detract from the principle that a claimant’s pleadings must allow the defendant to know the case that he has to meet. If the defendant thinks that the claimant has no viable case and applies to strike out the claimant’s case, this must be because of the claimant’s pleadings, which the claimant is bound by. Short of a successful application to amend its pleadings, a claimant cannot be allowed to shift the goal posts when the defendant is bearing down on a metaphoric goal. This is also consistent with the oft-cited proposition from the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association </span>[1970] 1 WLR 688, albeit in relation to the English equivalent of the ground in r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), that a reasonable cause of action means a cause of action with some chance of success when only the allegations <span class="font-italic">in the pleadings </span>are considered. For this proposition to make any sense, it must follow that a claimant must be bound by its pleadings . </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On the facts of the present case, it is clear from the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">own </span>pleadings and affidavit evidence that his case is that the first defendant signed the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement <span class="font-italic">physically</span> (as opposed to electronically). The claimant has not run an alternative case, as the learned AR appeared to suggest below, that the first defendant signed another copy of the said agreement electronically. In this regard, in so far as the learned AR accepted the submissions by Mr Viveganandam Devaraj (“Mr Devaraj”), who appeared for the claimant, that there was such an alternative possibility, I respectfully think that she ought not to have done so. The claimant is bound by his pleaded case, and it is not correct for his counsel to make up for his incomplete case from the Bar without any evidence or (so it appeared) any instructions from the claimant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, since the claimant is bound by his pleaded case that the first defendant signed the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement <span class="font-italic">physically</span>, it follows that if this account can be determinatively dispelled, then the claimant’s claim must have no basis to stand on and should be struck out. In this regard, while I agree with the learned AR that the fact-finding task “strictly belongs to a trial judge who will have the benefit of all the fact-finding processes in a full trial”, this broad proposition extends only to a situation where there is a dispute of fact between the parties. If the parties, or the evidence adduced to support their respective cases, are actually aligned as to a state of facts, then it would not advance the Ideals found in O 3 r 1(2) of the ROC 2021 to continue an action that would only make sense had there been disagreement on such facts. This is because the Ideals emphasise, among other principles, expeditious proceedings, cost-effective and proportionate work, and efficient use of court resources (see O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), and r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC 2021). It will further these Ideals to discontinue proceedings where the parties’ <span class="font-italic">own </span>evidence erases any dispute of fact, without which there would no basis to the underlying action. Put differently, it cannot be expeditious, cost-effective, or efficient to put the parties through a full trial where there is plainly no sustainable dispute of fact that underlies the entire action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In this regard, I disagree with Mr Devaraj that the defendants are somehow precluded from applying to strike out the claimant’s claim before the exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”). Mr Devaraj explained that the claimant ought to be given a chance to ventilate his case theory more fully in his AEIC. Instead, I agree with Mr Victor Leong (“Mr Leong”), who appeared for the defendants, that such a requirement is not only absent in the ROC 2021 but would also make no practical sense. This is because if a party can resist striking out by saying that he wants to file an AEIC, then the entire striking out regime would be at the mercy of such requests by parties. This cannot be the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the present case, the claimant’s pleaded case has been rendered factually impossible by his <span class="font-italic">own </span>expert’s evidence that the first defendant’s signatures on the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement and the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement “aligns [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] on top of each other almost perfectly” and it was “very likely” that one was copied and inserted from the other since it would be “almost impossible for a human to sign 2 identical signatures”.

</div> While the claimant may say that the expert’s view is that it is only “almost impossible” and not “completely impossible”, this is really a matter of semantics. For all intents and purposes, the claimant’s own expert concluded, in agreement with the defendants’ expert, that the first defendant’s signature on the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement had been copied and inserted from the earlier and genuine 3 July Loan Facility Agreement. It is important to note that the claimant’s expert’s mandate was, among other things, to “[d]etermine if the questioned signature found in the [Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement] could have originated from the specimen signature in [the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement]”.

</div> The claimant’s expert’s answer to this very question therefore dispels the claimant’s pleaded case that the first defendant had signed the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement <span class="font-italic">physically</span>. There is no need to put the parties through a full trial given that the parties’ experts are <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> on their forensic analyses of the signatures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Third, and for completeness, I agree with the learned AR that the absence of contemporaneous documents that support the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement<span class="font-italic"> </span>is not determinative for a striking out application. I accept that this may point to the claimant’s case being weak, but it does not necessarily mean that his case is impossible or improbable. To be fair to Mr Leong, he reasonably agreed that such absence alone would not be sufficient for a striking out application to succeed. Similarly, I also do not think that the mere fact that the objective facts supposedly contradict the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement, such as it being uncommercial or illogical, can be determinative for a striking out application. These allegations, even if true, do not necessarily mean that the claimant’s claim cannot succeed. However, given my conclusions above, there is no need for me to enter into a more detailed analysis of the claimant’s case on the basis of the objective evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For the reasons above, I allow the appeal.
