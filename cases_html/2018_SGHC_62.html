This was on 26 July 2017.  When the court resumed in the afternoon of 27 July 2017, I understood that the Defence had just made representations to the Attorney-General’s Chambers.

Parties had a preliminary discussion in chambers and were about to proceed for oral submissions in open court when Defence Counsel, Mr Edmond Pereira, indicated that there might be another development.  The matter was stood down to the afternoon.  Then in open court, the accused applied for the plea of guilt recorded on 28 July 2017 (about 6½ weeks earlier) to be retracted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Mr Pereira applied to be and was discharged from further acting for the accused.  The intervening time was taken up for the accused to obtain new counsel.  Mr Ramesh Tiwary now appeared for the accused and maintained the application for the retraction of the plea.  On the court’s direction, the accused had put forward his grounds for doing so in an affidavit (“accused’s first affidavit”) filed on the 12 February 2018.

He advised me that the evidence against me was strong in view of Shanti’s evidence.  If I lost the case I could be sentenced to death.  He asked me if he could make representations to the DPP to reduce the capital charge to one that did not attract the death sentence.  I would have to plead guilty to this amended charge.  I think we spoke for about 45 minutes.  At the conclusion of that meeting I said I would not plead guilty.  He told me to think again and to inform him the next day.  He gave me a piece of paper to write what I intended to do.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. The next morning he met me again.  He asked for my decision.  At first I said that I would not plead guilty.  He advised me again that the evidence against me was strong.  He advised me to think of my family, my son and wife.  That day was my son’s birthday.  I was very emotional.  I felt no one believed me.  Everyone believed Shanti.  I felt alone as if no one was helping me.  I was feeling very depressed.  I was also missing my son more than ever because it was his birthday.  So I agreed to plead guilt.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. The next time my lawyer saw me at Changi prison I told him I did not want to plead guilty. He said he would then have withdraw from the case. I said okay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The accused added, “I was very emotional and I had been crying.  I was thinking about my son more than ever.  In those circumstances I broke down.  I agreed to plead guilty.  I simply gave up.  I am not guilty of the offence or the reduced charge to which I pleaded guilty.  I did not give Shanti anything.  Therefore I cannot plead guilty.”

I advised the Accused that the evidence against him was strong. There were circumstances in which if he were questioned following Shanti’s evidence, he would not be able to answer as he had difficulty explaining when I questioned him. I informed him that he was dealing with his life. I told him that I had spoken with the Prosecution earlier that day and the Prosecution had indicated that in the event he elects to plead guilty, the Prosecution will consider proceeding on a non-capital charge and offer him a sentence between 26-30 years’ imprisonment. However, that determination will have to be considered by the Prosecution after they have considered our Representations. Without a moment of hesitation, the Accused immediately agreed to plead guilty to the charge. I told the Accused not to make a rash decision. I provided the Accused with a piece of paper to confirm his instructions to me that he wish to plead guilty to the charge. The Accused asked me what he should write. I told him that if he wishes to plead guilty, he can write to me his instructions. He then wrote on the piece of paper I provided. After he finished writing, I told him to keep the paper with him and to take some time to think about his decision and to inform me on the following day what he intends to do and if he still wishes to plead guilty to the charge, he can than hand his written instructions to me. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Mr Pereira further added that he received the signed note from the accused on the morning of 27 July 2017. Thereafter, representations were made to the Prosecution. On 28 July 2017, Mr Pereira went through the SOF with the accused. Mr Pereira informed the accused that pleading guilty was “a choice that he has to make freely to which he responded that he understood”.

</div> Throughout the discussion, the accused maintained his decision to plead guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 When Mr Pereira visited the accused on 19 August 2017 in Changi Prison, the accused was told that the Prosecution would be seeking a sentence of at least 28 years’ imprisonment. The accused asked if Mr Pereira could request the court to impose a sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. Mr Pereira said he would try for 24 years’ to 26 years’ imprisonment. Instructions were taken to prepare for a written mitigation on his behalf. The accused did not ask to retract his plea on 19 August 2017. The first time Mr Pereira was told that the accused wanted to retract his plea was on 11 September 2017.

The accused conceded that he had agreed to plead guilty on 26 July 2017 and not on 27 July 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The accused also claimed that he had no difficulty explaining to Mr Pereira the facts of his case. He maintained that during Mr Pereira’s visit to Changi Prison on 19 August 2017, he had told Mr Pereira he wished to retract his plea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On analysis, it should be plain what the accused was <span class="font-italic">not</span> saying.  He was not challenging the procedure for or that he had entered the plea of guilt.  He had sufficient time for consideration and was granted such time as was requested to reach his decision.  The accused was not alleging that he had misunderstood the situation. Further, the accused was not criticizing Mr Pereira’s advice and conduct as counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I found that in the circumstances, the accused’s plea of guilt was voluntarily made, with full presence of mind as to the nature of the plea, the offence and the facts he was admitting to. His present allegations were a belated afterthought, and in any event, they were insufficient in law to enable him to retract his plea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 To begin, I noted that the accused’s initial account was that after 45 minutes of discussion on 26 July 2017, he refused to plead guilty. Conversely, Mr Pereira claimed the accused wished to plead guilty after the discussion “[w]ithout a moment of hesitation”.

Objectively, it was hard for the accused to deny this as his note containing his instructions was signed twice and dated twice on 26 July 2017, with a correction that indicated the accused’s mind was directed to the date. It was fairly obvious that the accused indicated he wanted to plead guilty by 26 July 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 What also could not be controverted was that the sentencing consequences of pleading guilty were explained to him.

</div> The accused’s inconsistent stance was juxtaposed against Mr Pereira’s consistent account. In my judgment, the accused’s claim that he had tried to retract his plea as early as 19 August 2017 was untrue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The foregoing findings raised the scenario that between 28 July 2017 and 11 September 2017, the accused had not notified his counsel or anyone else about the involuntariness of his plea, or his emotional state. I had serious doubts about the accused’s <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in this application and the truthfulness of the reasons stated for the change of plea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In any event, the accused had not provided the court with “valid and sufficient grounds which satisfy the [trial judge] that it is proper and in the interests of justice that he should be allowed to” retract his plea, or that indicated a qualification of his plea (<span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Kannan v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 125 (“<span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span>”) at [12], citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Sam Kim Kai</span> [1960] MLJ 265).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The above was reflected in s 228(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), which states:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">228.</span>-(4) Where the court is satisfied that any matter raised in the plea in mitigation materially affects any legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged, the court must reject the plea of guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 After an accused had admitted to the Statement of Facts and prior to sentence being passed, the issue here commonly arose in two main scenarios. The first was where the plea of guilt was qualified, whether by matters raised in mitigation (as contemplated in s 228(4) of the CPC), or by any matter that may come to the notice of the court.

The court was duty bound to enquire into the reasons for the change in mind because an “accused person cannot be permitted merely at whim to change his plea” (<span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [12], citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Sam Kim Kai</span> [1960] MLJ 265).

The Prosecution claimed that the accused had assisted a cross-border drug trafficking syndicate by bringing in large quantities of drugs on the Bus on four occasions. It was also claimed that the accused had been part of an elaborate drug trafficking scheme that involved communicating “using both Malaysian and Singapore-registered phone numbers”, and involved at least five persons – namely, “Boy”, “Abang”, Shanti, Zainudin and the accused.

Second, and to the point, I noted that <span class="font-italic">Vasentha</span> (at [39], [40], [67]) linked an accused’s culpability to the size and complexity of the drug operations.

</div> None of the additional features, as suggested by the Prosecution, as to how the drugs were concealed and delivered on prior occasions, and on this occasion, were disclosed in the SOF. There was simply no factual basis to find such an aggravating factor existed. Nevertheless, I took the view that the accused’s admission in the SOF to the uncharged offences negated the mitigating weight to the Defence’s claim that the accused was a first-time offender (<span class="font-italic">Vasentha</span> at [81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I disagreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that the accused’s lack of remorse was an additional <span class="font-italic">aggravating</span> factor, as that was confined to his attempt to retract his plea of guilt. I also noted that the accused’s late plea of guilt did save some, albeit limited, resources for the system. However, in the main, I was in agreement with the Prosecution that the mitigating weight given to the accused’s plea of guilt had to be attenuated. Here, the accused pleaded guilty only after the Prosecution’s material witness had given evidence and he had assessed his chances of succeeding at trial.  Thereafter, he effected a <span class="font-italic">volte</span><span class="font-italic">-face</span>, and sought to retract his plea. His plea was tactical, rather than remorseful.
