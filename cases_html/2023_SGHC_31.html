It was compounded by the applicant’s mistake of applying for an extension of time in the State Courts notwithstanding that it should have been filed in the High Court, given that the time for appeal had lapsed (O 55D r 14 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed)).  This is not a new rule and the legal position is clear (<span class="font-italic">Tjo</span><span class="font-italic"> Kwe In v Chia Song Kwan</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 560 at [8]). No explanation was given as to why the application was wrongly brought. Further, although the applicant was alerted to this error at a hearing in the State Courts on 1 December 2022, this application was only filed on 8 December 2022. No explanation was offered for this delay either. As a consequence, a proper application for an extension of time to appeal was only filed one month after the deadline.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I also find that insufficient reasons have been given for the delay. In the Affidavit, the applicant’s director and substantial shareholder, Ho See Peng (“Mr Ho”) admitted that he was informed of the 14-day deadline to file the appeal and was aware that it expired on 8 November 2022.

</div>  However, Mr Ho gave no explanation for why the funds could not have been secured by 8 November 2022.  Furthermore, if the applicant was aware that it would not be able to obtain funds within time, it should have filed an application with the State Courts for an extension of time before the deadline; this was not done and the omission was not explained. As noted above at [6], there was also no explanation for the application being brought wrongly in the State Courts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appeal is hopeless  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In assessing whether to grant leave for a notice of appeal to be filed out of time, the court also considers the prospects of the applicant succeeding on appeal. The court adopts a very low threshold in this merits assessment: the test is whether the appeal is “hopeless” (<span class="font-italic">ARW</span><span class="font-italic"> v Comptroller of Income Tax and another and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 499 at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 As a preliminary observation, I note that the applicant did not make any closing submissions at the trial below. It therefore offered no arguments to the learned DJ as to how the evidence, and the parties’ respective claims, should be evaluated. The applicant claimed this failure was due to a disagreement with its (then) solicitors over legal fees. No particulars were proffered, and, in any event, that is not a good explanation. The applicant could have applied for time to instruct new solicitors or to prepare closing submissions on its own. In fact, the applicant did apply for and was granted an extension of time until 23 September 2022 to file its closing submissions, but eventually did not file any. For completeness, I do not agree with the learned DJ that this, by itself, means that the applicant had abandoned its defence.  Nonetheless, this is a non-issue as the learned DJ ultimately decided this case on its merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In order to assess whether the appeal is a hopeless one, I first set out the facts agreed between the parties or found by the learned DJ, and a summary of the applicant’s case.

The varied Agreement was for the applicant to supply a different model, a CTU-20 machine, to be purchased directly from TSEM Med Swiss SA, a manufacturer in Italy (the “Italian supplier”). (The CTU-20 machine is a newer model of the CTU-18 machine, and they share substantially the same functions.)

</div>. It is not disputed that no contracts were signed for the CTU-20 machines, nor were guarantees procured.

This contradicts the applicant’s pleaded variation. Indeed, Mr Ho and Ms Thea Gonzales Caoile (“Ms Thea”), both witnesses for the applicant, gave evidence at trial that, at this meeting, the parties had agreed that the respondent would purchase one CTU-18 machine, to be obtained from the Malaysian supplier, and that two CTU-20 machines would later be procured from the Italian supplier. The July Minute expressly states that when the CTU-20 machines have been received, the CTU-18 machine would be used for mobile road shows instead.

In response, he pointed to various portions of the cross-examination of Mr Nathan but conceded that these did not support a variation either.
