<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       It has frequently been emphasised that for
                    offences where there are established sentencing precedents, “it would not
                    be proper for a trial judge to depart from such precedents without, at the very
                    least, giving cogent reasons as to why they should not be applied in the case
                    before him” (<em>Public Prosecutor v UI</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 500, CA at [17] (“<em>PP v
                        UI</em>”); <em>Public Prosecutor v Hirris anak
                        Martin</em> [2010] 2 SLR 976, CA
                    at [13]–[15]). These two appeals, MA149 and MA178 of 2010, were
                    brought by the Prosecution against the sentences imposed by the District Judge
                    (“the DJ”) on the Respondent, Chow Yee Sze, on the principal
                    ground that the DJ had departed from established sentencing benchmarks without
                    sufficient justification. After considering the evidence, I agreed with the
                    Prosecution that the departures by the DJ were indeed unwarranted. I delivered
                    my oral decision on 20 August 2010 in which I increased the sentences
                    handed down by the DJ as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">for MA 149 of 2010, I replaced the fine of $6,000
                            for DAC 36095/2008 to nine months imprisonment; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">for MA 178 of 2010, I increased the imprisonment
                            term for DAC 36097/2008 from four months to nine
                        months.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I now give my reasons for increasing the sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">MA 149 OF 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first appeal, MA149, relates to a single
                    proceeded charge, DAC 36095/2008, under s 354 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), for the use of criminal force knowing it
                    likely that it would outrage the modesty of his victim (“V1”). The
                    prescribed punishment for an offence committed under s 354 of the Penal
                    Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to two years, or with fine, or
                    with caning, or with any two of such punishments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The brief facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       V1, who was 25 years old at the time when the
                    offence took place, worked as an operations manager at a pub. On 9 January
                    2007, she went to work although she was unwell. She had taken some medication
                    before reporting for work. V1 met the Respondent, whom she had met before, at
                    the pub. She had a drink or two with the Respondent together with his friends.
                    As V1 was not feeling well, she went up to the pub’s office on the third
                    floor to rest. Shortly thereafter, the Respondent went into the office
                    (“the first incident”). V1 was resting on the sofa. Unbeknown to
                    the Respondent, the office was being monitored by a closed circuit camera
                    (“CCTV”). From the CCTV recording which I viewed, it was clear
                    that V1 was unaware of the Respondent’s presence. He stroked her head and
                    appeared to have planted two kisses on her cheek but V1 did not react. The owner
                    of the pub then entered the office and told the Respondent to leave the office.
                    The first incident lasted for about 90 seconds. About fifteen minutes later, the
                    Respondent entered the office a second time (“the second
                    incident”). On this occasion, the CCTV recorded him tickling V1’s
                    right palm, patting her head, stroking her left cheek, grabbing her hands,
                    stroking her lower body at various places including her left thigh and her
                    buttocks. It is however important to note that after each touch, the Respondent
                    would pause to observe V1’s reaction. When she did not react, he continued
                    touching her through her clothes. Finally, because she did not react <em>at all</em>, the Respondent’s hand then reached into
                    her shirt to directly touch part of her breast. V1 then woke up and pushed him
                    away. She looked visibly annoyed and told the Respondent to leave the office.
                    All in, the second incident lasted about two and a half minutes. V1 complained
                    to the pub owner and after reviewing the CCTV recording, she then lodged a
                    police complaint against the Respondent within the hour after the two
                    incidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent claimed trial to the charge. The
                    trial lasted nine days and was conducted over several tranches between
                    12 October 2009 and 18 March 2010. Over this period, the Respondent
                    changed his mind three times after indicating to the Prosecution of his
                    intention to plead guilty. On 18 March 2010, the DJ found the Respondent
                    guilty and convicted him of the above charge. The DJ found that a heavy fine
                    would be sufficient punishment and fined the Respondent $6,000 (in default, 6
                    weeks’ imprisonment). The Respondent paid $2,000 of the fine and has
                    served the default sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the unpaid
                    balance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The DJ’s decision </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In <em>Public Prosecutor v Chow
                        Yee Sze</em> [2010] SGDC 223 (“<em>GD</em>”), the DJ observed that the following factors are
                    relevant for sentencing:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the part of the body molested;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the manner in which the victim was
                            molested;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the period of time over which the act took
                            place;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the frame of mind of the offender;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the relationship between the offender and the
                            victim.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Further, the DJ also observed that the factors
                    laid down in <em>Public Prosecutor v Heng Swee Weng</em>
                    [2010] 1 SLR 954 (“<em>PP v Heng Swee
                        Weng</em>”) are equally relevant in deciding the appropriate
                    sentence for a conviction under s 354 of the Penal Code, <em>ie</em>:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">was the offence premeditated or committed on the
                            spur of the moment;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">were the circumstances in which the offence was
                            committed inherently reprehensible;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(h)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">was the offender recalcitrant; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">was the offender suffering from any mental
                            disorder or intellectual disability.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">As a matter of principle, these factors are not controversial. The
                    question, as in all cases, lies in their proper application to the facts of the
                    present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In arriving at his decision to impose a fine of
                    $6,000, the DJ then took into account the following facts:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">no force or violence was used and V1 did not have
                            to struggle to free herself;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he touched V1 over her clothes and did not
                            attempt to undress her;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he did not touch V1’s sexual
                        organs;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">his touches were quick and brief and were not
                            committed over a prolonged period of time;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">his contact on V1’s breast was a fleeting
                            one;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he was a first offender; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the IMH report dated 10 December 2009
                            prepared by Dr Tomita.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After reviewing the evidence, in my judgment,
                    the sentence imposed by the DJ for DAC 36095/2008 was manifestly inadequate and
                    my reasons are set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentencing benchmark</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The well-established sentencing benchmark is
                        <em>nine months’ imprisonment with caning as a starting
                        point</em> for molest or outrage of modesty under s 354 of the
                    Penal Code where “a victim’s private parts or sexual organs [were]
                    intruded” (<em>Chandresh Patel v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1 CLAS News 323; MA 357/1993
                        (“<em>Chandresh Patel</em>”), per Yong
                    Pung How CJ). The DJ specifically referred to this sentencing benchmark at [7]
                    of his <em>GD</em>. Since <em>Chandresh
                        Patel</em>, the nine months’ imprisonment plus caning benchmark
                    has consistently been considered by the courts to be the <em>correct benchmark</em> for s 354 offences over the past 15
                    years: referred to recently in <em>PP v Heng Swee Weng</em>
                    where a taxi-driver who pleaded guilty to hugging his 15-year old passenger was
                    sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment; also <em>Yu Eng
                        Chin v Public Prosecutor</em> [2009] SGHC 57 where Choo J
                    referred to the benchmark in <em>Chandresh Patel</em> and
                    did not find the sentences of 12 months and 18 months manifestly
                    excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     A helpful survey of the sentencing precedents
                    for a conviction under s 354 of the Penal Code can be found in the decision
                    of <em>Public Prosecutor v Ho Ah Hoo Steven</em>
                    [2007] SGDC 162 wherein it affirms the general benchmark set by
                        <em>Chandresh Patel</em> (at [86]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A survey of the sentencing precedents reveals that where the molest
                        involves an interference with the victim’s breasts and moderate force
                        was used, sentences of between 6 to 12 months’ jail have been
                        imposed:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It is apparent from the above survey that most
                    of the cases did not involve use of force or coercion and were typically
                    fleeting in nature. Yet each of them was sentenced between six to nine months.
                    The law is clear that the touching of a private part of the body by itself would
                    typically attract a <em>custodial sentence</em>, even if it
                    was a fleeting touch and where no force was used (see <em>Kwan
                        Peng Hong v Public Prosecutor</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 824 at
                    [64]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here, it was amply justified for the trial judge to impose a sentence of
                        imprisonment. <em>The appellant had touched the underarm that
                            included a small part at the side of the complainant's right breast. It
                            was a soft touch. It lasted only a few seconds. Although the act of
                            molest was minor and neither force nor coercion was used, the touch was
                            on a private body part of the complainant. In such cases, there must be
                            a sentence of imprisonment</em>. The court must convey the
                        disapprobation with which the court views such offences. The message must be
                        unequivocal. The court will step in to maintain law and order, when
                        individuals feel inclined to give in to certain impulses. And the court will
                        maintain this with robust sanction. A fine will send a wrong signal to the
                        public, at least in terms of deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     A fine would only suffice if the act of molest
                    was a relatively minor one: see <em>Teo Keng Pong v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 890 where a tuition teacher
                    with no antecedents was fined $500 on each charge for four charges for caressing
                    a student’s thigh and a fifth charge of caressing her thigh and squeezing
                    her back; and <em>Soh Yang Tick v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1998] 1 SLR(R) 209 where an employer was fined $2,000 for slapping
                    his secretary’s buttock lightly on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">This Court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As the DJ imposed only a fine on the
                    Respondent in the present case, this amounted to a clear and marked departure
                    from the established benchmark set by the sentencing precedents. It is therefore
                    imperative to examine the reasons provided by the DJ for doing so. Before
                    examining his reasons, I should add that I do not disagree with the DJ’s
                    observation at [16] of his <em>GD</em> that every sentence
                    must fit the crime and that the lower courts must not place sentencing
                    precedents “on an altar and obsessively worship them”. However,
                    these precedents are there for good reasons, <em>ie</em> to
                    provide consistency and rationality in sentencing, and it is for the trial judge
                    to provide cogent and proper reasons when departing from them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Reading the <em>GD</em>
                    on the whole, it seems to me that the DJ’s approach in determining the
                    appropriate sentence was to evaluate whether any of the facts amounted to
                    aggravating factors and in arriving at his finding that none was present, he
                    thereby concluded that a heavy fine would suffice. With respect, such an
                    approach is flawed. The lack of aggravating factors in itself would not be
                    sufficient to justify a fine instead of a custodial sentence where the
                    molestation involved touching the private parts of the victim. In other words,
                    the lack of aggravating factors cannot be construed as a mitigating factor. In
                    any event, for the reasons as explained in <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>–<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> below, there
                    were in fact aggravating factors in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In my view, the correct approach for
                    sentencing should generally be as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ascertain whether there is any
                        established sentencing benchmark for the type of offence in question and the
                        range of such benchmark.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the punishment prescribed for the offence provides the
                        court with the option of imposing a custodial sentence or a fine, to
                        determine whether the starting benchmark ought to be a custodial sentence
                        given the nature of the offence. For example, under s 354 of the Penal Code
                        where the molestation involved a private part of the victim; or under
                        s 323 of the Penal Code where the victim of assault is a public
                        transport worker (<em>Wong Hoi Len v Public
                            Prosecutor</em>
                    [2009] 1 SLR(R) 115).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     Determine whether there are <em>recognised</em> mitigating factors to justify a departure from
                        the established sentencing precedent or to impose the lower end of the
                        range. If none exists or none of any significance, generally the benchmark
                        should be followed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     Examine whether there are <em>recognised</em>
                        aggravating factors of sufficient gravity to either impose the higher end of
                        the range or to warrant an increase from the sentencing
                    precedent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     If there
                        are both mitigating and aggravating factors present in the case, which is
                        not uncommon, both of them should be properly balanced so as to ensure that
                        the overall punishment fits the crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Such an approach
                    will seek to ensure that when a trial judge decides to depart from the relevant
                    sentencing precedents, he directly addresses his mind to the facts of the
                    particular case to provide good and cogent reasons for doing so. Needless to
                    say, such an approach is only intended to be a guideline as the DJ rightly
                    observed (<em>GD</em> at [16]), since “no two cases
                    can ever be completely identical or symmetrical”. The difference in every
                    case lies in the details. That is precisely the reason why the evidence before
                    the trial judge must be carefully analysed and considered before deciding on the
                    appropriate sentence. To quote Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 707 (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Judges should not blindly apply any sentencing principle without
                        considering all the circumstances of the case at hand, especially the
                        culpability of the accused in that particular case. <em>It
                            cannot be over emphasised that the court must apply its mind to the
                            facts of each case before it and determine the appropriate sentence
                            accordingly</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should add that for this case, the task of the DJ was made easier by
                    the fact that the entire incident was actually captured by CCTV
                    recording.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In arriving at the sentence, the DJ took into
                    account the following facts (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">no force or violence was used and V1 did not have

                            prepared by Dr Tomita.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Did the above facts justify the DJ’s
                    departure from the sentencing benchmark? In my view, there was no justification
                    to do so. First, there was no need for the Respondent to resort to force or
                    violence given that V1 was semi-conscious due to a combination of factors,
                        <em>viz</em> she was under the weather, the effects of
                    her medication and the alcohol that she had consumed earlier. Furthermore,
                    although the presence of force or violence would be an aggravating factor, the
                    lack thereof is not in itself a mitigating factor. In the present case, the lack
                    of force, violence or a struggle was due to V1’s condition which the
                    Respondent was well aware of at the material time. It pointed to the fact that
                    the Respondent had taken advantage of V1 while she was unwell and vulnerable. In
                    my view, this was in fact <em>an aggravating
                    factor</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Secondly, while the Respondent touched V1 over
                    her clothes for the most part, he did finally touch the bare skin of her breast
                    by placing his hand under her shirt. Furthermore, the Respondent had touched V1
                        <em>numerous</em> times all over her body: on her
                    hands, face, thigh, calf, and buttocks in addition to her breast. It was obvious
                    that the Respondent had become more emboldened after he realised that given
                    V1’s condition, she was either not going to put up a struggle or was
                    oblivious to his groping and this led him to reach under her shirt to touch her
                    breast. Although the Respondent did not touch V1’s sexual organs, the
                    deliberate and calculated manner in which he touched V1’s breast was
                    sufficient to attract a custodial sentence (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). The Respondent only stopped the molestation after
                    V1 woke up and told him to leave the office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Thirdly, I disagree with the DJ’s
                    finding that the Respondent’s touches were not conducted over a prolonged
                    period of time. The Respondent had touched V1 repeatedly over a period of about
                    two and a half minutes even without taking into account the first incident which
                    lasted some 90 seconds. As observed earlier from the CCTV recording, the
                    Respondent would pause after each touch to see the reaction or lack thereof from
                    V1. He wanted to see how far he could get away with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Although the Respondent’s touch of
                    V1’s breast was fleeting, this was simply because V1 had reacted
                    immediately to his invasion of her modesty. From the CCTV recording, it was
                    clear to me that if V1 had not woken up in reaction to his touch of her breast,
                    he would have continued. V1‘s evidence at the trial was that she woke up
                    because she felt something near her heart area. In any event, offences committed
                    under s 354 of the Penal Code typically involve acts that are brief and
                    fleeting because the victim would often react by struggling or escaping. Acts of
                    molest for periods longer than a fleeting moment would usually involve the use
                    of coercion such as force or violence which would be an aggravating factor.
                    Accordingly, the fact that the touch on V1’s breast was fleeting in
                    circumstances peculiar to this case did not justify the imposition of a fine
                    instead of a custodial sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Finally, the fact that he was a first offender
                    is in itself a neutral factor as it is not necessarily positive evidence of good
                    character: <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Fook Sum</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 1022. On the other hand, the presence of antecedents would
                    often lead to an enhanced sentence: <em>Md Anverdeen Basheer
                        Ahmed and Others v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2004] SGHC 233.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aggravating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Once each of the factors that the DJ took into
                    account is closely examined, it is clear that none of them, either singly or
                    collectively, justified the departure from the sentencing benchmark. The absence
                    of mitigating factors must, however, be contrasted with the presence of
                    aggravating factors in this case. First, the Respondent’s acts of molest
                    were clearly deliberate. By returning to the office the second time to continue
                    to molest V1 after having been told by the pub owner to leave some 15 minutes
                    earlier, it was obvious that he was intent on criminal conduct. This, I found,
                    was particularly aggravating. The Respondent admitted that he was not
                    intoxicated and therefore his judgment was not in any way impaired when he
                    committed the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Secondly, the Respondent showed no remorse and
                    denied any wrongdoing even when confronted with incontrovertible evidence. He
                    claimed to be uninterested in women in a desperate attempt to escape liability.
                    Subsequently, he claimed trial even though the CCTV recording clearly showed
                    that he had committed the offence. By putting V1 through the agony of the trial
                    and in the process forcing her to re-live the unpleasant and embarrassing
                    experience in watching the CCTV footage of the molestation, the Respondent has
                    shown himself to be completely unremorseful of his behaviour. Finally, the
                    Respondent made three about turns after indicating to the Prosecution of his
                    intention to plead guilty. The Respondent’s conduct spoke of his blatant
                    refusal to take responsibility for his reprehensible behaviour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Thirdly, as explained at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above, the Respondent molested V1 when he
                    knew she was unwell and as such took advantage of her condition to violate her
                    modesty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     After noting the absence of mitigating
                    circumstances and the presence of some aggravating factors, I found no
                    justifiable reason to depart from the established benchmark. The present case
                    bears no similarity whatsoever with the cases in which only a fine was imposed.
                    Accordingly, I replaced the Respondent’s original sentence of a fine of
                    $6,000 (in default, 6 weeks’ imprisonment) for DAC 36095/2008 with a
                    sentence of nine months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">MA 178 OF 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     This appeal relates to DAC 36097/2008 which
                    was one of seven charges brought against the Respondent. Four of them were for
                    outrage of modesty against a different victim (“V2”) under
                    s 354 of the Penal Code. The remaining three were for criminal intimidation
                    under s 506 of the Penal Code and were unrelated to the charges under
                    s 354. The Prosecution proceeded on one charge under s 354, DAC
                    36097/2008, against the Respondent with the remaining three charges taken into
                    account for the purpose of sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The brief facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 16 August 2006, the Respondent
                    contacted V2 for an interview because she had indicated an interest to join his
                    modelling agency. She met him at about 10.30pm at the Coco Latte, a bar located
                    at the Gallery Hotel. The Respondent then told V2 that he planned to use her to
                    model for two of his magazines, FHM and Maxim. To do so, he wanted to examine
                    her body <em>as a matter of standard protocol</em>. The
                    Respondent suggested that the examination take place in the toilet. V2
                    reluctantly agreed and accompanied the Respondent into the toilet. Once in the
                    toilet, V2 removed her clothes down to her undergarments at the request of the
                    Respondent. When he asked her to remove her undergarments, she refused. The
                    Respondent then suddenly extended his left hand to reach into V2’s
                    brassiere to caress her left breast. V2 reacted immediately and pushed the
                    Respondent away. She then left the toilet after putting on her clothes. The
                    other three charges under s 354 against the Respondent which were taken
                    into account related to separate acts of molest, one of which occurred on the
                    same day as DAC 36097/2008 while the other two incidents occurred on different
                    days, <em>ie</em> 17 and 23 August 2006. These
                    incidents of molest therefore predated the charge under MA 149 of
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The DJ’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Respondent pleaded guilty to DAC
                    36097/2008 and agreed for the remaining three charges to be taken into
                    consideration for sentencing. The DJ sentenced the Respondent to four
                    months’ imprisonment for DAC 36097/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The facts that the DJ took into account in
                    arriving at the sentence were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     V2 was not forced to attend the
                        interview and had expressed an interest to join the Respondent’s
                        modelling agency.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Although V2 was reluctant, she agreed to follow the Respondent into
                        the unisex toilet to allow him to examine her body.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     No force or violence was used by the
                        Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        Respondent did not use false pretences to lure V2; he was not pretending
                        when he asked V2 to meet him at the bar, Coco Latte, for the interview or
                        when she went to the toilet together with the Respondent to be
                        examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"></a>(e)     V2
                        could have refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_f"></a>(f)     V2 did not have to struggle to free herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_g"></a>(g)     There was no prolonged act of
                        molestation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">This Court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before going into my decision, I pause here to
                    take note of the incongruity between the sentences imposed by the DJ for DAC
                    36095/2008 (the subject matter of MA 149) and for DAC 36097/2008 (the subject
                    matter of MA 178). In my view, the facts in DAC 36095/2008 involving V1 (at
                        <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above) are far more compelling than
                    that in DAC 36097/2008 to warrant a custodial sentence. However, in the latter
                    case, the DJ sentenced the Respondent to four months’ imprisonment after
                    he pleaded guilty to the charge. This is to be contrasted with DAC 36095/2008
                    where the same DJ inexplicably imposed only a fine even though the Respondent
                    was completely unremorseful in claiming trial in circumstances when the CCTV
                    recording clearly proved the various acts of molestation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It was conceded that the Respondent did insert
                    his hand into V2’s brassiere to caress her left breast
                directly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     While V2 was a willing participant insofar as
                    she had reluctantly agreed to allow the Respondent to view her body while in her
                    undergarments to ascertain her suitability to pose for the Respondent’s
                    magazines, it was incorrect to suggest that she had in some way afforded the
                    Respondent with the opportunity to reach out to molest her or that the
                    Respondent was only acting on the spur of the moment. There was also no question
                    of consent here given that the Respondent had pleaded guilty to the charge. It
                    is pertinent to mention that when the Respondent asked V2 to remove her
                    undergarments, she flatly refused. In response to her refusal, the Respondent
                    reached out to caress her breast under her brassiere. The DJ found that there
                    was no evidence that he had lured V2 into the toilet in order to molest her
                    because this point was not stated in the Agreed Statement of Facts. In my view,
                    this was an entirely permissible inference to be drawn from the agreed facts.
                    His conduct was clearly premeditated. His action showed that he had lured V2
                    into the toilet on the pretext of viewing her body with the ulterior motive to
                    take advantage of her. The Respondent’s <em>immediate</em> reaction in reaching out to caress her breast when V2
                    refused to remove her undergarments indicated that it was his intention all
                    along to molest her. This must be distinguished from a situation where an
                    employer had slapped his secretary’s buttock on the spur of the moment.
                    Here, the Respondent had deliberately placed her in a vulnerable position so as
                    to afford himself with an opportunity to molest her. In short, he sought to take
                    advantage of V2’s aspirations to work as a model. His subsequent acts of
                    molest against her in the other charges bear out his intention to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     From a perusal of the facts that the DJ took
                    into account, it is apparent that none of them were mitigating factors in favour
                    of the Respondent. Again, if there had been prolonged molestation, or if the
                    Respondent had used force and violence, or had coerced or lured V2 using false
                    pretences, they would have operated as <em>aggravating
                        factors</em>. However, the lack of such factors in itself did not
                    justify a departure from the established benchmark. At most, it was a relevant
                    consideration in not enhancing the sentence beyond the benchmark. However, on
                    the facts of this charge, I in fact found that the Respondent did lure V2 into
                    the toilet to exploit her aspirations to work as a model so as to take advantage
                    of her. In my view, this fact amounted to an aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges taken into consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Furthermore, three charges (“TIC
                    charges”) were to be taken into account for sentencing. Such TIC charges
                    would generally result in an <em>enhanced</em> sentence
                    particularly where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar
                    in nature as they would show that the offender was recalcitrant (<em>eg</em> if both sets of offences consist of sexual offences
                    against the same victim): <em>PP v UI</em> and <em>Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 439 at [19].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Three of the TIC charges were for similar
                    offences committed against V2 over the span of one week. For the second charge,
                    on the same day that the Respondent had caressed V2’s left breast, the
                    Respondent had pinched V2’s buttocks several times. The following day, the
                    Respondent had brushed his hand across V2’s cleavage, which formed the
                    subject of the fourth charge. Six days later, the Respondent pinched V’s
                    buttocks again, which resulted in the fifth charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The above acts committed by the Respondent
                    over the following week clearly betrayed a lack of remorse after having outraged
                    the modesty of V2 in the toilet. Evidently, V2 finally decided that she could no
                    longer tolerate the Respondent’s continuing sexual harassment when she
                    decided to file the police report against him. All this seems to have been
                    overlooked by the DJ in sentencing the Respondent to an imprisonment term of
                    only four months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For MA 149, there was only one proceeded
                    charge, <em>ie</em> DAC 36095/2008, while for MA 178, in
                    addition to DAC 36097/2008, three further charges of a similar nature were to be
                    taken into account for sentencing. If not for the Respondent’s guilty
                    plea, the sentence for DAC 36097/2008 should have been higher than DAC
                    36095/2008. Taking into account the guilty plea and the TIC charges, I decided
                    to impose the same sentence and therefore replaced the DJ’s sentence for
                    DAC 36097/2008 of four months’ imprisonment with a term of nine
                    months’ imprisonment instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Caning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As stated in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, any mental disorder and/or intellectual disability of
                    the offender are relevant considerations in deciding the appropriate sentence
                    – see <em>PP v Heng Swee Weng</em>. For sentencing,
                    various psychiatric assessment reports were submitted by the Respondent to show
                    that he was suffering from stress and a personality disorder. The Respondent was
                    treated with mood-stabilising, antidepressant, and sleep medications. The
                    reports stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Respondent
                    suffers from personality problems – “mainly anger management
                    issues, impulsivity and emotional disability” and “extreme mood
                    instability that often leads to impulsive and self-destructive
                    behaviour”. The reports also stated that the Respondent’s ability
                    to function has been compromised further by alcohol and benzodiazepine
                    dependence, which have been escalating for the past two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having gone through the sentencing precedents,
                    I found that caning was not meted out in every case where there was touching of
                    a victim’s breast. In fact, in response to my question whether caning is
                    the norm for cases where the offence involved touching of the victim’s
                    breast, the Prosecution, to its credit, drew my attention to several recent
                    cases where caning was not ordered. While the Respondent’s personality
                    problems and substance dependence have no direct relevance to the commission of
                    the offences, in that the Respondent knew the nature of his acts and understood
                    that he was breaking the law, I took them into account in sparing him from
                    caning. In my judgment, the longer custodial sentences that I have imposed are
                    sufficient punishment for his offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     By reason of my findings, I substituted the
                    sentences imposed by the DJ as follows:</p>
