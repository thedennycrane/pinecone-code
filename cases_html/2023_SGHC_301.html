</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis and decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a reasonable suspicion that there were further documents to be discovered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It is axiomatic that an affidavit verifying a party’s list of documents is <span class="font-italic">generally</span> regarded as conclusive. However, the court may order further discovery if it has a reasonable suspicion that there are further documents to be discovered: <span class="font-italic">Soh Lup Chee and others v Seow Boon Cheng and another </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 604 at [9]. That suspicion may arise because the disclosed documents themselves demonstrate that there are other underlying documents that are in the party’s PCP and have not been disclosed; or it could, in an appropriate case, be inferred from the circumstances that there are or must be other documents in the party’s PCP that have not been disclosed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In the present case, as I mentioned at [15] above, the 2nd defendant’s LOD in S 188 consisted of only six documents. Not a single communication between the 2nd defendant and his employees and/or fellow directors was disclosed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my view, a reasonable suspicion did exist that there were further documents relating to the matters in question in S 188 to be discovered, for example communications between the 2nd defendant and his employees and/or fellow directors, and that such communications could be found in the Compound Documents. In this regard, it was not contested that the Compound Documents comprise the 2nd defendant’s <span class="font-italic">personal</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>mobile phones and <span class="font-italic">personal</span> email accounts. I was satisfied that a reasonable suspicion did exist that other relevant documents, such as communications between the 2nd defendant and his employees and/or fellow directors in HLT, OTPL, UTPL and UTSS on matters directly or indirectly relevant to the issues to be determined in S 188, were likely to exist among the Compound Documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 To be clear, before an order for further discovery may be made in such circumstances, it is not necessary, and neither is it a prerequisite, that the applicant must make out a case that the defendant has suppressed or is continuing to suppress documents. For the avoidance of doubt, I made no such findings in arriving at my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Compound Documents were in the possession, custody or power of the 2nd defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Apart from demonstrating the likely existence of further documents that have not been disclosed by an opposing party, the applicant would also need to demonstrate that those documents are in the PCP of the opposing party. In this case, the question of whether the Compound Documents were in the 2nd defendant’s PCP was vigorously contested. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The law is clear that a party has a duty to take reasonable steps to search for relevant and material documents and to be satisfied that he has complied with his discovery obligations, <span class="font-italic">before</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the affidavit verifying the list of documents can properly be treated as conclusive. This would include the usual statement in the verifying affidavit that the deponent does not have any other document in his PCP. Where the documents may lie with a <span class="font-italic">third party</span>, the duty extends to making reasonable efforts to request for the relevant documents: <span class="font-italic">Saxo Bank A/S v Innopac Holdings Ltd </span>[2022] 3 SLR 964 at [63]; <span class="font-italic">SK Shipping Co Ltd v IOF Pte Ltd </span>[2012] SGHCR 14 at [38]; <span class="font-italic">Hai Jiao 1306 Ltd and others v Yaw Chee Siew </span>[2020] 3 SLR 142 (“<span class="font-italic">Hai Jiao</span>”) at [47]; <span class="font-italic">Phones 4U (in administration) v EE Ltd and others </span>[2021] EWCA Civ 116 at [26] and [28]. In my view, that must be the case; otherwise, the mere fact that documents (including in this case, the Compound Documents) lie with a third party would be a “convenient ruse” for not providing discovery, even if those documents could be easily requested from the third party: <span class="font-italic">Hai Jiao </span>at [47]. A particularly wily defendant could even deliberately put documents within the possession of a third party in order to then use that as an excuse not to provide discovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The 2nd defendant’s argument was that there could be no obligation to take reasonable investigative steps <span class="font-italic">because</span> he had no PCP over the Compound Documents. I was not convinced by this argument, which was in any event not supported by any authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The submission that PCP is a <span class="font-italic">prerequisite </span>for the obligation to take reasonable steps to search for the Compound Documents is, in my view, artificial and practically illogical. The very purpose of taking reasonable investigative steps is to determine whether the requested documents come within the party’s PCP in the first place, in order for that party to then be satisfied that he has properly complied with his discovery obligations. The 2nd defendant’s argument was therefore circuitous. The obligation to take reasonable steps to search for the relevant and material documents on the one hand, and PCP on the other, cannot be decoupled in the way the 2nd defendant envisioned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Further, even taking the 2nd defendant’s case at its highest, the plaintiff had, in my view, established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the 2nd defendant <span class="font-italic">did</span> have <span class="font-italic">power </span>over the Compound Documents. In this regard, where the producing party has the practical ability to access or obtain documents held in the possession of the third party, the producing party may be found to have a sufficient degree of control as to constitute power; the practical ability to obtain those documents is to be seen and assessed in context: <span class="font-italic">Hai Jiao </span>at [46]; <span class="font-italic">Dirak Asia Pte Ltd and another v Chew Hua Kok and another </span>[2013] SGHCR 1 at [35]–[36]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the present case, it was not disputed that the Compound Documents comprised the 2nd defendant’s <span class="font-italic">personal</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>mobile<span class="font-italic"> </span>phones and email accounts. It was, firstly, open to the 2nd defendant to request for new SIM cards from his telcos in order to access the recovery codes from his Handphones to retrieve his “Lonestar” Yahoo Email Account. I did not accept that the only way to access the recovery codes was for the 2nd defendant to <span class="font-italic">physically</span> have the Handphones in question or the particular SIM cards within them. The 2nd defendant could have also written to the HLT Liquidators to seek their assistance to use the HLT Email Account for the simple purpose of retrieving the recovery codes for both his “Lonestar” Email Accounts. He could have also written to the CAD to request for either the return of the Handphones or a clone copy of the Handphones (including the WhatsApp messages therein), explaining that he needed to access the recovery codes from his Handphones in order to disclose any relevant communications contained therein for the purposes of S 188. The 2nd defendant did not avail himself of any of these options. Nor did he even attempt to do so. In those circumstances, it was not open to the 2nd defendant to sit on his hands and do nothing, and then claim a practical inability to access or obtain documents. Otherwise, the court would be permitting the 2nd defendant to stand in his own way and block his own path.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 My analysis above is sufficient to distinguish the present case from <span class="font-italic">Lonrho</span>, which the 2nd defendant sought to rely on for the proposition that “power” must mean “a presently enforceable legal right to obtain from whoever actually holds the document inspection of it without the need to obtain the consent of anyone else” (at 635). In <span class="font-italic">Lonrho</span>, the House of Lords held that the defendants did not have “power” over documents in the possession of their subsidiary companies as control over those documents was vested in the subsidiary companies’ board of directors and the defendants had no legal right to inspect or take copies of them (at 634). The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Lonrho </span>contended that the defendants could have taken a series of steps to acquire such a legal right, such as procuring the subsidiary companies to alter their articles of association and to apply for a ministerial licence permitting the disclosure (as disclosure of those documents was otherwise prohibited under the local law of some of these subsidiaries) (at 634–635). The House of Lords found that “in the absence of a presently enforceable right”, the defendants were not compelled to take such steps to acquire such a legal right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It was plain to me that <span class="font-italic">Lonrho </span>dealt with significantly different circumstances from those in the present case. Indeed, Lord Diplock expressed in <span class="font-italic">Lonrho</span> that the appeal was dismissed “on its own special facts” (at 636). In my view, the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Lonrho </span>that “power” must mean “a presently enforceable legal right” over the documents must be understood in its context. In <span class="font-italic">Lonrho</span>, discovery was sought from the defendant companies of documents that belonged to and were in the possession of the defendants’ subsidiary companies, which were in turn distinct and separate legal entities governed by their own respective boards of directors, who held the keys to those documents.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Even if I were to accept the 2nd defendant’s arguments that applying <span class="font-italic">Lornho</span>, the court must first find that the party has a “presently enforceable legal right” to the documents <span class="font-italic">before</span> the court can consider that the party has power over those documents and thus can be ordered to disclose them, I was of the view that the 2nd defendant <span class="font-italic">did</span> have those rights over all of the Compound Documents. After all, they are all <span class="font-italic">his</span> <span class="font-italic">personal</span> documents – unlike the documents in question in <span class="font-italic">Lornho</span>, which effectively belonged to third parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For the “Lonestar” Email Accounts, the fact that the password recovery modes might <span class="font-italic">reside</span> with a third party did not, in my judgment, dilute the 2nd defendant’s legal right to the “Lonestar” Email Accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As for the Handphones, it is clear from <span class="font-italic">Goldring Timothy Nicholas and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[2013] 3 SLR 487 that the 2nd defendant did have a common law legal right to gain access to the Handphones, whether by way of a request to the CAD for a copy or clone of the contents of the Handphones, or the right to have the Handphones returned to him. The fact that these rights may not be unqualified was beside the point and in fact, missed the forest for the trees. What was undeniable was that there still existed, in the 2nd defendant’s favour, a <span class="font-italic">legally enforceable right</span> to the Handphones and/or their contents. Thus, even on the 2nd defendant’s case, applying the “presently enforceable legal right” test <span class="font-italic">per</span> <span class="font-italic">Lornho</span> did not support his case that he had no PCP over the Compound Documents. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Compound Documents were relevant and necessary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42  I was also satisfied that the plaintiff had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the Compound Documents were likely to be relevant (or contain documents that were relevant) to the pleaded issues in question in this case, and that the said documents were necessary for the fair disposal of the matter. Counsel for the 2nd defendant, Mr Darius Lim, did not raise any serious argument or objections at the hearing before me to contest the requirements of relevance or necessity, and submitted that he could not comment as he did not have access to the Compound Documents or the discrete documents within them.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The plaintiff’s case against the 2nd defendant in S 188 is that the 2nd defendant was involved in, had knowledge of and/or had acquiesced in numerous wrongful acts against the plaintiff. To recapitulate, these include unauthorised dealings with, and making false declarations in respect of, cargo that had been pledged to various security holders including the plaintiff, with the aid of the UT Facility; the buying and selling of non-existent cargo for the purposes of obtaining financing from banks including the plaintiff; and fabricating various documents such as bills of lading, sale contracts and invoices for the purposes of obtaining the said financing (see [11]–[12] above). The 2nd defendant’s case is that he did not carry out HLT’s, OTPL’s, UTPL’s and UTSS’ day to day operations or commercial activities, and neither did he instruct and/or supervise the employees who carried out the day to day operational and commercial activities of those companies; therefore, he was unaware of the alleged wrongful acts (see [14] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In relation to the “Lonestar” Hotmail Account, it was not disputed by the 2nd Defendant that emails from the 2nd defendant’s HLT Email Account were forwarded to his “Lonestar” Hotmail Account, and that the 2nd defendant’s “Lonestar” Hotmail Account was regularly blind copied in emails pertaining to HLT’s day to day operational and commercial matters (see [17] above). In my view, the emails in the “Lonestar” Hotmail Account would thus be relevant and necessary as they could show the information that the 2nd defendant had sight of at the material time, including whether he had given any instructions to his employees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As for the “Lonestar” Yahoo Email Account, its existence was volunteered by the 2nd defendant himself in his solicitors’ letter dated 28 November 2022 (see [18] above) and his affidavit dated 10 January 2023 (see [20] above). It also shares the same email name (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “lonestar286”) as his “Lonestar” Hotmail Account. I was thus of the view that there was a reasonable suspicion that the “Lonestar” Yahoo Email Account could contain similarly relevant and necessary information. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As regards the Handphones, there was evidence showing that the 2nd defendant used the WhatsApp platform to communicate with at least one of his employees in UTSS at the material time (between October 2019 and April 2020) on work-related issues.

</div> In my view, the WhatsApp messages and other communications in the 2nd defendant’s Handphones, between the 2nd defendant and his employees and/or fellow directors in HLT, OTPL, UTPL and UTSS, could show the nature and extent of the interactions between the parties and possibly reveal documents both directly and indirectly relevant to the dispute in S 188. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ancillary orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Finally, I did not agree with the 2nd defendant’s submissions against para 1(2)(ii) of the AR’s order below in SUM 878, which required the 2nd defendant to state in his affidavit the steps taken to locate and obtain the Compound Documents and why they were unsuccessful, and to provide the correspondence exchanged between the 2nd defendant, and the CAD and the HLT Liquidators respectively. The 2nd defendant contended that this was not part of the plaintiff’s original application and was only raised at the hearing before the AR. Accordingly, it was contended on behalf of the 2nd defendant that he did not have the opportunity to properly respond to this expanded relief sought by the plaintiff and the ancillary order ought not to have been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I disagreed with the 2nd defendant and found the objection to be a technical one. The order made by the AR was an ancillary order which the court clearly has the inherent power to make in order to effectively police its main discovery orders. In my view, the ancillary order was necessary and reasonable. The purpose of that order was so that the 2nd defendant would be required to demonstrate to the plaintiff and the court that he had complied with the discovery order not just in letter but also in substance, especially if his requests to the CAD and the HLT Liquidators were unsuccessful. There was no need for the ancillary order to be specifically prayed for by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For the reasons set out above, I dismissed RA 100 and fixed the costs of RA 100 in the sum of S$10,000 (including disbursements) to be paid by the 2nd defendant to the plaintiff. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan J<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yap Yin Soon, Dorcas Seah Yi Hui (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Darius Malachi Lim Wen Hong, Lim Dao Yuan Keith (Damodara Ong LLC) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Shalini Rajasegar (Advocatus Law LLP) for the third defendant (watching brief);</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Yu Lun, Darrell (Wong &amp; Leow LLC) for the fourth defendant (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
