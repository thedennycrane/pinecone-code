</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Rapyd contends that the communications made at the 29 August Meeting are protected by Privilege, as are certain communications made before and after the 29 August Meeting. Rapyd therefore seeks to strike out paragraphs 22 and 36 of the SOC, and the relevant Particulars, on the basis that the communications pleaded are subject to Privilege. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Mr Hall makes two main submissions. First, that Privilege does not apply as there had been no dispute that the parties were trying to settle at the material time. Second, even if there had been a dispute, Privilege still does not apply as Mr Shtilman had made an admission of liability at the 29 August Meeting. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The applicable legal principles are settled. At common law, “without prejudice” privilege derives from the policy of encouraging settlements: <span class="font-italic">Mariwu Industrial Co (S) Pte Ltd v Dextra Asia Co Ltd and another </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 807 (“<span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span>”) at [24]. In effect, communications between parties protected by without prejudice privilege which were made in the course of negotiations for a settlement are not admissible: <span class="font-italic">Quek Kheng Leong Nicky and another v Teo Beng Ngoh and others and another appeal </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 181 at [22]. This stems from the principle that parties should be encouraged as far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations may be used to their prejudice in the course of future proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head </span>[1984] Ch 290 at 306. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Section 23 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”) is a statutory enactment of Privilege, as held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mariwu </span>at [24]. Section 23 of the Evidence Act provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Admissions in civil cases when relevant</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23.—(1)  In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it is made —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) upon circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 It is trite law that there are two prerequisites before Privilege can be invoked. The first is that the communication must constitute or involve an “admission”, namely, statements or actions that appear on their face to go against the interest of the maker. The second is that the communications (in respect of which the privilege is claimed) must have arisen in the course of negotiations to settle a dispute: <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA</span><span class="font-italic"> and others and other appeals</span> [2018] 1 SLR 894 (“<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span>”) at [67] and [89].

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 26 August 2022, Mr Hall expressed his gratitude to Mr Yarbrough for giving him “the heads up that Rapyd is considering cutting [Mr Hall’s] pay – again” and that he wanted Mr Yarbrough to know that when Mr Hall was “officially told [his] agreement won’t be honoured [he] will be resigning”. Mr Hall said that “[r]emuneration is why” Mr Hall did what he did. Taking it away from him would be “a mortal blow”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 28 August 2022, Mr Hall told Mr Yarbrough that it was “disgusting” that Rapyd wanted to steal from Mr Hall when he was so dedicated. Mr Hall also said that he had told Mr Gomez that he would be resigning.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Yarbrough asked Mr Hall on 28 August 2022 if he had had his “1:1 [meeting] with [Mr Shtilman] yet?”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for Mr Hall submitted that these messages do not constitute evidence of any dispute between the parties about Mr Hall’s compensation or commission payments in relation to the Funding Societies deal. Rather, they only provide evidence of Mr Hall’s concerns about stock grants or not receiving inflation adjustments in his pay, which he mentioned in the same set of messages to Mr Yarbrough around 6 July 2022. Counsel for Mr Hall also submitted that other messages between Mr Hall and Mr Yarbrough, such as a message where Mr Hall had expressed his disappointment that Rapyd “blocked and again destroyed the other Funding Socities [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] deals [Mr Hall] salvaged”, only related to Mr Hall’s concerns of generating future revenue and not past payments of commissions already earned from the Funding Societies Deal. However, counsel for Mr Hall acknowledged that even as of 6 July 2022, Mr Hall had complained that he had not been paid his commission for the first two quarters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 With respect, I have several difficulties accepting these submissions. First, by referring to stock grants, not receiving inflation adjustments in his pay or not receiving his commission for the first two quarters, Mr Hall was clearly referring to past payment issues. Counsel for Mr Hall’s submission that the messages were about <span class="font-italic">future</span> revenue issues was thus contradicted by counsel’s other submission referring to stock grants and not receiving inflation adjustment in Mr Hall’s pay. Counsel for Mr Hall further submitted at the hearing that Mr Yarbrough had not filed any affidavit to explain the messages, but that does not help advance Mr Hall’s case here, since the relevant statements are what Mr Hall himself had said in his messages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Second, Mr Hall’s messages to Mr Yarbrough deal with more than just concerns of stock grants or inflation adjustments to his pay. As seen from the above extracts of the messages, Mr Hall was expressing his broader concern that Rapyd was considering cutting his pay, that it would not honour its agreement with him and that taking remuneration away from him would be a mortal blow. Mr Hall’s concerns as expressed there are broad and general, and relate to his pay and remuneration, rather than being limited to what counsel for Mr Hall submitted. These messages provide evidence of Mr Hall’s broader concerns over pay, which include among other things, the Funding Societies Deal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 At the same time, I find that Mr Hall’s concerns over his payments may not have tilted over into a dispute with Rapyd at the point of his messages to Mr Yarbrough around 6 July 2022. As set out above, Mr Gomez’s WA messages with Mr Hall in July 2022 also did not suggest that there was a dispute then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 However, by around 26 August 2022, Mr Hall had made it clear to Mr Yarbrough in his messages that he would resign if the agreement with him was not going to be honoured. In his affidavit, Mr Hall explains that he told Mr Yarbrough that he would resign if he was not paid what he was owed in full.

</div> By threatening to resign if he was not, Mr Hall himself was casting this as a dispute. Notably, Mr Yarbrough did not say that Mr Shtilman would confirm paying Mr Hall in full at the upcoming “1:1” meeting. Mr Yarbrough also did not give any assurance as to what Mr Shtilman would say at the meeting. He simply asked Mr Hall if he had had the “1:1” meeting with Mr Shtilman yet. I therefore find that there is evidence of a dispute by around 26 August 2022, and that the “1:1” meeting with Mr Shtilman was to resolve this pay dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Mr Shtilman’s evidence is also consistent with the tenor of Mr Hall’s messages to Mr Yarbrough around 26 to 28 August 2022, where Mr Hall expressed his concerns that Rapyd would not pay him in full. Mr Shtilman’s evidence is that by around August 2022, he had concerns about paying Mr Hall in full, in the lead up to the 29 August Meeting.

</div>
</div>
</div> There, Mr Shtilman stated that Mr Hall’s claim for commissions in relation to the Funding Societies Deal was a “very problematic thing”, a “misuse of [Rapyd’s] compensation structure” and “ridiculous”. Mr Shtilman was clearly opposed to Mr Hall’s demands as of 19 August 2022. This is relevant in showing his mindset going into the 29 August Meeting. While these views were conveyed by Mr Shtilman only to Mr Bullock and not to Mr Hall prior to the 29 August Meeting, this does not undermine the evidence of a dispute. By Mr Hall’s own account, he was also upset that he might not be paid the full sums he considered were owed by Rapyd and hence Mr Hall threatened to resign. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I hence find that based on Mr Hall’s messages with Mr Yarbrough on 26 and 28 August 2022, Mr Hall’s affidavit at paragraph 45, and Mr Shtilman’s email to Mr Bullock dated 19 August 2022, there is evidence of a dispute about Mr Hall’s pay at the material time at which the parties attended the 29 August Meeting. Privilege would therefore apply to the communications at the 29 August Meeting provided that the communications were admissions which arose in the course of negotiations to settle the dispute, but subject to whether there was an admission of liability by Mr Shtilman (which Mr Hall submitted there was).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For completeness, I reiterate that the courts have firmly established that a broad approach should be taken to communications over which Privilege is asserted. In <span class="font-italic">Unilever PLC v The Procter &amp; Gamble Co </span>[2000] 1 WLR 2436 (“<span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>”), Robert Walker LJ observed at 2448−2449 that “to dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications (except for a special reason) would not only create huge practical difficulties but would be contrary to the underlying objective of giving protection to the parties”. Walker LJ’s dicta was cited in <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span> at [51]. In <span class="font-italic">CSO v CSP and another</span> [2023] SGHC 24 (“<span class="font-italic">CSO</span>”), Andre Maniam J affirmed Walker LJ’s dicta at [4], and held at [59] that the broad approach furthers the objective of encouraging settlements, as a matter of policy and principle and is the position at common law. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">CSO</span> also held at [76] that the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand </span>supports the broad approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the communications at the 29 August Meeting are admissions arising in the course of negotiations to settle a dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I next consider whether the communications at the 29 August Meeting constituted admissions which arose in the course of negotiations to settle a dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, on either Mr Hall or Mr Shtilman’s account of the contents of the communications, the 29 August Meeting involved Mr Shtilman making admissions against his own interest. Under Mr Hall’s account of the events, Mr Shtilman had agreed to pay Mr Hall the sums owed under the Compensation Plan as a bonus rather than as commissions, which would be against Rapyd’s interests. Under Mr Shtilman’s account, Mr Shtilman had conceded to Mr Hall that Rapyd would continue to honour its commitments under the Compensation Plan.

</div> Either of these admissions is probative of a fact in issue, namely, whether Rapyd was contractually bound by the Compensation Plan and what the sums owed to Mr Hall under the Compensation Plan were.

</div> When Mr Hall expressed further frustrations and said that he had told Mr Gomez that he would be resigning, Mr Yarbrough asked Mr Hall if he had his “1:1” meeting with Mr Shtilman yet.

In <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) held at [10] that it is trite law that the availability of the “without prejudice” privilege is not dependent upon the use of the words “without prejudice”, citing <span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council </span>[1989] AC 1280 at 1299 and <span class="font-italic">Sinojaya Sdn Bhd v Metal Component Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 281 at [31]. The failure to stipulate expressly that a communication is made “without prejudice” also does not preclude the operation of s 23 of the Evidence Act. In the absence of express words, the Court approaches the inquiry with no predilection one way or the other and examines all the circumstances to determine if the privilege exists: <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span> at [60].

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  AR’s Oral Judgment dated 31 October 2023 at paras 6−7.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In the court below, the learned AR rejected this and held that the party asserting such an admission of liability must show that there are <span class="font-italic">triable issues</span> as to whether the communications are in fact covered by Privilege. However, to avoid a striking out, the party denying Privilege must establish a clear basis for the Court to believe that communications may not be privileged. Bare and unsubstantiated assertions will not suffice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Mr Hall’s position is that where there is conflicting evidence on the crucial facts forming the basis of the allegation of Privilege, the Court should not choose between such conflicting evidence at a striking out application, but should instead leave the choice to the trial judge. Mr Hall relies on the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> from <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Bunga Melati 5”</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 (“<span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati</span>”) at [45] that “a court should not in a striking out application choose between conflicting accounts of crucial facts” [emphasis removed]. That <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> was however, made to explain the approach to a different legal test, namely when a claim should be considered “factually unsustainable”, such that it should be struck out. The court went on to note at [47] that there were certain facts in that case, which suggested that the appellants had at least an arguable case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The effect of adopting Mr Hall’s approach would be to dismiss a striking out claim based on Privilege and leave it to the trial judge whenever there are conflicting accounts over the existence of an alleged oral admission of liability. There would naturally be conflicting accounts whenever the existence of an oral admission is disputed. In my view, this approach would set the threshold far too low. It would be far from what the established case authorities have required in terms of the legal test for establishing whether the contents of an admission against interest amounts to an admission of liability, which is that the admission of liability must be clear and unequivocal. It would also risk eroding the protection afforded to Privilege and undermine the policy rationale for it. The English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Berry Trade Ltd and another v Moussavi and others </span>[2003] EWCA Civ 715 (“<span class="font-italic">Berry Trade</span>”) highlighted such risks when it observed at [56] that in a case where there was no unambiguous impropriety on the evidence, if there was a trial of the factual dispute relating to the application of Privilege: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]t such trial it would be inevitable that the witnesses would have to give even more evidence to explain what occurred in the without prejudice discussions. Satellite litigation of this sort is bound to discourage settlement negotiations for fear of such consequences, and is in our opinion highly undesirable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I have similar reservations about adopting the “triable issues” approach to a dispute over the existence of an oral admission. This is a legal test (rather than a standard of proof) that is applied in summary judgment applications under O 9 r 17 of the Rules of Court 2021. In an application for summary judgment, the applicant has to first show that he has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for judgment, and once he has done that, the burden shifts to the defendant to raise a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence to resist summary judgment, such that there are triable issues to be determined: <span class="font-italic">Ritzland Investment Pte Ltd v Grace Management &amp; Consultancy Services Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1342 (“<span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span>”) at [8], [43]–[45]. The underpinning judicial considerations are quite different, as can be seen from the following extract from <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at paragraph 14/4/2:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The policy of [the summary judgment provision in the revoked Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)] is to prevent delay in cases where there is no defence (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Robert Goff L.J. in <span class="font-italic">European Asian Bank A.G. v Punjab and Sind Bank (No. 2)</span> [1983] 1 W.L.R 642 at 654; [1983] 2 All E.R. 508 at 516, CA (Eng)), and therefore … once the court concludes that there is no triable issue…it will ordinarily give judgment for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The threshold required to satisfy the court in summary judgment applications that a matter should proceed to trial is lower. The reason for the lower threshold is that the policy behind summary judgments is to enable a plaintiff with a strong claim to secure a judgment in a period of time and at an expense which is proportionate to the dispute, and to enable the court to conserve scarce public resources where there is no reasonable or fair probability that deploying those resources in a full trial would make a difference to the just determination of the dispute: <span class="font-italic">Ritzland </span>at [46]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On the other hand, there is no policy reason to adopt a lower threshold when a party resists Privilege on the basis of a disputed oral admission of liability. I have serious concerns that adopting the legal test of “triable issue” in such situations would erode the protection that has been given to Privilege. In <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>, the court cited at [27] the Canadian decision of <span class="font-italic">Hansraj v Ao</span> (2002) ACWSJ 6409 where Slater LJ held that the “[t]he privilege is clearly an important one, and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should undoubtedly err on the side of protecting the privilege.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">Berry Trade</span>, the English Court of Appeal expressed concern at [48] that applying a test of a serious and substantial risk of perjury would considerably weaken the requirement of unambiguous impropriety for there to be an exception to Privilege. It held that the judge below should have looked for nothing less than unambiguous impropriety. In my view, for similar reasons, the legal test applied to assessing whether an admission against interest amounts to an oral admission of liability should be nothing less than what has been established and is expected where there are written communications from which the court can assess the content and context. The legal test is that the admission of liability has to be clear and unequivocal. Counsels for both Rapyd and Mr Hall also acknowledged at the hearing that they could find no reason why a lower test should be applied simply because the existence of an oral admission of liability is disputed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 At the same time, I do not accept Rapyd’s submission that the party asserting the oral admission of liability must prove the existence of such an oral admission on a balance of probabilities. I find [129] of <span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati </span>to be instructive on this point. There, the Court of Appeal held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, if the defendant is only prepared to rely on its affidavits, the court will only be able to determine the disputed issue on a preliminary basis. Consistent with the nature of the hearing, there can be no finding of fact on the balance of probabilities, but only on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis that, on the facts, the court has jurisdiction… It does not matter how the standard of proof (at the interlocutory/jurisdictional stage) is labelled provided it is understood that a factual dispute cannot be <span class="font-italic">conclusively</span> decided on contested affidavit evidence alone. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It is clear from the above <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> that disputed issues of fact at the interlocutory stage cannot be conclusively decided on contested affidavit evidence alone. It can only be determined on a preliminary basis and hence there can be no finding of fact on the balance of probabilities in such situations. As Mr Hall has made his contention at this interlocutory stage of OC 78 that there is an oral admission of liability only on the basis of affidavits, and he has made no application that the makers of the affidavits be cross-examined pursuant to O 15 r 7(6) of the Rules of Court 2021 in the court below or on appeal, I proceed on the basis of the affidavit evidence alone. Following <span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati</span> at [129], the court can only determine the disputed issue of whether such an oral admission was made on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis. I therefore do not accept Rapyd’s submission that Mr Hall must prove on the balance of probabilities that the alleged oral admission was made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In summary, in my view, where the applicability of Privilege is being considered and parties dispute whether an oral admission of liability was made, in reliance only on affidavits, the standard of proof on which the court is to determine the existence of such an oral admission is on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis. The party seeking to rely on such an oral admission bears the legal burden of proving this. If the court finds that such an oral admission was made on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis, the party relying on such an oral admission of liability must still satisfy the court as to the established legal test that the alleged admission against interest was a clear and unequivocal admission of liability. The above dicta from <span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati</span> at [129] and the above analysis was brought to the attention of parties at a further hearing. Both parties agreed that this is the legal position.

Where a defendant makes a submission of “no case to answer”, the claimant’s legal burden of proving its case on a balance of probabilities will be discharged if he satisfies the court that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case on each of the essential elements of the claim: <span class="font-italic">Millsopp </span>at [11], citing <span class="font-italic">Ma Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 1 SLR 304<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32]–[33].

Counsel for Mr Hall accepted that there was no such legal obligation, but submitted that Mr Bullock should have done so immediately because Mr Hall was a subordinate.

They are therefore not contemporaneous records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Mr Hall also sent a WA message to Mr Bullock on 1 September 2022 asking whether Mr Bullock had had the chance to “confirm the meeting minutes” that Mr Hall had shared. However, Mr Bullock’s response on 1 September 2022 was that he was “reviewing [Mr Hall’s] commissions as well as a handful of others with Mr Shtilman”.

</div> Notably, in his reply, Mr Bullock chose not to confirm Mr Hall’s account, which was that the compensation for the Funding Societies Deal had already been agreed to by Mr Shtilman at the 29 August Meeting. Mr Bullock also sent Mr Hall an email on 7 September 2022 stating that Mr Shtilman needed “additional information before he’s willing to give a final view on this”. In an email dated 19 September 2022, Mr Bullock explained to Mr Hall that there have been several compensation committee discussions on the issue of Mr Hall’s claimed commissions, and stated that, with respect to Funding Societies, “Funding Societies is ineligible for commissions”. Mr Bullock’s communications with Mr Hall in the weeks after the 29 August Meeting thus do not support Mr Hall’s account of what Mr Shtilman had agreed to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The learned AR found that Rapyd was at this point resiling from an agreement reached at the 29 August Meeting. I am unable to reach a similar conclusion. There is, as pointed out above, no evidence corroborating Mr Hall’s claim of an oral admission of liability by Mr Shtilman, other than Mr Hall’s own account. It would hence be too speculative to consider Rapyd’s communications post 7 September 2022 as resiling from an agreement. As pointed out above, even when Mr Bullock first responded by WA to Mr Hall on 1 September 2022, he did not confirm Mr Hall’s account but said instead that he was reviewing Mr Hall’s commissions. Ultimately, the onus is on Mr Hall to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the alleged oral admission of liability had occurred. In the absence of any extrinsic evidence supporting Mr Hall’s account of the disputed oral admission, I find that he has not shown such a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In any event, even if Mr Hall’s case is taken at its highest, and I accept that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that Mr Shtilman made the alleged oral admission at the 29 August Meeting, Mr Hall has not shown that there was a clear and unequivocal admission of liability, bearing in mind the context of the surrounding evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Mr Hall’s account was that “Rapyd will pay 100% of the Q1 commission as per my Comp Plan”.

</div> There was however, a dispute between the parties as to Mr Hall’s entitlement under the Compensation Plan. It is uncertain whether Mr Shtilman meant that Rapyd would pay Mr Hall 100% of the commission as per Mr Hall’s understanding of his entitlement, or that Rapyd would only pay Mr Hall what Rapyd considered him to be properly entitled to under the Compensation Plan. Mr Shtilman had earlier emailed Mr Bullock on 19 August 2022 about his reservations with paying Mr Hall under the compensation structure. He stated that while he was willing to pay Mr Hall a one-time bonus of $55,000 for his performance overall, he did not want to link such payment to the deal because it would be a misuse of Rapyd’s compensation structure.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> While there were suggestions that Mr Shtilman may have changed his mind, those are, in my view, speculative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In addition, the alleged agreement reached with Mr Shtilman entailed Mr Hall being paid a “bonus” instead of “commission”, but with the same quantum. As set out above, I do not find there to be a clear and unequivocal agreement to pay the quantum that Mr Hall thought was due under the Compensation Plan. But even if there were such an agreement, the use of a different term to classify the payment raises further doubt as to whether there was a clear and unequivocal admission of liability to Mr Hall’s entitlement under the Compensation Plan. That there was a discussion of payment of “bonus” rather than “commission” suggests the possibility that Mr Shtilman was not looking to follow the entitlement under the Compensation Plan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It is useful to bear in mind <span class="font-italic">Enterprise</span><span class="font-italic"> Fund</span> at [30], where it was held that while the court did not “doubt that an admission of liability could sometimes be implied by what was said in a communication, such an admission would still need to be clear and unequivocal (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it had to be clear and obvious that that was the implication).” In view of the above analysis, even if there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that Mr Shtilman had made the alleged oral admission, it cannot be said that there is evidence of a clear and unequivocal admission of liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Mr Hall also submits that based on Mr Shtilman’s evidence at paragraphs 26 and 28 of his affidavit, Mr Shtilman was not offering any concession to Mr Hall, but on the contrary, Mr Shtilman was seeking a concession from Mr Hall. Therefore, Mr Hall submits that adopting the approach of Lord Mance in <span class="font-italic">Bradford </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Bingley plc v Rashid </span>[2006] 1 WLR 2066 (“<span class="font-italic">Bradford”</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [83], there was no relevant dispute about Rapyd’s indebtedness at the 29 August Meeting and Privilege does not apply here.

</div>
</div> However, this citation does not assist Mr Hall. Lord Mance had found that the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Bradford</span> was seeking a concession in respect of an undisputed debt. Paragraphs 26 and 28 of Mr Shtilman’s affidavit do not contain admissions of an undisputed debt. Neither, when properly examined, do they imply that Mr Shtilman was seeking a concession from Mr Hall. These paragraphs only state that Mr Shtilman shared his concerns with Mr Hall and assured him that he would be paid what he is properly entitled to under the Compensation Plan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In summary, I find that Mr Hall has not shown that there was a clear and unequivocal admission of liability from Mr Shtilman. I therefore find that the discussions at the 29 August Meeting are protected by Privilege. Where pleadings plead or disclose without prejudice communications, they are liable to be struck out: <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng v Lim Jit Ming Bryan and another </span>[2010] SGHC 35 at [17]. In the instant case, the relevant pleadings referencing communications protected by Privilege during the 29 August Meeting are therefore struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Communications after the 29 August Meeting</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As I have found that there was no admission of liability made at the 29 August Meeting, the parties’ continued discussions to explore a resolution to Mr Hall’s claim after the 29 August Meeting would also be covered by Privilege. This is consistent with the broad approach taken for without prejudice communications: <span class="font-italic">CSO </span>at [50]−[76]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In conclusion, I allow the appeal in part, and order that paragraphs 22 and 36 of the SOC be struck out, with the exception of the communications stated at paragraph 22(a) of the SOC and as particularised in the Particulars.
