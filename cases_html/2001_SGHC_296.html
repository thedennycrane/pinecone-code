THE PROSECUTION’S CASE</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 On Thursday, 1 March 2001, at about 1 pm, Insp Sivaraman Letchumanan

instructed SSSGT B. Chandrasegaran to conduct surveillance in the vicinity of Blk 347,

Jurong East Ave 1, a food centre in the Jurong East housing estate. He was told to look

out for two male Indians, one of whom was known as "Black" (i.e. First Accused).

A description of "Black" was given to him. SSSGT Chandrasegaran proceeded to the

said Blk 347 in a van.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The teams involved in this operation comprised:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1) Insp Sivaraman, SSGT Md Azman, SGT S. Rajkumar, SGT Chua Yong Choon

  – these four officers were together in a car belonging to the Central Narcotics

  Bureau ("CNB"), with SGT S. Rajkumar as the driver. They left for the carpark at

  Blk 448 Jurong West St 42 at about 4 pm;</p>
<p align="justify">2) SGT Affendi Ideris and CPL D. Sivarajaa went to Blk 552 Jurong West

  St 42 on a motorcycle. They kept a look out from the seventh storey of that block of flats

  which was located next to the First Accused’s block of flats (Blk 554);</p>
<p align="justify">3) W/Insp Neo Ling Sim, SSSGT Qamarul Zaman and SGT Chong Yit Ming

  proceeded to the carpark at Blk 447 Jurong West St 42 in another CNB car;</p>
<p align="justify">4) SGT Gan Kok Wee, SGT Justin Fong, SGT Lim Teong Wah and W/SGT

  Jasylin Low went to the carpark at Blk 448 Jurong West St 42 in a CNB van;</p>
<p align="justify">5) SSSGT Hansen Sebastian took a taxi to Jurong West St 42 and walked

  about the area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 At 4.25 pm, SSSGT Chandrasegaran spotted the First Accused on a

motorcycle with the registration number FS 5358P. He parked his motorcycle at a motorcycle

parking lot about 15 metres from SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s stationary van. The First

Accused alighted from his motorcycle and waited beside it.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The Second Accused was then seen walking towards the First Accused.

He was carrying a yellow plastic bag. When he reached the motorcycle, the Second Accused

opened the carrier box at the rear of the motorcycle, placed the yellow plastic bag in it

and then shut the carrier box. Both Accused persons then had a short conversation for less

than one minute.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 After that, the First Accused got on his motorcycle and left while

the Second Accused walked empty-handed back towards the food centre. SSSGT Chandrasegaran

followed the motorcycle which turned left into Jurong East Ave 1, continued along Jurong

West Ave 1 and then turned right into Jurong West St 42. The junction of Jurong West Ave 1

and Jurong West St 42 was controlled by traffic lights and the CNB officer’s van

could not make it past the junction before the lights changed against it. SSSGT

Chandrasegaran thus lost sight of the First Accused’s motorcycle. He reported this to

Insp Sivaraman. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 Insp Sivaraman then instructed SGT Affendi Ideris and CPL Sivarajaa

to look out for the First Accused’s motorcycle. They went down from the seventh

storey of Blk 552 and cruised around the vicinity on their motorcycle. At about 4.50 pm,

they spotted the First Accused’s motorcycle parked in a motorcycle lot at the carpark

of Blk 554 and reported this to Insp Sivaraman who instructed them to continue their

observation. They did not see the First Accused. They returned to their position on the

seventh storey of Blk 552 to continue their look out.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 At about 5.10 pm, the two officers saw the First Accused and a

female Indian (his wife) approaching the First Accused’s parked motorcycle. They

spoke to each other for a while upon reaching the motorcycle. The First Accused then got

onto his motorcycle and rode out of the carpark towards Jurong West St 42 while his wife

walked back to their flat. They immediately reported the development to Insp Sivaraman. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 They then descended from their observation point and ran towards

Jurong West St 42. From a distance, they saw that the First Accused had stopped his

motorcycle by the roadside. A short while later, they saw Insp Sivaraman’s vehicle

intercept the First Accused.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 When Insp Sivaraman was informed that the First Accused had returned

to Jurong West St 42 on his motorcycle, his team immediately proceeded to the said street

in the CNB car. They saw that the First Accused had stopped by the roadside, seated

astride his motorcycle and appeared to be waiting for someone. They stopped their car at

an angle in front of the First Accused’s motorcycle, got out, handcuffed the First

Accused and placed him under arrest at about 5.15 pm. The motorcycle’s engine was

turned off and the keys removed from the ignition. The First Accused was noticed to have

urinated in his pants while still seated. He was brought to stand beside the

motorcycle’s carrier box. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 Insp Sivaraman then took the keys and, before opening the

motorcycle’s carrier box, asked the First Accused in Tamil if there was anything in

it. The First Accused replied in Tamil that there was "Jamma" inside.

"Jamma" meant "things" generally but was also a street name for

Cannabis in Tamil.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 The carrier box was then opened using the keys. Inside the carrier

box were a yellow plastic bag with two blocks of vegetable matter containing Cannabis,

wrapped with transparent plastic, a black carrier bag with a bottle of spray in it, an

empty carrier bag with the name Criss Cross and a blue plastic bag containing 61 S$1

coins.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 At about 5.30 pm, with SGT Rajkumar as a witness, Insp Sivaraman

asked the First Accused a series of questions in Tamil. He recorded the questions and the

answers thereto (given in Tamil) in his field book thus:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Q: What is your name.</p>
<p align="justify">A: Rajagopalan s/o Tamilarasan.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: What is inside your bike Carrier.</p>
<p align="justify">A: Drugs.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: What kind of drugs is this?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Ganjah (Cannabis) "Jamma".</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Who does this Ganjah belong to?</p>
<p align="justify">A: It is mine.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: What is this Ganjah for?</p>
<p align="justify">A: It is for sale.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: When did you take this Ganjah?</p>
<p align="justify">A: About 10-20mins Ago.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Who did you take it from?</p>
<p align="justify">A: I took it from Paul.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Where did you meet Paul?</p>
<p align="justify">A: At the Hawker’s Centre.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: What block.</p>
<p align="justify">A: At the Hawker Centre near Esso Petrol Station.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: How did you contact Paul to collect the Ganjah.</p>
<p align="justify">A: I called him at handphone no: 96101229."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The officer then read back the questions and answers in both English

and Tamil to the First Accused and asked him in Tamil whether he understood the contents,

inviting him to make any changes he desired. The First Accused replied in Tamil that he

understood the contents and that they were true and correct. He then signed in the field

book.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 The other teams arrived at the scene of arrest. At about 6 pm, Insp

Sivaraman instructed SSSGT Chandrasegaran to lead a party of six officers to arrest the

Second Accused. W/Insp Neo and the two officers in her team proceeded to the First

Accused’s flat to search for controlled drugs. Insp Sivaraman, still holding the

yellow plastic bag with the two blocks of vegetable matter, then left in the CNB van with

two officers and the First Accused to join SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s team at Blk 347

Jurong East Ave 1. SSGT Hansen Sebastian was handed the keys to the First Accused’s

motorcycle and instructed to ride it behind the CNB van.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 When SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s team arrived at the said Blk 347

(the food centre), he saw the Second Accused sitting beside a coffee stall having drinks

with another male Indian, Subramaniam s/o Lechumanan Suppiah. Both of them were placed

under arrest.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 On a steel cabinet behind the Second Accused, there were two black

bags placed one on top of the other. SSSGT Chandrasegaran asked the Second Accused about

the ownership of the two bags. The Second Accused claimed the bag at the top with the

letters "SCTS" was his but not the one at the bottom which had the word

"Brutini". Nothing incriminating was found in the SCTS bag. The Brutini bag

however contained nine bundles of vegetable matter, each wrapped with an aluminium foil, a

Nokia handphone battery charger, an aluminium wrapper and ten sachets of vegetable matter.

The Second Accused claimed that these things were not his.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 The Second Accused was searched and a mini-sachet of vegetable

matter was found in his left trousers pocket. Upon questioning, the Second Accused

admitted that it was Cannabis and he had it for his own consumption. SSGT Azman held on to

all the items recovered at the scene.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 Insp Sivaraman then arrived in the CNB van and was informed of the

arrest of the two male persons. Subramaniam was handed over to Insp Sivaraman. SSSGT

Chandrasegaran then left the food centre with his team and the Second Accused for the

Second Accused’s flat at Blk 311 Jurong East St 32 #13-333.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 Nothing incriminating was found in the said flat. The CNB team then

brought the Second Accused to the Clementi Police Division HQ.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 In his office, at about 6.52 pm, SSSGT Chandrasegaran asked the

Second Accused three questions in English. The answers were also given in English. SGT

Rajkumar and SSGT Azman, still holding the seized items, were also present. The questions

and answers recorded on a piece of paper were as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Q: Does the 2 black bags which were recovered from the premises

  of the hawker centre where you were arrested belong to you?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Both bags belong to me. One black bag (Singa China Travel Service

  Logo) and (Berutini) brand belongs to me.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Do you know what is in the black bag (Berutini) which was seized

  from you.</p>
<p align="justify">A: I know that there is Marijuana in the bag but I do not know the

  exact amount. I only know that is about 350 to 400 grams of Marijuana.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: The other black bag (SCTS) logo, did it contain any drugs before we

  seized it.</p>
<p align="justify">A: The bag contained 2 kilogram of Marijuana which I handed to my

  friend Raja only a few minutes before my arrest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The questions and answers were then read back to the Second Accused who

confirmed that they were true by signing on the piece of paper.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 At 7.15 pm, SSSGT Chandrasegaran instructed SSGT Azman to hand over

the Second Accused together with the seized items to Insp Sivaraman. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 In the meantime, Insp Sivaraman and his team left the hawker centre

together with the First Accused and Subramaniam in the CNB van for the flat of the First

Accused at Blk 554 Jurong West St 42. They arrived at 6.35 pm. One officer remained in the

van with Subramaniam while Insp Sivaraman and the other officer escorted the First Accused

to his flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 There they met W/Insp Neo and the other two officers. A further

search was conducted but nothing incriminating was recovered from the flat. They then left

at 6.50 pm for Clementi Police Division HQ.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 At 9.25 pm, Insp Sivaraman left with three officers, the First and

the Second Accused and all the exhibits seized for the Major Investigation Branch

("MIB"). SGT Affendi followed them on the First Accused’s motorcycle.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 At the MIB, they met ASP Soh Thiam Loon, the Investigating Officer.

The two Accused persons were left in the conference room with two officers standing guard.

Insp Sivaraman then briefed ASP Soh in the latter’s office about the events that day

and handed over all the seized exhibits.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 Photographs were taken of the First Accused’s motorcycle. The

drug exhibits were then photographed and weighed in the conference room in the presence of

the First and the Second Accused. The two Accused persons were then escorted to the

Alexandra Hospital for their pre-statement medical examination. Insp Sivaraman then handed

over the personal properties of the Accused persons to ASP Soh and left the MIB.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 The two blocks of vegetable matter found in the yellow plastic bag

were analysed at the Narcotics Laboratory at the Centre for Forensic Science and were

found to contain 824 grams and 824.8 grams respectively of cannabis. Adding up to 1648.8

grams of cannabis, they formed the subject of the two Charges.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 Subramaniam, who was arrested at the food centre together with the

Second Accused, testified that he had gone to the food centre at past 5 pm on 1 March 2001

to buy "private Toto" from a Chinese but did not meet him. He saw the Second

Accused sitting alone drinking beer. Upon the Second Accused’s invitation, he joined

him at the table.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31 When the CNB officers approached them, Subramaniam knew who they

were as he was a drug supervisee at the Clementi Police Division HQ. He did not realize

there were two bags on the steel cabinet until he was asked. He told the CNB officers that

the bags were not his. Subramaniam did not know the First Accused.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32 Shiyamala d/o Kesavan is the First Accused’s wife. They were

married in 1995 and have a 5 year old son. She worked in the Republic of Singapore Navy at

Tuas and supported the family financially as her husband had been unemployed since being

involved in a motorcycle accident in 1996. The First Accused did odd jobs now and then.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33 She testified that on 28 February 2001, at about 9.30 pm, she had

gone to watch a movie at Westmall in Bukit Batok together with her husband and their son,

Raja Mohamed (the First Accused’s uncle) and his girlfriend, Selvam (the First

Accused’s friend) and his wife and their son. After the movie, Raja’s girlfriend

left the group while the First Accused and Selvam went somewhere to play cards. The rest

of the group returned to the First Accused’s flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34 The First Accused and Selvam returned home sometime in the morning.

When Shiyamala was leaving for her work at about 7 am, both of them were still awake. She

left with Selvam’s wife who was going to the market.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35 At about 8.30 am, she called the First Accused who told her he was

about to go to sleep. She informed him that she was taking the afternoon off from work and

would leave her office at about noon.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36 When she returned home at about 2 pm, the First Accused was sleeping

on the sofa. At about 3 pm, she woke him up to eat lunch.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37 While they were eating, Paul (the Second Accused) called. The First

Accused then told her he wanted to go and see his friend, Paul, to borrow money from him

to buy her a birthday gift. He told her that he had requested the loan from Paul a few

days earlier and that Paul had asked him to see him to take the $100. He said Paul would

call him later. She had never seen nor spoken to Paul before.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38 At about 4.30 pm, the First Accused’s handphone rang. After

answering the call, the First Accused told her that Paul had called to ask him to meet him

for the $100. The First Accused said the meeting place was within Jurong and he would

return home within ten minutes. He then left the flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39 About ten minutes later, the First Accused telephoned her and asked

her to go down from their second storey flat to the ground level. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40 When she met him, he was with his motorcycle in the parking lot

between Blks 552 and 554. They sat at the void deck of Blk 552. The First Accused was not

carrying anything and he behaved normally. She sat with her back to the carpark, opposite

the First Accused. There could have been a pillar blocking the First Accused’s view

of the carpark.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41 The First Accused told her he wanted to bring her to IMM for

shopping. He also said Paul had asked him to deliver a bag to Paul’s friend. She

asked him why Paul could not do it himself. The First Accused replied that Paul had to go

somewhere and therefore asked him to do him that favour. She asked the First Accused what

was inside the bag and to whom was it to be delivered. The First Accused said he did not

know but was expecting a call from Paul’s friend as Paul had given the First

Accused’s handphone number to that friend. A call then came through and the First

Accused said that Paul’s friend had called to say that he had arrived. The First

Accused told her he would deliver the bag and would be back in about ten minutes. As she

was in her houseclothes then, he asked her to go up to the flat to change and he would

call her later. He then left on his motorcycle.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42 Back at the flat, Shiyamala waited for her husband to call but he

did not. Subsequently, CNB officers went to the flat. That was when she learned of the

First Accused’s arrest. Asked whether First Accused was someone who would go around

leaving his motorcycle unlocked, she replied that the First Accused was a very careful

man.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43 Shiyamala was later recalled to the witness stand at the request of

the First Accused as there was some dispute as to the time of his arrest. She now

testified that she had seen CPL Sivarajaa walking past alone at the void deck of Blk 552

on 1 March 2001 and commented to her husband that he (CPL Sivarajaa) looked as if he was

drunk. She could remember him because of his coloured hair, his lips and the way he

walked. The First Accused did not respond to her remark. CPL Sivarajaa, in his testimony,

denied that he had seen them at the void deck. He stated that he and SGT Affendi Ideris

worked as a team and were together.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44 She further added that when she returned to the flat after speaking

to the First Accused at the void deck of Blk 552, the CNB officers went to the flat within

one to two minutes later, at about 5.10 pm to 5.12 pm. She knew it was about that time

because the First Accused’s sister and her fianc (Nantha Kumar), who were in the

flat, had to go out at 5.15 pm because they had to meet someone by 6 pm. Her sister’s

friend, Rajan, was also in the flat at that time. At about 5.40 pm, another of the First

Accused’s friends, Goudham, also went to the flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45 She claimed that four CNB officers had gone to the flat – one

female Chinese, two male Chinese and one male Malay. The female Chinese made one or two

calls on her handphone and also received one or two calls. At about 5.20 pm or 5.25 pm,

that female Chinese received a call informing her that the First Accused had been

arrested. When she mentioned the word "arrested", Shiyamala asked her about it

and she said that her husband was arrested. The officers searched the safe in the flat

when the First Accused was brought to the flat as the safe key was with him. The safe

contained passports and certificates only.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46 Shiyamala claimed that she had informed the First Accused’s

former Counsel that there was a man who was drunk who walked past her and the First

Accused at the void deck. She told this to his present Counsel only after a few days into

the trial although she was interviewed by him on the first day.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47 W/Insp Neo was not called to testify at the trial as she was

attending a course overseas and Counsel for the First Accused had informed the Prosecution

earlier that he did not need her evidence. He confirmed in Court that he did not require

W/Insp Neo to be called as a witness despite the further evidence of the First

Accused’s wife. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48 Her two team members testified that the three of them were

instructed to raid the First Accused’s flat at 5.25 pm on 1 March 2001 after the

First Accused had been arrested. They witnessed the arrest from a distance. They arrived

at Blk 554 at 5.35 pm and observed the flat. They only raided the flat at about 6 pm when

instructions from Insp Sivaraman were received through W/Insp Neo.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49 Raja Mohamed, the First Accused’s uncle, confirmed that he was

with the First Accused and his family on 28 February 2001 and had stayed the night at the

First Accused’s flat after the movie. He left for work at about 6 am on 1 March 2001

when the First Accused and Selvam returned home.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50 He added that in December 2000, the First Accused’s wife wanted

to buy a handphone for the First Accused. As the couple often travelled to Malaysia for

shopping while he looked after their son, they wanted a handphone with the autoroam

facility. She was not yet 21 years old then and therefore could not be a subscriber. The

First Accused did not bring his identity card with him. They asked if they could use his

identity card to register for a handphone line with StarHub and he agreed. The bills were

sent to the First Accused’s address. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51 Rajinthran, the elder brother of the Second Accused, testified that

two days before 1 March 2001, the Second Accused asked him to help with painting and

rewiring works at their parents’ flat (where the Second Accused was also residing),

promising him $50 per day of work. The Second Accused told him that another friend, Segar,

would be joining them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52 On 1 March 2001, at about 1 pm, Rajinthran arrived at the Second

Accused’s flat. The Second Accused, their mother and Segar were in the flat. The

Second Accused was sleeping while Segar was pulling out the cables. Rajinthran woke the

Second Accused up and the three of them started working. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53 Sometime past 2 pm, the three men walked over to the food centre at

Blk 347 Jurong East. They ordered beer. The Second Accused handed to Rajinthran a 4D

ticket and asked him to collect the winnings of $650 from the turf club’s outlet

nearby. After doing that, Rajinthran rejoined the other two men. One Mani had also joined

them. Rajinthran handed the $650 to the Second Accused who in turn gave him $50 and asked

him and Segar to purchase materials and tools from a hardware shop. They did so and

returned to the food centre.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54 At about 4 pm, Segar and Rajinthran left the Second Accused and Mani

and returned to the Second Accused’s flat to continue with the works. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55 Sometime past 6 pm, CNB officers went to the flat with the Second

Accused. They searched the flat and then left with the Second Accused.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56 The First Accused’s motorcycle, a Honda CB 400, was bought on

hire-purchase. Its price was $14,230. The First Accused made a downpayment of $3,000 in

September 2000 and had to pay $373 per month for three years. Instalments for October to

December 2000 and for January 2001 had been paid. The First Accused had indicated that he

was self-employed. The hire-purchase company did not require information as to income. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57 Ms Irene Ong, an executive with StarHub Pte Ltd, testified that the

subscriber of handphone number 90014490 was Raja Mohamed (the First Accused’s uncle)

whose address was in Taman Ho Swee. The billing address was however the First

Accused’s address in Jurong West. She also furnished the call details of that

handphone from 22 February 2001 to 1 March 2001. As StarHub provided free incoming calls,

only outgoing calls from the handphone were captured in the system, showing details such

as the numbers to which calls had been made. The call details showed that six calls were

made from the First Accused’s handphone to the Second Accused’s handphone number

(96101229) on 1 March 2001 between 1.53 pm and 5.20 pm. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58 The StarHub executive was re-called subsequently to explain a

continuous series of ten outgoing calls made from the First Accused’s handphone to

the number 98501302 between 6.35 pm and 11.03 pm when the First Accused was already in the

custody of the CNB officers. She explained that 98501302 was StarHub’s Voicemail

Depository Number. Whenever calls made to a StarHub subscriber’s handphone were not

answered, the calls would be diverted to that Voicemail Depository Number and would appear

as outgoing calls from the subscriber’s handphone. This happened even if the

subscriber’s handphone was switched off. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59 Seven calls were made from the First Accused’s handphone

between 5.16 pm to 5.23 pm to various handphone numbers. He denied that those calls were

made by him as he was arrested at about 5.15 pm. He claimed that the last call made by him

was the one logged at 5.11 pm lasting 43 seconds.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60 The Investigating Officer, ASP Soh Thiam Loon, testified that after

the two Accused persons were brought to MIB at 9.45 pm, he was briefed by Insp Sivaraman

on the facts of the case. Photographs were taken of the motorcycle and the seized

exhibits. The drug exhibits were then weighed in the presence of the two Accused persons.

They were then brought to the Alexandra Hospital for their medical examination.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61 When they returned at about 12.05 am on 2 March 2001, ASP Soh had

the First Accused brought into his room. He introduced Mr Y Raja Gopal as a Tamil

interpreter. The First Accused had no objection to Mr Y Raja Gopal as interpreter. With

only the three of them in the room, ASP Soh proceeded to take a statement from the First

Accused pursuant to Section 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code through the Tamil

interpreter. Amendments were made by the First Accused when the recorded statement was

read back to him. The First Accused then signed the statement which was in the following

terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"One person by the name of Paul. Paul told me whether I could help

  him to bring something. I agreed. Since I am looking after a child, I told him I would be

  able to help him. At about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, my wife came back. Then I

  telephoned Paul that I could go and help him to bring whatever thing he gave me. He also

  said he would pay me S$100/- if I could bring the item which he give me and hand over to

  his friend.</p>
<p align="justify">Since my wife had already come home, I came out of my house after

  handing over the child to her. Before which I telephoned Paul where to go and deliver the

  goods. He asked me where can I go and deliver the goods. I told him near the bus-stop near

  my house. He told me that I supposed to go and collect the item from him and wait at the

  bus-stop near my house, and to deliver to a person who would come to see me at the

  bus-stop. Then I went to see Paul. Paul came, carrying a plastic bag, yellow colour. I

  told him I am unemployed and I am taking this S$100. I told him don’t get angry

  because I know him. I asked for the S$100 which he promised. He said go and deliver first

  and he would pay me tonight. He put the plastic bag into a box which was behind my

  motorcycle. I drove the motorcycle to Blk 554 Jurong West St 42, my house, under my block.</p>
<p align="justify">Then I went to speak to my wife. I told her I would come back shortly,

  as I had to go and deliver some goods near the bus-stop.</p>
<p align="justify">I drove my motorcycle to the bus-stop. I was waiting at the bus-stop.

  Officers moved in and I was arrested. After they took out from the box the plastic bag.

  Officers showed me the content of the bag was controlled drug. </p>
<p align="justify">I told the officer a friend of mine by the name of Paul told me to

  deliver, without knowing the contents. I am not accustomed to this type of work. I

  don’t involved myself in drugs. That’s all. Paul is the one who was arrested and

  sitting outside now."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62 After the recording of the statement had been completed for the

First Accused, he was brought out of the room and the Second Accused was brought into the

room. Again, the Investigating Officer introduced the Tamil interpreter and ascertained

that the Second Accused had no objection to him acting as such. A statement under Section

122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code was then recorded from the Second Accused who chose

to speak in English. Amendments were made at the request of the Second Accused. He then

signed the statement. It read:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Around 3-something afternoon, I went for a beer with my workers.

  After that, a guy from Malaysia came down and see me. He came down and he bring two bags.

  So he put down there, sit down with me for a while, on the beer cabinet. I know Raja two

  or three months only. He said: Paul, I am going out for a while. I’ll come back in

  half-an-hour time. Before that, he said his friend, Raja, will call me. He said pass this

  yellow plastic bag to him. I never said what is inside. The other bag was on the same beer

  cabinet.</p>
<p align="justify">After I met Raja, Raja called me first. I went to see him, he came in a

  motorbike. Then he opened the box at the back of his motorbike. Then I just said your

  friends asked me to pass to you. He also never checked what is inside.</p>
<p align="justify">He took just the yellow plastic bag and left in his motorbike. Then I

  came back to the same location, the hawker centre. I was drinking again with my worker and

  brother. They also left already. Suddenly a lot of people came into where I was sitting.

  They said they are CNB. They said "you just now put the yellow plastic bag inside the

  box." They asked whose bag was on the beer cabinet? One officer said: don’t

  bullshit, this is yours. Because in the other bag, the black bag, you got this one belong

  to who? So I said nobody. Then the officer took another bag and asked what is this? So I

  said this is my friend’s bag (the Malaysian friend, same guy).</p>
<p align="justify">Then they said they wanted to spot-check the house. So they came to my

  house. Nothing was down there. So they bring to narcotic that side to investigate. To tell

  the truth, I am an asthmatic patient. Casually, once in a blue moon, I would take

  marijuana for my asthma. I buy rations of $0.20 for my own consumption. That was in my

  pocket. But the Malaysian guy never come back. So I told the CNB this is what

  happened."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63 A second statement was recorded from the Second Accused at about

1.40 am on 2 March 2001 in respect of some other matter. Both Accused persons were then

sent to the Alexandra Hospital again for their post-statement medical examination. Later

in the day, ASP Soh went to hand over the exhibits to the Health Science Authority for

analysis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64 On 23 March 2001, photos were taken of the scene at Jurong West St

42 and at the food centre in Jurong East. Subsequent analysis of the two transparent

wrappers from the two blocks of vegetable matter found in the yellow plastic bag did not

produce any fingerprints.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65 On 21 July 2001, photos taken by SSGT Hansen Sebastian on 1 March

2001 at Jurong West St 42 using a disposable camera were sent for developing. A total of

$477.20 was recovered from the First Accused, including 61 S$1 coins in a blue plastic bag

found in the carrier box of the First Accused’s motorcycle. $77.10 was recovered from

the person of the Second Accused.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66 In cross-examination, ASP Soh agreed that during his investigations,

the First Accused repeatedly told him that the $100 mentioned in his statement was a loan.

The First Accused also claimed that he did not know what was inside the yellow plastic bag

that the Second Accused had asked him to deliver. He disagreed however that the First

Accused had said that the issue of the loan was not recorded in the statement. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67 The Tamil interpreter testified that he did not keep any notes

relating to the taking of the above statements save as to the date and time he was at the

MIB. Whatever the First Accused wanted to say was recorded by the Investigating Officer.

He agreed that he had used a Tamil word which could also mean "hand over" when

he interpreted the words in paragraph 1 of the First Accused’s statement, "He

also said he would pay me $100 …". That was also the Tamil word the First

Accused used in relation to the $100. The same word was used for "… he would pay

me tonight". The Tamil interpreter was a police officer before becoming a Senior

Interpreter and was fully aware of the procedure for recording a statement.</p>

<p align="justify"><br/>

THE CASE FOR THE FIRST ACCUSED</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68 The First Accused was educated up to Primary 2. He could not read or

write in English but could speak some English. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69 He got to know the Second Accused about two or three months before 1

March 2001 through a friend whom he had asked for a job and who referred him to the Second

Accused. He first met the Second Accused at the food centre in Jurong East. He was told

that the Second Accused was an electrician and a plumber and owned a company. He

approached the Second Accused but was told that there was no work for him at that time.

Both of them exchanged their telephone numbers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70 He met the Second Accused by chance at the same food centre another

two or three times before 1 March 2001. They also spoke to each other casually over the

telephone. On 28 February 2001, the day before their arrest, the First Accused called the

Second Accused to ask for a loan of $100. The Second Accused told him he did not have the

money then but would call him when he had it. The reason for the loan was that the First

Accused’s wife’s birthday was on 4 March and he wanted to get her a gift. He

intended to repay the loan on 10 March 2001 when his wife would receive her salary.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71 Besides his wife’s salary, they had other income in the form of

rental. One of the bedrooms was rented to two tenants who each paid them $300 per month.

Another bedroom was rented out to his sister who would pay between $200 to $500 per month

to them. All the rentals were payable within the first three days of each month.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72 On the morning of 28 February 2001, when he asked the Second Accused

for the loan of $100, he had not collected the rentals yet. He collected $600 from the two

tenants in the evening of that day. He spent some on 28 February 2001 when he went for the

film show and shopping. He also made some money in his card games. That was why when he

was arrested, he had more than $400 with him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73 On 1 March 2001, when he was lying in bed, the Second Accused called

him on his handphone (90014490) and asked whether he was free. He told the Second Accused

that he would call him back shortly. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74 Two or three minutes later, he made the call logged in the StarHub

call details at 1.53 pm to the Second Accused’s handphone (at 96101229). The Second

Accused told him he was renovating his mother’s flat in Jurong East and asked him

whether he could deliver some things to the Second Accused’s friend. The First

Accused said he was not free then but could do it in the evening after his wife had

returned from work. The Second Accused agreed with that arrangement. The Second Accused

also said that he would let him have the $100 loan which he had requested the previous

day.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75 The First Accused’s wife then called him to say that she would

be returning home by 2 or 3 pm that day.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76 At 1.57 pm, the First Accused telephoned the Second Accused to

inform him of his wife’s early return from work and that he would be able to delivery

the things as requested by the Second Accused earlier. He told the Second Accused that he

would call him once his wife returned home.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77 The First Accused’s wife returned home sometime past 3 pm on 1

March 2001. At 3.44 pm, the First Accused called the Second Accused as promised and asked

him where he should go to deliver the things. The Second Accused said the location was

near the First Accused’s home and told the First Accused he would call him again two

or three minutes later. He also asked where it would be convenient for him to deliver the

things. The First Accused informed the Second Accused to tell his friend to go to the bus

stop near Blk 554, Jurong West St 42. The First Accused also said that he would call the

Second Accused when he was leaving his flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78 At 4.26 pm, the First Accused called the Second Accused. The Second

Accused told him to meet at the food centre in Jurong East. The First Accused went to the

ground level with his wife and, after opening their letter box, the First Accused turned

on the motorcycle’s engine, spoke to his wife for a while and then left alone. He was

wearing a safety helmet which he had taken from the carrier box of the motorcycle. The

carrier box was shut but could be opened without using a key.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">79 When he arrived at the food centre in Jurong East, he parked his

motorcycle, rear in, at the motorcycle lots and sat there waiting with the engine still

running. As the Second Accused was nowhere to be seen, he telephoned him. That, as seen in

the StarHub call details records, was the call made at 4.58 pm. The Second Accused told

him to go to the back of the food centre but the First Accused told him to meet him at the

front.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">80 At 4.59 pm, the First Accused made a call to a Chinese man known to

him as See Vatt. As he was still speaking on the handphone, the Second Accused and another

Indian man approached. The other man stopped a short distance away while the Second

Accused, holding a yellow plastic bag in one of his hands, went up to the motorcycle. The

First Accused told the Second Accused to place the yellow plastic bag in the carrier box

at the rear of the motorcycle. The Second Accused opened the carrier box and then closed

it while the First Accused concluded the call on his handphone. The First Accused did not

see what was inside the yellow plastic bag. It did not occur to him to look inside as his

thoughts were focused on bringing his wife shopping.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">81 When the Second Accused walked to the front of the motorcycle, the

First Accused asked him for the $100 requested by him the day before, imploring him at the

same time not to be angry that he was asking for the money. This was because he was not

employed. The Second Accused told him he would give him the $100 loan that night and asked

the First Accused to telephone him later.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">82 He then told the First Accused "to go fast" as the two

persons would be waiting at the aforesaid bus stop. When the First Accused asked how he

was going to identify the two persons, the Second Accused said they had been told what the

First Accused looked like and would approach him. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">83 The First Accused then travelled on his motorcycle back to Jurong

West St 42. On arriving at the said bus stop, he saw no one. He then decided to go into

the carpark next to the block he lived in. He stopped at the motorcycle lots but left the

engine running. He removed his safety helmet and then telephoned his wife who was in their

flat, telling her to meet him at the ground level. When she went down, he saw that she had

changed from working clothes to a house dress. He told her he was taking her shopping. He

switched off the engine and got down from his motorcycle. He did not lock the carrier box.

They then walked to the next block (Blk 552) and sat on some stools. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">84 His wife asked him whether the Second Accused had given him the loan

and the First Accused told her that he would be getting it that night. He also told her

that the Second Accused had handed him some things to be delivered and she asked him,

"What things?". He told her he did not know what they were. She asked him why

the Second Accused could not do the delivery himself and the First Accused replied that

the Second Accused had asked for a favour. He also told her that the things had not been

delivered yet and when the intended recipients arrived at the bus stop, they or the Second

Accused would telephone him. He then told her to go back up to their flat and get changed

so they could go shopping.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">85 His wife mentioned that there was a man walking as though he was

drunk but he did not see that man as he received a couple of nuisance calls then. He

called the telephone number of the nuisance caller (90035157) but there was silence at the

other end.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">86 After that, as his wife went home to change, the First Accused rode

his motorcycle back to the bus stop. There was still no one around. He moved a distance

ahead, stopped and looked around. He was about to move off to return the things to the

Second Accused when the CNB car intercepted him by stopping in front of his motorcycle. He

could have escaped on his motorcycle if he wanted to but there was no reason why he should

do that.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">87 Three or four men came out of that car and someone said they were

from CNB. His left hand was handcuffed. An officer then turned off the ignition and

removed the key. Insp Sivaraman asked him whether there was anything inside the carrier

box and he replied, "There is thing" in Tamil. Someone proceeded to open the

carrier box and he then heard "Confirmed, Ganja" and "Cannabis". Insp

Sivaraman walked to the rear of the motorcycle to look and then said, "Go and arrest

Paul".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">88 The First Accused was still seated on the motorcycle. He was shocked

at hearing the words "Confirmed, Ganja" and "Cannabis" and urinated in

his pants. Feeling giddy, he alighted from the motorcycle. An officer commented that the

First Accused had urinated. He was then handcuffed on both hands. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">89 Insp Sivaraman seized his handphone and his wallet. The First

Accused was then told to sit on the kerb. Insp Sivaraman asked him whether the things in

the yellow plastic bag were his, while writing in a notebook. As the First Accused could

not see what he was pointing at, he was told to stand up. It was then that he noticed the

contents. He denied having answered "drugs" or "Ganja". Insp Sivaraman

did not even ask the third, fourth and fifth questions recorded by him. For the sixth

question, the question was "When did you take the yellow bag?" and not

"When did you take this Ganja?". Again, in respect of the tenth question,

"Ganja" should read "bag". Insp Sivaraman also asked, "Do these

things belong to you?" and the First Accused pointed and answered that the bag and

the spray in the box were his but the yellow plastic bag was handed over by the Second

Accused.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">90 The questions in the notebook were not read back to the First

Accused. He signed when told to do so, not knowing what he was signing. The word

"Ganja" was never used by Insp Sivaraman.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">91 Where his statement under Section 122 (6) of the Criminal Procedure

Code was concerned, he had said to ASP Soh that the Second Accused would give him the loan

of $100 he had asked for and not that he would give him $100. When he informed the Tamil

interpreter about this, he was told that statement was a rough one and he should just

confine his statement to what had happened on 1 March 2001 and that, in that context, his

words meant that the Second Accused would be giving him the loan he had asked for earlier.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">92 The calls shown in the StarHub record to have been made after 5.11

pm were not made by the First Accused as he was already under arrest by then. However, the

numbers called were those of his friends and the Second Accused. One of the numbers called

after 5.11 pm was in fact the nuisance caller’s. Although Insp Sivaraman had allowed

him to make a telephone call at his request, he was in fact not given the opportunity to

do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">93 Counsel for the Second Accused put it to the First Accused that the

Second Accused had asked him whether he could deliver something <u>for</u> a friend. The

First Accused said he was asked whether he could deliver <u>to</u> a friend. The Second

Accused did not tell him that the Malaysian was not familiar with the area nor that he was

willing to give $100. He did not know whether that Malaysian was known as Ravi although he

had seen him with the Second Accused once.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">94 The First Accused denied that the contents of the yellow plastic bag

were altered between about 4.32 pm (the time SSSGT Chandrasegaran lost sight of his

motorcycle when it turned into Jurong West St 42) and about 4.50 pm (when it was spotted

again, parked between Blks 552 and 554). He had no reason to guard the carrier box but

there was money inside. He then agreed it was possible that the contents of the carrier

box had been tampered with without him noticing. He did not know whether the handle slots

of the yellow plastic bag were knotted together. He also did not know whether the Second

Accused was aware of the contents of the yellow plastic bag.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">95 Asked by the Prosecution why he had been making various calls to

90035157 (the number which he claimed belonged to a nuisance caller) that day, the First

Accused said that nuisance caller had been disturbing him on his handphone and so he

called back to annoy the nuisance caller by remaining silent. He denied that he knew the

subscriber of that number or that he was supposed to hand over the yellow plastic bag to

that person.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">96 The First Accused was then referred by the Prosecution to a

statement recorded on 3 March 2001 by ASP Soh with the same Tamil interpreter in

attendance. Asked where he had made reference to a loan in that statement, he maintained

that he had said from the very beginning that he had asked the Second Accused for a loan.

He denied the suggestion that the $100 promised to him was payment for his services in

delivering the drugs. He was not suspicious about the delivery because the $100 was meant

to be given as a loan and not as payment. He did not ask the Second Accused what the

"thing" was because he considered the Second Accused as his boss and did not

know that he would deal in drugs. This was the first time he had done such a delivery for

the Second Accused. He would have helped the Second Accused even if he had not offered the

loan on 1 March 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">97 When talking to his wife at the void deck of Blk 552, he sat facing

the motorcycle lots but a wall impeded his view of his motorcycle parked there. He did not

lock the carrier box as it would look as if it was locked when closed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">98 Nantha Kumar, the First Accused’s sister’s fianc, a

Malaysian technician working here, testified that he was in the First Accused’s flat

in Blk 554 on 1 March 2001 since the morning. Four CNB officers went to the flat at about

5.10 pm as he and his fiance were preparing to leave the flat. They had intended to go

out at 5.15 pm. He was arrested by the CNB officers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">99 He could remember the time because he was supposed to meet his

friend at 5.30 pm at the BP petrol station along Jurong West Ave 1, a short distance away

from the First Accused’s flat. They were planning to go shopping along Serangoon

Road. He had also looked at the wall clock in the flat when he was arrested. When he was

brought downstairs to the CNB van, he saw the First Accused beside it. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">100 Nantha Kumar maintained his evidence although shown the Arrest

Report by one of the CNB officers which indicated that the raid at the First

Accused’s flat was at 6.05 pm and that he was arrested then.</p>

THE CASE FOR THE SECOND ACCUSED</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">101 The Second Accused was working as an electrical and plumbing

contractor before his arrest on 1 March 2001. He is not married and lived with his parents

and his younger brother’s family in the Jurong East flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">102 On 28 February 2001, the occupants moved out temporarily to the

Second Accused sister’s flat as he intended to do some rewiring works in the Jurong

East flat on 1 March 2001 with the assistance of his elder brother, Rajinthran,

Subramaniam and Segar. Subramaniam could not make it as his leg was hurting. The Second

Accused told him to buy some food and meet them later.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">103 They worked in the flat from about 10.30 am to 12.30 pm and then

proceeded to the food centre at Blk 347 for lunch. Subramaniam brought food and met them

at the food centre. They ate and drank beer together there. The Second Accused was in a

mess because of the morning’s work.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">104 The Second Accused then told Rajinthran and Segar to buy cement,

wire and paint from a shop nearby. He also asked Rajinthran to collect his winnings in the

4D lottery for him. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">105 While alone with Subramaniam, the Second Accused received a call

from Malaysia. It was from a friend called Ravi. Ravi wanted something to be sent to

Jurong for him and was willing to pay $100 for that to be done. He said he would meet the

Second Accused at about 4 pm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">106 The Second Accused then called the First Accused and asked him

whether he was free to run the errand. The First Accused said he would call the Second

Accused when his wife returned from work. He called the First Accused because he had asked

for a loan of $100 the day before and the Second Accused thought he could get the $100

from Ravi and give it to the First Accused as a loan. The First Accused called later and

said he would be available after 3 pm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">107 In the meantime, Rajinthran and Segar returned after buying the

goods and collecting the lottery winnings. The winnings were handed to the Second Accused

who told the two of them to return to the flat to continue with the work. The Second

Accused remained at the food centre, drinking with Subramaniam. Subramaniam also won in

the 4D lottery and went to collect his winnings, returning to the table at about 5 pm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">108 At about 4 pm, Ravi arrived at the food centre, bringing two bags

with him. After placing the two bags on the cabinet, Ravi joined the Second Accused for a

drink. While seated at the table, Ravi pointed to the bags and said there was something

inside and that was the thing to be delivered. Ravi said he could not deliver it himself

as he was busy and was not familiar with the Jurong area. His two friends (the intended

recipients) were also busy. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">109 The First Accused then called to say that he had arrived at the

parking lots for motorcycles at Blk 347. The Second Accused told Ravi he could not run

that errand as he was in a mess but had asked a friend to do it and that friend was

waiting at the motorcycle parking lots. Ravi opened one of the bags, took out a yellow

plastic bag and passed it to the Second Accused. The contents felt like a hard box but the

Second Accused could not look inside the yellow plastic bag as it was knotted at the top.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">110 The Second Accused took the yellow plastic bag and walked to meet

the First Accused, with Ravi following him. Ravi stopped halfway. The Second Accused told

him to go sit down at their table as there was beer there.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">111 When the Second Accused reached the First Accused’s

motorcycle, the latter had already lifted up the cover of the carrier box. He was seated

on the motorcycle. The Second Accused placed the yellow plastic bag in the carrier box and

closed it. He told the First Accused that the thing was to be delivered to Jurong West as

indicated by Ravi. The First Accused suggested a bus stop along Jurong West St 42 as that

was near his flat and was convenient for him. Ravi would call his friends to meet the

First Accused at the designated bus stop to collect the yellow plastic bag.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">112 The First Accused asked the Second Accused whether he could have

the $100 which he had asked for as a loan and was told to meet the Second Accused in the

evening to collect the money. The Second Accused told the First Accused to go off fast. He

then returned to the table where Ravi was.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">113 At the table, the Second Accused asked Ravi about the $100 promised

by him. Ravi then said he would go get the money. He left the two bags at the food centre,

saying he would return within half an hour.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">114 Turning to his Section 122 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Code

statement recorded on 2 March 2001, the Second Accused said that the words he had uttered

to the First Accused – "Then I just said <u>your</u> friends asked me to pass to

you" – should read as "<u>my</u> friends".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">115 At about 5 pm, Subramaniam returned to the table at the food centre

and sat down to have drinks with the Second Accused. A short while later, the CNB officers

arrived. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">116 SSSGT Chandrasegaran asked the Second Accused whether he had placed

anything in the motorcycle and the Second Accused replied, "Yes, is there any

problem?". The CNB officer then asked, "Do you know there are two kilos of ganja

inside?" to which the Second Accused replied, "I don’t know". The

officers then searched the surrounding area and the Second Accused’s body. A small

amount of cannabis was found in the Second Accused’s pocket.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">117 The officers took the black bag and asked whom it belonged to. The

Second Accused said he did not know. Beneath that bag was another one. When opened, there

was a lot of cannabis inside. The Second Accused was asked about this. SGT Raj Kumar

insisted he must have known about the bags and that they belonged to the Second Accused.

The Second Accused denied it.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">118 At the scene, he told SSSGT Chandrasegaran that the SCTS bag at the

top belonged to him but not the Brutini Bag at the bottom because the CNB officer had said

that both bags belonged to him and he was frightened. He had not seen the cannabis before

that and he became unsteady then. He did not know whether there was anything else left in

the SCTS bag after Ravi removed the yellow plastic bag. The handphone charger found in the

Brutini Bag probably belonged to Ravi. His own charger was in the Jurong East flat and he

had no reason to bring it to the food centre.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">119 He did not learn anything about the First Accused nor remember any

discussion about drug seizure after his arrest.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">120 At the Clementi Police Division HQ, the Second Accused said, in

answer to SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s question, that both the bags belonged to him because

SGT Raj Kumar had said earlier that they must belong to him. He also admitted that there

were about 350 to 400 grammes of marijuana in the Brutini bag because the officers had

shown the contents to him and estimated that amount. Similarly, he replied that the SCTS

bag had 2 kilogrammes of marijuana because SSSGT Chandrasegaran had mentioned at the scene

of arrest at the food centre that it could contain 2 kilogrammes. When he placed the

yellow plastic bag into the motorcycle’s carrier box, he had no idea then that it

contained drugs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">121 Some hours later, at about 1.54 am on 2 March 2001, when he was

charged by ASP Soh for trafficking in the drugs in the Brutini bag, he made a statement

under Section 122 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Code denying ownership of the Brutini bag

and its contents. He admitted that the small amount of drugs found in his pocket was for

his own consumption.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">122 Upon cross-examination by Counsel for the First Accused, the Second

Accused confirmed that the First Accused did not look inside the yellow plastic bag and

neither did the Second Accused tell him what the contents were as the Second Accused did

not know himself.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">123 In cross-examination by the Prosecution, the Second Accused said he

got to know Ravi, a Malaysian, through another friend (Govind) about two years ago. He had

met Ravi four or five times. The Second Accused and Govind consumed cannabis and Ravi

would frequently be with Govind. Govind supplied the drugs. Ravi would give small amounts

of cannabis to Govind who would share the drugs with the Second Accused. After Govind

migrated to Australia, Ravi used to call the Second Accused and asked whether he wanted

cannabis. The Second Accused would tell him to bring small amounts if he had any and Ravi

would do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">124 Ravi used to bring a lot of food whenever he went to see the Second

Accused. The Second Accused also borrowed money from Ravi. Therefore, on 1 March 2001,

when he asked for a favour in delivering the yellow plastic bag, the Second Accused agreed

to help him without thinking about or asking what the contents were. Anyway, Ravi was a

rich man who could afford to pay the $100 and the Second Accused was having financial

problems.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">125 The Second Accused got to know the First Accused sometime in

December 2000. That same day, the First Accused was introduced to Ravi as Ravi happened to

be at the food centre in Jurong East as well, together with the Second Accused’s

friends. The First Accused only said "Hi" to Ravi and then left.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">126 On 1 March 2001, the Second Accused had told Ravi that he could ask

his friend to go to the food centre in Jurong East to collect the thing instead of having

it delivered to the Jurong West area but Ravi said his friend was busy and it would be

convenient to deliver it in the Jurong West area. Ravi’s friend would call to inform

him of the exact delivery point and Ravi would then tell the Second Accused. The Second

Accused told Ravi that the person doing the delivery would be a fat person on a motorcycle

and the delivery point would be the bus stop along Jurong West St 42. He also told the

First Accused that two persons would be waiting at the said bus stop for him. After the

First Accused left the carpark at Blk 347, he did not call the Second Accused again. The

Second Accused also did not call him to ask whether he had made the delivery because the

First Accused was supposed to see the Second Accused again at about 6.30 pm (to collect

the money).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">127 The Second Accused added that Ravi was not working in Singapore. He

worked in a travel bus agency possibly as a tour guide and travelled in and out of

Singapore. He lived in Johor. He would come to Singapore two or three times a month and

each time would meet the Second Accused at the food centre in Jurong East. He would call

the Second Accused before he arrived. Ravi drove a Malaysia registered Proton Saga.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">128 Elan Jelian, the younger brother of the Second Accused, testified

that the Second Accused’s handphone was a Nokia model. He had retrieved the charger

for that handphone from the Jurong East flat and had brought it to Court. The Second

Accused’s contractor business was registered in Elan’s name but he worked in a

shipping company.</p>

THE DECISION OF THE COURT</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">129 The Prosecution has to prove against the First Accused that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) he was in possession of the yellow plastic bag and its contents;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the contents were 1648.8 grammes of cannabis;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) he knew that the contents were cannabis; and</p>
<p align="justify">(4) he had the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of

  trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">130 In respect of the Second Accused, the Prosecution must prove that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) he abetted the First Accused by engaging with him in a conspiracy

  to traffic the contents of the yellow plastic bag;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the contents were 1648.8 grammes of cannabis;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) he knew that the contents were cannabis; and</p>
<p align="justify">(4) pursuant to the conspiracy, he gave possession of the cannabis to

  the First Accused for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">131 The nature and quantity of the drugs and the fact of physical

control over the yellow plastic bag and its contents were not in issue. The entire case

hinged on the knowledge of both Accused persons as to the contents of the yellow plastic

bag. The Prosecution must of course prove that the yellow plastic bag and its contents

found in the carrier box of the First Accused’s motorcycle were the same bag and

contents handed over by the Second Accused to the First Accused at Blk 347 Jurong East.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">132 I accepted the evidence of Insp Sivaraman on what transpired at the

scene of the arrest of the First Accused along Jurong West St 42 despite the apparent

error in the time of the arrest, which was no more than ten minutes in any event. In a

fast moving scene, with 14 officers located at various places reporting to him at various

times and having to give instructions to match the events as they unfolded, minor

divergences in the timing of the events could be expected. I accepted that the First

Accused was intercepted and arrested at about 5.25 pm and that all the calls shown to have

been made from his handphone between 5.11 pm and 5.23 pm had been made by him. After all,

all the calls between 5.11 pm and 5.23 pm were to telephone numbers that he had called

earlier. His handphone had been seized by the CNB officers upon his arrest and if any of

them had made those calls, surely that would have been part of the investigations and

there was absolutely no need to deny it.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">133 I accepted that the questioning of the First Accused took place

after the carrier box of his motorcycle was opened. I also accepted that the First Accused

answered the questions posed to him by Insp Sivaraman in the presence of SGT Raj Kumar and

that all the questions and the answers had been dutifully recorded. His voluntary answers

were clearly damning to his assertion that he knew not what he was delivering. Insofar as

all the other details at the scene of the arrest along Jurong West St 42 were concerned,

for instance, who removed the keys from the ignition, whether he was handcuffed to the

front or at his back, when he urinated in his pants, when he got off the motorcycle,

whether he was walking about or sitting down on the kerb, I considered them quite

immaterial to the issues at hand. I would only observe that it would be quite strange for

the CNB officers to have placed the handcuffs on only one of his hands and not both. I

certainly drew no adverse inference against the First Accused for urinating in his pants

as even a less timorous innocent man could experience such an untimely discharge when

pounced upon by several men suddenly. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">134 Similarly, I accepted the evidence of the Prosecution regarding the

time of the raid led by W/Insp Neo on the First Accused’s flat. The

Prosecution’s timing would accord with the time of the arrest of the First Accused

and it would certainly be more logical to raid the flat only after ascertaining that the

First Accused had drugs on his motorcycle. No useful purpose would be served in any event

by falsifying the time of the raid, which was corroborated by the raiding party’s

testimony and the Arrest Report.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">135 I would say the same regarding the contradictory testimony of the

First Accused’s wife and CPL Sivarajaa concerning the events at the void deck of Blk

552. Although the wife was a Prosecution witness, in the circumstances of this case, one

should not be too surprised if she were to try to tailor her evidence to match her

husband’s, which she would have an inkling of. Her testimony regarding CPL Sivarajaa

was nevertheless unreliable. She made no mention of him when she first gave evidence

before the Court. It was also unlikely that she could have remembered his face so well

after 1 March 2001. If indeed she had seen someone stumbling along, it was not CPL

Sivarajaa. Again, there was no reason for CPL Sivarajaa to falsify this part of his

evidence. He and SGT Affendi were on the lookout for the First Accused and there was no

reason to mask the fact, if fact it be, that CPL Sivarajaa had indeed spotted the First

Accused and his wife at the void deck.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">136 I accepted the First Accused’s evidence that the carrier box

of his motorcycle was shut but not locked even after the yellow plastic bag was placed in

it by the Second Accused. It was evident that a third person would not know it was not

locked unless he tried to open the cover of the carrier box. The First Accused rode his

motorcycle from Blk 347 back to Jurong West St 42. The CNB officers lost sight of him and

his motorcycle for only about 18 minutes between 4.32 pm to 4.50 pm. The First Accused did

not say that anyone had gone near his motorcycle. When the motorcycle was parked at the

motorcycle lots between Blks 552 and 554, it was obvious that a careful man like the First

Accused would have made sure that he could still keep an eye on his motorcycle. After all,

even if he knew nothing about the contents of the yellow plastic bag (which was clearly

not the case), he had money kept in the carrier box and $61 could not be a small amount

for someone who had to importune the Second Accused for a $100 loan. I had no doubt that

the yellow plastic bag and its contents found by Insp Sivaraman at the point of arrest

were the same ones placed by the Second Accused at Blk 347.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">137 Where the Second Accused was concerned, I accepted the evidence of

SSSGT Chandrasegaran relating to the arrest at Blk 347 and the events thereafter. If the

Second Accused was so intimidated by SGT Raj Kumar’s assertions that the two bags

must be his, how did he have the gumption to acknowledge only the SCTS bag at the top and

to deny ownership of the Brutini bag at the bottom? Clearly, it was because he knew that

the SCTS bag had been emptied of its contents earlier and the contents were with the First

Accused and that the Brutini bag contained incriminating evidence. There was no allegation

in any event that SGT Raj Kumar or any other officer had threatened him in any way.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">138 The recording of the questions and answers at Clementi Police

Division HQ by SSSGT Chandrasegaran was witnessed by SGT Raj Kumar and SSGT Azman. Again,

no inducement, threat or promise was alleged by the Second Accused in Court. He said he

could not remember whether the CNB officers had discussed the arrest of the First Accused

and the seizure of the drugs in the yellow plastic bag. It could not be that he would

answer that the SCTS bag contained 2 kilogrammes of marijuana simply because SSSGT

Chandrasegaran had said it could have or that he would regurgitate what he had heard about

the Brutini bag as if it was his personal knowledge. Like the First Accused’s oral

statement to Insp Sivaraman, the Second Accused’s answers to SSSGT

Chandrasegaran’s questions were damning and totally demolished his defence of lack of

knowledge. It made no difference even if the Nokia battery charger found in the Brutini

bag was not for his handphone. Only the Second Accused knew why it was inside the bag

together with the drugs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">139 Both Accused persons insisted that they did not ask nor look into

the yellow plastic bag and knew nothing about its contents. I found their evidence

incredible. How could they not have at least asked what the size of the thing to be

delivered was? What if it turned out to be a table? Further, they would surely want to

know whether the thing was fragile or perishable. After all, the box-like thing could well

hold a precious vase which could be easily broken or even be ice-cream which would have

melted in the carrier box!</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">140 Ravi, the Malaysian friend, was in the travel business and had

driven to Singapore from Johor on many occasions, in particular to the food centre at

Jurong East. It was impossible that Ravi would be so familiar with Jurong East but was so

unsure about the area around Jurong West, not more than five minutes away by car, that he

had to bring the things to Blk 347 so that they could be delivered to Jurong West St 42.

Alternatively, if the intended recipients could make their way to the bus stop along

Jurong West St 42, they could just as well have been informed to meet Ravi at Blk 347

Jurong East. As a further alternative, the Second Accused could have gone in Ravi’s

car and shown him the way to Jurong West St 42. If his "messy" state had not

stopped him from spending a few hours at a public place, I saw no reason why he should

fight shy of going with Ravi for a ten-minute round trip. Ravi also did not appear to have

been in a terrible hurry to go elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">141 Ignorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion

and no right and opportunity of examination and ignorance <i>simpliciter</i> is not enough

(<i>Yeo Choon Huat v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 217</nobr>). Ravi was known to the Second Accused to

have access to drugs. Taking all the facts into consideration, it was patently clear that

both the Accused persons did not need to ask or to look into the yellow plastic bag

because they knew what was inside.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">142 On the issue of whether the $100 promised to the First Accused was

intended to be a loan or a payment, I would say the various statements seemed to indicate

it was a payment for the delivery service rather than a loan, although a loan had

originally been requested. Even if it was a loan, with the rentals already collected, it

was strange that the First Accused still required a $100 loan on 1 March 2001. Further,

when the money was not to be handed over until the evening of 1 March 2001, it was again

strange that the First Accused, who had intended to use the money or part thereof for a

gift for his wife, would immediately ask his wife to join him to go shopping. In any

event, it made no material difference to the Charges whether it was a loan or a payment as

either would be some form of consideration for delivering the drugs and consideration need

not even be proved here. I emphasize at this juncture that I am not in anyway implying

that the Tamil interpreter was less than diligent or competent in his duties. On the

contrary, I felt he had interpreted faithfully during the recording of the various

statements.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">143 The Prosecution was entitled to invoke the presumption concerning

trafficking in Section 17 (d) of the Misuse of Drugs Act against the First Accused.

However, in the light of what I have set out above, it was clear that the First Accused

had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and there was no need to rely on the

presumption. The Charge against the First Accused alleged trafficking "at about 5.15

pm". In my view, that approximate time was sufficient for the facts here even though

I have said the arrest of the First Accused took place at about 5.25 pm. The occasion

specified in the Charge was manifestly clear to the First Accused.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">144 Direct evidence of a conspiracy between two or more persons would

rarely be available. "A frequent method of proving a conspiracy is to show that the

words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object

or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by

arrangement beforehand" (<i>Lai Kam Loy &amp; Ors v PP</i> <nobr>[1994] 1 SLR 787</nobr> at page

795). In my opinion, the Prosecution has proved the conspiracy alleged. Both the Accused

persons were aware that they were handling drugs. They were in constant communication with

each other and were obviously playing their respective roles in moving the drugs in

question from one place to another.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">145 Both Charges having been proved beyond reasonable doubt, I

convicted both the Accused persons and passed the mandatory death sentence on them.</p>
