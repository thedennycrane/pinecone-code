Regardless of whether brought as a criminal motion or a criminal revision, the application would be brought before the High Court in exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz Khan bin Abdul Kader v Public Prosecutor </span> [2022] SGHC 287 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span>”) at [23]–[24]), with the corollary that the threshold requirement for the High Court to act is that it must be satisfied that the State Courts’ decision would give rise to a “serious injustice” (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Fero</span>z<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I nevertheless went on to consider, as a matter of procedural propriety, the form that the present application ought to have taken. As regards the Prosecution’s objection, it was clear to me that the application could have been brought as a criminal motion under s 97(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Powers of General Division of High Court regarding bail</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">97.</span>—(1)  Subject to section 95(1) and subsection (2), at any stage of any proceeding under this Code, the General Division of the High Court may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) release any accused before the General Division of the High Court on bail, on personal bond, or on bail and on personal bond;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Indeed, <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> also concerned an application to the High Court by an accused person who had been denied bail in the State Courts. Although the application was dismissed by Sundaresh Menon CJ on its merits, there was no suggestion that it had been improperly brought as a criminal motion under s 97(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC. To similar effect was <span class="font-italic">Ewe Pang </span><span class="font-italic">Kooi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 2 SLR 672, in which an application to the High Court by an accused person who had been denied bail in the State Courts was brought as a criminal motion under an earlier version of s 97 of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Notwithstanding my view that the application could have been brought as a criminal motion, it did not follow, in my judgment, that it had been improperly brought as a criminal revision. This turned on the distinct question of whether the High Court’s revisionary powers could be exercised over a State Court’s decision to deny bail. Having regard to the case authorities, I answered this question in the affirmative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Sollihin bin Anhar</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Sollihin</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”) concerned an application by the Prosecution to the High Court to revoke bail granted to an accused person by the State Courts. The accused person raised the preliminary objection that the application should have been filed as a criminal motion under an earlier version of s 97 of the CPC. Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) rejected this submission. This was largely because, as s 97 did not then confer on the High Court the power to revoke bail granted by the State Courts, the Prosecution’s application could not in fact have been brought as a criminal motion under s 97 (at [26]–[28]). However, Tay J also considered at [29] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nevertheless, even if it were accepted that s 97 of the CPC enables the High Court to revoke bail granted by the State Courts, this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Prosecution is disentitled from bringing a criminal revision to reverse a bail decision by the State Courts. The ascertainment of whether this was procedurally appropriate would depend on the separate issue of whether the scope of the High Court’s revisionary powers is wide enough to review bail decisions by the State Courts. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In Tay J’s view, “the revisionary powers conferred on the High Court were sufficiently broad so as to allow it to reverse a State Court’s decision to grant bail to an accused” (at [30]). Section 400(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), which is functionally identical to the present s 400(1) of the CPC, provided that these revisionary powers could be exercised over “any judgment, sentence or order” recorded or passed by the State Courts and, although s 400(2) foreclosed an application for criminal revision against an appealable decision, “a bail decision, being merely interlocutory and tentative in nature, would generally be regarded as a non-appealable order” (at [29], citing <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Razip and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[1987] SLR(R) 525 at [15]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Sollihin bin Anhar</span> [2015] 3 SLR 447 (“<span class="font-italic">Sollihin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) did not disagree with Tay J’s conclusion, which was endorsed by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Yang Yin</span> [2015] 2 SLR 78 (“<span class="font-italic">Yang Yin</span>”) (at [20]–[21]).<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I respectfully agreed with Tay J. Further, although <span class="font-italic">Sollihin</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> itself concerned a decision by the State Courts to grant bail, Tay J’s reasoning suggested more broadly that a decision by the State Courts to deny bail would be equally susceptible to the High Court’s revisionary powers. Indeed, it is now clear that an application to the High Court for bail, following the denial of bail in the State Courts, necessarily engages the High Court’s revisionary jurisdiction and must satisfy the corresponding standard, even if the application is brought as a criminal motion (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> at [18] and [23]–[24]). I was therefore of the view that the High Court’s revisionary powers could be exercised over a State Court’s decision to deny bail. The fact that the High Court is not exercising its appellate jurisdiction in such an application (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> at [21]) was also further evidence that s 400(2) of the CPC would not preclude the exercise of these revisionary powers to be invoked through the specific means of an application for criminal revision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Accordingly, I was also of the view that the Applicant’s application to be released on bail had not been improperly brought as a criminal revision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It is convenient at this juncture to articulate some general principles governing the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary powers. In <span class="font-italic">Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 929 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Chuan</span>”), Yong Pung How CJ stated at [17] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Similarly, Yong CJ stated in <span class="font-italic">Knight Glenn </span><span class="font-italic">Jeyasingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 196 at [19] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court’s immediate duty is to satisfy itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court. However, this is not sufficient to require the intervention of the courts on revision. The irregularity or otherwise noted from the record of proceedings must have resulted in grave and serious injustice…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The above remarks were cited with approval by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Yang Yin</span>, which likewise involved a criminal revision against a bail decision by the State Courts. Menon CJ also observed that the high threshold of “serious injustice” meant that the High Court’s revisionary powers would only be exercised sparingly (at [25], citing <span class="font-italic">Yunani bin Abdul Hamid</span> <span class="font-italic">v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 383 at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I address one other point before turning to the merits of the application. It was incumbent on the Applicant, having brought his application as a criminal revision, to identify the specific decision of the DJ of which he was seeking revision. The Applicant’s initial position was that he was only seeking revision of the DJ’s rejection, on 10 April 2023, of his application to be reoffered bail. In his Petition for Revision, the Applicant prayed for an order that “[t]he General Division of the High Court… call for and examine, on an expedited basis, the record of proceedings before the State Court <span class="font-italic">relating to the </span><span class="font-italic">Applicant’s bail review hearing on 10 April 2023</span> before the [DJ]” [emphasis added].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 This position struck me as odd because the Applicant’s arguments were largely directed toward the DJ’s revocation of his bail on 22 February 2023 and not at the DJ’s rejection of his application to be reoffered bail on 10 April 2023. Perhaps realising this, the Applicant’s counsel, Mr Yong Hong Kit Clement (“Mr Yong”), clarified at the hearing that he was seeking revision of the “totality” of the DJ’s decisions on 22 February 2023 and 10 April 2023. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I was conscious that this position had not been expressed in such terms in the Applicant’s Petition for Revision. Nonetheless, in my view, it was relatively clear from the arguments contained therein that the Applicant was in reality challenging both the DJ’s decisions on 22 February 2023 and 10 April 2023. Given that the Prosecution in its written submissions defended both decisions against the Applicant’s objections, it also appeared to have shared this understanding of his position. In the premises, I was of the view that no prejudice would be occasioned to the Prosecution if I was to examine both the DJ’s decisions in the course of dealing with the application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the DJ had the power to revoke the Applicant’s bail</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I first address the DJ’s revocation of the Applicant’s bail on 22 February 2023, beginning with the question of whether he had the power to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my judgment, the DJ did have the power under s 103(4) of the CPC to revoke the Applicant’s bail.

However, the Applicant contended in his Petition for Revision that the first precondition had not been fulfilled because he had not been arrested under s 103(1) of the CPC for failing to surrender to custody, to make himself available for investigations, or to attend court despite being under a duty to do so.

</div> It followed that the DJ was, with respect, clearly wrong to say that the Applicant was facing non-bailable offences (see [12(d)] above). The Applicant was charged with three offences under ss 323A and 267B of the PC and reg 6(1) of the COVID-19 Regulations. The offences under ss 323A and 267B of the PC are expressly designated as bailable offences under the First Schedule to the CPC. Further, the First Schedule provides that offences against laws other than the PC, if punishable with imprisonment for less than three years, are bailable offences. Thus, the offence under reg 6(1) of the COVID-19 Regulations, being punishable under s 34(7) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both, is also a bailable offence. Even if the DJ had been referring to the offences under s 182 of the PC for which the Applicant was under investigation, these are expressly designated as bailable offences under the First Schedule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Nonetheless, I was not persuaded that this error alone constituted or had produced a “serious injustice” sufficient to warrant the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary powers. Had the DJ been deciding whether to grant bail to the Applicant at the first mention, his erroneous classification of the offences as non-bailable would likely have been material. This is because bail is generally available under s 92 of the CPC for bailable offences, but a person charged with non-bailable offences has no such right under s 93 of the CPC and bears the burden of showing why bail should nonetheless be extended to him (<span class="font-italic">Yang Yin</span> at [29], citing <span class="font-italic">S </span><span class="font-italic">Selvamsylvester v Public Prosecutor</span> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 409 at [22]). Here, however, the DJ was instead deciding whether to revoke the Applicant’s bail owing to breaches of his bail conditions. Although the classification of his alleged offences as bailable or non-bailable remained a relevant consideration, it was only one of many factors to be weighed in the balance. Indeed, the DJ’s reasons were focused largely on the unacceptability of the Applicant’s breaches as well as the deceptive conduct by which they were accompanied (see [12] above). The misapprehension that the Applicant was facing non-bailable offences featured only in one passing reference and was nowhere else repeated. Thus, even though the DJ had indeed erred as rightfully pointed out by the Applicant, this error was not central to his decision to revoke the Applicant’s bail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the DJ could only have revoked the Applicant’s bail if he had assessed that the Applicant was a flight risk</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The second step of the Applicant’s argument, following from the observation that he was charged with bailable offences, consisted of the claim that the DJ could only have revoked the Applicant’s bail if he had assessed that the Applicant was a flight risk.

</div> This claim was built upon two planks, both of which I rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 First, the Applicant referred to s 92 of the CPC:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">When person must normally be released on bail or personal bond, or on both</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">92.—</span>(1)  When any person, except a person accused of a non‑bailable offence —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is arrested or detained without warrant by a police officer, or appears or is brought before a court; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is prepared to give bail at any time while in the police officer’s custody or at any stage of the proceedings before the court,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the person must be released on bail by a police officer in cases determined by the Commissioner of Police or by that court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  Despite subsections (1) and (2), where the person is accused of an offence that is not a fine-only offence, and a court believes, on any ground prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Rules, that the person, if released, will not surrender to custody, be available for investigations or attend court, the court may order as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) if the person appears or is brought before the court — refuse to release the person, whether on bail, on personal bond, or on bail and on personal bond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">His argument appeared to be that, as s 92(3) contained the sole exception to the general right expressed in s 92(1) of a person accused of a bailable offences to be released on bail, such a person could only have his bail revoked if the court believed that he would not, if released, surrender to custody, be available for investigations, or attend court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I disagreed with this analysis, which conflated the distinct questions of: (a) whether bail should be granted at the first mention; and (b) whether bail, having earlier been granted, should subsequently be revoked. Although s 92 governs (a), it is of no application to (b), which, assuming that the court is possessed of the requisite power under ss 103(4) or 102(1) of the CPC, is a matter instead of judicial discretion. This distinction, which I have already alluded to at [40] – between the grant of bail at the first mention and its subsequent revocation – was explicitly recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sollihin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [23]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Save for the fact that <span class="font-italic">bail must be granted at the first mention in cases involving bailable offences pursuant to s 92(1) of the CPC</span>, all bail decisions in relation to the granting or denial of bail for non-bailable offences, the quantum of bail, the imposition of bail conditions and the <span class="font-italic">revocation of bail</span> entail the <span class="font-italic">exercise of judicial discretion</span>… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It is especially clear that s 92 can be of no application where the court is exercising its power under s 103(4) of the CPC to revoke a released person’s bail. As discussed earlier, this power is subject to two preconditions, the second of which may be satisfied in two alternative ways (see [32(b)] above). Section 103(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which is expressed in broadly similar terms to s 92(3), allows the revocation of bail where the court thinks the released person is unlikely to surrender to custody, to make himself available for investigations, or to attend court. Section 103(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), meanwhile, allows the revocation of bail where the court thinks that the released person has broken or is likely to break any of his bail conditions. This is not dependent on any judgment by the court that the released person is unlikely to surrender to custody, to make himself available for investigations, or to attend court. To read the power under s 103(4) as subject to s 92 would render s 103(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) otiose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, the Applicant also relied on the following remarks by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> (at [1] and [26]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1 When a court considers granting bail, it must necessarily balance a myriad of interests and considerations. Perhaps the most common of these is whether the accused person is a ‘flight risk’, or to put it another way, whether there is a chance that he or she will escape from the jurisdiction or otherwise evade detection to avoid participating in further proceedings or investigations. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 In determining a grant of bail, the assessing court will generally endeavour to strike a balance between two broad considerations: the accused person’s interest in preserving his or her liberty prior to conviction, and the State’s interest in securing his or her attendance during proceedings: <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 753 at [53]. ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On the strength of these remarks, Mr Yong submitted during the hearing that the DJ was wrong to revoke the Applicant’s bail for public safety reasons (see [12(f)]). According to Mr Yong, the safety of the public was irrelevant to the question of whether the Applicant constituted a flight risk and, accordingly, did not engage the State’s limited interest in securing his attendance during proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I disagreed with this analysis as well. In my judgment, whether an accused person is a flight risk is not the sole consideration to which a court may have regard in making a bail decision. Indeed, Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> acknowledged at [1] that the court is required to “balance a myriad of interests and considerations”, of which the question whether the accused person is a flight risk is only “the most common”. I discuss some of the other relevant interests and considerations below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Relatedly, the State’s interest in a bail decision is not, in my judgment, limited to its interest in securing the attendance of the accused person during proceedings. I accept that this aspect of the State’s interest was accorded particular emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> at [26]. But this is unsurprising given that <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> involved an accused person who had absconded and failed to attend court. In my respectful view, Menon CJ could not have intended to depart from the well-established position, clearly articulated in the following cases, that the State’s interest in a bail decision encompasses a range of other interests than its interest in securing the attendance of the accused person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> v </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 753 (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Loqmanul</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">”)</span>, which Menon CJ cited in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span> at [26], V <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">K Rajah JA </span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">stated at [54] that:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As in all balancing exercises, in this case, between public interest and individual liberty, there are instances in which bail should not be granted. To give but two pertinent examples: where it is likely that the accused (a) would seek to use his liberty to <span class="font-italic">intimidate witnesses</span> or <span class="font-italic">tamper with evidence</span>; (b) abscond, or <span class="font-italic">abuse his freedom to pose further harm to society via the commission of further offences whilst on bail</span>. The courts would be remiss in discharging their functions if they mechanically grant or refuse bail.

The latter covers a <span class="font-italic">broad based</span><span class="font-italic"> range of considerations</span> including the need to secure the attendance of the accused, which is a matter of importance to society because it is directed at upholding the efficacy of the criminal justice system. <span class="font-italic">Other aspects of the interests of society include the need to guard against the possibility of witnesses being tampered with which could prejudice a fair trial or against the danger of further offences being committed by the accused if he were not confined.</span> The court, in appropriate circumstances, will similarly also take into consideration other factors in the accused person’s interest such as his health or the fact that trial is being unduly delayed. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Each of these cases clearly demonstrates that the State’s interest in a bail decision is not limited to its interest in securing the attendance of the accused person during proceedings. Also relevant are its legitimate interests in, among others: (a) preventing the commission of further offences; (b) preventing any prejudice to a fair trial. It follows that a court in making a bail decision may also consider the risk that the accused person will reoffend, intimidate witnesses, or tamper with evidence if he is released. The question of whether the accused person is a flight risk is by no means the sole relevant consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I therefore disagreed that the DJ could only have revoked the Applicant’s bail if he had assessed that the Applicant was a flight risk. This submission wrongly assumed that the revocation of bail was subject to s 92 of the CPC and was also predicated on an untenably narrow reading of <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Feroz</span>. Having rejected the second step of the Applicant’s argument, it was not necessary for me to consider its third step, which consisted of the claim that the Applicant was not a flight risk.

</div> As I will now explain, the DJ’s decision to revoke his bail was amply justified even on the assumption that he was not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the DJ was correct to assess that the balance of interests had shifted </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Sollihin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal stated at [34] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A] decision to revoke bail pursuant to s 103(4)(<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">b</span>) of the CPC is not to be justified on the grounds that it is to punish the accused for breaching a bail condition. The condition would have been imposed in the first place to enable the court to strike a suitable balance between the interests of the accused and those of society. If that balance has shifted, then the court may intervene. But the fact remains that the breach or anticipated breach of the condition is only a factor, albeit a potentially important one, in the balancing exercise which remains the premise of any decision to revoke bail - and so the question for the court is whether that balance has shifted. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, the DJ was correct to conclude, in the light of the Applicant’s undisputed breaches of his curfew, that the balance between his interests and those of society had indeed shifted so as to justify the revocation of his bail.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Applicant’s non-compliance with his curfew meant that he was at significant risk of reoffending. His alleged offences generally arose out of violent conduct taking place late at night or in the early morning:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The Applicant’s charge under s 323A of the PC alleged that he had punched a male victim at about 11.16pm on 18 July 2020, causing the victim to fall to the ground and die. Although the Applicant denied during the trial that he had punched the victim or caused his death, he conceded that he had “struck him with a slap”.

The Applicant left his mobile phone at home to give IO Goh the false impression that he was at home when he had in fact gone out. He was also not forthcoming before the DJ about his second breach. As discussed above, on 22 February 2023, the Applicant initially maintained through his former counsel, Mr Sanjiv Vaswani (“Mr Vaswani”), that he had left home on 19 February 2023 only to sit in his car in the carpark. It was only on 10 April 2023 that the Applicant admitted to having visited a bar during that time (see [9] above). This dishonest conduct could not be treated lightly. It was also suggestive that other attempts to monitor the Applicant short of revoking bail, such as through e-tagging or reporting, would be similarly dishonestly exploited by him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the duration of the Applicant’s curfew had already been varied by the court on the basis of his claim that he needed to stay out late to work. The Applicant exploited the court’s indulgence to visit entertainment outlets for frivolous reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For these reasons, I agreed with the DJ’s decision to revoke the Applicant’s bail, even after I had taken into account that the Applicant’s offences were bailable as of right.

In context, the DJ was then addressing the Applicant’s submission that his sudden remand was causing hardship to his family. The DJ had already explained why this alleged hardship was unexceptional and, in any event, causally unrelated to the revocation of the Applicant’s bail. Having done so, the DJ then issued the remarks extracted above. They clearly did not form the basis of his decision, which he had already justified on other grounds, and accordingly did not disclose any improper purpose on the DJ’s part. Indeed, the DJ had earlier acknowledged that “[t]he deprivation of bail is never intended to be a punishment or the first resort”.
