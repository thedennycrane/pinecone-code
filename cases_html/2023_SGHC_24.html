That policy was articulated in these terms by Oliver LJ in <span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head</span> [1984] Ch 290 (“<span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head</span>”) at 306: “parties should be encouraged so far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that <span class="font-italic">anything that is said</span> in the course of such negotiations (and that includes, of course, as much the failure to reply to an offer as an actual reply) may be used to their prejudice in the course of the proceedings”. [emphasis added]. This policy has been affirmed by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council </span>[1989] AC 1280 (“<span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tompkins</span>”) at 1299, and by our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(cited above); see also <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd v Singapore Telecommunications Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 433 (“<span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>”) at [9] and [49].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The common law “without prejudice” principle finds statutory expression in s 23 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Evidence Act”). Section 23(1) of the Evidence Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Admissions in civil cases when relevant</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23.—(1)  In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it is made —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) upon circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At common law, “anything that is said” in the course of “without prejudice” negotiations is privileged (<span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head</span>, quoted at [2] above). The court does not “dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications” (per Walker LJ in <span class="font-italic">Unilever Plc v Procter &amp; Gamble Co</span> [2000] 1 WLR 2436 (“<span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>”) at 2448–2449). This may be described as the Broad Approach to “without prejudice” privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Section 23(1) of the Evidence Act, however, only refers to “admissions” not being relevant. Does the Evidence Act thereby oust the Broad Approach, such that only <span class="font-italic">admissions</span> made in the course of “without prejudice” communications are privileged? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I decided that neither s 23(1) of the Evidence Act nor binding local case authority limits the common law in that regard: the privilege protects the whole of “without prejudice” communications, not only admissions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The first defendant was engaged as the contractor for a project.

The plaintiff contended that the Disputed Emails were covered by “without prejudice” privilege, and so the first defendant could not put them into evidence, or refer to their contents.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The assistant registrar’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The application failed at first instance.

In this regard, I considered that the concept of “delay” included not only belated action, but also complete inaction: here, the non-extension of the LC, which the plaintiff alleged to be due to the first defendant not taking any steps to extend it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Those pages of Walker LJ’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> were cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Nicky Quek</span> at [23] as setting out “the most important instances” of the exceptions to “without prejudice” privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Walker LJ noted that in <span class="font-italic">Walker v </span><span class="font-italic">Wilsher</span> (1889) 23 QBD 335, Lindley LJ (at 338) had regarded the Delay/Acquiescence Exception as limited in its effect, as excepting the fact and dates of negotiations from being privileged. However, Walker LJ doubted the generality of this proposition, commenting that “occasionally, fuller evidence is needed in order to give the court a fair picture of the rights and wrongs of the delay”. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Nicky Quek</span> accepted the exceptions as formulated by Walker LJ in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiff cited <span class="font-italic">Soon Peng Yam and another (trustees of the Chinese Swimming Club) v </span><span class="font-italic">Maimon bte Ahmad</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 279 (“<span class="font-italic">Soon Peng Yam</span>”) at [21] to suggest that Singapore law only recognises the Delay/Acquiescence Exception in its narrow form (based on <span class="font-italic">Walker v </span><span class="font-italic">Wilsher</span>), rather than the broader formulation set out in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>. The court in <span class="font-italic">Soon Peng Yam</span> did not however have to decide whether the Delay/Acquiescence Exception might extend to <span class="font-italic">contents</span> of “without prejudice” negotiations. In that case, the appellants sought to adduce certain “without prejudice” letters for the mere fact that negotiations (on the matter in question) had taken place – and the court agreed that that could be done. As the appellants accepted that the contents of the “without prejudice” letter were not admissible, it was not in issue whether the appellants might also have referred to those contents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Soon Peng Yam</span> also predates the formulation of the exceptions in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> and the endorsement of that formulation in <span class="font-italic">Nicky Quek</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The application of the Delay/Acquiescence Exception to this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the present case, the first defendant could minimally rely on the narrow form of the Delay/Acquiescence Exception to say that in the period of 17 to 21 February 2020, the plaintiff and the first defendant were engaged in “without prejudice” negotiations regarding the payments to be made by the first defendant to the plaintiff. That would go some way towards rebutting the plaintiff’s second Assertion that the first defendant had not taken issue with the plaintiff being paid the retention money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This was, however, a case where (as Walker LJ put it in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>) fuller evidence was needed to give the court a fair picture of the rights and wrongs of the delay (or inaction, I would add).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In response to the plaintiff’s second Assertion that the first defendant had not taken issue with the plaintiff being paid the retention money, the first defendant could point to the <span class="font-italic">fact of negotiations about payment</span>; but the first defendant should also be allowed to say that <span class="font-italic">it had expressed disagreement with the plaintiff’s claim</span> for the remaining payments, and that <span class="font-italic">it had stated that the amount of the remaining payments </span><span class="font-italic">due to the plaintiff had not been finalised</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The plaintiff had also made the first Assertion that the LC had not been extended because the first defendant had not taken any steps to extend it. Given that the plaintiff had put in issue the <span class="font-italic">reason</span> for the LC not being extended (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the rights and wrongs of the delay/inaction), the first defendant should be allowed to respond by showing that in the course of “without prejudice” negotiations <span class="font-italic">it had proposed to extend the LC, but the plaintiff had opposed that extension</span>, and that is why the LC was not extended. If the first defendant were limited to referring to the dates and fact of negotiations about payments, the court would not have a fair picture of why the LC had not been extended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 <span class="font-italic">McFadden v Snow</span> (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 8 (followed in <span class="font-italic">Pitts v </span><span class="font-italic">Adney</span> [1961] NSWR 535 at 539) is a similar case. There was an issue in <span class="font-italic">McFadden</span><span class="font-italic"> v Snow</span> as to whether one Ms Jobson had surrendered her tenancy to the claimant. The claimant sought to prove that she did, by adducing a letter from him to her to this effect. The letter referred to evidence given by Ms Jobson in earlier proceedings that she claimed no interest in the property. It further expressed the claimant’s acceptance of Ms Jobson’s abandonment of rights in the tenancy. Crucially, the claimant asserted that he had received no reply to his letter. The court said (at 10) that this would have been “highly significant for the purpose of establishing an admission (by silence) [that] Ms Jobson had surrendered her tenancy”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The truth, however, was that following the claimant’s letter, Ms Jobson’s solicitors did write to the claimant, but that letter was marked “without prejudice”. The contents of the letter were inconsistent with Ms Jobson having surrendered the tenancy. The court admitted the letter into evidence, to “negative the inference that otherwise might quite erroneously have been raised in [the] claimant’s favour” (at 10). It dismissed the claimant’s objection that the reply could not be admitted as it was marked “without prejudice”. It refused to allow “the cloak of ‘without prejudice’” to be “abused for the purpose of misleading the court” (at 10). If the court had merely allowed Ms Jobson to refer to the date and fact of her solicitors’ letter, Ms Jobson could have rebutted the claimant’s assertion that he had received no correspondence from Ms Jobson after his letter to her, but the court would still not have a fair picture of the matter if it did not know what the letter from Ms Jobson’s solicitors said.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Allowing the contents of the Disputed Emails to be put in evidence (to the extent they related to the plaintiff’s Assertions) would not offend the public policy underlying the “without prejudice” principle. In <span class="font-italic">Muller v </span><span class="font-italic">Linsley &amp; Mortimer </span>[1996] PNLR 74 at 79–80 (cited in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> at 2443), Hoffmann LJ suggested that many of the exceptions to “without prejudice” privilege involve communications relevant for the mere <span class="font-italic">fact that they were made</span>, rather than the <span class="font-italic">truth of what is stated or admitted</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the present case, the first defendant wished to mention:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the fact that it had proposed to extend the LC, pointing out that the parties were still in negotiations about what the plaintiff should be paid; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the fact that the first defendant had expressed disagreement with the plaintiff’s claim for the remaining payments, and stated that the amount of the remaining payments due to the plaintiff had not been finalised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The first defendant’s statements on those points were relevant for the <span class="font-italic">mere </span><span class="font-italic">fact that they were made</span>, and not because of the <span class="font-italic">truth of what was stated</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On a related note, at the core of the “without prejudice” principle is the protection of admissions against a party’s interest being used against that party thereafter (<span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> at 2448). Allowing the first defendant to refer to <span class="font-italic">its own statements</span> in the Disputed Emails would not go against that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As for the first defendant also wishing to refer to <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff’s statements</span> that the plaintiff would not agree to extend the LC unless the negotiations culminated in agreement on a contract amendment (see [17(b)] and [17(d)] above), those statements would contain an <span class="font-italic">admission</span> by the plaintiff that it was willing to negotiate. Indeed, a genuine intimation that a party is willing to negotiate a settlement of an existing dispute is a sufficient “admission” to make communications “without prejudice” in nature: <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span> at [22]–[39]; <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v </span><span class="font-italic">Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and others and other appeals </span>[2018] 1 SLR 894 (“<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span>”) at [67]–[69], and [89]–[95].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It would, however, not go against the policy objective of “without prejudice” privilege to allow the first defendant to rely on the plaintiff’s rejection of the first defendant’s proposal to extend the LC, to rebut the plaintiff’s first Assertion that the LC was not extended because the first defendant did not take any steps to extend it. That the parties were in “without prejudice” negotiations (and that the plaintiff was willing to negotiate) would already have been evident even before one turned to the fact that the plaintiff rejected the first defendant’s proposal. The first of the five Disputed Emails, which came from the first defendant, already made references to settlement discussions. Moreover, as discussed above at [36], as the plaintiff had sought to blame the first defendant for the LC not being extended, the first defendant was justified in providing fuller evidence to give the court a fair picture of why the LC had not been extended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Given these findings, I was satisfied that the first defendant should be allowed to rely on the fact, dates <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">contents</span> of the Disputed Emails, but with reliance on the contents limited to those of the Relevant Portions ( see [42]–[44] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Relevant Portions of the Disputed Emails were privileged in the first place</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having dealt with the thrust of the plaintiff’s appeal, I turn to discuss the first defendant’s appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In giving permission to appeal, the Appellate Division framed various issues to be addressed by the parties:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The applications are allowed because of the following question of general principle to be decided for the first time:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  Whether, in respect of without prejudice privilege, the broad approach stated in <span class="font-italic">Unilever Plc v The Procter &amp;

They show that the protection of admissions against interest is the most important practical effect of the rule. But to dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications (except for a special reason) would not only create huge practical difficulties but would be contrary to the underlying objective of giving protection to the parties, in the words of Lord Griffiths in the <span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tompkins</span> case [1989] AC 1280, 1300: ‘to speak freely about all issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise and, for the purpose of establishing a basis of compromise, admitting certain facts.’ Parties cannot speak freely at a without prejudice meeting if they must constantly monitor every sentence, with lawyers or patent agents sitting at their shoulders as minders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) cited the above portion of Walker LJ’s judgment in part, to support his decision that “without prejudice” privilege would continue to apply to negotiations on quantum even if there had been an admission of liability (which would not be privileged).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Menon JC first agreed with the <span class="font-italic">policy</span> rationale stated in <span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head</span> (and approved of in <span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tom</span><span class="font-italic">pkins</span>) that “parties should be encouraged so far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations … may be used to their prejudice in the course of the proceedings” (at [49]). He decided that that rationale “applies with equal force to negotiations on quantum where there is a real dispute over this … even though one party may have admitted to liability” (at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 At [51]–[52] he then cited Walker LJ’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> as support for his decision as a matter of <span class="font-italic">principle</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51 In my judgment, the same result can also be seen to be justified <span class="font-italic">in principle</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> ([12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Robert Walker LJ stated that it would be undesirable to ‘dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications’. The rationale for this proposition is that if there is a risk that some part of the communications that take place in circumstances where the parties are trying to come to a settlement may later be found not to be privileged, it would inhibit the discussions as a practical matter. In my judgment, the same sort of practical difficulties would arise if the ‘without prejudice’ rule were held not to apply to negotiations directed at settling disputes on quantum.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 One can quite easily imagine a situation where negotiations both as to liability and quantum are conducted on the same plane and at the same time. If the negotiations in respect of liability succeed, but those as to quantum break down and the matter proceeds to trial for an assessment of damages, it would be patently unfair for evidence of such negotiations to be admitted. As observed by Robert Walker LJ in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> at 796:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Parties cannot speak freely at a without prejudice meeting if they must constantly monitor every sentence, with lawyers or patent agents sitting at their shoulders as minders.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The outcome in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> turned on the application of the Broad Approach. Unilever had pleaded that Procter &amp; Gamble had made a threat actionable under the UK Patents Act 1977 (c 37). However, that threat (if it had been made) would have been made during a “without prejudice” meeting. The judge at first instance struck out the “threat” pleading as an abuse of process, and that was upheld by the English Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Walker LJ (with whom the other lord justices agreed) applied the Broad Approach to preclude Unilever from referring to the threat as it was made during a “without prejudice” meeting. Although the threat was not an admission, by applying the Broad Approach the whole of the “without prejudice” communications would be privileged, as Walker LJ explained (at 2443–2444 and 2449):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I have no doubt that busy practitioners are acting prudently in making the general working assumption that the [‘without prejudice’] rule, if not ‘sacred’ (<span class="font-italic">Hoghton</span><span class="font-italic"> v Hoghton</span> (1852) 15 Beav 278, 321), has a wide and compelling effect. That is particularly true where the ‘without prejudice’ communications in question consist not of letters or other written documents but of wide-ranging unscripted discussions during a meeting which may have lasted several hours.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At a meeting of that sort the discussions between the parties’ representatives may contain a mixture of admissions and half-admissions against a party’s interest, more or less confident assertions of a party’s case, offers, counter-offers, and statements (which might be characterised as threats or as thinking aloud) about future plans and possibilities. As Simon Brown LJ put it in the course of argument, a threat of infringement proceedings may be deeply embedded in negotiations for a compromise solution. Partial disclosure of the minutes of such a meeting may be, as Leggatt LJ put it in <span class="font-italic">Muller v </span><span class="font-italic">Linsley &amp; Mortimer</span> [1996] PNLR 74, 81, a concept as implausible as the curate’s egg (which was good in parts).

The circumstances were such that each side was entitled to expect to be able to speak freely, and their agreement to the meeting being arranged evinces that common intention. I would, if necessary, base my conclusion on the parties’ agreement to extend the normal ambit of the rule based on public policy. But I do not think it is necessary to go that far. The Frankfurt meeting was undoubtedly an occasion covered by the normal rule based on public policy, and the pleading of the threat (or claim of right) has not been shown to come within any recognised exception. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Walker LJ recognised (at 2448) that “the protection of admissions against interest is the most important practical effect of the rule”, but admissions are not the only communications that “without prejudice” privilege would cover.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Admissions against interest made during “without prejudice” negotiations might be seized upon by the opposing party if they were not privileged, and it is “thus in the overall spirit of encouraging negotiations that parties be sufficiently protected when they ‘lay their cards on the table’” (<span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span> at [43]). Admissions against interest are, however, not the only communications made during “without prejudice” negotiations that might prejudice their author if the communications were not protected by privilege. One example would be actionable threats such as that pleaded in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>. Likewise, a party might during negotiations assert a claim or defence that is not later pursued in court proceedings – it should not be prejudiced by the other party being able to make forensic use of that discrepancy. So too, if an exaggerated claim sum is put forward in negotiations, or if a party emphasises the strength of his case to an unreasonable extent, or indeed in an unreasonable manner. It would encourage settlements if the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of “without prejudice” communications are protected, and not merely <span class="font-italic">admissions against interest</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Broad Approach furthers the objective of encouraging settlements, as a matter of <span class="font-italic">policy</span> and <span class="font-italic">principle</span>; and it is the position at common law. Is the Broad Approach, however, precluded in Singapore by the Evidence Act or by binding authority (in particular, the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span>)?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Broad Approach is not precluded by s 23(1) of the Evidence Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 2(2) of the Evidence Act provides that “[a]ll rules of evidence not contained in any written law, so far as such rules are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Act, are repealed”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, s 23(1) (which is reproduced at [3] above) has been described as “a statutory enactment of the common law principle relating to the admissibility of ‘without prejudice’ communications based on the policy of encouraging settlements”: <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> at [24] (the applicable section at the time was s 23 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act (1997 Rev Ed)”), but this is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 23(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed)). One would expect the common law “without prejudice” principle not to be inconsistent with its statutory enactment in s 23(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 That was indeed the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span>, in relation to the application of the common law principle to third parties (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, parties other than the parties to the negotiations). The court noted at [25] that s 23 of the Evidence Act (1997 Rev Ed) “only refers to situations where it is the <span class="font-italic">parties to the negotiations</span> themselves who are attempting to renege on an express or implied agreement not to use admissions made in the course of negotiations against each other. The admissions in such cases are not relevant.” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The court went on to hold at [27]–[28] that s 23 cannot refer to the situation where a third party is involved; that situation was governed by the common law. Given the court’s interpretation that the rationale of the s 23 privilege was to encourage settlements, the court saw no inconsistency between that section and the common law principle as stated in <span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tompkins</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> was followed in <span class="font-italic">Krishna Kumaran s/o K Ramakrishnan v </span><span class="font-italic">Kuppusamy s/o Ramakrishnan</span> [2014] 4 SLR 232 (“<span class="font-italic">Krishna</span>”), where the High Court applied the common law “without prejudice” principle to cover a communication made to a messenger or informal mediator between the two disputing parties. <span class="font-italic">Krishna</span> was then approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> at [98].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> at [24] the court recognised that the “without prejudice” principle at common law has two justifications – first, the public policy of encouraging parties to negotiate and settle their disputes out of court; and second, an agreement between the parties that their negotiations should not be introduced into evidence. It then observed at [26] that section 23 of the Evidence Act (1997 Rev Ed) places emphasis on the second reason, “agreement”:  be it express agreement (now s 23(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Evidence Act (2020 Rev Ed)) or inferred agreement (now s 23(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, this did not mean that the public policy rationale was of no relevance to s 23. Although s 23 places emphasis on agreement, the court in <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> further held at [24] and [28] that the rationale of the s 23 privilege was to encourage settlements, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 23 has the same rationale as the common law “without prejudice” principle. That in turn entails applying the Broad Approach, as Walker LJ explained in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> at 2448–2449 (quoted above at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Given that s 23 and the common law “without prejudice” principle have the same rationale (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, public policy and agreement of parties), the common law principle (and the Broad Approach) is not inconsistent with s 23.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span>, the court reasoned that s 23 cannot refer to the situation where a third party is involved, but that the common law principle could and would still apply to that situation. On a parity of reasoning, as between the parties to the negotiations, s 23 only refers to admissions; if the “without prejudice” communications contain more than just admissions, the common law still applies to make the whole of the “without prejudice” communications privileged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Broad Approach is not precluded by </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Ernest Ferdinand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 An issue in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> was whether a certain letter between lawyers was “without prejudice” in nature. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that for the letter to be “without prejudice” in nature:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “the communications (in respect of which privilege is claimed) must arise in the course of genuine negotiations to settle a dispute”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “the communication must <span class="font-italic">constitute </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span><span class="font-italic"> involve</span> an admission against the maker’s interest” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">([67] read with [89] of the Court of Appeal’s decision, quoting from [489] of the first instance decision published as [2017] SGHC 14)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Court of Appeal however disagreed with the trial judge’s application of those principles. The judge had held that the letter was “without prejudice” in nature as it was a genuine invitation to negotiate a settlement, but the Court of Appeal considered that taking the 11-page letter as a whole, it conveyed little in the way of an invitation to negotiate a settlement – instead, the letter gave the impression that its author was trying to exert pressure on the recipient to acquiesce in the maker’s demands (at [89]–[94]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Significantly, the Court of Appeal observed that if two paragraphs (which the court quoted at [92]) were the only mention of criminal consequences, the court might not have thought them unusual in a letter concerning settlement negotiations; however, practically the entirety of the letter’s 11 pages, comprising 55 paragraphs, was devoted to an analysis of wrongdoing and replete with statements regarding wrongdoing and consequences (at [93]). Like the trial judge, the Court of Appeal considered whether <span class="font-italic">the letter</span> was privileged, and there was no suggestion that if certain paragraphs in the letter comprised statements about criminal consequences, rather than admissions against the author’s interest, then <span class="font-italic">those paragraphs</span> would not be privileged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It follows that a communication may be “without prejudice” in nature even if some parts of it are not admissions, but instead statements about the other party’s wrongdoing and the consequences thereof. That is consistent with the Broad Approach – if an objective inquiry based on the whole content and circumstances of the communication (<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand </span>at [90]) shows that the communication was made with the purpose of inviting negotiations for a settlement, that communication would be “without prejudice” in nature. The court would not then parse the communication to identify admissions as the only contents that are privileged, leaving the other aspects of the communication (references to wrongdoing and consequences, or portions emphasising the strength of a party’s own case – at [90] – and the like) unprotected by privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Indeed, the very formulation of the second pre-requisite (<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand </span>at [67]) that “the communication must <span class="font-italic">constitute </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span><span class="font-italic"> involve</span> an admission against the maker’s interest” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] itself shows that admissions are not the only aspects that are privileged. It is not only communications that “constitute” admissions that are privileged; communications that “involve” admissions (and also involve non-admissions) are privileged too. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Court of Appeal (at [86]) noted the argument that “the broader purpose of without prejudice privilege is to provide parties with a general freedom to negotiate, and therefore <span class="font-italic">things which go beyond admissions against interest should be capable of being protected</span>” [emphasis added]. The court did not disagree with this. On the contrary, the court (at [68] and [90]) approved of the observations in <span class="font-italic">Schering Corpor</span><span class="font-italic">ation v CIPLA Ltd</span> [2004] EWHC 2587 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Schering</span>”) , a decision that applied the Broad Approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In <span class="font-italic">Schering</span>, the court held that a certain letter was a “negotiating document”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a document indicating a willingness to negotiate, and as such the letter was protected by “without prejudice” privilege. The letter contained two paragraphs asserting the author’s confidence, on the basis of legal advice, that the other party’s patent was invalid, and a further paragraph to the effect that the author’s confidence in the correctness of its position was so great that it felt it is safe to proceed without regard to the other side’s position if negotiations were not entered into and resolved satisfactorily. The court however held that “the overall message continues to be one of wishing to negotiate” (at [21]). The court did not dissect out identifiable admissions (such as references to willingness to negotiate) and withhold protection from the rest of the “without prejudice” communications (such as the author’s assertions of the strength of its own position). The <span class="font-italic">whole</span> letter was privileged, not just the identifiable admissions in it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> (which endorsed <span class="font-italic">Schering</span>) does not preclude the Broad Approach.

It follows that whether the Broad Approach is the position in Singapore, or “without prejudice” privilege in Singapore only covers admissions, the same exceptions accepted in <span class="font-italic">Nicky Quek</span> would apply.

The court cited the decision of the majority in the House of Lords case of <span class="font-italic">Bradford &amp; Bingley plc v Rashid</span> [2006] 1 WLR 2066 (“<span class="font-italic">Bradford &amp; Bingley</span>”), that “without prejudice” privilege did not apply to “apparently open communications designed only to discuss the repayment of an admitted liability rather than to negotiate a compromise to a disputed liability” (<span class="font-italic">Greenline-Onyx </span>at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The first defendant, however, relied on <span class="font-italic">Greenline-Onyx</span> for a broader proposition. In <span class="font-italic">Greenline-Onyx</span>, the court noted (at [17]) that in <span class="font-italic">Bradford &amp; Bingley</span>, Lord Hope of Craighead was of the view “that the [without prejudice] rule did not apply to clear admissions or statements of fact that did not form part of an offer to compromise”. The first defendant relied on that to contend that the Relevant Portions of the Disputed Emails were statements of fact “not fairly incidental to the purpose of settling a dispute between the parties” (citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span>, vol 10 (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) at para 120.402). The first defendant also cited <span class="font-italic">Field v Commissioner for Railways for NSW</span> (1957) 99 CLR 285 as an example: there, the plaintiff’s admission to a doctor (appointed by the defendant) that the plaintiff himself was responsible for the injuries for which he was seeking compensation, was regarded as having been “made without any proper connexion with any purpose connected with the settlement of the action” (at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The court should be cautious about allowing such propositions to be used to erode the protection provided by the Broad Approach. As Lord Griffiths put it in <span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tompkins</span> at 1300:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There is also authority for the proposition that the admission of an ‘independent fact’ <span class="font-italic">in no way connected</span> with the merits of the cause is admissible even if made in the course of negotiations for a settlement.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The present case was not an “exceptional case” where statements of fact made in the course of negotiations were nevertheless “in no way connected” with the settlement that was being negotiated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In the first place, the Relevant Portions of the Disputed Emails were not “statements of fact”.

As for the plaintiff’s refusal to extend the LC, the plaintiff said that it would only agree to extend the LC if the negotiations concluded in a contract amendment – to the plaintiff, the extension of the LC was a potential outcome of the negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I thus did not agree with the first defendant’s contention that the Relevant Portions of the Disputed Emails were not privileged because they were communications of objective facts unconnected with the parties’ negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Relevant Portions of the Disputed Emails would also be privileged in the first place, even if the privilege only covered admissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For completeness, even if the Broad Approach is not the law in Singapore, the Relevant Portions of the Disputed Emails would nevertheless be privileged in the first place, for they all constitute admissions that would be protected by “without prejudice” privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, the Disputed Emails were “without prejudice” in nature to begin with (<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> at [67] and [89]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Disputed Emails concerned disputes between the parties (including about what the plaintiff should be paid) which the parties were trying to settle; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Disputed Emails contained admissions – intimations by both parties that they were willing to negotiate, and references to their settlement negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Second, the Relevant Portions of the Disputed Emails constituted admissions that, even on a narrow approach to “without prejudice” privilege, would be privileged: see [85] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 However, I rested my decision on the Broad Approach to “without prejudice” privilege conferring privilege on the Disputed Emails, but an exception (the Delay/Acquiescence Exception) applying to allow the first defendant to refer to the Relevant Portions to explain delay (or inaction) or apparent acquiescence, and particularly to rebut the plaintiff’s Assertions: (a) that the first defendant had taken no steps to extend the LC; and (b) that the first defendant had not taken issue with the plaintiff’s claim under the LC for the retention money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I considered this to be appropriate in terms of policy and principle, rather than merely protecting admissions, which would entail having to characterise each portion of the negotiations as an “admission” before it would be privileged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As a matter of policy and principle, the Broad Approach to “without prejudice” privilege furthers the objective of encouraging settlements.

The rest of those emails remained protected by “without prejudice” privilege.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Soon Peng Adrian, Ang Leong Hao, Wayne Yeo and Sia Bao Huei (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Toh Chen Han, Ang Wee Jian and Glenn Sim Sze Nyuang (MPillay) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Hong Liang, Kwek Yuan Justin and Tan Hao Ting Valerie (JWS Asia Law Corporation) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
