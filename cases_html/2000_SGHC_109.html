<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. The parties were married in July 1980 and have two children, a son

Mark born in 1981 and a daughter Nicole born in 1984. The marriage broke down in 1992 and

the husband left the matrimonial home at Block 48 Henley Court, #06-04, Astrid Meadows,

Coronation Road West (the "Astrid Meadows property"). The wife petitioned for a

divorce in March 1994 and was granted a <i>decree nisi</i> in June 1997.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The parties were unable to agree on the ancilliary matters. They

were heard by a district judge who made the following orders on 7 May 1999 –</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a) 45% of value of Astrid Meadows (45% of $4,380,000 = $1,971,000)

  (round up - $2 million).</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">If sale, Respondent to make his own refunds to CPF, to pay outstanding

    mortgage fees and expenses relating to sale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">b) Other assets</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">25% of $1,807,113 = $451,778.25 (round up - $500,000).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">c) Lump sum maintenance to Petitioner -$960,000</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Total - $3,442,111 ($3,460,000)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">d) Maintenance for Nicole - $3000 per month with effect from 15 May

  1999.</p>
<p align="justify">e) Costs to Petitioner fixed at $12,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. Both parties appealed against the orders. The husband sought to have

the maintenance for the wife reduced to $480,000 calculated at $4,000 a month for 10

years, to reduce her share of the matrimonial assets (other than the Astrid Meadows

property) to 25% of the net value rather than the gross value and against the order for

costs. In her appeal the wife wanted to have the orders on the division of the matrimonial

assets varied, and to have the costs taxed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. After hearing counsel, I ordered that</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><p align="justify">9. Each party is to bear its own costs in the appeal.</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The husband was unhappy with the result and appealed against the

orders in italics. I shall explain those of my orders which are under appeal.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Order 1 - The Astrid Meadows property</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. My order was an affirmation of the district judge’s order. The

effect of the order was that the wife was to receive $2 million as her share in this

property. I changed the wording to reflect its effect more succinctly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. As the district judge did not specify the time for payment of this

amount, I ordered that it be paid in three months, lest it be argued that the order was

effective and enforceable from the day it was made. The three month period was set to

enable the husband to sell the property or to raise the $2 million by other means.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The husband had not appealed against the district judge’s

order, and appeared to have accepted that he has to pay the wife the $2 million as her

share in the property. His counsel in their written submissions confirmed </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It was also ordered by the Learned District Judge on 7 May 1999 that

  the Petitioner be entitled to 45% of the matrimonial home at Astrid Meadows, which share

  shall be ascribed the rounded-off value of $2 million, the said $2 million to be paid by

  the Respondent to the Petitioner forthwith, either from the net proceeds of the sale of

  the matrimonial home or otherwise. <i>The Respondent has not appealed against this order</i>

  …</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Order 2 – The other matrimonial assets</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. Both parties have identified the matrimonial assets available which

they considered were subject to division. The wife’s list was "Annex A" to

the Petitioner’s Skeletal Submissions filed on 16 March 1999, and the husband’s

list was exhibit "R4".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. The district judge proceeded on the assumption that both parties

were comfortable with the wife’s list. This was not borne out by the notes of

evidence which showed counsel for the husband to have said "Annex A. It’s a fair

list of assets in the neutral sense. I will submit which should not be matrimonial

assets."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. The district judge added up the values of the assets in Annex A

(except an inheritance from the husband’s grandfather’s estate) and arrived at

the figure of $12,559,320.00. He then deducted from that the market value of the Astrid

Meadows property, shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd ("LKTH") and Lee Kim Tah

Pte Investments ("LKTI"), and the husband’s liabilities, and arrived at the

figure of $1,807,113, which he took to be the value of the other matrimonial assets.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. There were difficulties with his approach, <i>inter alia</i> -</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) The husband had not accepted the wife’s list.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) In that list the recorded values of the Astrid Meadows property

  and the Sydney property were their open market values without deducting the outstanding

  loans secured on these properties. These loans must be deducted from the market values.

  The value of an asset for the purpose of division is the value available for division. It

  is inappropriate to use market value (or gross value as the district judge put it) when

  loans are secured on the properties because only the balance remaining after discharging

  the loans is available for division.</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) The district judge mistook the numbers of LKTH and LKTI shares

  for their values.</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) The district judge erred in deducting the husband’s

  liabilities from the value of matrimonial assets. His liabilities could be taken into

  consideration if they come under section 112 (2)(b) of the Women’s Charter in

  apportioning the matrimonial assets, but they should not be taken out from the value of

  the matrimonial assets unless the liabilities are secured by the assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. I employed a different approach to identify the matrimonial assets.

I used the wife’s list as a starting point and determined which asset should be taken

into account, and how their values should be determined.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Sydney property</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. The two loans were taken by the husband to purchase the property.

The loans taken in 1994 and 1995 were documented. I ordered that the outstanding loans and

annual interest be deducted from the market value of the property in determining its value

for the purpose of division.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The LKTH and LKTI shares</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. The husband explained how he came to own these shares. Before his

marriage he received shares in three companies, namely Lee Realty Pte Ltd, Lee Development

Pte Ltd and Lee Kim Tah Pte Ltd as gifts from members of his family.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. In 1982 the three companies were part of an amalgamation exercise

to consolidate the companies into a holding company, LKTH. He deposed that "I was

offered the shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd and Lee Kim Tah Investments Pte Ltd in

consideration of the shares which I held earlier." He was married by this time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. The husband argued that the LKTH and LKTI shares are not

matrimonial assets under s 112(10), but I disagreed with him. The gift shares in the

original companies were no longer in existence at the time of division. He had accepted

the offer to exchange them for new shares. The new shares did not come from the donors and

were not gifts received in the course of amalgamation.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The SingTel shares</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. The husband did not dispute that he held 720 SingTel (A) shares and

600 SingTel (B) shares. He wanted to exclude them from division because "… these

shares were not acquisitions and the Petitioner herself has the same number of

shares."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. He did not explain how he came by those shares, and cannot expect

anyone to act on his bare assertion. The fact that the wife also held SingTel shares does

not mean that his shares are not matrimonial assets. It may mean that her SingTel shares

should also be considered for division, but that is another matter, and that is not a

matter under appeal before me.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Singapore Island Country Club ("SICC") and American Club

memberships</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. The husband claimed that they were given to him by his father. In

respect of the SICC membership, it was submitted that </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">This was a gift from the Respondent’s parents. When the membership

  was made transferable, in January 1992, the Respondent made an upfront payment of

  $14,000.00 and paid the balance in instalments of $500.00 monthly from 1<sup>st</sup> July

  1992 to 1<sup>st</sup> June 1998.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. The husband did not get his father to confirm the gifts, or obtain

confirmation from the clubs as he did in respect of the gift of a British Club membership.

I found that he had not proved them to my satisfaction. Even if there was a gift of the

SICC membership, it was a gift of a non-transferrable membership with no realisable value.

The present membership is a transferable membership. Assuming that it originated from a

gift, it is no longer that membership after it was converted at a cost of $50,000.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The bank accounts</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. Three accounts are in the husband’s sole name. One account

with OCBC is held with his father and another with POSB is held with his mother.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. The husband’s submissions dealt with these accounts in two

sentences - "There is no available cash for division. The Petitioner has more cash

than the Respondent." I cannot understand that. The accounts are in credit. Whether

or not the wife has more cash has no bearing on the issue. Her cash holdings may be

subject to division, but that is not a matter before me on the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. He also claimed that he was holding the account with his mother as

her trustee. This was a bare assertion with no documentary evidence, no explanation to the

purpose and terms of the trust, and no affidavit by the mother to confirm her beneficial

interest.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. In the circumstances, I ruled that the sums in the three accounts

in the husband’s name and half the funds in each of the accounts he held with his

parents are matrimonial assets.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The CPF funds</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. The husband’s position before the district judge was that the

wife should not be entitled to more than 20% of his CPF funds. In his appeal from the

district judge’s decision, the husband accepted the 25% apportionment but contended

that it should be computed on the net value. I have dealt with this net/gross issue in

paragraph 12(ii).</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Valuation of the assets</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. I ordered that the values of the matrimonial assets on which there

was no agreed values to be assessed by the Registrar. I also ordered that the values be

taken as at 7 May 1999 – the day when the district judge ordered the division. With

regard to the shares in two Malaysian counters United Engineers and Faber Merlin which

cannot be transacted currently, I ordered that their values be set at the time they can be

disposed of.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The maintenance for the wife</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. The district judge had ordered that she is to receive a lump sum of

$960,000 computed at $8000 per month for 10 years. Both parties agreed that there should

be a lump-sum amount pegged at 10 years. The wife had asked it to be computed on $14,000

per month, and the husband offered $4000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. In coming to his figure of $8000 the district judge took into

account the fact that it was common ground between the parties that the wife had enjoyed a

very high standard of living and a good quality of life during the marriage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. Prior to the hearing before him, the parties had an arrangement

whereby the husband paid to the wife $5000 for the maintenance of her and the daughter. He

also paid $3000 per month for the rental of the house the wife and daughter were staying

in, and $3090 towards the payment of the wife’s car. This arrangement is a reflection

of the parties’ expectations and abilities with regard to maintenance. The award

based on $8000 a month is reasonable.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Maintenance for the daughter</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. There was no appeal against this order in the husband’s notice

of appeal. Nevertheless his counsel submitted on it before me.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. Since it was brought up, I will comment on it, although I do not

regard it as a matter under appeal. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. In fixing the maintenance at $3000, the district judge found that

to be adequate maintenance. He was not obliged to set out the components to that figure,

and he did not. His finding that the wife and the family had enjoyed a very good quality

of life must have contributed to his decision, and he must have considered the wife’s

break-down of the $3400 that she claimed as well as the husband’s basis for offering

$2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. On the available material, I would not say that the district

judge’s award of $3000 was wrong. I may have come to a lower figure if the matter

came before me at the first instance, but the difference would not merit disturbing the

order even if there was an appeal.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The costs below</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. The district judge awarded costs to the wife for the hearing of the

ancillary matters fixed at $12,000. No costs were awarded on the petition, which was

grounded on separation and was not contested There can be two bases for the husband’s

objection to the order – on principle and on quantum.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36. His complaint is that costs should not be ordered because the

divorce proceeded on a no-fault basis, citing in support <i>Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat </i><nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 221</nobr> where the Court of Appeal said at pp 237-8</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The wife obtained a decree nisi on the ground that the marriage had

  irretrievably broken down owing to desertion on the part of the husband. Implicit in the

  grant of such decree to the wife was the finding of fault on the part of the husband as a

  cause for the divorce. In granting the decree nisi the court ordered, inter alia, that

  costs be adjourned for further hearing. We can find no reason why the wife should not be

  allowed the full costs of the hearing of the petition. As the hearing of the ancillary

  matters was a continuation or part of the hearing of the divorce petition, the wife should

  be entitled to the costs of such hearing also. The wife was awarded $240,000 as a lump sum

  maintenance and $10,000 as her share of the matrimonial assets. We cannot see any reason

  for depriving the wife of her costs of the hearing of the ancillaries. In our judgment,

  she should be entitled to full costs of the hearing of the petition and the ancillaries

  below, and we so order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37. This is not really relevant or helpful to the husband’s cause.

The Court held that the petitioner was entitled to the costs of the divorce hearing and

the hearing of the ancillary matters in a fault-based divorce. I do not read that to imply

that where a divorce proceeded on fault-free basis, costs should not be awarded for the

ancillary matters.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38. In the usual case where marriage is dissolved on a fault-free

ground no costs are awarded. This is especially so when the petition is not contested. If

it is contested, costs may be awarded if the respondent acts unreasonably, e.g. by

unreasonably disputing the separation or the breakdown of the marriage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39. However it does not follow that costs would not be awarded in

ancillary applications in fault-free uncontested proceedings in all cases. It really

depends on the conduct of the parties. If one party’s unreasonable conduct led to a

long hearing of ancillary matters, there is no reason why that party could not be ordered

to pay costs. In <i>Grenfell v Grenfell</i> [1978] 1 All ER 560 Ormrod LJ said at 568</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(I)f the court dissolves a marriage on the ground of five years’

  separation, it should not, in the ordinary way, grant costs to either side, the object

  being to prevent parties insisting on the court conducting an enquiry as to why they have

  been living apart for five years; in other words, having a contested suit simply for the

  purpose of deciding who should pay the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">So far as ancillary relief is concerned, it seems to me that <i>the

  costs in any proceedings for ancillary relief must depend on the way in which those

  proceedings are conducted on both sides</i>, and the judge must exercise his discretion in

  the ordinary way, bearing in mind perhaps that it is a five year separation case, but

  certainly not regarding himself as bound to make no order as to costs because the ground

  for decree was a five year separation. The matter must be dealt with, it seems to me, in a

  reasonable way in the light of the facts of any particular case.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40. In a hearing on ancillary matters, it is for the judge hearing them

to decide whether costs should be awarded. The Court of Appeal ruled in <i>Tham Khai Meng

v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette </i><nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 27</nobr> at p 47 that</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(T)he hearing of the ancillaries is part of or a continuation of the

  hearing of the petition. It therefore follows that where a party, whether petitioner or

  respondent, is awarded costs at the hearing of the petition, the same order as to costs

  should follow at the hearing of the ancillaries, <i>unless the party to whom the costs

  were awarded at the hearing of the petition has acted unreasonably at the hearing of the

  ancillaries</i> or for other good reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41. Thus a party awarded costs for the hearing of the petition may not

get the costs for the hearing of the ancillary matters if it acted unreasonably. This can

be taken further. In an appropriate case a court may even find a party’s conduct in

respect to the ancillary matters so unreasonable that costs be awarded against that party

although it was awarded costs on the divorce proper. To illustrate the point, a petitioner

proceeds on the ground of adultery. The respondent does not contest the petition, and

costs therein are awarded to the petitioner. On the ancillary matters, the petitioner

makes unjustified and unacceptable claims and demands on the matrimonial assets,

maintenance and care and custody of the children of the marriage and rejects reasonable

proposals from the respondent on these matters. In such a situation, costs for the hearing

of the ancillary matters may well be ordered against the petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42. The district judge had exercised his discretion to award costs for

the ancillary applications to the wife, and had fixed costs at $12,000, taking into

account the fact that the hearings took 2 days and the complexity in computation. I did

not think that the order was wrong in principle or excessive in amount, and I affirmed the

order.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Costs of the appeal</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43. Neither party has succeeded in getting what it wanted from the

appeals. The wife did not obtain the revision of the share of the matrimonial assets she

wanted, and the husband did not get the reduction of the wife’s maintenance and the

rescission of the order for costs. Looking at the matters as a whole, I ordered that each

party bears its own costs in the appeal.</p>
