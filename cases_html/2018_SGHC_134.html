[X] was a certified football coach whose team comprised boys aged 12–17. [X] left the team sometime in 2014 as a result of various disagreements with the accused. The accused then took over as the team’s coach and began recruiting boys below the age of 14. He changed the name of the club to mirror that of a registered football club. As part of the recruitment exercise, he designed his own pamphlets, which he distributed outside primary schools and in the neighbourhoods in the northwest of Singapore. He also created a Facebook page to promote the team. By 2015, most of the members of the team were primary school boys aged 12 or below.

</div> The accused, addressing the court, asked for a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment. I explained to the accused that the minimum term of imprisonment per charge for the offence which the accused pleaded guilty to was eight years’ imprisonment, and that the law mandated that the sentences for at least two charges to run consecutively, resulting in a cumulative minimum global sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment. The accused confirmed that he understood the applicable minimum terms, and did not seek to retract his plea of guilt.

</div> I therefore proceeded to sentence him after I examined the relevant circumstances and factors, which I explain below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable sentencing framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 There is no case setting out a sentencing framework for fellatio charged under s 376 of the Penal Code. In this connection, Mr Wee submitted that the sentencing framework introduced by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span> [2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”), for the offence of rape under s 375 of the Penal Code, ought to be used.  The Prosecution, on the other hand, was of the view that the framework devised by the Court of Appeal for the offence of digital penetration under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair v P</span><span class="font-italic">P</span> [2017] 2 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>”) was “a useful reference point”.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The framework approach in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Terence Ng</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Pram Nair</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal introduced a two-step sentencing framework for rape. At the first stage, the court should “identify under which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the factors which relate to the manner and mode by which the <span class="font-italic">offence</span> was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, offence-specific factors]”. The court should then “determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an ‘indicative starting point’, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the <span class="font-italic">offending act</span>” [emphasis in original]: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [39(a)]. Offence-specific factors include (a) group rape; (b) abuse of position and breach of trust; (c) premeditation; (d) violence; (e) rape of a vulnerable victim; (f) forcible rape of a victim below 14; (g) hate crime; (h) severe harm to the victim; and (g) deliberate infliction of special trauma: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [44]. The sentencing bands are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Band 1: cases with no or limited offence-specific aggravating factors (10–13 years’ imprisonment, 6 strokes of the cane);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Band 2: cases with two or more offence-specific aggravating factors (13–17 years’ imprisonment, 12 strokes of the cane);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Band 3: extremely serious cases of rape owing to the number and intensity of offence-specific aggravating factors (17–20 years’ imprisonment, 18 strokes of the cane). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 At the second stage, the court “should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are <span class="font-italic">personal to the offender </span>to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender” [emphasis in original]. These “relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances” and are distinct from the factors considered in the first step of the sentencing framework: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [39(b)]. Examples of offender-specific factors are: (a) offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing; (b) the presence of relevant antecedents; (c) remorse or lack thereof; (d) plea of guilt; and (e) age of the offender: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [63]–[65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework was adapted to suit the offence of digital penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>. In doing so, the two-step approach was retained but the sentencing bands were adjusted. The Court of Appeal was of the view that “there is an intelligible and defensible difference to be drawn, in terms of offence severity, between rape and digital penetration” (at [157]). Accordingly, the three sentencing bands laid down in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> were revised downwards for the offence of digital penetration:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Band 1: 7–10 years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Band 2: 10–15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Band 3: 15–20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Court of Appeal further held that where either of the two statutory aggravating factors under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are present, the case should fall within Band 2 or even Band 3: <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> (at [160]). The Court of Appeal, however, expressly declined to hold whether the three revised bands should similarly apply where the penetrating device is anything but a finger: <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [159]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The offence and offender specific stages and matrix were used in both cases, and this approach is equally useful in this case. The Court of Appeal made clear in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> its preference for the use of sentencing bands in the interests of clarity, transparency, coherence and consistency (at [37]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The issue in this case was whether the sentencing bands as set out in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>or <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> would be more appropriate. I disagreed with Mr Wee that the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> bands were the better option, which in any event carried longer terms of imprisonment. In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, at [150], the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between rape and digital penetration because the latter carries no risk of pregnancy and is a relatively less intimate act. The same logic applies to cases of fellatio, which, when compared with rape, carries the same “intelligible and defensible difference in offence severity” that the Court of Appeal was concerned with at [157]. In this vein, our local legislative approach is different from that of several other jurisdictions, where legislation has expressly defined rape to include fellatio. For instance, in the United Kingdom, s 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (c 42) (UK) (“Sexual Offences Act 2003”) defines rape as the penetration of the vagina, anus or <span class="font-italic">mouth</span> of another person with a penis. The same also applies to some Australian states: see ss 38 read with 35A of the Crimes Act 1958 (No 6231 of 1958) (Vic), s 349 of the Criminal Code 1899 (No 9 of 1899) (Qld), s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (No 2252 of 1935) (SA), and ss 185 read with 2B(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (No 69 of 1924) (Tas). In contrast, Parliament did not define rape in s 375 of the Penal Code to include fellatio. Hence, there was force in the Prosecution’s suggestion that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework could be a useful reference point, although the Court of Appeal specifically declined to decide whether the sentencing bands should apply outside of digital penetration by finger. I would agree that, <span class="font-italic">broadly speaking,</span> the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework is a useful point of reference, <span class="font-italic">so long as </span><span class="font-italic">one is aware of the context in which the sentencing bands were set</span>. Let me elaborate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Using Pram Nair as a point of reference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> (at [159]) was clear in restricting the stated sentencing bands to the offence of digital sexual penetration. The Prosecution was, in effect, seeking to extend the framework. The question, therefore, is whether it is appropriate to extend the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework<span class="font-italic"> </span>beyond its intended scope. And if so, how the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework ought to be applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The present offence of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code was introduced by Parliament in 2008. Prior to its introduction, s 376 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the pre-2008 Penal Code”) dealt with the punishment for rape. Section 377 criminalised “unnatural offences”. Because of the limited scope of sexual offences under the pre-2008 Penal Code, many serious sexual offences, including fellatio, were prosecuted under s 377: see Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore</span> (LexisNexis, 2nd Rev Ed, 2015) at para 12.73. Such offences were committed when one “voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals”. Section 377 was repealed by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (No 51 of 2007). The Amendment also introduced the offences of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 as presently enacted, and that of sexual penetration of a minor under 16 under s 376A. Various other provisions relating to sexual exploitation of minors were also enacted: ss 376B–G. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 These amendments sought to achieve several objectives. First, the offences from ss 376A–G were meant to protect minors from sexual abuse. A conscious decision was also made to ensure that the provisions were gender neutral, so that male minors could be protected from female abusers. Second, s 377, which criminalised consensual oral and anal sex between a male and a female, was deleted because most Singaporeans did not find this offensive or unacceptable. In its place, s 376 was enacted to cover non-consensual oral and anal sex. Third, these new provisions widened the spectrum of offences, thereby giving the Prosecution greater choice in deciding the appropriate charge to prefer, <span class="font-italic">based on the circumstances of the case</span>: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (22 October 2007) vol 83 at cols 2187–2199 (Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As a result of the above amendments, the Penal Code sets one sentencing range for, and groups together, many forms of sexual penetration under s 376 and s 376A; including penile penetration of the mouth or anus, and penetration of the vagina or anus with any object. Hence, while each provision in the Penal Code reflects some difference in the type of sexual act, the Penal Code, in terms of sentencing, does not draw bright lines separating one form of sexual penetration, not amounting to rape, from another.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The sentencing approaches taken by other jurisdictions also do not show any sharp distinction between the various types of penetration not amounting to rape: see <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [143]-–[145]. In <span class="font-italic">Doe v Regina</span> [2013] NSWCCA 248, the Supreme Court of New South Wales held at [54] that it is “erroneous to attempt to rank forms of forced sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness”. Furthermore, the UK Sentencing Council placed both penile and digital penetration in the same category of culpability (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Category 2 of Harm) in its sentencing guidelines for the offence of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity under s 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (the most serious which the accused could have been prosecuted if he had committed these offences in the UK): see the UK Sexual Offences Definite Guideline at pp 42-–44. Turning to Canada, where the  present offending acts would fall under the offences of sexual interference (under s 151 of the Canadian Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c 46 (Can) (“Canadian Criminal Code”), which applies when the victim is under 16, and where consent is irrelevant) and sexual assault (under s 273 of the Canadian Criminal Code, where lack of consent is an element of the offence), the Alberta Court of Appeal confirmed in <span class="font-italic">R v Hajar</span> [2016] ABCA 222 (“<span class="font-italic">Hajar</span>”) at [2] and [81] that the starting point for “major sexual interference” and “major sexual assault” is three years’ imprisonment. Pertinently, conduct which fall into these categories include vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus: <span class="font-italic">Hajar</span> at [10]. By using the same starting point for a wide range of sexual offences, it appears that the Court did not draw a sharp distinction between them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I note that some of the previous local authorities draw a distinction, in terms of severity, between different sexual acts. The Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">Adam </span><span class="font-italic">bin Darsin v PP </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 709 at [21]–[22], and Woo Bih Li J in <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span> at [61]–[64] (following <span class="font-italic">Adam bin Darsin v PP</span>) considered that anal intercourse was more serious than fellatio. In <span class="font-italic">PP v </span><span class="font-italic">BMD </span>[2013] SGHC 235 (“<span class="font-italic">BMD</span>”), Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) put fellatio and penile-anal penetration on the same footing, one level above digital-anal penetration (at [73]). Consideration of different sexual acts within a specific case is a different issue, however, from that of applicable sentencing bands. These cases concerned <span class="font-italic">multiple offending acts </span><span class="font-italic">which were carried out in the same factual setting</span>. When imposing sentence in an individual case, it is pertinent to impose different sentences for each type of sexual activity.  This is for two reasons: first, to indicate the relative gravity of each offending act; and second, to ensure a correct overall sentence that reflects the totality of the criminal conduct. Thus the differing gradations used in <span class="font-italic">BMD</span> and <span class="font-italic">Adam bin Darsin</span> are best explained in the light of the factual context and overall criminality of the specific cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 <span class="font-italic">Across cases, </span>however, which is the comparison that sentencing frameworks seek to draw, a gradation of sexual acts, while still technically relevant, could play a much smaller role, <span class="font-italic">because the facts and circumstances of each case are unique, and the precise nature of the sexual act itself is part of a wider context and factual setting</span>. This is what the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework seeks to acknowledge. A specific act of fellatio in a particular setting could cause much greater harm than another specific act of digital penetration in another setting. Therefore, it would be better to weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in each case, using <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, very broadly speaking, as a conceptual frame. To put the point another way, the gravamen of the complaint in each case must be the serious psychological trauma caused to victims by a grave intrusion into their bodily integrity and sexual autonomy: the harm, and therefore the sentence, in each case, must depend upon the full context, of which the specific sexual act is only one aspect. Thus, any framework to be used across cases should be one that is broad in nature, having regard to all the facts and circumstances, including, in its context, the specific sexual act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Moreover, if multiple frameworks were created for each different sexual act within s 376, the applicable bands might any event overlap to such an extent that it may not be useful to have separate ones for each of the disparate acts. It is important to note that even the delineation between digital penetration and rape is a somewhat fluid one, although the Court of Appeal was of the view that there was an intelligible difference between rape (a s 375 offence) and digital penetration (see <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [157]). The sentencing bands for both offences overlap. Band 2 in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> is 13–17 years, while the same band in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> is 10–15 years. In a particular case, the specific aggravating factors such as the abuse of trust, age of the victims and circumstances of the offences could be of greater importance than the precise nature of the sexual act. Thus, an offender sentenced for digital penetration could receive sentences in totality higher than an offender sentenced for rape,<span class="font-italic"> depending upon the accumulation of all the factors within the stages of sentencing</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>For this reason, it may be less practical to have multiple frameworks for the different sexual acts within s 376, and more useful to recognise the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> bands as broadly applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Two decisions reflect this broad approach in the context of the range of sexual acts encompassed by s 376A of the Penal Code. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PP v BAB</span> [2017] 1 SLR 292 (“<span class="font-italic">BAB</span>”) did not draw a distinction between the different types of sexual penetration when laying down starting points for ss 376A(2) and (3); indeed in relation to s 376A(2), the court’s starting point was stated specifically to apply to “each of the offences under this section in this case” (at [65(a)]). Again, in setting the starting point for fellatio under s 376A(2), where the minor above 14 was not coerced and there was no abuse of trust, Sundaresh Menon CJ did not draw any distinction between an accused who performs and an accused who receives fellatio: see <span class="font-italic">AQW v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span> [2015] 4 SLR 150 at [41]. In my view, this is apt <span class="font-italic">because the starting points in question were simply indicative guides, which may be used for a range of sexual </span><span class="font-italic">misconduct</span>. The same logic applies with greater force when one considers the use of sentencing <span class="font-italic">bands</span>, as these ranges are framed, as a matter of definition, to accommodate a width of factual circumstances in coming to a sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevance of previous sentencing norms set for fellatio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 A final point to consider is the previous sentencing norms set for fellatio. There is no sentencing norm set for fellatio under s 376. There have been, however, cases involving sentences for fellatio under s 376A(3). In this regard, <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>expressed the view that ss 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 376A(3) have a lot in common and overlap in scope in some situations. Hence, guidance may be sought from cases that have decided sentencing norms under s 376A(3) for the purposes of sentencing under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The cases under s 376A(3) have evolved significantly over time. The previous norms set out in <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span> is a starting point of 6-–7 years (I should caveat that in the light of the minimum sentence of eight years applicable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span> may be less relevant). In<span class="font-italic"> BAB</span>, the Court of Appeal held that in cases involving an abuse of trust, a starting point of 10–12 years would be appropriate. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>then remarked that the framework it set out in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> could require review (at [164]). At the same time, again after the case of <span class="font-italic">BAB</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal stated a preference for sentencing bands over the use of a starting point, because the Court was of the opinion that the use of sentencing bands would better serve the interests of clarity, transparency, coherence and consistency (at [37]), and further held that the starting point approach should be restricted to offences which almost invariably manifest in a particular way. In other words, the starting point approach is better suited for offences which can be committed in circumscribed situations; as opposed to offences which may be committed in an expansive number of ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Pulling these strands together, the sentencing norm set out in <span class="font-italic">BAB </span>and the framework approach in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>can be reconciled when modified in the light of the Court of Appeal’s concerns expressed in the latter case. The <span class="font-italic">BAB </span>sentencing norm should not be taken as a starting point but merely as guidance in the Band 2 analysis. While Band 2 requires at least two aggravating factors to be engaged, this requirement is common in breach of trust cases. This is because victim vulnerability and planning are typical of such cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Having regard, thus, to the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> sentencing bands as broad norms and the previous norms set for fellatio, I was of the view that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> Bands of 7–10, 10–15, 15–20 years were useful in deciding the individual sentences. I now turn to deal with the two stages of analysis below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Offence specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 At the first stage, the court identifies the relevant offence-specific factors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Young age of victims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The victims’ youth is a statutory aggravating factor under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code.

As for Defence submission that no force was used on the victims and that they did not object to the accused’s acts, these considerations were wholly irrelevant because the statutory aggravating factor deems the age of the victims to be such that they were too young to know how to object or resist. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Abuse of trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As a football coach to the victims, the accused had undoubtedly held a position of authority which he misused.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my judgment, this misses the point. The degree of trust reposed in any accused turns on the facts and circumstances of each case – the use of “institutional” or “familial” labels should not obscure this inquiry. The actions of the accused, such as the distribution of printed pamphlets to advertise his lessons, and his active engagement with the boys’ parents, who entrusted their children to his care, showed that he had sought a position of responsibility. The law would operate unjustly if an accused who actively sought and obtained a position of trust in his victims’ lives by plan and premeditation could later contend that he need not take responsibility for such authority simply because it was not vested in him by an institution of some sort, but through his own cunning and connivance. A parallel may be drawn with <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, where the accused met the victim at the stall where he was carrying out his trade and invited her to his flat. After discovering that she had run away from home, he called her parents and offered to act as her godfather. This offer was accepted by her parents. Two weeks later, they engaged in sexual intercourse, for which Ng was charged with statutory rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code. It was submitted on behalf of Ng that there was no abuse of trust, because Ng and the minor had only known each other for two weeks prior to their first sexual encounter. The Court of Appeal rejected this submission, because Ng “had been allowed unrestricted access to the [victim] with the express consent of her parents only because he undertook to act as her ‘godfather’ and promised to ‘take care’ of her”: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [88]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Premeditation and planning</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 “The presence of planning and premeditation evinces a considered commitment towards law-breaking and therefore reflects greater criminality”, and an example would be the “taking of deliberate steps towards the isolation of the victim”: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [44(c)]. The accused actively recruited young boys to his team by distributing pamphlets around primary schools and neighbourhood spaces. He purposefully changed the age profile of the team, from 12–17 years old to 12 and under, in order to target the younger and more vulnerable. This provided him with easy access to potential victims. Mr Wee did not dispute that premeditation was a relevant aggravating factor here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I wish to highlight a further point. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>the rationale behind premeditation and planning being an aggravating factor is an accused’s commitment towards law-breaking. In the present case, apart from his aggressive and targeted recruitment campaign, the accused was also persistent and committed in his pursuit of his desires.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I rejected this submission for several reasons. First, there was no evidence of the extent of the trauma which the accused suffered. Mr Wee contended that the accused had sought treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) for mental trauma and mental disability arising from the sexual abuse. In a reply to Mr Wee’s enquiry, however, TTSH said that it was unable to furnish a medical report because of the lapse in time, as the accused was last seen at TTSH in <span class="font-italic">1998</span>. <span class="font-italic">The accused would have been </span><span class="font-italic">only nine years old in 1998</span>, even though the accused claimed to have been sexually abused when he was around 15 years old.

</div> Secondly, Dr Lee, in the report dated 23 October 2017, upon which Mr Wee sought to rely, did not state that there was a <span class="font-italic">causal</span> link between the accused’s unfortunate history of sexual abuse and his diagnosis of paedophilia. Quite the contrary, he recognised that the link between the two has “not been firmly established”, and that there are various other factors which can result in the development of paedophilic disorder.

</div> The accused’s submissions in this respect were therefore speculative. Third, arguments which seek to render unlawful conduct excusable in this way must, as a matter of principle, be treated with caution, as they undermine acceptable societal standards and appropriate responses to trauma. In any event, insofar as it is accepted that such trauma could create a tendency for replication, there could arguably then be an issue of specific deterrence where such accused persons are concerned. But to be clear, this point had no relevance to the sentence, because, as mentioned, there was insufficient evidence of trauma suffered by the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Paedophilia</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The accused was remanded in Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre from 3 to 30 October 2015, and from 7- to 27 October 2016, where he was assessed by Dr Lee.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Dr Lee’s assessment that the risk of him reoffending was at least moderate to high. This was a relevant aggravating factor. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v PP</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 37, the Court of Appeal held at [21(b)], in discussing paedophilic offences, that “[t]he presumption is that the safety of the child must be paramount and chronic paedophiles who have a propensity to reoffend, because they are either totally unable or unwilling to control themselves, have to be put away for long periods”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Mr Wee did not dispute Dr Lee’s assessment but emphasised that treatments for paedophilic disorders exist.

</div> Presumably, the point sought to be made was that the accused’s likelihood of reoffending could be lowered with treatment, and hence should not be accorded full weight as an aggravating factor. I note, however, that Dr Lee stated in his report that evidence on the efficacy of such treatments is “weak due to the paucity of well controlled and randomized studies with adequate follow up duration and sample size”. He was therefore “guarded” on the prospect of a cure.

</div> 17 of the TIC offences were of a similar nature to the charges proceeded with, which justified an increase in sentence: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [64(a)]. In <span class="font-italic">PP v Goh Jun Guan</span> [2017] SGHC 2 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Jun Guan</span>”) at [94] Woo J emphasised the gravity where multiple crimes were committed against multiple victims: the higher the number of victims, the greater the need for deterrence, retribution and protection.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">General deterrence aspects of offender’s conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Of relevance here was a need for general deterrence. The High Court held in <span class="font-italic">PP v Law Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Law Aik Meng</span>”) at [24]–[25] that need for general deterrence arises where offences have been committed against several vulnerable victims, and where the crime is of such a nature as to cause public disquiet and offend the sensibilities of the general public. The goal of specific deterrence was also engaged on these facts as the offences were premeditated: see <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> at [22] and the discussion above at [41]–[42]. These various criteria were met in the case at hand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on stage 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The only relevant mitigating factor was the accused’s plea of guilt. On the other side of the scale were the multiplicity of charges and the need for deterrence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The discussion thus far may be summarised as follows: (i) the conceptual frame and factors approach of <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> is applicable; (ii) its sentencing bands could be used, broadly speaking, as a useful reference point. Coming then to (iii), the placement of these offences within these bands, with the accumulation of aggravating factors at hand and considering the interests of the public, it would be conservative to say that each individual offence sat squarely within Band 2 of <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of 10–15 years. With these points in mind, I turn then to (iv), the overall sentence. In this context, I consider totality and proportionality. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Totality and the overall sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Both the Prosecution and the Defence relied upon <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as a relevant precedent. Yap was sentenced, in total, to 30 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The offender, Yap, befriended victims on Facebook under different personas and earned their trust by portraying himself as an elder brother or mentor. He then arranged to meet on various pretexts and brought the victims to various places to commit sexual offences against them. He cajoled and persuaded the victims to engage in sexual activities with him even though some of them had expressed reluctance. On some occasions, he filmed the sexual acts with his mobile phone, albeit with the victims’ knowledge. Yap faced a total of 76 charges, for offences committed against 30 boys between the ages of 11 and 15, over a period of two-and-a-half years. He was diagnosed to be suffering from hebephilia (sexual interest in pubescent individuals), and his risk of reoffending was assessed to be high. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Yap’s charges were different from those the accused faced. Yap pleaded guilty to 12 charges, comprising 11 charges of sexual penetration of a minor under 14, an offence punishable under s 376A(3) of the Penal Code, and one charge of sexual penetration of a minor under 16, an offence punishable under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code. These charges related to various types of penetrative acts, including penile-anal penetration, performing and receiving fellatio, and digital anal penetration. In applying <span class="font-italic">Yap</span> to the case at hand, both the Prosecution and the Defence were, in effect, comparing the overall severity of the criminal conduct in both cases. In other words, they sought to ensure that ordinal proportionality was observed in sentencing the accused. This approach was consistent with the totality principle as elucidated in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam</span> <span class="font-italic">v PP</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) at [47]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Looking at the overall criminality of both cases, the offending in <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span> is more serious in some respects. In particular, Yap faced 76 charges in relation to 30 victims, while the accused faced 22 sexual offence related charges in relation to seven victims. Yap also offended over a longer period of time, two-and-a-half years. Further, ten of the charges Yap pleaded guilty to involved penetrating his victims’ anus with his penis, which Woo J found to be more serious than fellatio: see <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span> at [58]–[61]. On the other hand, the victims in this case are younger, the youngest being eight years old. And this age group was specifically engineered by the accused when he took over the club, changing the focus from players aged 12–17. Children in the former age-group are unable to fend for themselves, as shown starkly by the facts of the offences at hand. The abuse of trust in this case is also worse than that in <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span>, because of the vulnerability of the victims and the accused’s engagement with the children’s parents. Further, there was a higher level of planning and premeditation, in terms of the renaming the club to mirror a professional club’s name, maintaining its Facebook presence and designing its brochures. Yap had hebephilia, while the accused has paedophilia. As was described in <span class="font-italic">Yap</span> <span class="font-italic">Weng Wah</span> at [84], paedophilia is the primary and exclusive attraction to prepubescent children generally aged 13 and below while hebephilia is a conscious preference for pubescent individuals generally aged 11 to 14. After weighing up the various issues and considering the objectives of parity, rank order and the spacing of penalties necessary in ensuring ordinal proportionality (as referred to by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">R v Arcand</span> [2010] AJ No 1383 at [50]) between <span class="font-italic">Yap Weng Wah</span> and the case at hand, I was of the view that the accused’s sentence ought to take reference from, but be appreciably lower than Yap’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In the present case the accused pleaded guilty to five charges. In the light of the multiplicity of victims and charges and the public interest considerations at hand, in line with <span class="font-italic">ADF v PP</span> [2010] 1 SLR 874 (at [146]), I considered whether more than two sentences ought to run consecutively. I decided against it, because—unless I adjusted the individual sentences very substantially—the overall sentence would have been crushing, having regard to the principles outlined in <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [47]. It was in my view more appropriate to order individual sentences within Band 2 and, in that light, it was sufficient to order two terms of imprisonment to be consecutive as required by s 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my judgment, it was accordingly sufficient and appropriate to impose 13 years’ imprisonment on each proceeded charge, with two sentences to run consecutively, resulting in a total of 26 years’ imprisonment. As for caning, the minimum prescribed punishment is 12 strokes of the cane per charge under s 376(4)(b) of the Penal Code. The accused was therefore ordered to receive a total of 24 strokes, the maximum permitted under s 328(6) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For the foregoing reasons, I sentenced the accused to 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each of the five charges. Two sentences of imprisonment were to run consecutively, with the other sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. In the result, a term of 26 years’ imprisonment with effect from the date of first remand on 3 October 2015 and 24 strokes of the cane were imposed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">David Khoo and James Chew (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Wee Hong Shern (Ong &amp; Co LLC) for the accused.<br/></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
