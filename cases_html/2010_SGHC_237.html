<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a tenancy dispute. The defendant, Thong
                    Hup Gardens Pte Ltd (“THG”), is the head tenant of a plot of land
                    situated at Jurong West Street 25 with an estimated area of 116, 600 square
                    metres (“Plot 2”) which it rented from The Government of the
                    Republic of Singapore represented by The Housing and Development Board
                    (“HDB”) pursuant to a tenancy agreement made on 21 July 2005
                    (“the Head Lease”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Fico Sports Inc Pte. Ltd.
                    (“Fico”) is THG’s sub-tenant in respect of a portion of Plot
                    2 having an area of 40,000 square metres (“the Premises”) as
                    described in the lease dated 6 February 2006 (“the
                    Sub-Lease”) between THG and Fico. Following disputes that arose in the
                    course of the Sub-Lease, the parties entered into a settlement agreement dated
                    11 March 2008 (“the Settlement Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This action was started by Fico in February
                    2009. The main reliefs that it seeks are as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       THG is in the business of horticulture. At all
                    material times, it was run by Mr Toh Thong Hup
                    (“Mr Toh”) and his daughter Toh Gek Hoon (“Joey
                    Toh”). Fico was incorporated in December 2005 to carry on the business of
                    acquiring, developing, and leasing sports facilities. It has several directors
                    but the persons who represented the company in its dealings with THG were
                    Mr Lau Nam Foong Gary (“Mr Lau”) and his wife,
                    Mdm Fiona Loy (“Fiona Loy”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In April 2005 THG learnt that the Government of
                    Singapore, through the HDB, was offering by way of public tender to let out two
                    parcels of land at Jurong West Street 25 for short term or interim uses. The
                    tender papers specified that the uses to which a successful tenderer could put
                    the parcels of land were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Turf production;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Nursery (including tree/plant
                        storage);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Sports ground; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Adventure training ground.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">However, at least half of each parcel of land had to be put to a
                    non-agricultural use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       THG put in a bid for the second plot of land,
                    Plot 2, which had an area of 116,600 square metres, and offered to pay rent of
                    $12,826.00 a month or 11 cents per square metre. By letter dated 8 July
                    2005, HDB notified its acceptance of THG’s bid. THG’s intention at
                    that stage was to use half of Plot 2 for the purposes of a nursery and to
                    construct football pitches and badminton courts on the other
                portion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At about this time, Mr Lau made contact
                    with THG. At a meeting with Mr Toh and Joey Toh in July 2005, Mr Lau
                    informed them that he wanted to take a sub-lease of part of Plot 2 in order to
                    carry on sporting activities, particularly tennis. There were several meetings
                    between the parties thereafter and the accounts of what were discussed at these
                    meetings vary somewhat. It is Fico’s position that from the outset
                    Mr Lau had made it clear to THG that it was absolutely crucial for
                    Fico’s business to succeed that it be able to have food and beverage
                    facilities (which Fico referred to as “F&amp;B”) with cooking and
                    eating-in at its business premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Lau testified that, on or about
                    11 October 2005 he had given Mr Toh a presentation regarding the
                    business that Fico would carry on at Plot 2 and had given examples of the
                    projected use of retail shops on the Premises. These included fast food outlets
                    and seafood restaurants. Mr Lau said that he had had a discussion with
                    Mr Toh after the presentation during which Mr Toh had told him that
                    there would be no problem for part of the Premises being used for F&amp;B with
                    cooking and eating-in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Toh denied this allegation. He stated
                    that at no time during his meeting with Mr Lau was there any conversation
                    about F&amp;B outlets being set up in the Premises. He did recall a meeting at
                    HDB’s office attended by Mr Lau, Joey Toh and Mr Toh himself in
                    October 2005. At that meeting, Mr Lau had asked HDB about the provision of
                    F&amp;B facilities on the Premises. The HDB officer, one Mr Goh Choon
                    Ngwen, informed Mr Lau that only drinks and snacks could be served at the
                    Premises. Mr Toh categorically stated in his affidavit that he had never
                    told Mr Lau that any part of Plot 2 could be used for food &amp; beverage
                    with cooking and eating-in. The allegation that he had induced Mr Lau to
                    enter into a tenancy agreement by representing that the Premises could be used
                    for F&amp;B with cooking and eating-in at the Premises was a blatant
                lie.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Shortly after THG’s first meeting with
                    Mr Lau, the tenancy agreement in respect of Plot 2 was signed and dated
                    21 July 2005. Clause 1.1 of the Head Lease provided that the term of
                    the lease would be “three + three + three years” from
                        1<sup>st</sup> August 2005. It was later clarified by the
                    parties that this provision meant that the original term of the lease was a
                    period of three years only but that the HDB could renew the grant of the lease
                    for up to two further periods of three years each. Clause 4.1.1 of the Head
                    Lease set out the approved use of Plot 2 in the same terms as stated in the
                    tender. The Head Lease also contained the following material terms:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Clause 4.2.5 – THG was not permitted
                            to erect or put up any structure on Plot 2 without the prior written
                            consent of HDB;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Clause 4.2.6 – THG was not to
                            undertake any addition or alteration works without the prior written
                            approval of HDB and the relevant authorities and also had to engage
                            competent professionals to submit plans, drawings and calculations to
                            the relevant authorities in the event that HDB gave their consent and
                            before the works could be proceeded with; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Clause 7.1 – at the written request of
                            the tenant made three months before the expiration of the term, HDB
                            could grant the tenant a further tenancy of Plot 2 for a further term of
                            up to three years subject to new terms and conditions and the market
                            rent prevailing at time of renewal to be decided by HDB provided that at
                            the time of the request there had been no breach of any of the terms and
                            conditions by the tenant.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 11 October 2005, a letter of intent
                    was signed by THG and Mr Lau. By this letter, THG agreed to sub-lease about
                    25,000 square metres of Plot 2 to Mr Gary Lau to develop a sports complex
                    with his business partners. The letter stated that the land would be used for
                    “Football field &amp; tennis only (All other sport facilities are
                    subjected to approval by HDB)”. The rental to be paid was 18 cents per
                    square metre per month and the duration of the lease was stated to be three
                    years plus three years plus three years “according to our master lease
                    date and period”. I note in passing that the terms of the letter on the
                    use of the land were consistent with Mr Toh’s evidence that
                    Mr Lau wanted the land to develop his sports business - particularly in
                    relation to tennis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The letter of intent was initially drafted by
                    Mr Lau and sent to THG for the latter’s approval. It is THG’s
                    position that Mr Lau had a copy of the Head Lease at the time he prepared
                    the letter of intent. Fico, however, denies this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In November 2005, THG entered into a contract
                    with a firm of professional engineers and consultants called HSK &amp;
                    Associates (“HSK”) and subsequently submitted to HDB a set of
                    plans that HSK had drawn up in respect of THG’s intended use of Plot 2.
                    HSK, pursuant to a separate appointment by Mr Lau, additionally drew up
                    plans for the use of the Premises which were also submitted to the HDB by THG.
                    Fico’s plans included a structure bearing the description
                    “Single-Storey Shop with Ancillary Office and Changing Room (Blk
                    3)” (hereinafter called “Block 3”) which contained 19
                    units some of which were marked “Shop (F&amp;B)”. Whilst
                    Fico’s allegation was that its requirements and plans were incorporated by
                    THG in its master plan which were then submitted to the HDB, THG took the
                    position that Fico had instructed HSK in respect of the drawings needed for the
                    structures to be put up on the Premises and that THG was never involved in
                    instructing HSK regarding Fico’s drawings. Eventually, because THG was the
                    head lessee, HSK put the respective parties’ submissions together and
                    forwarded them to the competent authorities for approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Fico was incorporated in December 2005. In
                    February 2006, the Sub-Lease was entered into by the parties. The document was

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Sub-Lease does not contain any
                    clause dealing with sub-letting of the Premises. The first draft of this
                    document which Mr Lau forwarded to THG contained a clause 5 which
                    read: “The Tenant may sub-let the premise in whole or in part provided
                    the HDB requirement for sub-letting is met”. THG asked for this
                    clause to be deleted and Mr Lau agreed. Mr Toh explained he had
                    made this request because he did not want to give Fico the right to sub-let. He
                    did not know then that this was the wrong way to achieve his aim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Two further matters need to be mentioned in
                    this account of the background. First, by an option dated 17 July 2006, THG
                    granted Fico an option to rent an additional 18,300 square metres from it at an
                    additional rental of $1,800.00 per month. This option was exercised by Fico on
                    22 March 2007. Secondly in January 2008, Fico started an action in the
                    District Court against THG alleging that THG had encroached on the Premises.
                    This dispute was later resolved by mediation and parties entered into the
                    Settlement Agreement to record the agreed terms. Clause 9 of the Settlement
                    Agreement read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“FSIPL may sub-let the demised land provided that HDB has no
                        objection to the sub-letting. FSIPL shall copy the appropriate
                        correspondence to THGPL.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The parties did not have an easy relationship.
                    On 25 March 2009, HDB issued THG with a notice to quit. In turn, THG issued
                    and served a notice to quit on Fico on 26 March 2009. In any case, the
                    original term of the Head Lease expired on 31 July 2008 and, to date, no
                    renewal of the tenancy has been granted by the HDB to THG. THG wrote to HDB on
                    4 August 2008 purporting to exercise its option to obtain an extension of
                    the Head Lease but in its reply of 11 August 2008, HDB stated that it would
                    only consider an extension after the infringements of the Head Lease which had
                    occurred by reason of unauthorised sub-letting of parts of the Premises and
                    unauthorised A&amp;A works thereon had been rectified/or regularised. Such
                    regularisation has not yet taken place. Both parties however, continue in
                    occupation of their respective portions of Plot 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties’ Complaints</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fico’s side of the story</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Fico’s first complaint relates to its
                    inability to use the Premises for cooking and eating-in. It states that such
                    facilities are critical to its business success and that THG knew this right
                    from the outset. In order to induce Fico to enter into the Sub-Lease, THG made
                    various representations regarding the use of the Premises for Fico’s
                    F&amp;B requirements. Fico relied on such representations but they turned out to
                    be false as under the terms of the Head Lease the Premises cannot be used for
                    F&amp;B with cooking and eating-in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Fico states that it discovered the false
                    representations when THG’s solicitors sent a letter dated
                    17 September 2008 to Fico’s solicitors enclosing HDB’s letters
                    stating that the Premises could not be used for food operators with cooking and
                    eating-in and requiring Fico to make applications for “change of
                    use” for parts of the Premises which Fico had sub-let to fast food and
                    cooked food operators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Fico further complains that THG refused to
                    assist it in mitigating the loss that it had sustained by reason of the falsity
                    of the representations. By its letter of 10 October 2008, Fico sought to
                    have THG’s endorsement on the required plans/drawings before the same were
                    submitted to HDB in support of Fico’s application for a change of use. THG
                    had however failed or refused to endorse these plans/drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The second category of Fico’s complaints
                    relate to allegations of breach of contract. The terms of the Sub-Lease, it
                    says, clearly entitle Fico to sub-let parts of the Premises, to use the same for
                    any uses approved by the HDB and to a renewal of the Sub-Lease for a second term
                    of three years subject only to a change in rent. However, THG had acted in
                    breach of the Sub-Lease in refusing to endorse or in persistently delaying its
                    endorsement of various applications made by Fico. The details of this allegation
                    are as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">From 14 April 2008 to the end of the first
                            week of July 2008, Fico wanted to apply to HDB for authorisation to
                            sub-let certain parts of the Premises to Pizza Hut (S) Pte Ltd
                            (“Pizza Hut”), Shan Da Want Chicken Pte Ltd (“SDW
                            Chicken”), Yummy Yum Yum Pte Ltd (“Yummy PL”) and
                            Love Skateboarding Pte Ltd (“LSPL”). Fico repeatedly
                            requested THG to assist in the applications by endorsing on the plans
                            and related documents. In breach of clause 6(3) of the Sub-Lease
                            and/or clause 9 of the Settlement Agreement and/or an implied term
                            thereof to assist Fico to obtain the approval of the HDB on A&amp;A
                            works and sub-lettings, THG refused to make such
                        endorsements;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">THG had in breach of clause 6 of the
                            Sub-Lease refused to endorse and/or had unreasonably delayed in
                            endorsing Fico’s application for permission to erect an indoor
                            skateboard park even though the said clause 6 entitled Fico
                            “to use the Demised Premises for the purpose of
                            sports/games/recreational activities and/or other uses as approved by
                            the HDB”;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In June 2008 the Plaintiff and its solicitors had
                            tried to resolve the impasse by making the applications relating to
                            sub-letting and A&amp;A works directly to the HDB and informing THG by
                            sending them copies of their correspondence. On 8 and 24 July 2008, HDB
                            made clear its position that all Fico’s plans and related
                            documents on sub-letting and A&amp;A works had to be submitted through
                            THG for endorsement or the same would not be entertained by HDB. Despite
                            this clear requirement from HDB, THG continued to refuse to endorse
                            Fico’s documents;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">By its letter of 11 August 2008, HDB had
                            indicated it would consider renewing the Head Lease after receiving the
                            applications and documents necessary to regularise the unauthorised
                            A&amp;A works and unauthorised sub-letting in respect of the Premises.
                            By 29 August 2008, all the data and plans required for
                            regularisation had been handed by Fico to THG’s solicitors.
                            Instead of endorsing on and submitting these documents to the HDB, THG
                            sought on 28 August 2008 to unilaterally impose onerous new terms
                            on Fico. This was in breach of clause 4 read with clause 6(3)
                            of the Sub-Lease. It was also in breach of an implied term in the
                            Sub-Lease that THG would assist Fico to do what was reasonable to apply
                            for a change in use of the Premises; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To date, THG continues to be in breach of the
                            terms of the Sub-Lease and the Settlement Agreement as it had continued
                            to refuse to assist Fico by making the necessary endorsements on the
                            documents for change of use, approval of sub-letting and approval of the
                            A&amp;A works despite Fico’s repeated requests and even after Fico
                            had agreed to bear any increase in rent relating to a change in use if
                            such an increase was imposed by the HDB.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Fico also alleges that by reason of these
                    matters and of the fact that it continues to receive rents from Fico, THG was
                    and is in breach of clause 7(1) of the Sub-Lease which contains an implied
                    covenant preserving Fico’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, and thus is in
                    derogation of the rights which THG granted Fico under the Sub-Lease. THG is also
                    in breach of clause 4 of the Sub-Lease in so far as it had neglected and
                    failed to execute a second lease agreement in favour of Fico granting it a
                    further lease of three years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">THG’s side of the story</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     THG’s main complaint is that after the
                    conclusion of the Sub-Lease, Fico conducted itself (or its actions were so
                    conducted by Mr Lau) as if it had an unrestrained right to do exactly what
                    it pleased. In particular, Fico sub-let various parts of the Premises to tenants
                    without seeking HDB’s prior approval, refused to disclose the rent it was
                    receiving from such tenants and also attempted to mislead everyone as to the
                    protocol it claimed HDB had agreed to in the conduct of affairs in respect of
                    its tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In relation to the question of sub-letting,
                    THG maintains that Mr Lau and Fico knew that any sub-letting of the
                    Premises would be subject to HDB’s approval. Despite this Fico signed
                    written agreements with the following tenants to set up restaurants and a food
                    court without first seeking consent or informing anyone of the change of use the
                    Premises were being put to:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Pizza Hut (for a 36-month tenancy commencing on
                            15 December 2007);</div>

                            25 April 2008); and</div>

                            26 April 2008).</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The tenants were let into possession and started renovation and
                    construction works in respect of their respective units without notifying HDB or
                    THG. When the hearing started, Pizza Hut and SDW Chicken were in occupation and
                    operating out of their respective units while Yummy PL had halted its renovation
                    works and had not started operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 8 April 2008, HDB asked for details of
                    the rent that Fico was collecting from Pizza Hut. Fico did not furnish this
                    information despite being asked for the same repeatedly between 28 April
                    2008 and 5 August 2008. On 8 July 2008, HDB asked for information
                    regarding the rent that Fico would receive from LSPL. Fico then announced that
                    it would operate the skateboard park itself. THG alleges that Fico knew the
                    consequences of disclosing the rent it was receiving from its tenants and that
                    it wanted to avoid disclosing such information to either THG or HDB despite the
                    fact that such conduct would result in a serious breach of the Head
                    Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     THG complained that in order that Fico could
                    have a free hand in achieving its own agenda, Mr Lau would communicate
                    directly with HDB and leave THG out of the loop. To justify its approach, Fico
                    drew up a protocol on 29 May 2008 and sent it to HDB and THG. It claimed
                    this protocol had been discussed with HDB and was to be applied henceforth. The
                    protocol gave THG no role in Fico’s sub-lettings and use of the Premises.
                    On 1 July 2008, THG’s solicitors asked Fico to furnish them with
                    HDB’s confirmation that the protocol was applicable to the chain of
                    communication between the parties. No response was received from Fico but on
                    24 July 2008, HDB wrote to the parties and corrected the protocol given by
                    Fico. It was clear from this letter that HDB had never approved Fico’s
                    protocol. Instead, HDB required all applications and submissions - whether for
                    sub-letting or change of use - to be made through THG with the latter’s
                    consent and approval. The HDB also required the plans being submitted to have
                    been prepared by a qualified person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Other alleged instances of breaches on the
                    part of Fico which THG complained of were:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     THG also complains that the Head Lease was not
                    renewed due to breaches on the part of Fico. It relies on various correspondence
                    from HDB addressed to THG and copied to Fico including the following:</p>

                            that such works should not have been started without its

                            construction of a food court and since no approval had been granted for
                            such use, the operations of the food court could not be commenced;

                            Premises.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     THG avers that, in the circumstances, it saw a
                    need for clear provisions to be drawn up to spell out what Fico could and could
                    not do in the areas of sub-letting and change of use. It considered that there
                    were serious implications for THG as head lessee if the change of use requests
                    were met. This was because the rent for Plot 2 would probably be revised upwards
                    and additional terms might be added to the Head Lease which would adversely
                    affect THG’s interests. Therefore attempts were made to try and agree
                    terms for these matters. Fico, however, did not accept the terms proposed and
                    refused to agree to a proper and transparent procedure to deal with matters
                    which the Sub-Lease does not cover.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The parties have characterised the issues
                    somewhat differently. THG submits that the principal issues are as
                    follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Is THG obliged under the Sub-Lease to

                            Fico may seek in respect of the Premises?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Was there any misrepresentation by THG to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In Fico’s view, the issues to be decided
                    are:</p>

                                    the Premises for F&amp;B as well as for
                                    sports/games/recreational activities;</div>

                                    respect of use of the Premises by consenting to endorse on
                                    Fico’s plans and documents; and</div>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It can be seen that Fico’s list of
                    issues is comprehensive and covers the issues raised by THG. I will therefore
                    structure the analysis largely in accordance with the issues as posed by Fico. I
                    will start with the issue of misrepresentation and then go on to the issue of
                    the terms and alleged breach of the Sub-Lease before considering the remedies
                    available to the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     To succeed in its claim for misrepresentation,
                    Fico, citing <em>Eng Hui Cheh David v Opera Gallery Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2009] SGHC 121 at [97] asserted that it is
                    necessary for it to prove that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A representation of fact was made to it by THG
                            which was untrue;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It was induced to act on the representation;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It suffered a loss as a result.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I accept that these are the ingredients of actionable
                    misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The first matter to consider therefore is
                    whether the representation was made. In its submissions, Fico repeated its
                    pleaded position that THG “expressly and/or implicitly”
                    represented that the Premises could be used for F&amp;B operations that included
                    cooking and eating-in. From these representations, Fico understood that, subject
                    to any necessary technical clearances from authorities such as the National
                    Environment Agency, it would be able to carry out such operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Fico said that THG knew about the proposed
                    F&amp;B operations because at the outset Fico had communicated its intention to
                    carry out F&amp;B operations that would necessarily include “by virtue of
                    a common understanding of the term F&amp;B”, cooking and eating-in at the
                    Premises. Fico (or rather Mr Lau) had made it clear by certain emails sent
                    to THG in October 2005 that Fico intended to have F&amp;B at its premises. The
                    emails themselves did not mention the proposed F&amp;B outlets but attached to
                    them were several “Proposed Layout Plans” and each of these
                    depicted designated and distinct areas for F&amp;B use. Under cross examination
                    Joey Toh had acknowledged that she had seen the Proposed Layout Plans and was
                    aware that F&amp;B was clearly denoted in those plans. Fico pointed out that the
                    Proposed Layout Plans had shown more than one F&amp;B outlet, covering a gross
                    floor area of 720.98 square metres or approximately 7,700 square feet. Thus, THG
                    had to be aware that Fico intended to carry out extensive F&amp;B operations on
                    the premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Apart from the above, Fico said there had been
                    specific discussions on the F&amp;B issue. On or about 11 October 2005,
                    during negotiations prior to the signing of the Sub-Lease, Mr Lau had
                    discussed with THG and submitted to THG documents (referred to as the
                    “Marketing Kit”) showing Fico’s proposed business model for
                    the Premises. This included artist’s impressions of F&amp;B outlets like
                    McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Jumbo Seafood – outlets which
                    would obviously include cooking and eating-in at the Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Fico emphasised that during the said
                    discussion, Mr Toh had told Mr Lau in so many words that there would
                    be no problem in cooking and eating-in at the Premises. Mr Lau also stated
                    that Mr Toh had said that Fico could do anything as long as the HDB
                    approved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It was also Fico’s pleaded position that
                    it was clear from the inclusion of Clause 7(3) of the Sub-Lease that
                    Fico’s proposed F&amp;B operations were already within the contemplation
                    of the parties at the time of drafting and signing the Sub-Lease.
                    Clause 7(3) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7. The Tenant hereby covenants with the Sub Tenant as follows:-</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Fico submitted that if HDB had indeed
                    clarified, at the outset, that F&amp;B was to be limited to a single outlet
                    serving snacks and drinks, there would have been no reason to include
                    Clause 7(3). Further, the approved drawings showed F&amp;B in a few
                    different areas on the Premises and covered an enormous gross floor area of
                    720.98 square metres. That could only mean that the parties had come to an
                    understanding, based on THG’s representations, that Fico would be able to
                    operate F&amp;B facilities with cooking and eating-in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Fico’s final submission on this point
                    was that if THG had not intended for Clause 7(3) to operate in such a
                    manner, then the failure to remove Clause 7(3) was an implied
                    misrepresentation on the part of THG on the type or extent of F&amp;B facilities
                    that Fico could operate. This last submission, in my view, carries no weight
                    and, indeed, smacks of desperation. I cannot accept that THG’s agreement
                    to not provide F&amp;B facilities itself meant that it was representing to Fico
                    that Fico could have F&amp;B facilities which involved cooking and eating-in.
                    That would be stretching the wording of the covenant. In fact, all the arguments
                    on the existence and wording of Clause 7(3) are tenuous and I have no
                    hesitation in rejecting them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I now deal with the other points made in
                    relation to misrepresentation. First, I should say that Fico has not been able
                    to establish that the misrepresentation complained of was indeed made.
                    Mr Toh denied telling Mr Lau that there would be no problem with
                    cooking and eating-in on the Premises. I accept his denial in preference to
                    Mr Lau’s assertion that such a statement was made. Mr Lau was
                    not a very credible witness – he was glib and often evasive and when it
                    came to this allegation, I think that he made up the evidence. In this
                    connection, I also accept THG’s evidence that at the meeting with HDB on
                    or about 11 October 2005 Mr Lau brought up the issue of F&amp;B at the
                    Premises and was told very clearly by Mr Goh Choon Ngwen of HDB that only
                    drinks and snacks were allowed and cooking was not permitted on the
                    premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is important to remember that it was
                    Mr Lau who first approached THG and asked them to sub-let a portion of Plot
                    2 to Fico. It was clear from the evidence that from the very beginning
                    Mr Lau was keen to take a sub-lease for his proposed sporting activities
                    and that he did not have to be induced into anything. It was Mr Lau who
                    drew up the first version of the letter of intent. This had no mention of food
                    and beverage of any kind. Whilst this was amended several times, no reference to
                    food and beverage was inserted and the signed version was equally devoid of any
                    such reference. It is also material that in August 2005 when the HDB wanted to
                    know what the proposed use of the premises by Fico would be, Fiona Loy’s
                    reply to THG for onward transmission was “All kinds of sports except
                    those not approved by HDB”. If F&amp;B facilities had been such a vital
                    part of Fico’s plans, either Mr Lau or his wife would surely have
                    mentioned it in writing to HDB from the beginning. The alternative inference,
                    and one which is equally unhelpful to Fico, is that the plans for F&amp;B
                    facilities were deliberately suppressed as Mr Lau did not want to risk an
                    immediate rejection of the proposed Sub-Lease from HDB. After all, HDB had made
                    it plain in the Head Lease what the approved uses were. F&amp;B was not one of
                    these.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Further, the sequence of events contradicts
                    Fico’s case that in order to induce it to enter the Sub-Lease, Mr Toh
                    had represented to Mr Lau on 11 October 2005 that the Premises could
                    be used for cooking and dining-in. This is because by 19 August 2005
                    Mr Lau already knew that HDB had approved THG’s application to
                    sub-let four hectares to him at 18 cents per square metre to be used for tennis
                    and football. The parties had by then agreed on the principal terms of the
                    sub-tenancy and that is why HDB’s approval for the same had been sought by
                    THG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The complaint about misrepresentation was an
                    afterthought. In October 2008 when Fico was complaining to THG in respect of its
                    refusal to apply for change of use of the Premises so as to permit cooking and
                    dining-in, Fico wrote (on 15 October):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have shared with Mr Toh Thong Hup on our operations, needs and
                        requirements before LOI was signed and subsequently signing of the
                        lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Toh was aware and is supportive. He has also included our plans
                        into the Master Plan E3300-00004-2006 with him as the main applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been made known to Mr Toh that the 19 units at Blk 3 are
                        meant for subletting and the various uses have been communicated &amp;
                        provided for such as F&amp;B, Gym, and Retail...etc.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The change of use is meant to apply by you on our behalf to the authority.
                        Are you trying to misled (shed your responsibility) by applying for shop
                        when our intention was made known very clearly it is F&amp;B including
                        cooking?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It can be seen from this wording that Fico was
                    not complaining that Mr Toh had misled Mr Lau into believing that the
                    Premises could be used for cooking and dining-in. Instead the language of the
                    letter indicates that the party who had mentioned “cooking” (if it
                    was mentioned at all) was Mr Lau. It was Mr Lau who was doing the
                    talking and communicating with THG on Fico’s plans. The strongest
                    allegation that Fico made in this letter of 15 October 2008 was that
                    “Mr Toh was aware and is <em>(sic)</em>
                    supportive” of Fico’s plans. Being supportive of Fico’s plans
                    cannot be construed as making a misrepresentation, as Fico pleaded in the
                    Statement of Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Next, as THG reminded me in submissions,
                    counsel for Fico in Fico’s opening submissions at the trial had taken the
                    position that THG had made a misrepresentation to Fico by keeping silent on what
                    could be done at the Premises and this silence had deceived Fico into believing
                    that it could set up F&amp;B outlets with cooking and dining-in at the Premises.
                    This was a departure from Fico’s pleaded case because in para 12(a)
                    of the Statement of Claim, Fico averred that THG’s misrepresentation had
                    arisen from a conversation between Mr Lau and Mr Toh where Mr Toh
                    had said that the Premises “could be used for food and beverage with
                    cooking and eating-in at the premises”. During cross-examination
                    Mr Lau had denied that THG’s alleged misrepresentation was by
                    silence. He was then asked to identify the misrepresentation that THG had made.
                    After much evasive rambling, Mr Lau answered that he was relying on
                    Mr Toh’s promise to him that “[he(Mr Lau)] could do
                    anything as long as HDB approves” for Fico’s case of
                    misrepresentation. This, as Mr Lau agreed in court, is not to be found
                    anywhere in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Fico, therefore, twice changed its story about
                    the alleged misrepresentation. The final version put forward by Mr Lau was
                    that the alleged misrepresentation on THG’s part was Mr Toh’s
                    statement that Mr Lau could do anything as long as HDB approved. THG
                    submitted, and I agree, that this statement could not be a misrepresentation as
                    it was the truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In addition to relying on an alleged express
                    assurance from Mr Toh, as I have indicated above, Fico also relied on the
                    fact that its Proposed Layout Plans contained clear statements that certain
                    units in its premises were for “F&amp;B”. The way in which this
                    was pleaded was not quite proper, in my view. What Fico said in para 12 of
                    its Statement of Claim was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During their negotiations, in order to induce the Plaintiffs to enter into
                        the Lease dated 6<sup>th</sup> February 2006, the Defendants
                        made the following representations to the Plaintiffs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">in a document entitled “Proposed Layout
                            Plan” dated October 2005 sent to the HDB with a cover letter
                            dated 16 November 2005, and copied to the Plaintiffs, the premises
                            to be sub-let to the Plaintiffs could be used for food and beverage (or
                            “F&amp;B”);</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">in a document entitled “Proposed Layout
                            Plan” dated December 2005 given to the Plaintiffs, the premises
                            to be sub-let to the Plaintiffs could be used for food and beverage
                            ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">This implied that it was THG who prepared the Proposed Layout Plan
                    and sent the same to Fico. As Fico knew, that implication was not true because
                    from the beginning it had been Fico (or, more precisely, HSK on Fico’s
                    instructions) who prepared the Proposed Layout Plan and wrote the word F&amp;B
                    thereon and sent them to THG for submission to HDB. HSK was directly appointed
                    by Fico and instructed to prepare the various drawings and submissions required
                    in respect of the uses of the structures to be erected at the Premises. It was
                    HSK who designated some units in Block 3 as “Shop (F&amp;B)”.
                    There was, however, no description indicating a restaurant or a food court in
                    any of the drawings prepared by HSK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Fico did not call anyone from HSK to explain
                    the drawings the latter had produced. THG, however, adduced evidence from
                    Mr Foo Koong Kit Richard, a registered and practicing architect. His
                    testimony was that HSK’s submission for Fico was a simple layout
                    submission without details. For example, there were no details of any kitchen or
                    stove with open fire depicted for the shop (F&amp;B) units. Mr Foo stated
                    that such a simple layout submission would have been for approval of units
                    selling snacks and light meals only. He also stated there were different classes
                    of establishments under the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s
                    (“URA”) classifications regarding food establishments. Some
                    establishments could only retail and serve food for consumption elsewhere that
                    did not require cooking and preparation on site. Such retail of snacks and light
                    meals fell under Class I being “shop” use. Another class
                    (i.e. restaurant) envisaged the cooking and preparation of food for consumption
                    on site. If the intended use of the “shop” was as a
                    “restaurant” falling under Class III of URA’s
                    classification, approval for such use had to be obtained from URA. I accept this
                    testimony from Mr Foo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I also accept the evidence of THG that neither
                    it nor its representatives played any part in giving instructions to HSK
                    regarding the structures that Fico wanted to erect on the Premises or concerning
                    the uses it wished to put such structures to. In cross-examination Mr Lau
                    claimed that he had told HSK specifically that he wanted to use the Premises for
                    restaurants and fast food. He accepted that the approved drawings which depicted
                    the shop units at Block 3 were based on the instructions which he had given
                    to HSK. THG argued that if Mr Lau had specifically instructed HSK that some
                    units were to be used as restaurants and fast food outlets, HSK would not have
                    depicted these in Block 3 as “Shop (F&amp;B)” when the word
                    “shop” denoted a class of use which fell under Class I of
                    URA’s classification. THG further submitted that HSK, as professional
                    engineers, would have known what they were doing. Consequently, their
                    description of the units and shops must have accorded with Fico’s actual
                    instructions that the units were to be used for uses falling within
                    Class I. I agree because HSK would have known that only Class 3
                    outlets could be used as restaurants. It is significant that Fico did not adduce
                    evidence from HSK as to why it had depicted the units in that way when Fico
                    ostensibly wanted to use them as restaurants and fast food outlets. It is also
                    significant that Fico does not appear to have made any complaint to HSK in
                    respect of the way in which the drawings were produced if indeed it instructed
                    HSK that the units were to be used for restaurants and fast food outlets. Fico
                    is now well aware that a Class I shop will not enable it to operate such
                    businesses. If HSK gave Mr Lau the impression that Fico would be able to do
                    so and the drawings were sufficient to obtain approval for the same, then Fico
                    would have grounds for complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I have come to the conclusion, on a balance of
                    probabilities, that no instructions were given to HSK that the Premises were
                    going to be used for cooking and eating-in. Mr Lau was aware at all
                    material times that as far as food was concerned he could only serve snacks,
                    light meals and drinks. This is what he was told by HDB at the meeting in
                    October 2005. HDB was consistent on this point. In December 2007, it informed
                    Fico that the proposed Members’ Lounge could only serve light meals which
                    did not involve cooking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As the head tenant in respect of Plot 2, THG
                    had the responsibility of endorsing and submitting all plans for structures to
                    be built on the Premises. I accept its evidence that it simply incorporated
                    Fico’s plans without any change. Since the plans emanated from Fico and
                    there was no input on the same from THG, I find difficulty in seeing how
                    THG’s conduct in relation to the acceptance and submission of the plans
                    constituted any representation as to the use of the premises for cooking and
                    eating-in. In any event, the plans proposed an F&amp;B usage that fell within
                    “Shop (F&amp;B)” which was a Class 1 usage and did not
                    propose a Class 3 unit so it is impossible to construe any such
                    representation from the plans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For the reasons given above, in my judgment,
                    Fico has no claim for damages for misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Alleged breach of the Sub-Lease by THG</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interpretation of the contracts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     This part of the judgment deals with the
                    issues referred to in [31(a)] and [32(a)] above. My first task is to decide what
                    the true meaning of Cl 6(3) of the Sub-Lease is.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Clause 6(3) of the Sub-Lease is a
                    covenant. By it, Fico covenants with THG:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To use the Demised Premise for the purpose of sports/games/recreational
                        activities <em>and or other uses as approved by the
                            HDB</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As Fico points out, this clause contains two parts. The first
                    part is the description of the explicitly approved uses, <em>i.e</em>. “sports/games/recreational activities”; the
                    second refers to other uses as approved by the HDB”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Fico’s interpretation is that a common
                    sense reading of the covenant would lead to the view that it was already in the
                    contemplation of both parties that Fico would primarily use the Premises for
                    sports, games and recreational activities. However, other uses, as maybe
                    approved by the HDB in the future, were also within their reasonable
                    contemplation. Fico pointed out that while Joey Toh took the position that the
                    phrase “and or other uses by HDB” was strictly a reference to the
                    four uses enumerated in Cl 4.1.1 of the Head Lease, Mr Toh had agreed
                    that other uses outside of sports/games/recreational activities could be
                    included under Cl 6.3. Mr Toh further agreed that Fico was not
                    precluded from putting the Premises to other uses including retail shops and
                    F&amp;B outlets restricted to snacks and light meals provided that such uses had
                    received HDB’s approval. He stated that if HDB was able to accept the sale
                    of snacks and light meals, he would also be able to accept this use. Fico
                    further submitted that the fact that other uses outside those stated in
                    Cl 4.1.1 of the Head Lease were contemplated by it and THG is supported by
                    the presence of Cl 7(3) of the Sub-Lease which prevents THG from
                    constructing or allowing any third party to construct any F&amp;B
                    facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Fico submitted that in these circumstances the
                    approval of HDB would operate progressively - <em>i.e</em>.
                    it was open to Fico to seek HDB’s approval for the relevant uses as and
                    when the need for the same arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In its argument on interpretation, Fico took
                    pains to rebut THG’s allegation that Mr Lau had had a copy of the
                    Head Lease from the beginning and was familiar with its terms when he drafted
                    the letter of intent and Sub-Lease. Joey Toh had given evidence to the effect
                    that it was Mr Lau who had pointed out to her that Cl 6.1 in the Head
                    Lease was inconsistent with the parties’ intention that THG would have a
                    secure term of three years from the start of the Head Lease. He advised her to
                    have this clause deleted and Joey Toh then approached HDB and verbally
                    arranged for the clause to be struck out. She and her father had attended
                    at the HDB thereafter to initial against the deletion. Fico submitted that there
                    was not a scrap of evidence other than THG’s say-so that this episode ever
                    took place. It was illogical, if not impossible, to be able to arbitrarily amend
                    a government contract without formal correspondence. The alleged amendment was
                    not dated and there was no evidence to prove that the deletion took place at the
                    suggestion of Mr Lau. On the contrary, the Defendant’s letter of
                    4 August 2008 to HDB indicated that the request for the deletion of
                    Cl 6.1 had been made at the time of tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It is well established that the task of the
                    court in interpreting a contractual document is to give effect to the
                    parties’ intentions objectively “in the face of conflicting
                    subjective interpretations advanced by ingenious counsel”: <em>per</em> V K Rajah JA in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp;
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR 1029, at
                        [1](“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”). The
                    same case also confirmed that extrinsic evidence of the external context of the
                    contract can be used to assist interpretation as long as such evidence is
                    relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties and relates to a
                    clear or obvious context. However, the principle of objectively ascertaining
                    contractual intention remains paramount. In this exercise, the court must have
                    regard to, <em>inter alia</em>, the plain or ordinary
                    meaning of the words the parties used. The extrinsic evidence that is admissible
                    includes prior negotiations and subsequent conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The first thing that the court has to do
                    according to <em>Zurich Insurance</em> is to take into
                    account the essence and attributes of the document being examined. In this case,
                    the document to be interpreted is a tenancy agreement which is a formal contract
                    involving land and which normally contains the demise of the land concerned and
                    the conditions on which the tenant is to hold it as well as the matters to be
                    observed by the landlord. In this connection, I have to bear in mind that
                    Cl 6.3 is a tenant’s covenant. In form, therefore, it expresses an
                    obligation to be observed by the tenant alone; it does not impose any obligation
                    on the landlord. It is also apparent from the wording of Cl 6.3 that the
                    obligation concerns a third party, HDB, and is not an obligation that can be
                    waived by the landlord acting on its own. The clause also has to be looked
                    at in the context of a sub-tenancy which is carved out from a Head Tenancy. It
                    is apparent from Cll 4 and 5 of the Sub-Lease that HDB has a part to play in
                    relation to the Sub-Lease since the Sub-Lease is subject to its approval (Cl 5)
                    and any option to extend the Sub-Lease under Cl 4 depends on an extension
                    of the Head Lease granted to THG by HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The question here is as to the true meaning of
                    the words “and other uses as approved by the HDB”. Whilst
                    Fico’s position as stated above is that these words refer to uses that may
                    be approved by HDB from time to time, THG’s interpretation is that they
                    refer to the uses that had already been approved by HDB at the time of signing
                    of the Sub-Lease, <em>i.e</em>. those uses enumerated in
                    Cl 4.1.1 of the Head Lease which I have set out in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     THG pointed out that long before the Sub-Lease
                    was signed, Fico was aware that HDB’s prior approval was required for the
                    way in which the Premises were to be used. This was shown by the correspondence
                    in August 2005 when it had told Fiona Loy that HDB wanted to know the proposed
                    uses of the Premises and she had replied that they would be used for “all
                    kinds of sports except those not approved by HDB”. This answer had been
                    passed on to HDB. HDB’s subsequent approval of use as “football
                    field and tennis court only” given by way of letter dated 19 August
                    2005 had been forwarded to Fiona Loy. The correspondence also showed that
                    although sport was one of the approved uses, not all kinds of sport would be
                    permitted. Consequently, when Mr Lau drafted the Sub-Lease and used the
                    phrase “other uses as approved by HDB”, he meant those uses and
                    sports that had already received HDB’s approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     THG also stressed that the word
                    “approved” used in Cl 6(3) is in the past tense. It is not
                    qualified or modified by any other words to suggest that the approval may be of
                    matters to come in, which, for example would be indicated by the phrase
                    “as approved <em>from time to time</em> by the
                    HDB” or the phrase “as <em>may be</em>
                    approved by the HDB” or, even more clearly, the phrase “as
                        <em>shall be</em> approved by the HDB”. In
                    contrast Cl 6(4) states “... installation expense from sub station
                    to our plot <b>will be</b> shared equally ...”.
                    THG submitted that the use here of the future tense made it clear that the
                    clause refers to a payment to be made in the future. Mr Lau had
                    admitted that he produced the Sub-Lease using a template and he also admitted
                    that Cll 6(3) and 7(3) were what he wanted. The <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> rule should apply against Fico if there was any
                    ambiguity as to whether Cl 6(3) was meant to operate
                progressively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Looking at the language of Cl 6(3) and
                    having regard to the context, I am satisfied that its meaning is that the tenant
                    has covenanted to use the demised premises for such sports, such recreation
                    activities, such games and such other uses as had been “approved by the
                    HDB” either at the time of entry into the Sub-Lease or at any time
                    thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     There are two parts to that interpretation. In
                    relation to the first part of the interpretation, <em>i.e</em>. that the phrase “approved by the HDB” applies
                    not only to the words “other uses” but also to the words
                    “sports”, “recreation activities” and
                    “games”, this is not only a natural reading of the words but is
                    also supported by the context which both parties were aware of. This context was
                    that HDB was not going to approve of all kinds of sports as Fico well knew (as
                    shown by the way in which HDB gave its consent to Fico’s proposed use of
                    the Premises and the statement in the letter of intent that the usage of land
                    was for a football field and tennis only, with other sports facilities subject
                    to approval by HDB) and similarly, that HDB was not obliged to approve all kinds
                    of recreational activities and games. In this connection, the Head Lease
                    referred to four permitted uses, only two of which related to anything that Fico
                    might want to do. Mr Lau was aware of the terms of the Head Lease at the
                    time he drafted the Sub-Lease. I accept Joey Toh’s evidence that she gave
                    him a copy of the Head Lease at the very beginning. Her oral evidence was
                    supported by the fact that the copy of this document that Fico produce in court
                    was the original unamended document which contained Cl 6.1.1 in full
                    without the lines which subsequently deleted it. With that knowledge,
                    Mr Lau was careful, therefore, when drafting the Sub-Lease to indicate that
                    any uses of the Premises would be in accordance with HDB’s
                    approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As for the second part of the interpretation:
                    whilst the word “approved” may in itself be in the past tense,
                    when used in the phrase “as approved by HDB” it does not, in my
                    opinion, limit the approval to one that had already been issued before the
                    conclusion of the Sub-Lease. Instead, it is also capable of referring to
                    approvals that might be given by HDB thereafter. The phrase is capable of being
                    interpreted, without straining the language, as referring to approvals that were
                    current at the time, <em>i.e</em>. both those that had been
                    issued prior to the execution of the Sub-Lease and those that might have been
                    given later. Mr Toh of THG was quite frank in his evidence when he said
                    that it was HDB’s approval that mattered and generally THG would not have
                    an objection if such approval was given. The interpretation I have given the
                    clause is not inconsistent with THG’s attitude and it is probable
                    that if THG had been asked to consider the meaning of the clause before all
                    the disputes with Fico arose, it would have accepted quite easily that the
                    clause encompasses approvals given after execution of the
                document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Although I agree with Fico that its covenant
                    allows it to use its premises for such uses that had been approved by HDB before
                    or after the conclusion of the Sub-Lease, this is not the end of the matter. To
                    succeed, Fico has to show further that as and when it wanted to implement a new
                    use which had not already been approved THG was obliged to assist it in
                    obtaining such approval. I have already said that Cl 6(3), as a
                    tenant’s covenant imposes an obligation only on Fico itself. It does not
                    impose any obligation on THG (the landlord). Fico resisted such a conclusion: it
                    argued that a correlative landlord’s obligation may be implied from a
                    tenant’s covenant. I turn to consider this argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Can any obligation on THG be implied from Fico’s
                covenant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Fico relied on various authorities to support
                    the proposition that a correlative obligation that operates on one party can be
                    implied from a given term in a contract, notwithstanding the fact that the term
                    purports to bind the other party instead. Fico’s submissions were not,
                    however, directed only to showing the existence of a correlative obligation.
                    Fico also sought to imply a term in the Sub-Lease, on the basis of the usual
                    principles applied in the implication of contractual terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It first cited <em>The
                        Interpretation of Contracts</em> by Sir Kim Lewison (London Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2007) (<em>“Lewison”</em>), which states at p 222 that where a
                    contract imposes an express obligation on one party to the contract but is
                    silent as to the obligations of the other party the court may, in appropriate
                    circumstances, imply an obligation on that other party correlative to the
                    express obligation. <em>Lewison</em> emphasises that before
                    such an implication is made, the test of necessity must be satisfied. He cites
                    the following dictum of Cockburn C.J. in <em>Churchward v
                        R</em>. (1865) LR 1 QB 173 which Fico also relies on:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I entirely concur that although a contract may appear on the face
                        of it to bind and be obligatory on one party, yet there are occasions on
                        which you must imply-although the contract may be silent –
                        corresponding and correlative obligations on the part of the other party in
                        whose favour alone the contract may appear to be drawn up. <em>Where the act done by the party binding himself can only be
                            done upon something of a corresponding character being done by the
                            opposite party</em>, you would there imply a corresponding
                        obligation to do the things necessary for the completion of the
                        contract.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Fico cited some examples of cases involving
                    landlords and tenants where this principle had been applied. In <em>Barnes v City of London Real Property Co</em> [1918]
                    2 Ch 18 (“<em>Barnes</em>”), a
                    reservation of rent for the provision of a housekeeper to clean the demised
                    premises was held to have given rise to a correlative obligation on the part of
                    the landlord to provide a housekeeper to clean the property. In <em>Edmonton Corp. v WM Knowles &amp; Son</em> (1961)
                    60 L.G.R. 124 <em>(“Edmonton”)</em>, it was held that the presence in a lease
                    of a covenant on the part of the tenant to pay the cost of periodical repairs of
                    the premises gave rise to an implied licence on the part of the landlord to
                    enter the premises for the purpose of painting even though a right of entry for
                    the landlord had not been reserved. The tenant was not entitled to claim damages
                    for trespass on the part of the landlord’s employee who had carried out
                    the painting. And, in <em>Barrett v Lounova (1982) Ltd</em>
                    [1990] 1 QB 348 (<em>“Barrett”</em>). The tenant had covenanted to do all
                    internal repairs needed in respect of the demised premises. The tenancy
                    agreement was silent about external and structural repairs. The premises fell
                    into serious disrepair and the tenant sued the landlord claiming the landlord
                    was in breach of an implied covenant to carry out external and structural
                    repairs. The action was successful and on the landlord’s appeal, it was
                    held that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There was no rule of law against the implication
                            in a lease of a repairing covenant against the landlord if the terms of
                            the agreement and the circumstances justify it, and the ordinary
                            principles of contractual construction concerning implication of terms

<p class="Judg-1">I note that <em>Barrett</em> has been criticised
                    by <em>Lewison</em> who considers the reasoning manifestly
                    unsound particularly when it is compared to the obligation implied in <em>Liverpool City Council v. Irwin</em> [1977] AC 239
                    to take reasonable care and which was not an absolute obligation. <em>Barrett</em> was distinguished in subsequent cases and in one
                    was said to be confined to its own special facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It is worth emphasising that a term cannot be
                    implied into any contract, including a tenancy agreement, unless it is essential
                    for the proper working of that contract that the term should exist. The cases
                    indicate, equally, that necessity is the touchstone for implying a correlative
                    obligation and <em>Barrett</em> emphasises that the usual
                    test as to whether a term should be implied – namely, the
                    “officious bystander” or “business efficacy” test -
                    must also be considered so that one must be able to say with reasonable
                    confidence that had the term sought to be implied been suggested to the parties
                    during negotiations, they would both have accepted it as being
                obvious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Fico also argued that a correlative obligation
                    has been imposed on THG by the terms of Cl 7(3) as well. The relevance of
                    Cl 7(3) is that it prohibits THG from constructing or allowing any third
                    party to construct F&amp;B facilities. Fico argues that by covenanting to
                    refrain from competing with any F&amp;B operations carried out by it, THG put
                    itself under a corresponding obligation to facilitate Fico’s applications
                    to HDB in respect of F&amp;B uses of the Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On the issue of necessity, Fico relied on the
                    evidence that HDB would not receive any applications in respect of the Premises
                    from Fico but would deal only with THG as the lessee under the Head Lease. In
                    this situation, Fico submitted, it was impossible for Fico to seek HDB’s
                    approval as it had covenanted to do in Cl 6(3) unless THG facilitated the
                    process by endorsing Fico’s plans and forwarding them to HDB. Fico argued
                    that in order for the Sub-Lease and Cl 6(3) in particular to be workable,
                    it was necessary for the court to find that there was an implied obligation on
                    THG to endorse Fico’s documents for HDB’s approval - regardless of
                    whether such documents were for sub-letting, change of use or for the erection
                    of an entirely new structure such as, for example, an indoor skateboard park.
                    Fico’s submissions on this point concluded (at [52] of Fico’s
                    Closing Submissions) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Fico] submits that [THG] was under an implied obligation to assist [Fico]
                        by consenting to endorse on [Fico’s] Plans and documents, such consent
                        not to be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Before I discuss the submissions above, I
                    should point out that Fico’s pleaded case as stated in para 29 of the
                    Statement of Claim, was that the implied term to be introduced into the tenancy
                    agreement was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[A]n implied term that [THG] shall do what is reasonably necessary
                        to assist [Fico] to apply to HDB for approval on matters relating to
                        sub-letting, and or applications for change of use or
                        “A&amp;A” works...”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was an unqualified term and would impose an obligation on THG to
                    assist by taking reasonable steps which would include, of course, endorsing its
                    consent on Fico’s applications if such was required by HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In its closing submissions, however, Fico did
                    not refer to the pleaded term and instead, as is shown by the quotation in
                        <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above, put forward a slightly
                    different proposition. It has not formulated the precise wording of the implied
                    term it is advocating. Rather, Fico has paraphrased what it submits THG ought to
                    do under the Sub-Lease if such an implied term is introduced by the court.
                    However, if such a term is formulated in accordance with the submissions, it is
                    at once apparent that the term cannot reflect necessity. It would appear that
                    Fico considers that the term should read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The Tenant [<em>i.e</em>. THG] shall assist
                        the Sub-Tenant [<em>i.e</em>. Fico] by consenting to
                        endorse on the Sub-Tenant’s plans and documents, and shall not
                        unreasonably withhold such consent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Such a term contains self-contradictory elements: on the one hand THG
                    is said to be under an obligation to assist by consenting to endorse
                    Fico’s plans; yet on the other hand, the term contemplates that THG may
                    have reasons to refuse to make such endorsement. In recognising that there may
                    be justifiable reasons to withhold consent, Fico is also recognising that it
                    cannot be an absolute necessity that all its plans and applications have to be
                    approved. Fico has therefore watered down the term which it seeks to have
                    implied. The most probable reason for this change in its position is its
                    realisation that it cannot impose an absolute obligation on THG to support
                    whatever it wants to do on the Premises without regard for the possible
                    consequences to THG itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     THG pointed out that Fico’s need, after
                    the conclusion of the trial, to restate the supposed implied term demonstrated
                    that it was not able to give a clear expression to the implied term that it
                    wanted the court to read into the Sub-Lease. It is established law that a term
                    to be implied must be capable of clear expression so that one can assess whether
                    such term is required to give the contract business efficacy. If the required
                    term cannot be clearly expressed then, said THG, it is obviously not needed to
                    give business efficacy to the Sub-Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     THG also stressed that Fico had not originally
                    pleaded the implied term referred to in the closing submissions and this
                    proposed term differed from the pleaded term in that it included the requirement
                    of consent not being unreasonably withheld. This element of the implied term had
                    not been brought up during cross examination of THG’s witnesses. It was
                    not put to them that Fico’s case was that THG needed their consent to the
                    endorsement of the “Plans and documents” but that such consent was
                    not to be unreasonably withheld or had been unreasonably withheld. It was
                    therefore not apparent during the trial that Fico had changed its position on
                    the content of the alleged implied term. In all these circumstances, THG
                    submitted, Fico was not entitled to rely in its closing submissions on this
                    completely new formulation of the implied term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In my judgment, there is considerable merit in
                    the points raised by THG. Parties are bound by their pleadings and cannot take
                    the opposite party by surprise. For this reason, as well that of necessity which
                    I mentioned earlier, I hold that a term cannot be implied into the contract to
                    the effect that THG must endorse Fico’s applications on the basis that its
                    consent to do so may not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I should also consider whether quite apart
                    from the phraseology suggested by Fico, there should be implied a correlative
                    obligation on THG to support all Fico’s applications for approval of its
                    intended uses of the Premises. As mentioned earlier, the basis of the principle
                    of “correlative obligations” is that the court finds that it is
                    essential to interpret a particular contract as imposing reciprocal or mutual
                    obligations on the part of the parties to each other although the contract
                    itself only mentions an obligation of one party to the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Fico had placed particular emphasis on
                        <em>Edmonton</em> because that case involved a
                    correlative obligation being placed on a landlord as a consequence of a
                    tenant’s covenant. The covenant in that case was that the tenant would
                    “pay to the [landlord] the cost... of painting with two coats at least of
                    good oil paint in workmanlike manner every third year of the term all the
                    outside wood and metal work and other external parts of the demised premises and
                    any addition thereto heretofore or usually painted”. The court held that
                    since the tenant had covenanted to pay for the painting the landlord had an
                    obligation to do the painting and the tenant could not complain of trespass when
                    the landlord carried out his obligation. McNair J explained his decision,
                    at 127 - 128 in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that one cannot find in that [<em>i.e</em>. the tenant company’s covenant] an express obligation
                        assumed by the corporation that they would carry out that painting. On the
                        other hand, there is an express obligation by the company to pay the
                        corporation the cost of the painting. <em>Unless that
                            obligation is to be entirely emasculated or given no effect at
                            all</em>, it seems to me that at least one must imply into that
                        covenant a right to the corporation to do the painting. And, if one implies
                        a right to them to do the painting, one also necessarily implies a licence
                        to go into the premises to do it. I think there must be certainly a right
                        given to the corporation. But I go further, and I say that I think that, on
                        the proper construction of this clause, there is an obligation on the
                        corporation. (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The passage quoted shows that the basis of the correlative obligation
                    imposed on the landlord was to give effect to the obligation of the tenant to
                    pay for the cost of painting. The court was influenced by the need to give
                    contractual promises a meaning instead of nullifying or ignoring
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As THG submitted, the facts of the present
                    case are different and do not give rise to a correlative obligation. Both in
                        <em>Edmonton</em> and in <em>Barnes</em>, the relevant tenancy agreement imposed an obligation on
                    the tenant. In this case, whilst it is true that Cl 6(3) imposes an
                    obligation on Fico to use the premises only for approved uses, THG had already
                    obtained approval for the uses that Fico itself had submitted by the time the
                    Sub-Lease was executed; there was no obligation on Fico to seek approval for any
                    other or additional uses. Under the covenant, Fico is obliged to use the
                    Premises only for uses approved by HDB: it has no obligation to ask HDB to
                    approve further uses. It may wish to ask HDB to approve a further use so that if
                    it puts the Premises to such additional use it will not be in breach of the
                    covenant but there is nothing in the Sub-Lease which compels it to add another
                    use. The Sub-Lease was operable and effective on its terms as they stood and
                    business efficacy did not require the inclusion of a term compelling THG to
                    consent to what would be an additional use or a change of use. Further, if Fico
                    is not compelled to use the Premises for anything other than uses which HDB had
                    already approved as at the date of execution of the Sub-Lease, there can be no
                    correlative obligation on THG’s part to assist Fico in its voluntary
                    application for an additional use. Going back to the language of necessity,
                    there is no necessity for such a correlative obligation to be implied to enable
                    Fico to comply with its obligation to use the Premises only for approved uses.
                    In the absence of such a necessity, a correlative obligation cannot
                    arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Similarly, and even more strongly, it is hard
                    to comprehend how a correlative obligation could, objectively, be said to arise
                    from THG’s covenant in Cl 7(3) that it would not, and it would not
                    permit a third party to, construct food and beverage facilities on Plot 2. If it
                    is THG’s obligation not to carry out or permit such construction, what
                    correlative obligation can be imposed on Fico? THG only has to refrain from
                    doing something; its obligation is entirely negative. Any correlative obligation
                    imposed on Fico as the other party would then have to be positive. But Fico has
                    not argued that it is obliged under the Sub-Lease to construct food and beverage
                    facilities. Its case is that THG is obliged to help it construct such facilities
                    by assisting its applications to HDB for approval. In my judgment Cl 7(3)
                    is of no assistance to Fico on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I agree with THG that there is no correlation
                    between what Fico undertook, <em>i.e</em>. to use the
                    Premises for approved uses only, and an obligation on the part of THG to consent
                    to endorsing Fico’s applications for change of use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I observe that when it came to the crunch,
                    even Fico was not prepared to argue in favour of an unqualified obligation
                    imposed on THG to consent to Fico’s plans. It recognised that any such
                    obligation had to be qualified by the words “such consent not to be
                    unreasonably withheld”. This must have been because Fico realised that
                    any change of use of the Premises could have a direct impact on THG as Head
                    Lessee. One such possible consequence could be an increase in the rental for
                    Plot 2. In a letter dated 9 October 2008, HDB had pointed out that rental for
                    the renewed term would be revised “based on the existing uses and market
                    rate to be valued by SLA’s valuer”. Premises used as restaurants
                    and food courts are usually subject to high rentals. Although Cl 4 of the
                    Sub-Lease envisages a change in rental on renewal, there is no provision for
                    increase of rental on change of use. Further, any application for a change of
                    use may result in the introduction of new and stringent conditions to be
                    observed by THG and Fico. There is nothing in the Sub-Lease to deal with a
                    situation where such new conditions are imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I conclude, therefore, that no obligation on
                    the part of THG can be implied into the Sub-Lease in the terms submitted by
                    Fico. If there is no obligation to endorse Fico’s applications, there can
                    be no breach of such obligation. I therefore do not have to make a finding on
                    whether THG was unreasonable in its withholding of consent. Without going into
                    detail, I would observe, however, that on the evidence my general view is that
                    THG was not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Having come to the conclusion that THG is not
                    in breach of the Sub-Lease, I do not have to deal with the various issues
                    regarding what would be the proper remedy for such a breach. I can therefore
                    turn my attention to THG’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is THG entitled to recover possession of the Premises?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     To reiterate, the term of the Sub-Lease was a
                    period of “three + three + three years” and the parties accepted
                    that this meant three terms of three years each and that at the expiry of each
                    period of three years the tenancy ended unless renewed. Clause 4 of the
                    Sub-Lease provides that upon the completion of the term, the tenant has the
                    option of extending the lease in accordance with the period granted to the
                    landlord by HDB. It therefore recognises that extension of the Sub-Lease is
                    dependent on extension of the Head Lease. In point of fact, the Head Lease
                    expired on 31 July 2008 and was not renewed for any period thereafter. HDB
                    told THG in no uncertain terms that it would not be extending the Head Lease
                    after that date. Since HDB did not extend the Head Lease, the Sub-Lease was also
                    not extended. Thereafter, both THG and Fico would have been holding over on a
                    periodic tenancy, most likely a monthly tenancy since the rental was paid on a
                    monthly basis. A periodic tenancy can be terminated by notice to quit of the
                    appropriate length. On 25 March 2009, HDB gave THG one month’s notice
                    to quit and, on 26 March 2009, THG gave a similar notice to quit to Fico.
                    It is my opinion (albeit in the absence of argument) that that notice ended
                    Fico’s tenancy and Fico was obliged to surrender the Premises to THG on
                    the expiry of the notice to quit. It has not done so yet. Equally, THG’s
                    Head Lease has been ended by the Notice to Quit served on it by HDB and it is no
                    longer entitled to remain in possession of any part of Plot 2. THG, however,
                    does not in this action rely on the notice to quit <em>simpliciter</em> in order to recover possession. Instead it regards
                    its notice to quit as an acceptance of Fico’s repudiation of the
                    tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     
          <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em> Vol 14(2) (LexisNexis, 2009 Reissue, 2009)
                        (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) states at
                    [170.0961] that a lease may be determined only in one of certain recognised
                    ways. Of the nine ways listed in that paragraph, the ones relevant to this case
                    are: notice to quit; forfeiture; and frustration, repudiation and acceptance.
                        <em>Halsbury’s</em> further confirms that the
                    contractual doctrine of repudiation and acceptance applies to leases: at
                    [170.0962].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     One basis for the counterclaim is that
                    Fico’s conduct constituted a serious breach of the Sub-Lease and
                    demonstrated its intention to not comply with the terms thereof but repudiate
                    the Sub-Lease instead. THG pleaded that this repudiation had been accepted by
                    its and its solicitors’ letters giving notice to quit - both of which were
                    dated 26 March 2009. As for forfeiture, the other main ground of the
                    counterclaim is that Fico’s breach of certain implied terms entitled THG
                    to forfeit the lease and re-enter the Premises. The main implied terms relied on
                    are that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Fico would not directly or indirectly by action
                            or omission breach the terms of the Sub-Lease or put at risk the renewal
                            of the term under the Head Lease; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that Fico would not use or suffer any part of the
                            Premises to be used for any purpose other than an approved
                        use.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">THG did plead other implied terms but as it did not press these in
                    submission, I will not deal with them here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     
          <em>Halsbury’s</em>
                    deals with the law on forfeiture and the right of re-entry at some length. To
                    paraphrase [170.0963] and [170.0966], a lease may contain an express proviso for
                    re-entry or forfeiture by the landlord on specified events, such as non-payment
                    of rent or non-observance by the tenant of the covenants of the lease. Where the
                    cause of forfeiture is complete, the landlord may bring an action to recover
                    possession and the bringing of the action is equivalent to actual entry. If the
                    writ contains a demand for possession, service of it operates as a final
                    election to determine the term. In this case, the Sub-Lease did not contain any
                    express proviso for re-entry or forfeiture. However, such a right may also be
                    implied. Para [170.0965] of <em>Halsbury’s</em>
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is implied in every lease a condition that the tenant is not to do
                        anything that may prejudice the landlord’s title, and that, if this is
                        done, the landlord may re-enter for breach of this implied condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Before I consider the issue of forfeiture
                    further, I think it is worth reproducing two letters that HDB wrote to THG. The
                    first is dated 31 July 2008 and deals with the renewal of the Head Lease whilst
                    the second is HDB’s notice to quit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The letter of 31 July 2008 reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    We refer to your letter dated 13 June 2008 and
                            your tenant, Fico Sports Pte Ltd’s (FICO)’s letters dated
                            27 June 2008 to HDB which were copied to you.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    The first 3-year term of your Tenancy Agreement (TA)
                            with HDB will expire on 31 Jul 08. Under Clause 7.1 of the
                            Tenancy Agreement (TA), HDB may at your written request made 3 calendar
                            months before the expiration of the tenancy of the subject site grant to
                            you a further term of up to 3 years from the expiration of the current
                            TA, subject to new terms and conditions and market rent prevailing at
                            the time of the renewal provided, that there shall be no breach of the
                            terms and conditions on your part. So far, we have not received any
                            written request from you for a further 3-year term upon expiry of the
                            existing TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    We have highlighted to you in our letters dated
                            9 May 08, 29 May 08 and 30 May 08 that we did not give
                            you any approval to carry out A/A works to convert your premises into a
                            foodcourt. Under Clause 4.2.6 of the Tenancy Agreement, you are not
                            to undertake any A/A works without the prior written approval of the
                            Landlord and the relevant authorities. Therefore, the foodcourt is
                            considered as unauthorised. We have also checked with URA which informed
                            us that the unauthorised foodcourt area is approved for use as a shop
                            and not for a foodcourt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    Our site inspections also revealed that Pizza Hut
                            and a Taiwan Chicken Chop outlet have commenced business on site. Again,
                            no approvals have been granted by HDB for the subletting. Recently, Fico
                            has requested for HDB’s approval to sublet various units at their
                            premises vide their letters dated 27 Jun 08. It was stated in
                            Fico’s letter that you have agreed for HDB to revert directly to
                            Fico on the subletting applications. This is not in accordance with the
                            subletting application procedures. We have informed you on several
                            occasions that Fico is your subtenant, any proposal from Fico must be
                            submitted through you for HDB’s consideration as
                        Landlord.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    In view of the above infringements, we will not
                            grant a further 3-year term when your existing tenancy expires on
                            31 Jul 08.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">THG noted that the earlier letters HDB referred to in para 3
                    of its letter had not only been brought to Fico’s attention by THG itself
                    but had also been copied to Fico by HDB. Fico had not responded in the way that
                    HDB required but had consistently disregarded the terms of the Head Lease and
                    failed to keep HDB informed, in the proper manner, as to what was happening on
                    the Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     HDB’s notice to quit dated 25 March
                    2009 reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Fico argued that THG had merely submitted that
                    it was “proper and valid” to imply the terms it had pleaded at
                    para 36A of the defence and counterclaim without demonstrating the
                    propriety or validity of the same. In the absence of concrete evidence or legal
                    precedent to further THG’s claim, Fico considered it sufficient to repeat
                    its denial of any implied term in the Sub-Lease which could bind it in the
                    manner asserted by THG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It is true that there is no legal precedent
                    for the assertion that there should be implied in the Sub-Lease a term that Fico
                    would not breach the terms of the Head Lease. The situation with regard to the
                    second term sought to be implied by para 36A(a) of the defence and
                    counterclaim (see [90(a)] above) is different, however. As can be seen from
                    [170.0965] of <em>Halsbury’s</em> quoted above, it is
                    established law that every lease includes an implied condition that the tenant
                    will not do anything that may prejudice the landlord’s
                title.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Turning to the facts, it is plain that Fico is
                    in breach of this implied term. HDB’s letter of 31 July 2008 showed
                    that its principal reason for not renewing the Head Lease was Fico’s
                    conduct in carrying on activities which HDB had not approved. I have found that
                    Fico was aware of the terms of the Head Lease and therefore knew what the
                    approved uses for Plot 2 were. I have also found that Mr Lau was told by
                    HDB that only snacks and light meals were permitted. He must also have been
                    aware from HSK that the class “Shop (F&amp;B)” did not permit
                    cooking and dining-in. Yet Fico proceeded to sub-let portions of its premises to
                    Pizza Hut and SDW Chicken without prior approval. Having seen Mr Lau in the
                    witness box, I think he believed that if he presented THG and HDB with a
                        <em>fait accompli</em> Fico would get what it wanted in
                    that he would be able to persuade the other parties to see things Fico’s
                    way. HDB’s notice to quit cited Fico’s conduct and breaches as its
                    reasons for terminating the Head Lease. THG’s title has been prejudiced by
                    Fico’s conduct and it is entitled to re-enter on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The next term which THG sought to imply was
                    stated in para 36(A)(b) of the defence and counterclaim. This was the term
                    that Fico would not use or allow any part of the Premises to be used for any
                    purpose other than an approved use. In my opinion, such a term would meet the
                    test of business efficacy required for the implication of a term. Fico had
                    expressly covenanted not to use the premises except for uses approved by HDB.
                    Such a covenant must reflect the condition that such use would not be undertaken
                    by Fico itself or by third parties who gained title or access to the Premises
                    through Fico. This implied term has also been breached. However, since there is
                    no express proviso for re-entry in relation to such a breach, it does not by
                    itself allow forfeiture. It can only permit re-entry if the breach is considered
                    to be a repudiatory breach which has been accepted by the landlord. I must,
                    therefore, consider it in the context of THG’s arguments on repudiation
                    and acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The basis of this ground is the allegation
                    that Fico had, by its actions and omissions and course of conduct, breached the
                    Sub-Lease and evinced an intention to repudiate the Sub-Lease and this
                    repudiation had been accepted by THG. Further, Fico’s conduct had resulted
                    in the non-renewal of the Head Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    THG pleaded that Fico was at all material
                    times aware of the terms of the Head Lease and that breach of the Head Lease may
                    result in non-renewal of the Head Lease or termination of the same.
                    Notwithstanding that, Fico had used portions of the Premises for unauthorised
                    uses, in particular, it had rented out units to Pizza Hut and SDW Chicken. THG
                    also complained about the following conduct on Fico’s part:</p>

                            When HDB came to know about this, it wrote (12 May 2008) to THG
                            with copies to Fico, the consultants and URA, stating that it took a
                            serious view of such matters. HDB specifically required the proposal to

                            regard Fico had placed an advertisement at the entrance of Plot 2 which
                            stated “Fico Lounge Now Open” and was clearly an
                            invitation to all. HDB’s response, on 24 June 2008, was to
                            ask for all commercial advertisements along the boundary fencing to be
                            removed.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I should state immediately that I do not consider that there is any
                    merit in THG’s complaint about the sub-letting of part of the Premises to
                    be used as football fields as this was a use which HDB had previously
                    approved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The incidents listed in <a href="#p1_100">[100]</a> had taken place before 31 July 2008.
                    THG complained of further unacceptable conduct after the Head Lease had expired.
                    First, Fico had sub-let the space next to its office to a construction company
                    as a site office. The HDB had discovered this from a site inspection but when
                    the issue was brought up to Fico, it denied any sub-letting and asserted that
                    the company concerned was handling maintenance work for Fico at its site. The
                    difficulty here was basically with the use of the Premises as the same were not
                    approved for use by third parties as offices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Second, there was an incident which occurred
                    on 10 January 2009. From 2 a.m. that morning, there was no power supply to
                    THG’s portion of Plot 2. The Premises, however, had power. The main
                    switchboard on Plot 2 is housed in a structure on the Premises. THG complained
                    that its personnel were not allowed to have access to the structure and it was
                    only on Monday 12 January 2009, after a warning from the police, that
                    access was obtained. It was then found that the supply to THG had been
                    deliberately switched off. THG complained that for 10 hours on 10 January
                    2009 it had no power and had not been able to conduct its usual business. This
                    was especially damaging as 10 January 2009 fell during the busy pre-Chinese
                    New Year period. It submitted that Fico had deliberately caused this
                    situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    THG complained that from 31 July 2008
                    when HDB served notice that owing to Fico’s persistent breaches it was not
                    going to renew the Head Lease, Fico had made no effort to remedy its breaches.
                    Instead, Fico had maintained it was entitled to continue sub-letting to Pizza
                    Hut and SDW Chicken because THG had no choice but to sign the drawings and
                    submissions for change of use to suit Fico’s needs. Fico had also refused
                    to consider the terms that THG had proposed for regulating the relationship. THG
                    submitted that Fico’s decision to continue with these sub-lets was
                    inconsistent with the terms of the Sub-Lease and manifested an intention not to
                    be bound by it. Consequently, THG was entitled to accept Fico’s
                    repudiatory breach and bring the Sub-Lease to an end by its notice to
                    quit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Dealing with the submissions on repudiation,
                    Fico did not accept THG’s assertion that it was due solely to Fico’s
                    actions that the Head Lease was not renewed. It stated that the unauthorised
                    uses were commenced under its misapprehension that sub-letting was not
                    restricted and that F&amp;B included the type and scale of operations it was
                    carrying out and that this arose due to THG’s misrepresentations. When
                    told by HDB that these were unauthorised uses, Fico had the option of either
                    rectifying the breaches by ceasing operation or regularising the uses by
                    applying to HDB for a change in use. Given Fico’s “immense
                    financial investments” in the Premises and the involvement of innocent
                    third parties, it sought to regularise the unauthorised uses. HDB itself was
                    supportive of this course of action. Fico had made repeated and concerted
                    efforts to try to regularise the uses long before renewal of the Head Lease was
                    in issue. THG had not mentioned those and had also carefully omitted its own
                    part in hindering the start of the regularisation process by repeatedly delaying
                    or refusing to endorse Fico’s plans and documents over a significant
                    period of time. The fact that THG did not actually write to HDB to formally
                    request the renewal of the Head Lease at the end of the first three-year term
                    was also highlighted by HDB in its letter of 31 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I am not disposed to accept Fico’s
                    submissions on its lack of blameworthiness. As I have held above, it was
                    Fico’s actions that led to the non-renewal of the Head Lease. No doubt,
                    under the terms of the Head Lease, THG should have applied for a renewal of the
                    same but judging by the patience that HDB displayed in giving Fico and THG time
                    to settle their problems even after 31 July 2008, I think it is safe to
                    infer that THG’s non-observance of the proper procedure would not have
                    constituted an insurmountable bar to the renewal of the Head Lease. Secondly,
                    Fico’s actions were not induced by any misrepresentation on the part of
                    THG. Thirdly, whilst Fico did seek to regularise the situation regarding the
                    unauthorised uses, it did not adopt a reasonable position but acted in its own
                    interests without regard for what was reasonable for THG and what was required
                    by HDB. Fico’s determined effort to try and impose its own protocol in
                    relation to applications for change of use was just one example of its
                    behaviour. On the other hand, THG made many efforts to try to resolve the
                    disputes and agree on a procedure for applications to HDB. Some of the
                    correspondence has been referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    From THG’s viewpoint, its effort to
                    resolve the difficulties culminated in its solicitors’ letter of
                    26 February 2009. This letter contained the draft terms which THG hoped
                    would form the basis of a written agreement between the parties to settle the
                    change of use issue. To paraphrase THG’s terms, these were as
                    follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Fico must not by any act or omission breach the

                            condition imposed by such authorities would have to be complied with

                            food for consumption in the Premises or outside the Premises, it had to
                            seek and obtain express written approval from HDB and other competent
                            authorities for the same and would have to comply with any condition

                    to proposals that Fico had made on 24 December 2008 asking THG to agree to
                    endorse on Fico’s plans and documents relating to sub-lettings and change
                    of use upon Fico’s agreement to: (i) pay the increase in rent by HDB if it
                    specifically related to Fico’s change in use; and (ii) pay an
                    administration fee of $150 if the endorsed plans and documents were submitted by
                    THG to HDB within two days of receipt and $50 if submission took place within
                    seven days. The letter also stated that Fico’s agreement to these two
                    terms was not to be construed as an admission that THG was entitled to any other
                    new terms in respect of the existing agreements between the parties. In effect,
                    therefore, Fico was rejecting THG’s proposal and putting forward its own
                    terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In its closing submissions, Fico argued that

                            choose one for the purpose of allocating any increase in rent due to
                            change of use; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Fico was required to assure and indemnify THG for
                            any complication arising from the applications regardless of whether it
                            intended the outcome or was even at fault.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">As far as Fico was concerned, THG was not attempting to mitigate its
                    losses or to provide a framework for the parties to “move forward”
                    as THG alleged. Instead, THG was trying to make it as difficult as possible for
                    Fico to submit its applications to THG and was just trying to discourage Fico
                    from doing so. This body of new, onerous, terms was an attempt to unilaterally
                    modify the Sub-Lease to THG’s advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In my judgment, Fico’s objections were
                    misplaced. Some of THG’s terms in relation to fee payment may have been
                    excessive but Fico was prepared to pay some fees and so this was a question of
                    quantum rather than of principle. Fico also misunderstood part of the proposals.
                    It appears to me that THG was prepared to agree to endorse plans that related to
                    uses that had already been approved subject to conditions if necessary but
                    wanted to be free to reject those that would embody a change of use or a new
                    use. That was a reasonable stance bearing in mind the consequences that might
                    result from the applications. Fico, on the other hand, wanted THG to agree to
                    all its proposals but was not prepared to indemnify THG against the consequences
                    thereof because it thought it should only be responsible for intended
                    consequences or when it was at fault. That was a self-serving attitude to take.
                    As far as the fees that THG sought to impose are concerned, these (and also the
                    periods of time for the response) were matters which Fico could have negotiated.
                    Instead, it made it clear by its lawyer’s letter of 27 March 2009
                    that it wanted its terms accepted and would not accede to THG’s. In
                    general, THG’s terms were reasonable since it had to protect itself
                    against both the foreseeable and the unforeseeable consequences of agreeing to
                    endorse on Fico’s applications to HDB. It was also not reasonable for Fico
                    to argue that its responsibility should be limited. It should have agreed to
                    indemnify THG against all matters arising out of its applications to change the
                    use of the Premises whether the same were foreseen or unforeseen, intended or
                    unintended. Fault would be irrelevant; all that would be material would be
                    whether the matter arose as a consequence of the change of use application or
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    One other point bears mention. THG had
                    wanted Fico to be fully responsible for any increase in rent arising from any
                    approved change of use. Fico’s response was that it would only be
                    responsible for rental increases “specifically related” to its
                    change of use. This phraseology was vague. It had been used previously and
                    because THG was not clear to what extent Fico was willing to bear the increase
                    in rent, it had proposed through its solicitors’ letters of
                    6 November 2008 and 26 February 2009 how the issue of apportionment
                    could be determined. Fico had not dealt with that proposal in substance in its
                    solicitors’ response of 26 March 2009. It did not appear to be
                    serious in its desire to settle the dispute out of court. It is significant that
                    Fico’s solicitors’ letter of 27 March 2009 ended with the
                    sentence “This is an open letter which will be shown to the Court, if
                    necessary”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Coming to the incidents that took place
                    after 31 July 2009, I do not think that THG can rely on anything to do with
                    the incident of the power shutdown on 10 January 2009 to substantiate its
                    argument that by conduct Fico was evincing an intention to repudiate the
                    Sub-Lease. I do not need to make a finding on the rights and wrongs of this
                    incident because in my view THG’s case, if any, would be one for damages
                    for mischief. There is nothing in the Sub-Lease relating to the power supply to
                    THG’s portion of Plot 2 and even if Fico did shut down the power
                    intentionally such action does not relate to its observance of the terms of the
                    Sub-Lease. It is also important that this was an isolated incident. I might have
                    taken a different view of the matter if it had been part of a campaign to
                    interfere with THG’s enjoyment of Plot 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The alleged sub-letting of a unit to Hen
                    Sheng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (“Hen Sheng”) to be used as a site
                    office is a different matter since this, if proved, would amount to a breach of
                    the covenant to use the Premises only for uses approved by HDB. It would also be
                    evidence of continuing recalcitrance on the part of Fico. To substantiate this
                    allegation, THG subpoenaed Mr Oh Kian Ann, a director of Hen
                Sheng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Mr Oh testified that Hen Sheng was
                    involved in a project for road repair and resurfacing at Jurong West Central 1
                    to 3, Streets 64 and 93. It was the contractor employed to resurface the roads
                    concerned. The project started in August 2008 and was completed in December
                    2009. Mr Oh stated that Hen Sheng’s site office for this project was
                    at Canberra Road. As far as the unit rented from Fico was concerned, that was
                    used only for storage of tools and as an office in relation to maintenance works
                    which Hen Sheng had contracted to carry out for Fico.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In its submissions, THG emphasised the
                    following evidence given by Mr Oh:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That Hen Sheng itself did not do any maintenance
                            work for Fico but arranged for such maintenance to be carried out by
                            others;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Although Hen Sheng charged Fico $1,000 a month
                            for this maintenance service, Hen Sheng had never billed Fico and only
                            intended to send out its bill for $17,000 after the 2010 Chinese New
                            Year because this was a small amount;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Hen Sheng provided the use of internet facilities
                            in its office at the Premises to supervisors from a number of its nearby
                            work sites;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Although there was no telephone connection in the
                            office in the Premises, Hen Sheng’s supervisors who used the
                            office had their own hand phones; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Although Mr Oh had said that the office was
                            used mainly as a store, it turned out that it was used to store three
                            small standard boxes of tools and a couple of ladders
                        only.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">THG submitted that this evidence supported the inference that in fact
                    the unit was used as a site office. It also considered that Mr Oh’s
                    assertion that the site office for the project was in Canberra Road was
                    incredible because that location was too far away from the project to suit the
                    purpose of a site office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Fico, on the other hand, submitted that the
                    unit was clearly not a site office. It had no fax or telephone line and was
                    therefore not equipped to act as such. It was a maintenance office and the fact
                    that site supervisors from nearby projects would use the internet facility at
                    the office was consistent with it not being a site office. Fico argued that site
                    supervisors of major construction projects are not primarily coordinated through
                    the internet and the usage of the internet facilities must have been primarily
                    recreational.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Having considered the evidence, I am
                    satisfied on balance that the office unit had been rented to Hen Sheng for use
                    as a site office. The fact that for over a year not a single invoice had been
                    sent out for the maintenance services allegedly provided by Hen Sheng to Fico
                    was telling. I did not believe Mr Oh’s assertions that the unit was
                    merely a store cum maintenance office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The evidence before me has satisfied me that
                    Fico’s conduct consistently evinced an intention not to be bound by the
                    restrictions in the Sub-Lease. During the initial negotiations with THG,
                    Mr Lau impressed upon the Tohs that he had a passion for sports and that he
                    wanted to go into the sports business to express that passion notwithstanding
                    his awareness that in Singapore the sports business was not profitable.
                    Mr Lau was at all material times aware that Plot 2 had a restricted usage
                    and that only certain sports would be approved by HDB. He was also aware that
                    heavy duty food and beverage business was not permissible but that HDB would
                    approve the provision of snacks and light meals as a complementary use to the
                    primary usage of the Premises for sporting activities. In line with this
                    knowledge and the terms of the Head Lease, the Sub-Lease had no provision
                    allowing the establishment of fast food restaurants and food courts but
                    contained a covenant that the tenant would only use the premises for
                    “sports/games/recreational activities and or other uses as approved by
                    the HDB”. Notwithstanding this, from the time Pizza Hut moved in in
                    December 2007, Fico consistently acted as if it did not need HDB’s
                    approval for change of use. Even after it was forced to admit that this was
                    required, it did not take reasonable steps to rectify the situation but instead
                    continued to go its own way including by renting out premises for the purpose of
                    a site office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    THG accepted Fico’s repudiation by its
                    notice to quit dated 26 March 2009. A similar notice was sent out the same
                    day by its solicitors. Fico submitted that the notice to quit was not an
                    effective acceptance of repudiation because in the very next paragraph after
                    giving Fico notice, THG’s solicitors had said “we opine it is still
                    not too late for [Fico] to act responsibly and reasonably by accepting the terms
                    we have set out in our letter to you of 26 February 2009 including the
                    mechanism outlined in paragraph 26 thereof in order that our client may attempt
                    to persuade the HDB to withdraw the notice to quit”. I do not agree. In
                    my judgment the notice to quit was an effective acceptance notwithstanding the
                    suggestion that perhaps things could still be worked out with HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Fico also contended that by accepting rent
                    from Fico as well as demanding rent, THG had not accepted the breaches allegedly
                    committed by Fico. Further, even though THG might have said that the acceptance
                    of rent was without prejudice to its rights, the position in law was such that
                    acceptance constituted a valid waiver of breach. For this proposition, Fico
                    relied on <em>Leivest International Pte Ltd v Top Ten
                        Entertainment Pte Ltd</em> [2006] SGHC 1 (“<em>Leivest</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The proposition of law that <em>Leivest</em> embodied is well settled. Several English cases
                    were cited in <em>Leivest</em> which held that the right of
                    forfeiture is waived when rent is demanded and accepted by the landlord with
                    knowledge of the tenant’s breach. The question that has to be answered in
                    each case is whether it was rent that was demanded and paid. If it was damages
                    for trespass that was demanded and paid, then there would be no waiver. This
                    principle is stated at [42] of <em>Leivest</em>, which
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Windmill Investments (London) Ltd v
                            Milano Restaurant Ltd</em> [1962] 2 QB 373, rent was
                        paid and the landlord’s receipt stated expressly that “This
                        receipt is given without prejudice to the following breaches of covenant
                        ...” with a breach spelt out. There was a dispute whether the receipt
                        constituted a waiver of the breach. Megaw J found in favour of the
                        tenant, and explained at 376:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t is a question of fact whether the money tendered is tendered as,
                            and accepted as, rent, as distinct, for example, from money tendered and
                            accepted as damages for trespass. That is a question of fact. Once it is
                            decided as a fact that the money was tendered and accepted as rent, the
                            question of its consequences as a waiver is a matter of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Thus, if as a matter of fact the rental was
                    only accepted as damages, then there would be no waiver. In the instant case on
                    26 March 2009, THG’s solicitors advised Fico’s solicitors that
                    if Fico failed to vacate the Premises by the deadline given, Fico would be
                    liable for double rent until vacant possession had been delivered. On
                    15 May 2009, THG advised Fico that it was holding over and was liable for
                    double rent from 24 April 2009 and that any rent paid on or after
                    25 May 2009 was received without prejudice to THG’s rights against
                    Fico and to account of Fico’s liability to double rent. THG made it quite
                    clear, therefore, that payments made after issue of the notice to quit would
                    only be accepted as part of the damages. As a matter of fact, therefore, I hold
                    there was no waiver of THG’s acceptance of Fico’s
                    repudiation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    For the reasons above, I find that
                    THG’s counterclaim must be allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In the event, Fico’s claim is
                    dismissed with costs. THG is entitled to judgment on its counterclaim on the
                    following basis:</p>
