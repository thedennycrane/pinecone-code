The defendant failed to satisfy the claim. The plaintiff proceeded to have its claim adjudicated. The defendant resisted the adjudication on the ground that one of the Act’s fundamental requirements was not fulfilled.  His position was that he had no contract at all with the plaintiff. He accepted that he had entered into a contract which did fulfil the requirements of the Act, but argued that the counterparty to that contract was not the plaintiff but another entity entirely. He argued, further, that he had never agreed to that other entity novating his contract to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The adjudicator rejected the defendant’s argument and found that the defendant had indeed agreed to his contract being novated to the plaintiff. He therefore determined the adjudication in the plaintiff’s favour.

</div> He told the defendant that a sister company of D&amp;B was pursuing a number of disputed claims under an unrelated contract in relation to an unrelated project. As D&amp;B was the builder in that project, Mr Tan was concerned that the owner there might bring cross-claims against D&amp;B and that that might lead the Building &amp; Construction Authority (“BCA”) to order D&amp;B to suspend work on all its ongoing projects, including the defendant’s. Mr Tan therefore proposed the novation in order to protect the defendant by insulating his project from the possible consequences of those unrelated disputes.

</div> They also took the objection that, under the Act, a claimant had no right of reply to the respondent’s adjudication response. However, the plaintiff had now taken the opportunity in its submissions to put in a full reply to the defendant’s adjudication response. As a result, the defendant’s solicitors invited the adjudicator either: (i) to reject the plaintiff’s submissions outright for being late; or (ii) to extend to the defendant a right of reply. The defendant’s solicitors asked for a right of reply on the grounds that the plaintiff’s submissions were lengthy and contained factual inaccuracies and erroneous statements of legal principle which, if left unaddressed, would cause the defendant “severe prejudice”. The defendant’s solicitors further stated that they intended to make only brief submissions for clarification in order to assist the adjudicator.

</div> that the question of jurisdiction is not for an adjudicator to decide. It is a question for the court hearing a setting-aside application to decide. In light of that, a respondent should not raise the issue of jurisdiction before an adjudicator – save perhaps only to preserve the point for a future setting-aside application to the court – and an adjudicator before whom his own jurisdiction is raised should not decide it. As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Lee We</span><span class="font-italic">e Lick Terence (alias Li Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 401 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span>”) at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, if the respondent’s objection to the jurisdiction or power of the adjudicator to conduct the adjudication is based on an invalid appointment, such a jurisdictional issue should be raised immediately with the court and not before the adjudicator.<span class="font-italic"> The reason is</span> <span class="font-italic">that</span> <span class="font-italic">since the objection is against the adjudicator’s jurisdiction as an adjudicator, he has no power to decide if he has jurisdiction or not. He cannot decide his own competency to act as an adjudicator when such competency is being challenged by the respondent.</span> An adjudicator who decides the issue may face one or other of the following consequences. If he accepts the respondent’s objection and dismisses the payment claim, the claimant may commence court proceedings against him to compel him to adjudicate the payment claim. If he dismisses the respondent’s objection and makes an award, the respondent could still raise the same objection in enforcement proceedings with respect to his award. Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">the adjudicator should proceed with the adjudication and leave the issue to the court to decide. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 So too, it is not for the adjudicator to decide whether or not he has complied with the rules of natural justice.

On 28 April 2015, the defendant filed his setting-aside application.  At the same time, he paid the sum of $396,875 into court as required by s 27(5) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The defendant makes his setting-aside application by way of an interlocutory summons in the plaintiff’s enforcement proceedings. The substantive relief which he seeks in his summons is an order setting aside the adjudication determination and an order setting aside the leave granted to the plaintiff to enforce the adjudication determination. These two claims for relief stand or fall together. Neither party suggests that the defendant’s application to set aside the leave granted to the plaintiff to enforce the adjudication determination ought, in the circumstances of this case, to be analysed separately or to be determined by principles separate from those which determine whether the adjudication determination itself ought to be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is therefore to these principles which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Setting aside</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Power and grounds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 797 (“<span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span>”), the Court of Appeal held (at [42]) that the power to set aside an adjudication determination arises at common law, as an instance of the High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> “the inherent power of superior courts to review the proceedings and decisions of inferior courts and tribunals or other public bodies discharging public functions”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The court’s role in exercising this supervisory jurisdiction is restricted. It inquires only into fundamental procedural grounds arising from the adjudication. It cannot review the adjudication determination on the merits. That restriction, in addition to being inherent in the nature of the supervisory jurisdiction, is consistent with the underlying purpose of the Act. As the Court of Appeal put it in <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Put simply, <span class="font-weight-bold">in hearing an application to set aside an </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[adjudication determination] …,</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">the court does not review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision, and any setting aside must be premised on issues relating to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator, a breach of natural justice or non-compliance with the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[Act]</span>. Applications to set aside [adjudication determinations] … are thus <span class="font-italic">akin </span>to judicial review proceedings, and are not appeals on the merits of the adjudicator’s decision. In our judgment, it is consistent with the purpose of the [Act], which is to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry, that the court, in hearing such applications, does not review the merits of the [adjudication determination] in question. It may be noted that in keeping with its statutory purpose, the [Act] establishes that parties who have done work or supplied goods are entitled to payment as of right; it also sets out an intervening process of adjudication which, although provisional in nature, is final and binding on the parties to the adjudication until their differences are ultimately and conclusively determined. In other words, the adjudication determination under the [Act] seeks to achieve temporary finality: see <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380 at [18]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in the original; emphasis in bold added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Because the power to set aside an adjudication determination arises at common law, the Act nowhere expressly gives the court the power to do so. Instead, the Act assumes that such a power exists outside the Act and does no more than require the dissatisfied party, by s 27(5), to pay the unpaid portion of the adjudicated amount into court before invoking that power. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Act likewise nowhere expressly spells out the grounds on which an applicant can succeed in either type of setting-aside application, whether to set aside an adjudication determination itself or to set aside the leave granted under s 27 of the Act to enforce an adjudication determination. There is thus no equivalent in the Act of s 48 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) or of Article 34(1) of the Model Law on Arbitration read with s 24 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”). The grounds for setting aside – just like the power to set aside itself – are therefore to be found outside the Act and in the common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span>, the Court of Appeal held (at [66] – [67]) that the court’s role on a setting-aside application is restricted to considering whether the respondent has established either of the two fundamental grounds on which the setting-aside power may be exercised:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the adjudicator was validly appointed, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> whether there is a payment claim and whether it has been validly served; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the claimant, in making the adjudication application, failed to comply with a provision of the Act which is so important that the legislative purpose of the Act is that a breach of that provision should render the application invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The second of these two grounds says nothing about the <span class="font-italic">adjudicator’s</span> conduct in making his <span class="font-italic">determination</span>. It focuses only on the <span class="font-italic">claimant’s</span> conduct in making its <span class="font-italic">application</span>. But that focus is simply the result of the nature of the actual challenge before the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span> itself.

</div> that the burden of proof in either type of setting-aside application rests on the respondent in the adjudication. That is so simply because it is the respondent who must move the court in both types of application.

It is also important to be clear about the standard of proof which a respondent must meet in order to discharge this burden on questions of fact. The defendant’s jurisdictional challenge turns, at least in part, on the following question of fact: did he agree to novate the construction contract to the plaintiff? I asked both counsel to address me on the standard which the defendant must meet to succeed on this question.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 To support this submission, defendant’s counsel relies heavily on cases from England and from New South Wales. In my view, these cases are of no assistance to him. The cases he cites from England are distinguishable because the English regime for adjudication is founded on contract rather than statute. The cases he cites from New South Wales are distinguishable because they each applied a well-known standard established in an aspect of the general law of civil procedure rather than a specific standard held to apply under New South Wales’ statutory adjudication regime.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As a result, I have rejected the defendant’s submission. In my view, the plaintiff is correct: for a respondent to succeed in discharging his burden on a disputed question of fact which he advances on a setting-aside application, the respondent must establish that fact on the balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the circumstances of this case, therefore, the defendant cannot succeed on the issue of jurisdiction unless he can establish on the balance of probabilities that he never agreed to novate his construction contract to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I now explain my reasons for rejecting the defendant’s submissions. I shall analyse first the English case cited by defendant’s counsel before turning to the New South Wales cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">England</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Although adjudication in England is regulated by statute, it is ultimately founded in contract. Access to adjudication in England arises either from terms which the parties have expressly agreed in their contract or from terms which statute implies into their contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The statute which regulates adjudication in England is the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (“the English Act”). Section 108 of the English Act provides that adjudication is governed by the parties’ contract provided that the contract contains express provisions for adjudication which meet certain minimum requirements prescribed by ss 108(2) to 108(4) of the English Act. These minimum requirements extend to aspects of the adjudication procedure and to the duties and powers of the adjudicator. If the parties’ contract contains no express provisions for adjudication or contains express provisions for adjudication which fall short of the minimum requirements prescribed by statute, ss 108(5) and 114(4) of the English Act read together provide that the adjudication provisions set out in subsidiary legislation enacted under the English Act take effect as implied terms of the parties’ contract. The subsidiary legislation in question is the Schedule to the Scheme for Construction Contracts (England and Wales) Regulations 1998. That legislation is known commonly and simply as the “Scheme for Construction Contracts”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 One of those minimum requirements, imposed by s 108(3) of the English Act, is that the parties’ contract must expressly provide that the decision of the adjudicator carries temporary finality, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that it bind the parties contractually until their underlying dispute is determined with full finality. If the contract contains no express provision to that effect, paragraph 23(2) of the Scheme for Construction Contracts read with s 114(4) of the English Act operates to imply a term into the parties’ contract conferring temporary finality on an adjudicator’s decision in the same terms as are set out in s 108(3) of the English Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As a result, the failure to comply with an adjudication decision under the English regime is simply a breach of contract. It constitutes a breach of either an express term or of a statutorily implied term of the parties’ contract. The consequence of that failure is the same as the consequence of any other breach of contract: the contract-breaker is liable to be compelled by the court to pay damages to the innocent party for breach of contract. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Macob</span><span class="font-italic"> Civil Engineering Ltd v Morrison Construction Ltd</span> [1999] All ER (D) 143 (“<span class="font-italic">Macob</span>”), Dyson J (as Lord Dyson then was) held (at [37]) that “the usual remedy for failure to pay in accordance with an adjudicator’s decision will be to issue proceedings claiming the sum due, followed by an application for summary judgment”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This is an important point. The typical civil action in England, as in Singapore, offers a claimant two avenues to put the merits of his claim before the court for determination. The first avenue is through an application for summary judgment. The second avenue is at a full trial on the merits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 A claimant in England who seeks summary judgment will secure it if he can establish that “the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim…” and that “there is no other compelling reason why the case…should be disposed of at a trial”. These tests are found in Part 24.2(a) of the English Civil Procedure Rules, the analogue of our Order 14. A claimant who relies on the temporary finality of an adjudication decision for his claim will ordinarily expect to satisfy this test. That is the result of the fundamental importance which the English courts attach to upholding temporary finality and of the limited defences available against a claim which relies on that concept. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Under the English regime, therefore, a claimant who is unable to secure summary judgment on an adjudication decision in his favour will nevertheless have another opportunity at a full trial to put the merits of his claim arising from the adjudication decision before the court. That situation will undoubtedly be rare: the objectives of any adjudication regime militate against requiring a claimant to go through a full trial simply to secure the benefit of an adjudication decision. But the important point is that a respondent who secures any sort of leave to defend at the summary judgment stage under the English regime does not thereby bring the claimant’s attempt to secure the benefit of an adjudication decision to an end. The claimant’s attempt simply proceeds to trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Our adjudication regime is significantly different from the English regime, as I explain at [82] – [84] below. That is why the English case law is not at all helpful when considering the standard of proof which rests on a respondent who brings a setting-aside application under our regime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Defendant’s counsel also relies on the English case of <span class="font-italic">Project Consultancy Group v Trustees of the </span><span class="font-italic">Gray Trust</span> (1999) 65 ConLR 146 (“<span class="font-italic">Project Consultancy</span>”). The defendants in that case failed to comply with an adjudication decision. The claimant issued a writ against the defendants followed by an application for summary judgment. The defendants resisted summary judgment on the grounds that the adjudicator did not have jurisdiction over them. The argued that either: (i) they had no contract with the claimant; or (ii) if they did, it had been entered into before 1 May 1998, the date on which the English Act had come into force. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 What Dyson J had to decide in <span class="font-italic">Project Consultancy</span> was not whether the claimant’s attempt to enforce the adjudication decision should succeed or fail. What Dyson J had to decide was whether the claimant was entitled to summary judgment on its claim. Therefore, echoing the language of Part 24.2(a) (see [74] above), he framed the question before him as being “whether the defendants [had] a real prospect of showing that the adjudicator was wrong in holding that a contract was concluded after 1 May 1998”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 After reviewing the evidence, Dyson J held that the claimant had failed to satisfy this test. It was therefore not entitled to summary judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 In my view, the question whether, and if so when, a contract was ever concluded in this case is by no means straightforward. I have heard prolonged argument, and been taken through many documents as well as a number of witness statements. I find it quite impossible to resolve these issues with any degree of confidence. I am by no means certain that I have seen all the relevant documents, or that I know the full story. Quite apart from the facts, the issues of law that have not been argued as fully as they would be at a trial are not easy to resolve. I have come to the conclusion that it is at least arguable that no contract was concluded on 10 July, and that no contract was ever concluded between the parties… I am quite satisfied that it is not possible to resolve these issues by summary process, and without full evidence and argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Dyson J’s decision is completely unremarkable in the light of the English adjudication regime. He had an action before him which sought contractual relief arising from the defendant’s failure to comply with an adjudication decision. The issue which arose was whether the parties had a contract at all, and if so whether the English Act applied to it. The plaintiff applied to Dyson J for summary judgment on its claim. The question which then arose, as it does on every application for summary judgment, was whether the plaintiff ought to be permitted to have its claim determined summarily or should be required to proceed to trial. Despite the claimant’s evidence and submissions, Dyson J found the defence to be at least arguable. He therefore concluded that the claimant’s claim should not be determined summarily and ought instead to proceed to trial, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> with the additional benefit of discovery of documents, cross-examination on the facts and fuller arguments on the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In <span class="font-italic">Project Consultancy</span>, Dyson J did not deny the claimant the benefit of an adjudication decision simply because the defendants’ grounds of challenge were “at least arguable”. Dyson J simply required the plaintiff to prove at trial that it was entitled to the benefit of the adjudication decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The adjudication regime in Singapore is significantly different from the adjudication regime in England. Our regime is a bespoke statutory process. It is not one which has been engrafted onto contract and therefore onto the ordinary procedure for enforcing contractual obligations. Instead, our regime is set out in primary and subsidiary legislation and in the case law interpreting and applying that legislation. This difference has two consequences which make the English case law of no assistance in deducing the standard of proof that a defendant in Singapore must meet on a setting-aside application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 First, the burden in an ordinary civil action, and therefore also in an application for summary judgment within that action, remains on the plaintiff. That is true in Singapore as it is in England. Under the English adjudication regime, therefore, a claimant who seeks the benefit of an adjudication decision bears the burden of establishing his contractual entitlement to do so. That is so whether the claimant is seeking relief summarily or at trial. Our Act, on the other hand, relieves a claimant of the burden of proof which would otherwise rest on him in enforcement proceedings by permitting him to enforce an adjudication determination simply by a process of registration. The onus is thereafter placed firmly on the respondent to bring a setting-aside application – of either type – and to satisfy the court that it should succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Second, in the English regime, whether the claimant is able to show that the respondent has no real prospect of a defence determines only whether the enforceability of the adjudication decision should be determined summarily or at trial. In our regime, a respondent must bring an application to set aside an adjudication determination by originating summons, and must bring an application to set aside leave to enforce an adjudication determination by interlocutory summons in the claimant’s enforcement application. In either case, the challenge to the adjudication determination is resolved once and for all – at least at first instance – when the High Court considers and decides whether to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction in the defendant’s favour. A setting-aside application in our regime will not go to trial. There is therefore no warrant for applying on a setting-aside application under our regime the converse of the standard which suffices for a plaintiff to secure summary judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">New South Wales</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The defendant also refers me to a number of decisions from New South Wales.

</div> I have reviewed them. None of them support his submission that the courts of New South Wales set aside an adjudication determination merely upon finding that the respondent has made out an arguable case of a lack of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The adjudication regime in New South Wales is set out in the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (“the NSW Act”). Under s 24 of the NSW Act, if the respondent fails to pay an adjudicated amount, the claimant may obtain a certificate from the authorised nominating body setting out the names of the parties, the amount adjudicated and the date on which payment of the amount adjudicated was due. The claimant can then file that adjudication certificate as a judgment for a debt in any court of competent jurisdiction, upon which the certificate will be enforceable accordingly as provided in s 25(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The NSW Act contemplates in s 25(4) that the respondent is entitled to commence proceedings to have the resulting judgment set aside.

</div> The respondent in that case brought judicial review proceedings seeking a declaration that an adjudicator’s determination was void. One of the respondent’s arguments was that the adjudicator had erred in finding that there was a construction contract between the respondent and the claimant. Brereton J held (at [21]) that it was open to the reviewing court to decide that question of fact for itself because it went to jurisdiction:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[w]here the existence of an essential preliminary precondition to jurisdiction is a question of objective fact (as distinct from where it depends on the tribunal having a state of satisfaction or opinion), it is for the reviewing court to determine, on the evidence before it, whether or not the fact exists, and evidence of the existence or non-existence of the fact is admissible in the reviewing court…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Brereton J went on to consider the evidence in detail and concluded (at [42]) that the adjudicator had erred when he had found a contract to exist:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…on the material before the adjudicator, so analysed, the matters on which the adjudicator relied did not in fact support his conclusion that there was a construction contract between [the plaintiff] and [the second defendant], and the matters to which he did not refer pointed against it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Nothing in this part of Brereton J’s judgment indicates that he was prepared to quash the adjudicator’s decision on the basis merely that there was an arguable case that there was no construction contract between the parties. On the contrary: Brereton J held that it was his duty to inquire into objective questions of fact which were relevant to the question of the adjudicator’s jurisdiction and to make those findings of fact, one way or the other, for himself on the available evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Brereton J next considered the respondent’s alternative ground of challenge to the adjudicator’s decision, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the adjudicator had denied the respondent natural justice by communicating privately with one of the claimants. Brereton J accepted that there had been a denial of natural justice and turned to the question whether he should nevertheless exercise his residual discretion to allow the adjudication determination to stand notwithstanding that denial (at [53]). He declined to exercise that discretion because the defendants had failed to satisfy him that the breach of natural justice could not possibly have made a difference to the outcome (at [54]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[53]<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>The result of a denial of natural justice is that the decision is void, even if the decision would not have been affected by any submissions which might have been made had an opportunity to make them been afforded. While, as a matter of discretion, relief might be declined if it can be shown that the denial of natural justice could not possibly have made a difference to the outcome, all that a plaintiff need establish is that the denial of natural justice deprived it of the possibility of a better outcome, and in order to negate that possibility it is necessary to conclude that a properly conducted adjudication could not possibly have produced a different result…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[54]<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>As the <span class="font-italic font-underline">evidence and argument on the construction contract issue was at best </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">[finely] balanced</span>, and as the adjudicator was sufficiently concerned by the point to seek further information from Impero, <span class="font-italic">I cannot be satisfied that, had FPI been given an opportunity to respond, which they say they would have taken, their response could not possibly have made a difference</span>. Mr Bechara says that he would have referred to the subsequent variations in answer to Impero's reference to the detailed estimate of November 2003, and pointed out that the contract had been varied since that time.

</div> without citing [53]. Neither does counsel explain that at [54], Brereton J was considering a challenge based on a denial of natural justice rather than one based on a lack of jurisdiction.

</div>
</div> In that case, the claimant served two payment claims on the respondent. The respondent failed to provide a payment schedule (the analogue under the NSW Act of our payment response). Section 14(4) of the NSW Act therefore placed him under an immediate civil liability to pay the unpaid balance to the claimant. Section 15(2) of the NSW Act gave the claimant a choice between commencing action to recover the unpaid balance from the respondent as a debt and proceeding to have his claim adjudicated. However, s 15(4) of the NSW Act provided that if a claimant commenced an action in debt under s 15(2), a respondent who had failed to serve a payment schedule was not entitled in the civil proceedings to “raise any defence in relation to matters arising under the construction contract”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The claimant elected to commence action and secured a default judgment against the respondent. The respondent applied to set aside the default judgment on the grounds that he was not a party to a construction contract with the claimant. The question which arose was whether that defence was a “defence in relation to matters arising under the construction contract” within the meaning of s 15(4) of the NSW Act. The judge at first instance held that it was. He dismissed the respondent’s application, holding that the respondent was therefore precluded by s 15(4) of the NSW Act from advancing that defence. The defendant appealed against that decision to the New South Wales Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 McDougall J observed (at [21]) that the first instance judge did not find that the respondent’s defence had no prospects of success. The question then was whether s 15(4) of the NSW Act precluded the respondent from advancing that defence in the proceedings. McDougall J concluded (at [36]) that it did not. Accordingly, he found (at [37]) that the respondent had succeeded in showing that he had an arguable defence to the claim and was therefore entitled to be let in to defend it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It is unclear to me why defendant’s counsel submits that <span class="font-italic">Grave v </span><span class="font-italic">Blazevic</span> supports his position. I reproduce [65] – [68] of his submissions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65. An important point to note in this case is the fact that the Appeal Court noted that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“…[10] <span class="font-italic">The primary judge did not find, as a matter of fact, that the proposed defence was untenable. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[21] <span class="font-italic font-underline">I start by repeating that the primary judge did not conclude, as a matter of fact, that the proposed defence had no prospect of success</span><span class="font-italic">.

Importantly, the <span class="font-italic">Honorable</span><span class="font-italic"> McDougall J</span> then noted that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“[37] In my view, <span class="font-italic">the applicant succeeds on the substantive point – that there is an </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">arguable defence</span>.

First, the test of an “arguable defence” which featured in that case is simply the test which applies in New South Wales to ascertain whether a judgment entered against a defendant in ordinary civil proceedings by default ought to be set aside. It is not the formulation of a test which applies to a setting-aside application. Second, the outcome in that case turned entirely on the construction of the specific wording of the specific limb of s 15(4) of the NSW Act which was in play in that case. But I am not applying a statutory test at all in order to determine whether the defendant’s setting-aside application should succeed, let alone a test taken from the New South Wales statute.

</div>. In that case, a developer sought an injunction to restrain a sub-contractor from enforcing an adjudication determination. The adjudicator had found, contrary to the developer’s case, that there was a contract directly between the developer and the sub-contractor. The developer sought the injunction on the grounds that the sub-contractor had failed to place before the adjudicator two critical documents in which the sub-contractor had, contrary to its case in the adjudication, asserted that its contract was not with the developer but with the main contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 McDougall J found (at [5]) that it was “at least arguable that if [the two documents] had been put before [the adjudicator], he might have taken a different view as to whether or not the relevant construction contract was one between [the sub-contractor] and [the developer] or one between [the sub-contractor] and [the main contractor]”. McDougall J also found that the applicant’s understanding had been that these documents had in fact been placed before the adjudicator. He then held (at [7]) that “[i]n those circumstances, I think, there is a serious question to be tried as to whether there was in existence a construction contract, to which the Act applies, between [the developer] and [the defendant].” Further, he held (at [8]), that “it may be arguable that there was a substantial denial of procedural fairness if, as is [the developer’s] case, [it] was given to understand that the relevant documents were before the adjudicator whereas in fact they were not.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 McDougall J concluded as follows (at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, there is a strong case for arguing that there is “<span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span>” error, and, if it matters, there is also an arguable case, although the strength of the case depends on a disputed question of fact, that there has been some denial of procedural fairness. In those circumstances it is appropriate that enforcement of the adjudicator’s determination be restrained for the moment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 It suffices to say that <span class="font-italic">Filadelfia</span><span class="font-italic"> Projects</span> did not consider the test to be applied on an application to set aside an adjudicator’s determination. It was an application for an injunction. The test applied by McDougall J was accordingly the ordinary threshold test which applies whenever the court is asked to issue an interlocutory injunction: is there a serious question to be tried?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 But this is not the impression given by defendant’s counsel’s summary of <span class="font-italic">Filadelfia</span><span class="font-italic"> Projects</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75.

It would seem that the relevant issue is whether:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“…there is a <span class="font-italic font-underline">serious question to be tried</span> as to whether there was in existence a construction contract to which the act applies, between Filadelfia and Entirity…” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(emphasis added) </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77. What is immediately apparent from the case is that the <span class="font-italic">standard of proof </span>adopted by the Court in deciding this issue (which consequently affects whether or not to grant the injunctive relief sought) is whether or not “…<span class="font-italic">there is also an arguable case</span>…” on the matter, which would result in the enforcement of the adjudicator’s determination being restrained for the moment. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">78. In essence, in determining issues, the Court adopted a <span class="font-italic">standard of proof akin to that required under a summary judgment application</span>, i.e. whether there is “…<span class="font-italic font-underline">an arguable case</span>…”, and if so enforcement would then be restrained. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the defendant’s submissions] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I reject the defendant’s attempt to assimilate the well-established standard for granting an interlocutory injunction to the standard to be applied to a defendant on a setting-aside application under the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Accordingly I reject the defendant’s reliance on the New South Wales authorities in its entirety.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For the reasons I have given, I do not consider that the defendant can succeed in having the leave to enforce the adjudication determination set aside on his jurisdictional point if all that he is able to show is that there exists a real prospect of success that there was no novation, an arguable case that there was no novation, a possibility that the adjudicator could have reached a different outcome on novation, a triable issue on novation or a serious question to be tried on novation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In my view, the burden which rests on the defendant is the ordinary civil burden to establish his case on the balance of probabilities. To succeed on his jurisdictional challenge, therefore, the defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the defendant never agreed to novate his construction contract from D&amp;B to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 This must be the correct position, and for two reasons. First, after I dispose of the defendant’s setting-aside applications, there will be no future opportunity to consider at first instance whether the defendant’s jurisdictional challenge was validly brought. I must therefore decide that question – and, for that purpose, decide all underlying questions of law and fact – now, once and for all and with full finality, subject only to appeal. That is so even though whether the defendant agreed to novate his construction contract to the plaintiff is also a question which a court or arbitrator will have to determine when it inquires into the merits of the parties’ claims and defences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Second, requiring the defendant to prove a disputed question of fact to this high standard is entirely consistent with the underlying purpose of the Act. The purpose of the Act, and indeed of any adjudication regime, is to yield a determination which carries temporary finality so long as certain prerequisites are satisfied. That goal would be completely undermined if all that a respondent had to do to succeed in displacing temporary finality was anything other than to establish on the balance of probabilities each factual question underlying its case for setting aside. To the extent that this high burden on the defendant carries with it the risk of error, it is the considered policy of the Act to place that risk of error on the respondent, as the party making payment, rather than on the claimant, as the party receiving payment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Jurisdiction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I now turn to consider the issue of jurisdiction and the disputed question of fact underlying it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I emphasise the limited nature of the task which I am now about to undertake. I consider the question of novation for the limited purpose of deciding only whether the adjudicator’s determination should carry temporary finality as provided for by s 21 of the Act. Further, I consider the question of novation on the basis of affidavit evidence alone. In keeping with the spirit of s 21(3) of the Act, nothing which I decide on this issue will prevent the parties from arguing the question of novation afresh if it arises in the entirely separate context of the plaintiff seeking a determination on the merits of the parties’ actual underlying dispute with full finality, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> as to whether the defendant is, in fact and in law, contractually liable to pay the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The defendant’s case is that he never agreed to novate the construction contract to the plaintiff, whether orally or in writing. He relies on the undisputed fact that he never signed the draft novation agreement. The plaintiff concedes this last point, as it must. But it submits that the defendant orally agreed to a novation when Mr Tan proposed this between August and October 2013 (see [12] above)

I accept Mr Tan’s evidence that the defendant indicated to Mr Tan between August 2013 and November 2013 that he would agree to novating the construction contract to the plaintiff. In that light, I accept also Mr Tan’s explanation that the application form for the plaintiff to replace D&amp;B as the builder was submitted to the BCA before the novation because there would be no point in novating the construction contract from D&amp;B to the plaintiff unless the BCA had already approved the change of builder from D&amp;B to the plaintiff.

I do not find it credible that she signed the cheques without noting the name of the payee. These cheques were for large amounts ranging from about $170,000 to $360,000 and totalling nearly $1.5m. That is just under 30% of the total value of the construction contract. I do not accept, on the balance of probabilities, that Ms Nidhi signed these cheques without intending the cheque to benefit the plaintiff rather than D&amp;B.

But from 23 May 2014 onwards, all the documentation relating to claims for payment – the cover letters, the invoices, the progress claims and the breakdown of costs – consistently named the plaintiff as the contractor, as the entity providing the breakdowns of costs, as the entity invoicing the defendant and as the entity to whom the defendant should make payment.

The important point, however, is that it is the defendant who bears the burden of proving on the balance of probabilities his case in order to succeed in his setting-aside application. His case is that he <span class="font-italic">never</span> agreed to novate his contract with D&amp;B to the plaintiff. The defendant cannot discharge this burden merely by pointing out that the plaintiff’s case is inconsistent with the pattern of invoicing and payment between December 2013 and May 2014. If the evidence suggests that a novation did take place, but that it took place in April or May 2014 rather than in December 2013, the consequence remains that the defendant has failed to discharge his burden of proof. Even taking into account this evidence, therefore, I am wholly unable to conclude on the balance of probabilities that there was <span class="font-italic">never</span> a novation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 It is also true that the unique entity number of the contractor stated in all the documentation before progress claim 18 dated 31 January 2015 is consistently that of D&amp;B. Thus, the cover letter, the progress claim, the breakdowns of costs and the invoices all specified D&amp;B’s unique entity number even when the contractor named in that document was the plaintiff. To my mind, this is a small and insignificant point. The unique entity number has no contractual or factual significance. This fact is, in itself, far too slight to bear the entire weight of the defendant’s burden of proof on the novation issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Further objections by the defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I will now deal with the three final points on the issue of novation which the defendant raised. In my judgment, none of these have any merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The defendant argues that he refused to sign the draft novation agreement because he was not willing to hand over the redevelopment of his home to a company in which Mr Tan, who was recommended to the defendant by his estate agent, was not even a director.

On 18 March 2015, he granted the plaintiff a unilateral and retrospective extension of time for its submissions which its solicitors had filed after his deadline of 5.00 pm on 17 March 2015. But when the defendant requested an extension of time on 18 March 2015, the adjudicator rejected the defendant’s request and thereafter rejected the defendant’s submissions on the basis that they had been filed out of time.

After receiving the plaintiff’s submissions between 5.40 pm and 6.05 pm on 17 March 2015, the defendant had only “a few hours” to respond with his own submissions and comply with the adjudicator’s extended deadline of 5.00 pm on 18 March 2015, even though the plaintiff’s submissions contained “several factual inaccuracies” which in the defendant’s view required clarification.

The adjudicator’s remarks in his emails of 18 March 2015 and 20 March 2015 indicate that he had “more or less decided on the outcome of the adjudication before even hearing what [the defendant] had to say”. The adjudicator also issued his adjudication determination on 20 March 2015, seven days before the deadline of 27 March 2015 imposed upon him by the Act.

This aspect of the adjudication process tempers the content of the duty to comply with the principles of natural justice. This aspect of the process also carries with it the inevitable risk of achieving only “somewhat roughshod” justice (<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel </span>at [22]).

I say that for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 First, the defendant does not challenge the adjudicator’s initial direction given on 15 March 2015 requiring the parties to submit their “replies, rebuttals or additional information” with regard to “both the Adjudication Application dated 5 March 2015 and the adjudication response dated 13 March 2015” by 5.00 pm on 17 March 2015. The significant point to note is that this initial direction was for both parties to put in their primary submissions together, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> not sequentially. What this direction extended to the parties, therefore, was an opportunity for each party to set out in these primary submissions its own case and to respond to the other party’s case, but only to the extent that the other party’s case was then known. This direction did not extend to the parties an opportunity to make <span class="font-italic">reply</span> submissions, responding to the other party’s <span class="font-italic">primary</span> submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 One of the defendant’s complaints to the adjudicator was that the plaintiff took the opportunity in its submissions to respond to the defendant’s adjudication response. But that is precisely what the adjudicator’s email of 15 March 2015 invited the plaintiff to do (see [29] above). That the plaintiff would do so was therefore clearly foreseeable on 15 March 2015 itself. If the defendant objected to the plaintiff being given an opportunity to respond to the defendant’s adjudication response, or wanted an opportunity to make reply submissions or otherwise to have the last word, it was for the defendant’s solicitors to raise that with the adjudicator as soon as he issued his directions on 15 March 2015. At the very least, the defendant’s solicitors should have foreshadowed then to the adjudicator that the defendant reserved his right to seek an opportunity to respond to the plaintiff’s submissions after having seen them. They did none of these things. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Second, the defendant allowed the adjudicators’ deadline of 5.00 pm on 17 March 2015 to expire without putting in any primary submissions at all. The defendant was therefore content to let the adjudicator arrive at a determination with no primary submissions from the defendant. The defendant thus implicitly invited the adjudicator to proceed on the basis of the material before him as at 5.00 pm on 17 March 2015, including any primary submissions which the plaintiff chose to put in. The defendant extended that implicit invitation knowing that the plaintiff could well use its primary submissions to rebut the defendant’s case as set out in the adjudication response.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Third, it is true that the plaintiff put in its primary submissions an hour after the adjudicator’s deadline. But, apart from suggesting it is evidence of bias, the defendant does not allege that the adjudicator breached his duty to comply with the principles of natural justice merely by accepting these submissions from the plaintiff out of time. In any event, the adjudicator did not accept these submissions out of time without more. Of his own initiative, he extended the time for both parties to put in their primary submissions until 5.00 pm on 18 March 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 One effect of this extension of time was to cure, unilaterally and retrospectively, the plaintiff’s non-compliance with the adjudicator’s directions of 15 March 2015. But another effect was to give the defendant a second opportunity to put in his primary submissions, even though he had been content to let the previous opportunity pass him by the previous day and even though he now had the plaintiff’s submissions in hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The defendant’s real complaint is not that the deadline so extended was insufficient time for the defendant to put in <span class="font-italic">primary</span> submissions. The defendant’s complaint is that the extended deadline was insufficient time for him to file <span class="font-italic">reply</span> submissions.

</div> This is apparent from his solicitors’ letter to the adjudicator asking expressly for a chance to <span class="font-italic">reply</span>. But the fact remains that the defendant did not seek and had never sought an opportunity to reply at any point before the morning of 18 March 2015. That is so even though it is always in theory foreseeable, when submissions are not exchanged sequentially, that an opposing party’s primary submissions may raise issues calling for a reply.

Once again, it was well within the adjudicator’s discretion to decline to extend to the defendant that indulgence without breaching his duty to comply with the principles of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 To put it another way, the principles of natural justice impose a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> obligation on an adjudicator to give both parties a reasonable opportunity to be heard before determining the adjudication. The content of this obligation is, of course, tempered by the fundamental objective of adjudication, by its expedited and abbreviated nature and by the circumstances of any particular case. Assuming in favour of the defendant that the content of the adjudicator’s duty to comply with the principles of natural justice on the facts of this case required him to give the defendant an opportunity to be heard before issuing a determination, the adjudicator gave the defendant that opportunity by his direction given on 15 March 2015 and again on 18 March 2015. I find that that opportunity was entirely reasonable. Making every assumption in the defendant’s favour, the adjudicator’s duty to comply with the principles of natural justice went no further than that. But the defendant did not take up either of those opportunities. Instead, having eschewed those opportunities, he tried to insist on a right of reply. The principles of natural justice, at least as they operated in the circumstances of this case, did not oblige the adjudicator to give the defendant a right of reply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 It was unfortunate that the defendant’s lawyers were engaged in a trial until 5.00 pm on 18 March 2015. But the defendant had voluntarily given up his right to make primary submissions on 17 March 2015 and had no right of reply. The unavailability of the defendant’s solicitors is not a ground on which I can find the adjudicator’s directions to be in breach of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Acting in a timely manner and avoiding unnecessary expense</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Even if the defendant’s request of 18 March 2015 is not characterised as seeking an indulgence, I still cannot find the adjudicator to have breached his duty to comply with the principles of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Pursuant to ss 16(3)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">a)</span> and <span class="font-italic">(b)</span> of the Act, the adjudicator is required to act in a timely manner and to avoid incurring unnecessary expense. These are both legitimate considerations for an adjudicator to take into account when considering the content of his duty to comply with the principles of natural justice. The plaintiff submits that these considerations of procedural efficiency and economy were within the contemplation of the adjudicator in his conduct of the proceedings.

</div>
</div> I agree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The adjudicator consistently took the view, not unreasonably in my view, that the adjudication before him was not complex and did not warrant lengthy and detailed primary submissions. In his email of 18 March 2015 at 10.58 am extending time until 5.00 pm that day, he expressly directed the parties to “focus on the key points of dispute, keep it brief and adhere strictly to [the] deadline”. In his email of 18 March 2015 at 2.19 pm rejecting the defendant’s request for a further extension to 23 March 2015, he again explained that “[t]he points of dispute are quite clear and requires (sic) only brief rebuttals. It is not necessary to prolong this adjudication. No response by the deadline is also acceptable.” At [13] of his determination, the adjudicator reiterated that he had rejected the defendant’s request for a longer extension to avoid “prolong[ing] the adjudication process as the points of arguments from both parties [were] clear and adequate for [his] determination.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Having applied his mind to the degree of complexity of the adjudication before him, and bearing in mind the Act’s objective of speedy resolution of claims in adjudication, the adjudicator was not minded to grant a longer extension of time to permit the defendant to put in his submissions. I can see no basis on which to say that the adjudicator thereby breached his duty to comply with the principles of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rejecting the defendant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In his email of 20 March 2015, the adjudicator gave two reasons for rejecting the submissions tendered by the defendant in the evening of 19 March 2015. First, the defendant’s solicitors had tendered the submissions after the extended deadline of 5.00 pm on 18 March 2015. Second, the submissions were “not as brief as directed but lengthy which contained a total of 164 pages”. The adjudicator proceeded with his determination as the disputed points were clear and he did not wish to prolong the process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 As I have mentioned, parties have a statutory obligation under s 16(6) of the Act to comply with procedural directions given by an adjudicator. The adjudicator found that the defendant was in breach of his directions. I find that the adjudicator’s grounds for rejecting the defendant’s submissions were reasonable. The defendant only has himself to blame for failing to comply with the clearly articulated instructions on the timeliness and length of the submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The defendant submits that his “new set of submissions was important because they highlighted the factual inaccuracies in [the plaintiff’s] further submissions and dealt with other important issues which impacted the adjudicator’s decision”.

</div> I reject this submission. In <span class="font-italic">RN &amp; Associates Pte Ltd v TPX Builders Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2013] 1 SLR 848, the plaintiff submitted that the adjudicator had breached the principles of natural justice when he rejected certain supplementary bundles tendered by the plaintiff after the deadline for filing an adjudication response. The plaintiff argued that the rule of <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem </span>was infringed as the supplementary bundles were an essential part of its case and their exclusion meant that the plaintiff was denied the opportunity to be fully heard. Andrew Ang J dismissed the plaintiff’s application to set aside the determination. I agree entirely with Ang J’s observations (at [64]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The right to have one’s case heard is not a right to have an adjudicator consider all material which the parties think are relevant. The adjudicator may make a decision on what considerations are relevant. The concept of <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem </span>is an open-textured one which “depends on the character of the decision-making body, the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or other framework in which it operates”: <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Bridge of Harwich in <span class="font-italic">Lloyd v McMahon </span>[1987] AC 625 at 702. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 As pointed out by Andrew Ang J, it is open to an adjudicator to decide what material or considerations are relevant and important for his decision.

The plaintiff put in its submissions, albeit late. The adjudicator accepted those submissions, even though they were late, by retrospectively extending the deadline for <span class="font-italic">both parties’</span> primary submissions to 5.00 pm on 18 March 2015. If the defendant had filed concise primary submissions, had had done so within the extended deadline, the adjudicator would have been obliged to accept them. But the defendant instead chose to file lengthy submissions, by way of reply, and did so out of time. The adjudicator was under no obligation to accept them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 An allegation of bias is a serious one and should not be made lightly.

</div> It is true that he issued his adjudication seven days before the statutory deadline. The suggestion, however, that issuing a determination early is a fact from which alone it can be inferred that the adjudicator has breached his duty to comply with the principles of natural justice is meritless. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The adjudicator was fully entitled – and indeed obliged by statute – to act expeditiously and economically. While the Act fixed a deadline for his determination, he cannot be criticised merely for completing his work before the deadline. He can similarly not be criticised merely for setting a timeline which sets the stage for him to complete his work before the deadline. It would undermine the objectives of the Act to criticise an adjudicator merely for taking either approach. What is important is that the adjudicator complies with the principles of natural justice and applies his mind to the parties’ dispute. I am satisfied from a reading of the adjudication determination that the adjudicator understood the dispute and came to a reasoned conclusion on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In making this finding, I make no finding on the merits of the parties’ underlying dispute as they placed it before the adjudicator or as they may in the future place it before a court or an arbitrator. I simply observe that there is nothing to support the defendant’s suggestion that the adjudicator “did not adequately apply his mind to the case”.

I cannot find in the Act any hint of a legislative purpose to invalidate every adjudication determination in which there has been a breach of the principles of natural justice, no matter how trivial or serious and regardless of whether that breach has caused the respondent prejudice.
