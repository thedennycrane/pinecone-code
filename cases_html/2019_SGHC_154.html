</div> (together, “the SHA”) governed the rights and obligations of Wellness and its shareholders. Sunbreeze and EQ Capital became parties to the SHA by way of accession. The directors of Wellness were Manoj, Kanchan and Dr Finian Tan Seng Chin (“Dr Finian Tan”). Dr Finian Tan represented the Vickers Funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 By an employment agreement dated 12 October 2007, Manoj was employed by Wellness as the chief executive officer (“CEO”) for a period of five years (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, until 12 October 2012). Under this agreement, Manoj’s remuneration was to be determined in accordance with the SHA. Manoj tendered his resignation as CEO on 14 August 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Wellness had been established for the purposes of wholesale and/or retail of lifestyle and/or wellness related products. However, it appeared that its only substantial asset was its shareholding in TWG Tea Company Pte Ltd (“TWG Tea”) which Manoj had incorporated in 2007. In early 2011, Manoj started discussions with OSIM International Ltd (“OSIM”) in relation to an investment by OSIM into TWG Tea. At that time, the shareholders of TWG Teawere Wellness and Paris Investment Pte Ltd (“Paris”). Paris was then owned by Mr Taha Bou Qdib (“Taha”) and two employees of TWG Tea. Taha was the former CEO of Wellness’ tea division which was subsequently corporatized and became TWG Tea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 During the negotiations with OSIM, Manoj presented profit projections which showed that TWG Tea would achieve profit before tax and minority interests (“PBT”) of S$29m for the financial year ending on 31 March 2013 (“FY2013”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated 18 March 2011 (“the OSIM SPA”), OSIM International Limited (“OSIM”) became a 35% shareholder of TWG Tea. After the sale to OSIM, Wellness’ and Paris’ shareholdings in TWG Tea were 54.7% and 10.3% respectively. Mr Ron Sim Chye Hock (“Ron Sim”) was the CEO of OSIM. He was also the principal of EQ Capital.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Clause 4.5 of the OSIM SPA (“the Profit Swing Clause”) provided for the combined shareholding of Wellness and Paris to be diluted (by up to 10% of TWG Tea shares) in favour of OSIM if TWG Tea’s audited PBT for FY2013 fell below S$17m, or for the shareholding of OSIM to be diluted (by up to 10% of TWG Tea shares) in favour of Wellness and Paris if the audited PBT for FY 2013 exceeded S$27m. The Profit Swing Clause was based broadly on the profit projections presented by Manoj.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 TWG Tea’s audited PBT for FY2013, which was signed off by its auditors on 11 June 2013, was just above S$5m. Pursuant to the Profit Swing Clause, the combined shareholding of Wellness and Paris in TWG Tea was diluted by 10% in favour of OSIM. The dilution reduced Wellness’ shareholding in TWG Tea from 54.7% to 46.3%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 18 October 2013, OSIM purchased all the shares in Paris. The shareholding structure of TWG Tea then became as follows: OSIM and Paris (53.7%) and Wellness (46.3%).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In November 2013, TWG Tea proposed a rights issue to raise capital (“the Rights Issue”). Wellness did not subscribe to the Rights Issue. Consequently, OSIM and Paris together subscribed for the entire Rights Issue and the combined shareholding of OSIM and Paris in TWG Tea increased from 53.7% to 69.9% while Wellness’ shareholding was diluted further from 46.3% to 30.1%. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Suit No 187 of 2014</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In February 2014, Wellness and Manoj commenced Suit No 187 of 2014 against OSIM, Paris and the directors of TWG Tea (“Suit 187”). Wellness’ claim was for minority oppression, conspiracy to injure and breach of contract whilst Manoj’s claim was for conspiracy to injure. Among other things, Wellness and Manoj alleged that OSIM, Ron Sim and the directors of OSIM, Paris and TWG Tea acted wrongfully to enable OSIM to take control of TWG Tea through the following acts, among others:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) OSIM’s exercise of its rights under the Profit Swing Clause to obtain an additional 10% of TWG Tea shares from Wellness and Paris; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ron Sim’s proposal and OSIM’s and Paris’ approval of the TWG Tea Rights Issue, which was, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, not for commercial reasons and intended to dilute Wellness’ shareholding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 22 April 2016, I dismissed the claims in Suit 187 – see <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group Pte Ltd and another v OSIM International Ltd and others</span> [2016] 3 SLR 729. Among other things, I found as follows (at [95], [107] and [200]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) OSIM did not cause TWG Tea’s failure to meet the performance target in the Profit Swing Clause and OSIM was entitled to exercise its rights under that clause. TWG Tea failed to achieve its project profit target for FY2013 because the profit projections presented by Manoj were (as Manoj knew) unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Rights Issue was undertaken <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and for good commercial reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Wellness’ appeal in Civil Appeal No 64 of 2016 (“CA 64”) was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 25 October 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Suit No 545 of 2014</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Suit No 545 of 2014 (“Suit 545”) was a separate defamation action by Wellness and Manoj against OSIM and its directors (including Ron Sim). Suit 545 was heard before me together with Suit 187. I dismissed Suit 545 on the ground that the offending words which formed the subject-matter of the claim, were clearly not defamatory and that even if they were, the defendants would have succeeded on their defences of qualified privilege and justification. Wellness and Manoj did not appeal against the dismissal of Suit 545. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Winding up under ss 254(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">f</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) and 254(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">i</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Under ss 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The Court may order the winding up if ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the members as a whole, or in any other manner whatever which appears to be unfair or unjust to other members;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) the Court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company be wound up;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The law was not in dispute.

</div> In my view, Manoj’s attempt to rely on the Board resolution was wholly unmeritorious. Dr Finian Tan signed the Board resolution in the context of discussions with Manoj about obtaining legal advice on the issue of the excessive dividends. Although the Board resolution was worded in broader terms, clearly, it was no excuse for Manoj’s action in commencing Suit 187 and Suit 545 without consulting Dr Finian Tan who was at all material times a director of Wellness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dilution caused by the Profit Swing Clause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As stated earlier, TWG Tea’s audited PBT for FY2013 was just above S$5m. This allowed OSIM to exercise its rights under the Profit Swing Clause which in turn resulted in Wellness’ shareholding in TWG Tea being diluted from 54.7% to 46.3%. In Suit 187, I had found that Manoj had no reasonable basis for believing that TWG Tea could achieve the original projected profits of S$29m for FY2013. Manoj had recklessly disregarded the many warnings by his own finance executive that the projections were unreliable, in his bid to obtain a loan from OSIM for TWG Tea as well as to cash out his investment in TWG Tea by selling part of Wellness’ holdings in TWG Tea to OSIM (see the Suit 187 judgment, at [95]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dilution in connection with the Rights Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As stated earlier, Wellness did not subscribe to the Rights Issue and this resulted in Wellness’ shareholding being diluted further from 46.3% to 30.1%. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The excess dividends that had been distributed (see [33] above) amounted to S$10.997,730.49 and would have provided Wellness with a very substantial part of the S$11.59m that was needed to subscribe to the Rights Issue and thereby prevent the further dilution of its shareholding in TWG Tea. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In his email dated 10 December 2013 to Manoj, Dr Finian Tan said that the Vickers Funds were willing to return the excess dividends received by them and noted that the other shareholders may be obliged to do so.

</div> Sunbreeze had received 80.62% of the excess dividends. Dr Finian Tan also pointed out that the return of the excess dividends would provide Wellness the funds to “mitigate the dilution or even prevent it” if Wellness could raise more capital to take up its full allocation under the Rights Issue. Manoj ignored Dr Finian Tan’s email and did not take any steps to resolve the issue of the excess dividends. Instead, in February 2014, Manoj and Wellness commenced Suit 187. Manoj also ignored the Vickers Funds’ and EQ Capital’s requests

Neither did he inform Dr Finian Tan that he was making the offers to OSIM and Paris. Manoj asserted that the Vickers Funds had given their “unequivocal consent” to Wellness selling its shares in TWG Tea because Dr Finian Tan had “repeatedly expressed the view that it would be in the interests of [Wellness] as well as that of [the Vickers Funds] and Sunbreeze” for Wellness to sell its stake TWG Tea.

</div>
</div> I found no merit in Manoj’s assertion. Dr Finian Tan did raise the idea of Wellness selling its stake in TWG Tea in his correspondence with Manoj over several unresolved issues. However, this fell far short of constituting consent for the <span class="font-italic">specific </span>offers that Manoj subsequently made to OSIM and Paris. The Vickers Funds could hardly be said to have consented to the terms of those offers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Sunbreeze submitted that it was normal to reach agreement on the sale before seeking the requisite shareholders’ approval. However, as EQ Capital pointed out, there was nothing in the either of the offers from Manoj that indicated that any sale of Wellness’ shares in TWG Tea pursuant to the offers, were subject to the approval of Wellness’ shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I agreed with EQ Capital that Kanchan was also responsible for what Manoj and Sunbreeze wrongfully did or failed to do because she allowed Manoj to do as he wished, did nothing to stop him, and went along with and endorsed his improper actions and omissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I also agreed with EQ Capital that Manoj, Kanchan and Sunbreeze had treated Wellness as if the company belonged to them alone, and Wellness’ funds as their own piggy bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my view, it was clear from the above that Manoj and Kanchan had conducted Wellness’ affairs in their own interests rather than in the interests of the members as a whole, or in a manner which was unfair or unjust to EQ Capital, within the meaning of s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Companies Act. It was also clear that there was a lack of probity in Manoj’s and Kanchan’s conduct of Wellness’ affairs, and that their conduct was grossly unfair to EQ Capital within the meaning of s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>). Having obtained EQ Capital’s investment into Wellness, Manoj and Kanchan proceeded to manage Wellness without any regard for EQ Capital’s interests as a shareholder of Wellness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether EQ Capital was able to exit from Wellness on fair terms</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Sunbreeze’s and Wellness’ main argument was that a winding up order should not be made because, according to them, EQ Capital was able to exit from Wellness on fair terms.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The presence of a buy-out mechanism in the company’s constitution would be a vital consideration when examining whether it was just and equitable to order a winding up. In the usual case, an applicant who had not even attempted to invoke the share buy-out mechanism would be unlikely to establish the “unfairness” necessary to invoke the court’s just and equitable jurisdiction to wind up a company: see <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> at [56]. This is because a buy-out or exit mechanism can negate any unfairness found to have satisfied s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>): <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma</span> at [76].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The failure to invoke a buy-out or exit mechanism would not be a bar to a winding up order under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) if the exit mechanism would not provide the aggrieved shareholder an exit at fair value. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> gave some examples (at [56]), including where the shareholders had conducted the company’s affairs in bad faith or improperly or where the valuation mechanism was arbitrary or artificial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Another example where an exit mechanism would not provide an exit at fair value would be if it was unlikely that a fair and proper valuation of the company could be done without a thorough investigation into the company’s financial records and activities by a liquidator: <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma </span>at [79]–[80]. In such a case, it would be just and equitable to wind up the company: <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma</span> at [81]. I disagreed with Wellness’ submission that the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma </span>was not clear. It seemed to me that the reasoning was both logical and clear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The winding up application in <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>was based on s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>). The present application was based on both ss 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>). EQ Capital argued its case on the basis that the principle in <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>was applicable to both grounds. It seemed to me that in principle, that was correct. Clearly, there is overlap between ss 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>),<span class="font-italic"> </span>the latter being broader in scope. In any event, as will be seen below, in my view, the buy-out mechanism in the present case would not have given EQ Capital an exit at fair value.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Exit mechanism under the Articles of Association</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the present case, Wellness’ Articles of Association provided a buy-out mechanism similar to that which was available in <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span>.

However, I agreed with EQ Capital that, on the facts of the present case, a winding up order was still appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my view, on the facts of the present case, the buy-out mechanism under Wellness’ Articles of Association did not allow EQ Capital to exit the company at fair value. The facts of this case clearly called for a thorough investigation into the company’s financial records and activities which only an independent liquidator could achieve. It was true that Wellness’ main value was in its shareholding in TWG Tea. However, the valuation of Wellness could not end with just a valuation of TWG Tea. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The financial affairs of Wellness were in a real mess. There were no audited accounts for FY2011 or later and even the accounts for FY2009 and FY2010 were qualified.

The auditor would be acting as an expert for purposes of certifying the fair value of the shares; he was not an arbitrator or judge. He would have no power to decide whether any party should be held liable for legal wrongs. In this case, this limitation was made even clearer by Article 48 of Wellness’ Articles of Association, which embodied the parties’ agreement that in certifying the fair value, “the auditor shall be considered to be acting as an expect [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and not as an arbitrator”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Wellness, Manoj and Kanchan offered the following undertakings to “aid the auditor … to ascertain Wellness’ true financial position”:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Wellness offered to undertake to the Court to permit the auditor to inspect all the books and papers of Wellness in its possession, custody or control that may be requested by the auditor.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Manoj and Kanchan offered to undertake to the Court to</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) permit the auditor to inspect all the books and papers of Wellness or relating to Wellness in their possession, custody or control that may be requested by the auditor; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) consent to be examined by the auditor on oath to give information concerning the promotion, formation, trade dealings, affairs or property of Wellness, such examination to be held before a Judge in Chambers if the Court so directs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, these undertakings did not address the concerns that I had. First, given the circumstances of the present case where, as I have found, Manoj had treated the company and its funds as his own, it was important that an independent party took custody and control of the company’s property. A liquidator could do this under s 269(1) of the Companies Act; the auditor appointed to value the company could not. In my view, it was not appropriate to let Manoj and Kanchan remain in control of Wellness. It was important that a liquidator took control of the company.

In that case, the court refused to stay a winding up order. Plowman J reasoned (at 592G–593A) that if a stay was granted and the appeal against the winding up order failed, the delay would very seriously hamper the liquidator’s ability to ascertain (a) the assets of the company as at the date of the winding up order and the date of the application, and (b) the liabilities of the company as at the date of the winding up order. In contrast, assuming a stay was not granted, a profitable business could be carried on and the refusal of a stay would have caused no additional harm (at 593A–B).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the present case, Wellness was a holding company with no business operations. I agreed with EQ Capital that there was a need for the liquidators to step in.

Otherwise, the shares might be sold by the liquidators under distress sale conditions and a successful appeal would be rendered nugatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I therefore refused a stay of the winding up order generally but granted a limited stay against a sale of Wellness’ shares in TWG Tea pending appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Davinder Singh SC, Jaikanth Shankar, Srruthi Ilankathir, Hanspreet Singh Sachdev, Rajvinder Singh Chahal and Avinesh Selvarajah (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Toby Landau QC and Calvin Liang (instructed), Chua Sui Tong, Liew Yik Wee and Wong Wan Chee (Rev Law LLC) for the defendant;<br/>Alvin Yeo SC, Koh Swee Yen, Lin Chunlong and Jasmine Low (WongPartnership LLP) for the 1st Non-Party.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
