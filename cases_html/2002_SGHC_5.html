<strong>Judgment</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font>Introduction

<p></p></b></i>1.        Tapematic SpA

(‘Tapematic’) is the Plaintiff in this action.<i xmlns=""><b>
<p></p></b></i>2.        It was alleged that in late 1999

and early 2000 one Umar Zen, who is the Second Defendant, had approached Tapematic to

propose two deals concerning the sale of optical equipment to some Indonesian buyers.

Subsequently, two contracts for the sale of optical equipment by Tapematic to the

Indonesian buyers known by the acronym ‘KBEI’ were entered into.

<p xmlns="">3.        It was agreed that payment would be made

by way of letters of credit. Tapematic alleged that they told Umar Zen that they would not

accept letters of credit issued by Indonesian banks.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.        Arrangements were then made by Umar Zen

for two letters of credit to be issued by Standard Chartered Bank (‘SCB’) in

favour of Tapematic.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.        The applicant for the letters of credit

was the First Defendant Wirana Pte Ltd (‘Wirana’).</p>
<p xmlns="">6.        The letters of credit required original

cargo receipts issued and signed by an authorised signatory of Wirana stating that the

goods were received in good order to be presented.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.        Tapematic alleged that Umar Zen had

represented to it that one Raj Kumar Singh was an authorised signatory of Wirana.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.        Subsequently, Tapematic received two cargo

receipts on a letterhead with the name ‘Wirana Pte Ltd’ and signed by one Raj

Kumar Singh. Tapematic then tendered the cargo receipts to SCB for payment.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.        However SCB then sent two advices of

refusal to Tapematic informing it that the cargo receipts were rejected on the basis,

inter alia, that the cargo receipts were not signed by an authorised signatory of Wirana

and Wirana had refused to waive the discrepancy.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.        Although Tapematic managed to get the

equipment shipped back from Indonesia to Italy, it alleged it suffered some financial

loss.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.        Tapematic then commenced action against

Wirana, as First Defendant, and Umar Zen, as Second Defendant.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.        The claim against Wirana was based on

misrepresentation i.e that Umar Zen had misrepresented to Tapematic that Raj Kumar Singh

was authorised to sign the cargo receipts and that Umar Zen was an agent of Wirana.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.        Wirana denied that it had authorised Umar

Zen to act on its behalf. It also denied that Raj Kumar Singh was an authorised signatory.

It alleged that no one by such a name was in its employ and it had no knowledge of such a

person. Also, the cargo receipts were not made on its stationery or letterhead.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.        Umar Zen denied that he had represented

to Tapematic that Raj Kumar Singh was an authorised signatory of Wirana.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.        He also alleged that he had dealt with

Wirana through an intermediary, one Ramdas Nair, and left the matter pertaining to the

signing of the receipts to Ramdas Nair and Wirana. He too claimed that he had no knowledge

of Raj Kumar Singh.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.        Wirana applied to strike out certain

paragraphs or parts of paragraphs of the Amended Statement of Claim against it in so far

as they alleged that Umar Zen was acting as agent or on behalf of Wirana or that Wirana

had made any false representation arising from what Umar Zen had allegedly represented to

Tapematic.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.        The grounds of the application were that

the paragraphs or parts thereof disclosed no reasonable cause of action, were scandalous,

frivolous and/or vexations, may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of this

action and/or were otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.        On 25 July 2001, SAR Tan Boon Heng

granted Wirana’s application.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.        Tapematic appealed against that decision

and on 20 November 2001, I dismissed its appeal with costs.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.        Tapematic has appealed against my

decision to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><em><strong><br/>

Paragraph 31 of the Amended Statement of Claim</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">21.        The thrust of Tapematic’s claim

against Wirana was that Umar Zen had the authority, actual or apparent, of Wirana to act

in all matters in relation to the letters of credit. Paragraph 31 of the Amended Statement

of Claim contained the Particulars of this assertions. It states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘31. At all material times the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had the

    authority, actual or apparent, of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to act in all matters in

    relation to the letters of credit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol xmlns="">
<p align="center"><u>PARTICULARS</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had informed the

    Plaintiff in or around the months of January and February 2000 that he had arranged for

    the <strike>1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to apply for the </strike>issuance of the 1<sup>st</sup>

    and 2<sup>nd</sup> letters of credit by Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    The 1<sup>st</sup> letter of credit was applied

    for by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on or about 8 December 1999 and subsequently issued by

    Standard Chartered Bank on 9 December 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    The 2<sup>nd</sup> letter of credit was applied

    for by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on or about 28 January 2000 and subsequently issued by

    Standard Chartered Bank on 1 February 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">(d)    After the preliminary cargo receipts were signed

    by Mr. Pritam Singh from KBEI and then transmitted to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant via

    facsimile, the Plaintiffs requested the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to procure the 1<sup>st</sup>

    Defendant to issue to the Plaintiffs the Wirana cargo receipts signed by its authorized

    signatory Mr. Raj Kumar Singh. On 24 February 2000 the Plaintiffs received the 2 Wirana

    cargo receipts both dated 11 February 2000 and signed by Mr. Raj Kumar Singh.’</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><em><strong><br/>

Contentions for Wirana</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">22.        Mr Toh Kian Sing, counsel for Wirana,

submitted that for there to be actual authority, there must be a consensual agreement

between the principal and agent. He cited Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency, Sixteenth

Edition 1996, at p 103 to 104.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.        He submitted that just because Umar Zen

had told Tapematic that letters of credit would be issued in its favour and this was done

on the application of Wirana, it did not make Umar Zen the agent of Wirana.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.        As for the cargo receipts, Mr Toh

submitted that Tapematic were unable to say that these documents were received from

Wirana. Furthermore, the documents were received after the alleged representation about

Raj Kumar Singh on 11 February 2000.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.        As for apparent authority, Mr Toh

submitted that it was established law that there must be a representation from the

principal to the third party that the agent had authority to do what he did. There is no

concept of a self-authorising agent.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.        For this proposition, Mr Toh cited: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    <i>Freeman &amp; Lockyer v Buckhurst Park

    Properties</i> [1964] 2 QB 480</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    <i>Tribune Investment Trust v Soosan Trading </i>[2000]     3 SLR 405, which approved <i>The Ocean Frost, Armagas Ltd v Mundogas SA </i>[1986] 1 AC

    717.</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">27.        The act of applying for letters of credit

could not be considered as a representation by Wirana that Umar Zen was its agent to make

representations about Wirana’s authorised signatory. Also, the letters of credit

themselves did not mention Umar Zen.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.        Mr Toh also submitted that the parties

had gone through discovery and interrogatories and yet Tapematic were in no better

position than when its Statement of Claim was filed.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.        He relied on the judgment of Justice Lai

Siu Chiu in <i>Thomas &amp; Betts (S.E. Asia) Pte Ltd v Ou Tin Joon &amp; Anor</i>

(Unreported, 27 February 1998) where the judge said at paragraphs 22 to 24: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘22.    …. The particulars given by the

    plaintiffs were at best vague and sweeping. It seemed to me that the plaintiffs were

    merely trying to frame their claim in the widest possible terms without the requisite

    particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">23.    It is a clear rule of pleading that ‘every

    pleading must contain the necessary particulars of any claim’ (O 18 r 12(1) of the

    RSC). In the absence of providing adequate particulars, and in the absence of any

    explanation as to why these particulars were inadequate, I was constrained in finding that

    there were insufficient facts in the pleadings to support the cause of action. <u>I did

    not think it fair that a plaintiff should be allowed to allege first, and then through the

    process of discovery or interrogatories, hope to substantiate those allegations later -

    that would be tantamount to ‘fishing’</u> which any court would vigilantly guard

    against in balancing the interests and rights of the parties concerned.</p>
<p align="justify">24.    Consequently, on the face of the pleadings, I

    concluded that no reasonable cause of action was disclosed. Alternatively, it would at

    least be open to argument that the pleadings were so speculative, harassing, oppressive

    and uncertain that striking out could also have been justified on the basis that this

    constituted an abuse of process of court. I accordingly struck out the cause of action

    based on the implied term.’</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">30.        Mr Toh submitted that the present case

was a stronger one for striking out because in <i>Thomas &amp; Betts</i>, discovery and

interrogatories had not yet been completed.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.        He also submitted that the further and

better particulars supplied by Tapematic did not advance its case on agency.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.        Mr Toh further submitted that

Tapematic’s assertion about Umar Zen amounted to an alleged agent, Umar Zen, making a

representation of another agent’s, Raj Kumar Singh’s, authority. Tapematic could

not validly make such an assertion unless Umar Zen had actual authority to do so which he

did not. Mr Toh cited <i>British Bank of the Middle East v Sun Life Assurance Co of Canada

</i>[1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 9 for this proposition.</p>
<p xmlns="">33.        As for the cargo receipts,

Tapematic’s case was based on the premise that these were forgeries. Therefore it

could not rely on these same documents to establish agency.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.        As for an argument that Wirana’s

application to strike out was made late in the day, Mr Toh submitted that when

Wirana’s application was filed, the affidavits of evidence-in-chief had not yet been

exchanged.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.        Furthermore, the application was filed

after discovery and interrogatories. If it had been filed earlier, it would have been met

with the argument that discovery and interrogatories were pending.</p>
<p xmlns="">36.        As for yet another request by

Tapematic’s solicitors for further discovery, this was dated 24 July 2001 and made

after the application to strike out had been filed. It was sent to Mr Toh’s firm on

the eve of the hearing of the application to strike out. Mr Toh was suggesting that it was

not a bona fide request for further discovery.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>
<em><strong>Tapematic’s contentions</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">37.        Mr Ashok Kumar, counsel for Tapematic,

submitted that both Wirana and Umar Zen were asserting that they had no knowledge of Raj

Kumar Singh. Both also denied sending the cargo receipts to Tapematic.</p>
<p xmlns="">38.        Furthermore, Wirana was saying that it

had dealt with Ramdas Nair, not Umar Zen, and Ramdas Nair had said he was an agent of

Wirana. However, Ramdas Nair also claimed he did not know Raj Kumar Singh.</p>
<p xmlns="">39.        As regards actual authority, he submitted

that Umar Zen had informed Tapematic that the letters of credit would be issued and they

were indeed issued. These were issued upon the application of Wirana. When Tapematic

reminded Umar Zen about the cargo receipts, two cargo receipts carrying the Wirana

letterhead and signed by Raj Kumar Singh were sent to Tapematic.</p>
<p xmlns="">40.        Mr Kumar also submitted that the issue of

actual authority should be resolved at a proper trial.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.        As for apparent authority, Mr Kumar did

not dispute that there is no concept of a self-authorising agent. However, there could

very well be a holding out or representation of the authority of Umar Zen by conduct.</p>
<p xmlns="">42.        He put his argument this way: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘43.    This "holding out" by way of

    conduct on the part of Wirana is supported by the particulars in paragraph 31 of the ASOC.

    Wirana has put Umar Zen in a position where he appears to be authorized to make the

    representations; to put it another way, Wirana has acquiesced or permitted Umar Zen to

    negotiate or liase with the Plaintiff on all matters in relation to the letters of credit,

    which would include of course the identity of the authorised signatory of Wirana for the

    cargo receipts.</p>
<p align="justify">44.    The two LCs were applied for by Wirana after Umar

    Zen had assured the Plaintiffs that he would make all necessary arrangements. This is not

    denied by Wirana who has admitted on oath that they applied for the LCs for a commission.

    Negotiations on the draft terms of the letters of credit were also conducted between

    Plaintiffs and Umar Zen.</p>
<p align="justify">45.    Accordingly, it is submitted that there was this

    holding out by Wirana clothing Umar Zen with apparent authority. When the question as to

    who Wirana’s authorised signatory for the cargo receipts was (sic) came up, it was

    therefore entirely reasonable for the Plaintiffs to rely on Umar Zen’s

    representations that Raj Kumar Singh was the authorised signatory for Wirana. Cargo

    receipts carrying Wirana’s letterhead and signed by Raj Kumar Singh did arrive in

    accordance with Umar Zen’s representations. It is the Plaintiff’s case that

    Wirana is therefore bound by Umar Zen’s representations by virtue of their holding

    him out as their agent.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">43.        Mr Kumar pointed out that the cases

relied on by Mr Toh were after full trial.</p>
<p xmlns="">44.        He also relied on certain parts of the

judgment of Tay Yong Kwang JC in <i>HSBC v Jurong Engineering </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50997&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 2 SLR 54</a>.</p>
<p xmlns="">45.        In paragraph 63 thereof, Tay JC said: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘63    As a general rule, for a principal to be

    bound under the doctrine of apparent authority, the representation as to the agent’s

    authority must emanate from the principal himself -<i> Freeman &amp; Lockyer v Buckhurst

    Park Properties</i>. In relation to corporations, where representations can only be made

    through agents, the translation of the general rule has produced the consequence that in

    order for a corporation to be bound under the doctrine of apparent authority, the

    representation as to the authority of the agent must be made by some other intermediate

    agent within the corporate structure, who has actual authority to do the very act that he

    represents the other person has having authority to do. The decision of the English House

    of Lords in the case of <i>British Bank of the Middle East v Sun Life Assurance Co of

    Canada (UK) Ltd</i> [1983] BCLC 78 illustrates this rule. ….’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">46.        In paragraph 68 and 70 thereof, Tay JC

said: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘68    There is, however, a narrow exception to the

    general rule stated above: if the company has expressly authorised the agent to make

    representations on its behalf, then any representation made by that agent that he himself

    has authority to do an act is a good representation for the purposes of conferring

    apparent authority on the agent to do that act, even if he has been expressly prohibited

    to do it, and even if it is not something that agents in his position usually have power

    to do. The leading authorities on this exception are the two English cases of <i>The

    Raffaella; Soplex Wholesale Supplies Ltd and PS Refson &amp; Co Ltd v Egyptian

    International Foreign Trading Co </i>[1985] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 36 and <i>First Energy (UK)

    Ltd v Hungarian International Bank Ltd</i> [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 194.</p>
<p align="justify">70    Similarly, in <i>First Energy (UK) Ltd v Hungarian

    International Bank Ltd</i>, the English Court of Appeal held that in certain

    circumstances, an agent had <i>apparent authority to communicate his principal’s

    approval for him to enter into a particular transaction on behalf of the principal</i>,

    even though the third party was aware that the agent did not normally have authority to

    enter into such transactions. …. The Court of Appeal pointed out that such apparent

    authority arose from HIB having placed J in the position of senior manager. As senior

    manager, J had usual authority to sign and send letters on behalf of HIB and therefore had

    apparent authority to represent by letter that he had obtained authorisation from HIB to

    make an offer on their behalf. The Court of Appeal stressed that their judgment was

    consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties, and that, in the

    circumstances, it was unrealistic to have expected First Energy to have checked with

    HIB’s Head Office in London as to whether an employee as senior as J had obtained

    necessary approval to make the offer. The Court of Appeal was able to distinguish <i>Armagas

    Ltd v Mundogas SA</i>, for in that case, Lord Keith had not said as a matter of law that

    an apparent authority to communicate approval could never arise where there was no

    authority in the agent on his own to enter into the transaction.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">47.        Mr Kumar submitted that there should be a

trial vis--vis Wirana to establish who sent the cargo receipts and the identity of Raj

Kumar Singh.</p>
<p xmlns="">48.        He also referred to an oral response from

an officer of SCB, one Peter Tan, who allegedly said that he had dealt with one Raj Kumar

Singh of Wirana in relation to the two letters of credit but when a formal Answer to

Interrogatories was filed, Peter Tan said he dealt with one Raj Bhan Singh.</p>
<p xmlns="">49.        Mr Kumar said that he had asked for

further discovery by a fax dated 24 July 2001. If further discovery was obtained, he might

be able to file further particulars to strengthen Tapematic’s case.</p>
<p xmlns="">50.        Mr Kumar’s last point was that the

application to strike out was taken at a very late stage. By the time it was heard, the

affidavits of evidence-in-chief had been exchanged. He relied on <i>Halliday v Shoesmith</i>

[1993] 1 WLR 1 and Civil Practice in Singapore and Malaysia by Pinsler 2001 p XVI 2.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><em><strong><br/>

My decision</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">51.        Although Mr Toh had submitted that actual

authority must emanate from some consensual agreement between the principal and agent, it

is clear from Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency, which he relies on, that actual authority

can be express or implied. A principal need not specifically tell the agent that the agent

has the authority to do each and every step. That would be unrealistic. It suffices if the

agent is appointed to carry out a function or activity for the principal and the step is

reasonably incidental to the function or activity.</p>
<p xmlns="">52.        In the case before me, Umar Zen was

neither an officer or employee of Wirana.</p>
<p xmlns="">53.        The crux of the issue was whether by

engaging in discussions with Umar Zen, whether directly or through Ramdas Nair, regarding

the issue of letters of credit and by applying for the same to be issued, Wirana had

appointed Umar Zen as its agent with actual authority for Umar Zen to make representations

to Tapematic about the authority of a supposed officer of Wirana. I will refer to this

purpose as ‘the purpose in question’.</p>
<p xmlns="">54.        I was of the view that the said

discussions with Umar Zen and the applications for letters of credit could not, without

more, possibly mean that Umar Zen had been appointed as agent of Wirana for the purpose in

question. Otherwise, it would mean that the mere discussion by an intended applicant of

letters of credit with a broker or intermediary about the issuance of letters of credit

and the consequent application for the same would in every case make that person an agent

of the applicant for the purpose in question. The fact that the letters of credit had been

issued did not advance Tapematic’s case any further.</p>
<p xmlns="">55.        As regards apparent authority, there was

no representation from Wirana to Tapematic about Umar Zen.</p>
<p xmlns="">56.        The fact that Umar Zen had informed

Tapematic that he had arranged for the issuance of the letters of credit did not

constitute a representation from Wirana. There was clearly no holding out by Wirana even

if it knew that Umar Zen was liaising or negotiating with Tapematic on the letters of

credit.</p>
<p xmlns="">57.        The mere fact that Wirana had applied for

the issuance of the letters of credit after Umar Zen had informed Tapematic that he would

make the necessary arrangements also did not constitute a representation from Wirana to

Tapematic.</p>
<p xmlns="">58.        It was irrelevant whether Ramdas Nair was

an agent of Wirana because there was also no representation from Ramdas Nair to Tapematic.</p>
<p xmlns="">59.        Although the cases cited by Mr Toh were

decisions after a full trial, it did not mean that an allegation about the status of a

person as agent could not be struck out in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p xmlns="">60.        As for the case of <i>HSBC v Jurong

Engineering</i>, the person who made the representation was an officer of the corporate

defendant. The facts in that case were different.</p>
<p xmlns="">61.        As regards suggestions by Mr Kumar that

the cargo receipts could possibly emanate from Wirana, I was of the view that this was

contrary to the premise on which Tapematic’s case was founded.</p>
<p xmlns="">62.        Tapematic’s case was premised on the

basis that the cargo receipts were not issued by an authorised signatory of Wirana and

hence its allegation of misrepresentation from Umar Zen as agent of Wirana. That being the

case, there was no reason to have a trial to allow Tapematic a chance to establish that

the cargo receipts in fact emanated from Wirana.</p>
<p xmlns="">63.        The same point applied to the latest

request for discovery by Tapematic’s solicitors dated 24 July 2001. The documents for

which discovery was sought were between SCB and Wirana. They were sought with a view to

uncovering the authorised signatory of Wirana which was a non-issue.</p>
<p xmlns="">64.        In my view, this latest attempt at

further discovery was a desperate manoeuvre to shore up Tapematic’s claim against

Wirana.</p>
<p xmlns="">65.        Notwithstanding earlier discovery and

answers to interrogatories, Tapematic was still in no better position than when it

initiated the action.</p>
<p xmlns="">66.        As for the last argument about the late

filing of the application to strike out, O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court provides that:

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘The Court may <u>at any stage</u> of the proceedings order to be

    struck out … any pleading …’</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">While an application to strike out a pleading should be made as soon as

possible, a late application was not doomed to failure.</p>
<p xmlns="">67.        The case of <i>Halliday v Shoesmith</i>

[1993] 1 WLR 1 relied on by Mr Kumar was one in which the application to strike out was

made at the commencement of the trial and on the facts there the application was not

allowed.</p>
<p xmlns="">68.        In the case before me, the further and

better particulars furnished by Tapematic were couched with the qualification that there

were pending discovery and/or interrogatories. Even when Wirana’s solicitors sought

further and better particulars, after discovery and answers to interrogatories were

provided, they were met with the response that Tapematic would be serving some more

interrogatories and would request for further and better particulars.</p>
<p xmlns="">69.        I accepted Mr Toh’s argument that

had the application to strike out been made earlier, it would have been faced with the

counter argument that it was premature.<i><b></b></i></p>
