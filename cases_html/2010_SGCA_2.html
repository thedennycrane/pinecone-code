<p class="Judg-Author">
        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal arising from an unsuccessful
                    striking-out application made by the appellant in the District Court. On appeal,
                    the High Court judge (“the Judge”) affirmed the District
                    Court’s decision. The appellant then appealed to this court against the
                    Judge’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant is a commercial bank. The
                    respondent, a practising lawyer at the material time, maintained several bank
                    accounts with the appellant. Some of these accounts were in his own name, and
                    the others were office and client accounts of the law firm in which he
                    practised, namely, M/s Y K Lim &amp; Company (“the
                    firm”). It appears that the appellant’s former partner, Lim Yee Kai
                    (“Lim”), embezzled a total of $413,000 from the firm’s
                    client account between June and September 1997. Unfortunately, after Lim
                    absconded, the respondent was left to solely shoulder the liabilities of the
                    firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant commenced an action against the
                    respondent in 1997 to recover an outstanding debt due to it. The respondent
                    counterclaimed for damages on the grounds that the appellant had been negligent
                    in allowing withdrawals from the firm’s client account by Lim. This action
                    was subsequently discontinued pursuant to a letter of settlement dated
                    18 November 1998. The terms of this settlement remain
                confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Soon after Lim’s embezzlement came to
                    light, the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) commenced
                    proceedings pursuant to s 27A of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161,
                    1994 Rev Ed) against Lim and the respondent in Originating Summons
                    No 1358 of 1997 (“the Law Society Action”) to intervene in
                    their practice as solicitors. Against Lim, the Law Society sought an order to
                    suspend his practising certificate. It further sought a sanction against the
                    respondent in the form of the imposition of a condition on his practising
                    certificate, <em>viz</em>, that he should be prevented from
                    practising as a sole proprietor or partner in a law firm. The High Court judge
                    who heard the Law Society Action, Lee Seiu Kin JC, suspended Lim’s
                    practising certificate on the grounds that Lim had failed to comply with the
                    Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R 8,
                    1990 Rev Ed). As far as the respondent was concerned, Lee JC found
                    that he had adopted “a rather cavalier attitude towards the accounts of
                    the firm” (see <em>Law Society of Singapore v Lim Yee
                        Kai</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 895 at [20]) right from the outset in
                    1996 when he first joined the firm until 1997 when the embezzlement took place.
                    Accordingly, the court imposed the condition sought by the Law Society. The
                    respondent remained a practising lawyer until he was made a bankrupt on
                    4 July 2003 upon the application of Aston Properties Pte Ltd, to which the
                    firm owed $85,300 in stakeholding monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 3 May 2004, almost a year after he was
                    made a bankrupt, the respondent commenced District Court Suit No 2018 of
                    2004 (“the DC Suit”) in his own name against the appellant. In the
                    DC Suit, the respondent alleged that the appellant had committed a breach of
                    duty both in contract <em>and</em> in tort in negligently
                    failing to discharge the requisite duty of care in relation to two bank accounts
                    maintained by him in his own name (“the Bank Accounts”). He
                    claimed that the appellant had without authority, on some six occasions between
                    April 1998 and May 1999, debited from and credited to the Bank Accounts certain
                    sums of money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> These unauthorised transactions were
                    for sums ranging from $12.53 to $168.52. As a consequence, the respondent
                    alleged, the appellant had no legal basis to wrongfully dishonour three cheques
                    issued by him for payment to various parties. The first cheque, which was
                    dishonoured on 18 May 1998, was for the sum of $100 made in payment to one
                    Goh Meow Heng, a client of the respondent. The second cheque, which was
                    dishonoured on 27 May 1998, was for the sum of $259 made in payment to
                    Hitachi Credit Singapore Pte Ltd (“Hitachi Credit”) for monthly
                    instalments on a computer leasing arrangement between the respondent and Hitachi
                    Credit. The third cheque, which was dishonoured on 29 May 1998, was for the
                    sum of $354.60 made in payment to the Law Society for a bill in respect of the
                    Law Society Action. As a result of the appellant’s alleged breach of duty
                    in contract and in tort, the respondent claimed, he had suffered a grievous loss
                    of “goodwill and reputation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, the respondent made two further
                    amendments to his statement of claim, first on 24 March 2005 and for a
                    second time, more than one and a half years later, on 27 December 2006. The
                    amendment on 24 March 2005 included further details to buttress the
                    respondent’s claim in contract while the amendment on 27 December
                    2006 was to add an altogether <em>new</em> cause of action
                    in defamation. In respect of this new cause of action, the respondent alleged
                    that, in failing to honour the cheques issued by him and by stating on the
                    returned cheques “Refer to Drawer”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> the appellant had defamed
                    him. In his statement of claim, the respondent asked for general and exemplary
                    damages to be assessed. For completeness, we should add that, in an affidavit
                    filed on 24 June 2008, the respondent alluded to his claim as amounting to
                    a rather remarkable amount in the region of over a million dollars.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It is common ground that <em>no</em> prior sanction from the Official Assignee (“the
                    OA”) was obtained by the respondent to commence the DC Suit on 3 May
                    2004 in his own name; neither were the choses in action which were the subject
                    matter of the DC Suit (“the Choses in Action”) assigned by the OA
                    to the respondent. The OA’s sanction for the respondent to proceed with
                    the DC Suit was finally obtained on 7 October 2004, some six months
                        <em>after</em> the writ of summons was first filed on
                    3 May 2004. The writ, however, was only served on the appellant on
                    4 November 2004. Although the OA’s sanction to commence the DC Suit
                    was retrospectively obtained, the OA was not asked to nor did he expressly
                    assign the Choses in Action to the respondent. We should also point out that,
                    even after sanction had been given by the OA, the named plaintiff in the DC Suit
                    continued to be the respondent alone. The fact that the respondent had been made
                    a bankrupt and that his property continues to be vested in the OA cannot be
                    gleaned from the statement of claim for the DC Suit. This has given rise to a
                    number of legal controversies which we shall address fully below at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>–<a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On ascertaining that the Choses in Action had
                    not been assigned to the respondent, the appellant filed an application to
                    strike out the DC Suit on the basis that (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) the respondent lacked <em>locus
                        standi</em> to bring the action since the Choses in Action had vested
                    in the OA. The striking-out application was first heard by a deputy registrar of
                    the Subordinate Courts (“the Deputy Registrar”), who made no order
                    on it. On appeal to a district judge (“the DJ”), the
                    appellant’s appeal against the Deputy Registrar’s decision was
                    dismissed on 29 March 2007. The DJ’s written grounds are to be found
                    in <em>Loh Chong Yong Thomas v Standard Chartered Bank</em>
                    [2007] SGDC 82. In essence, the DJ held that there was no need for an
                    assignment of the Choses in Action by the OA to the respondent because the
                    requirement for a bankrupt to obtain sanction from the OA under
                        s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act
                    (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the BA”) implied that, once the
                    respondent had obtained the requisite sanction, he would be competent to
                    maintain the DC Suit in his own name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The appellant appealed to the High Court against
                    the DJ’s decision. Before the Judge, the appellant repeated its argument
                    that the respondent had no <em>locus standi</em> to bring
                    the DC Suit in his own name because the Choses in Action were no longer vested
                    in him. It was also contended that, as the respondent was a bankrupt, <em>prior</em> sanction had to be obtained from the OA pursuant
                    to s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA. The
                    respondent’s failure to do so made the DC Suit a nullity <em>ab initio</em>, and that nullity could not be cured by the
                        <em>retrospective</em> sanction of the OA. The Judge
                    dismissed the appeal. As no written grounds have been given, we shall assume
                    that he agreed with the reasoning of the DJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As the Judge did not grant the appellant leave
                    to appeal, the present appeal came before us only after the appellant obtained
                    leave from us to appeal pursuant to s 34(2)(<em>d</em>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed) on 30 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The present appeal raised four broad issues as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, were the Choses in Action
                            “<em>property</em>” that became
                        vested in the OA upon the bankruptcy of the respondent by virtue of
                            s 76(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the BA (“the
                        first issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, if the answer to the first issue was “yes”, was
                        it necessary for the Choses in Action to be assigned by the OA to the
                        respondent before he could commence the DC Suit in his own name (“the
                        second issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, regardless of what the answer to the second issue
                        was, was it necessary for the respondent to obtain the <em>prior</em> sanction of the OA under s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA before he could commence the DC Suit
                        (“the third issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, in any event, was the respondent’s claim
                        for defamation “an action for damages in respect of an <em>injury to his person</em>” [emphasis added] for
                        the purposes of s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA
                        (“the fourth issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Before we proceed to
                    consider these issues, we should point out that it is important to bear in mind
                    that our bankruptcy legislation, when it was first enacted, was largely modelled
                    on England’s 19th century bankruptcy legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first issue turns on the meaning of
                    “property” in the BA. Section 2(1) of this Act defines the
                    “property” of a bankrupt to include all “things in action
                    … whether present or future or vested or contingent, arising out of or
                    incidental to … property”, which would include all choses in
                    action relating to property. This definition is <em>in pari
                        materia</em> with the definition of “property” in
                    s 436 of England’s current Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK)
                    (“the IA”), which is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“property” includes money, goods, <em>things
                            in action</em>, land and every description of property wherever
                        situated and also obligations and every description of interest, whether
                        present or future or vested or contingent, arising out of, or incidental to,
                        property … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In <em>Ord v Upton</em>
                    [2000] Ch 352 (“<em>Ord</em>”), the
                    English Court of Appeal had to decide whether a claim for personal injuries
                    caused by negligence was property that formed part of a bankrupt’s estate
                    for the purposes of s 306 of the IA (which corresponds to
                        s 76(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the BA in our local
                    context). In this regard, the court affirmed the concept of
                    “property” which has been consistently adopted by the English
                    courts since the 19th century in (<em>inter alia</em>)
                    delineating what property of a bankrupt is included within his estate.
                    Aldous LJ said (at 359–360 of <em>Ord</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows from section 306 [of the IA, which
                        corresponds to s 76(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the BA]
                        that upon Mr. Ord being adjudged bankrupt, his estate vested in his
                        trustee. That estate included all his property as defined in
                        section 436 [of the IA], excluding such things as books, clothing etc
                        [see the list of excluded items in s 283(2) of the IA, which (broadly
                        speaking) corresponds to s 78(2)(<em>b</em>) and
                            s 78(2)(<em>c</em>) of the BA]. His claim for
                        negligence committed by Dr. Wadehra is a thing in action within that
                        definition and therefore it would seem that Mr. Ord’s action
                        vested in the trustee. However that simple answer appears to conflict with
                        the way that sections 306, 283 and 436 of the [IA] have been
                        interpreted. Also, as both parties accept, there are certain actions which
                        do not vest in the trustee. As Hoffmann L.J. pointed out in <em>Heath v. Tang</em> [1993] 1 W.L.R. 1421,
                        1423:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The bankrupt as plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The property which vests in the trustee includes ‘things
                            in action:’ see section 436 [of the IA]. Despite the breadth
                            of this definition, there are certain causes of action personal to the
                            bankrupt which do not vest in his trustee. These include cases in which
                            ‘the damages are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain
                            felt by the bankrupt in respect of his body, mind, or character, and
                            without immediate reference to his rights of property:’ see
                                <em>Beckham v. Drake</em> (1849)
                            2 H.L. Cas. 579, 604, <em>per</em>
                            Erle J. and <em>Wilson v. United Counties Bank
                                Ltd</em>. [1920] A.C. 102. Actions for defamation and assault
                            are obvious examples. The bankruptcy does not affect [the
                            bankrupt’s] ability to litigate such claims. But all other causes
                            of action which were vested in the bankrupt at the commencement of the
                            bankruptcy, whether for liquidated sums or unliquidated damages, vest in
                            his trustee. The bankrupt cannot commence any proceedings based upon
                            such a cause of action and if the proceedings have already been
                            commenced, he ceases to have sufficient interest to continue them. Under
                            the old system of pleadings, the defendant was entitled to plead the
                            plaintiff's supervening bankruptcy as a plea in abatement. Since the
                            Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77), the
                            cause of action does not abate but the action will be stayed or
                            dismissed unless the trustee is willing to be substituted as plaintiff:
                            see <em>Jackson v. North Eastern Railway Co</em>.
                            (1877) 5 Ch. D. 844.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Section 436 [of the IA] is not in truth a
                            definition of the word “property.” It only sets out what
                            is included. As will appear later from the cases that have been decided
                            over many years, actions which relate to a bankrupt’s personal
                            reputation or body have not been considered to be property and therefore
                            they do not vest in anybody other than the bankrupt. They relate solely
                            to his body, mind and character and any damages recovered are
                            compensation for damage to his body, mind and character as opposed to
                            other causes of action which have been considered to be a right of
                            property. Thus causes of action to recover damages for pain and
                            suffering have been held not to vest in the trustee</em>. That has
                        led to a number of oddities. For example, the parties agree that if at the
                        time of the bankruptcy, the bankrupt had in his bank a sum which included
                        money paid as damages for a libel, that sum would vest in his trustee
                        because the right to the money formed part of his estate and therefore was
                        available to pay off the bankrupt’s creditors. That was to be
                        contrasted with an action personal to the bankrupt, such as a libel action,
                        which was not settled before the end of the bankruptcy. In such
                        circumstances the cause of action would remain with the bankrupt as would
                        any damages awarded after discharge. If a cause of action is not personal to
                        the bankrupt, it vests in the trustee and therefore any damages awarded
                        whether before or after the discharge will be available to discharge the
                        bankrupt’s liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We see no reason not to apply the decisions of
                    the English courts (as encapsulated in the above quotation) in determining the
                    meaning of “property” in s 2(1) of the BA. Accordingly, on
                    this basis, the respondent’s claims for breach of duty in contract and in
                    tort <em>vis-à-vis</em> the operation of the Bank Accounts
                    are property which vested in the OA under s 76(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the BA. The respondent thus had no <em>locus standi</em> to sue in his own name on these claims. However, as
                    far as the respondent’s claim for defamation is concerned, it is not
                    property that vests in the OA upon the respondent’s bankruptcy as it
                    relates to “pain felt by the [respondent] in respect of his body, mind,
                    or character, and without immediate reference to his rights of property”
                        (<em>per</em> Erle J in <em>Daniel
                        Beckham v William Walker Drake and John Surgey</em> (1849)
                    2 HL Cas 579; 9 ER 1213 (“<em>Beckham v
                        Drake</em>”) at 604; 1222); accordingly, the respondent may sue
                    in his own name on this claim (<em>subject to</em> his
                    obtaining the necessary sanction from the OA pursuant to s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA, a requirement which we shall discuss
                    further at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>–<a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> and <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>–<a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The second issue raises the question of
                    whether property of a bankrupt which has vested in the OA upon bankruptcy must
                    be assigned by the OA back to the bankrupt before the latter can sue <em>in his own name</em> on that property. The guiding principle
                    here is that, where property of a bankrupt has vested in the OA upon bankruptcy,
                    the bankrupt no longer has any standing to commence any proceedings <em>in his own name</em> in respect of such property. He may do
                    so (<em>ie</em>, sue in his own name <em>vis-à-vis</em> property vested in the OA) <em>only
                        if</em> the OA assigns the property in question back to him (upon such
                    assignment, the property re-vests in the bankrupt, which is why he can then
                    bring an action in his own name <em>apropos</em> that
                    property). In contrast, if the OA does not assign the property in question back
                    to the bankrupt (and merely grants the sanction required by
                        s 131(1)(<em>a</em>)), the bankrupt cannot sue in
                    his own name in respect of the property, but must instead sue <em>in the OA’s name</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The second issue is, to all intents and
                    purposes, purely hypothetical in that it has never been the practice of the OA,
                    for practical and other reasons (one of which is s 131 of the BA, which we
                    shall examine later), to assign property back to a bankrupt so that the latter
                    can pursue a claim which he has in respect of that property. Such a procedure
                    would entail more administrative oversight on the part of the OA in terms of
                    recovering from the bankrupt any damages or restitution that he may obtain from
                    the defendant. If the bankrupt has a viable claim against the defendant, the OA
                    would have a duty to pursue the claim for the benefit of the creditors. The OA
                    would also have full control over the proceedings. It can be envisaged that, if
                    an assignment of property back to a bankrupt for the purposes of enabling him to
                    sue on it is made, such assignment would be subject to so many conditions in
                    order to safeguard the interests of the creditors that it would simply be more
                    convenient for the OA to sue on the property rather than to delegate this duty
                    back to the bankrupt by an assignment of that property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The third issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Turning now to the third issue, the question
                    which we have to decide is, in essence, this: Does the use of the words
                        “<em>previous</em> sanction of the Official
                    Assignee” [emphasis added] in s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA entail that a bankrupt must obtain the OA’s
                        <em>prior</em> sanction before he can maintain an
                    action? In considering this issue, we shall limit our discussion to actions
                    which are <em>not</em> “action[s] for damages in
                    respect of … injury to [the] person” since s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) makes it clear that a bankrupt can sue for damages in
                    respect of injury to his person <em>without</em> having to
                    obtain the OA’s previous sanction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     To determine the third issue, it is necessary
                    for us to examine the history of s 131 of the BA. This particular provision
                    is peculiar to Singapore and is not found in the IA. The same is true of
                    Malaysia’s equivalent of this provision, <em>viz</em>, s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy
                    Act 1967 (Act 360, 1988 Rev Ed) (M’sia) (“the
                    MBA”) (see further <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The background and purpose of section 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Section 131 of the BA sets out some of
                    the essential disabilities and disadvantages of a bankrupt. Without the leave of
                    the OA, a bankrupt has no right to commence an action that does not constitute
                    “an action for damages in respect of an injury to his person” (see
                        s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA) or to travel
                    overseas (see s 131(1)(<em>b</em>) of the BA). A
                    breach of s 131 of the BA is an offence punishable with a fine not
                    exceeding $10,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both
                    (see s 131(2) of the BA). For ease of reference, we set out s 131 of
                    the BA in full below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>131</b>.—(1) Where a
                        bankrupt has not obtained his discharge —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    he shall be
                                incompetent to maintain any action, other than an action for damages
                                in respect of an injury to his person, without the previous sanction
                                of the Official Assignee; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    he shall not
                                leave, remain or reside outside Singapore without the previous
                                permission of the Official Assignee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    A bankrupt who fails to comply with this section
                            shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a
                            fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2
                            years or to both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The genesis of s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA can be traced back to
                        s 33(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Ordinance
                    1888 (SS Ord No 2 of 1888) (“the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888”)
                    of the Straits Settlements. This statute was the first consolidated bankruptcy
                    legislation in the Straits Settlements. Although it was based largely on
                    England’s Bankruptcy Act 1883 (c 52) (UK) (“the English BA
                    1883”), s 33(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy
                    Ordinance 1888 – the then equivalent of s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA – was an innovation in the bankruptcy
                    legislation of the Straits Settlements. The same may be said of the Federated
                    Malay States’ equivalent of s 33(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888, namely, s 33(i)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Enactment 1912 (No 2 of 1912) (FMS)
                    (“the Bankruptcy Enactment 1912”). As far as we know, neither of
                    these provisions is to be found in the bankruptcy laws of England or any other
                    Commonwealth jurisdiction. We now turn to examine the legislative materials
                    relating to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888 to ascertain its
                    legislative objects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In this connection, the report dated
                    29th December 1885 laid before the Straits Settlements Legislative Council
                    relating to the then existing bankruptcy legislation –
                    <em>viz</em>, the Report by the Commission appointed to
                    enquire into the Working of the Bankruptcy Ordinance, and into the existing Law
                    of Partnership (“the Commission Report”) – is highly
                    instructive. The Commission Report (a copy of which can be found in Appendix
                    No 46 of Straits Settlements, Colony of Singapore, <em>Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements for
                        1885</em>) was published as part of an enquiry (ordered by the then
                    Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Cecil Smith) into the Straits
                    Settlements’ Bankruptcy Ordinance 1870 (SS Ord No 21 of 1870)
                    (“the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1870”) to ascertain the existing
                        “<em>principal defects in … Bankruptcy
                        Law</em>” [emphasis added] (see the Commission Report at
                    para 2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Included among the several suggestions in the
                    Commission Report was a proposed provision to protect creditors. That provision
                    bears an unmistakeable resemblance to the current s 131(1) and s 82(1)
                    of the BA. The relevant text in the Commission Report reads as follows (at
                    para 7):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We cannot venture to hope that it will be possible entirely

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Commission Report was drawn up by a panel
                    of eight members (collectively, “the Commission”) consisting of
                    seven leading colonial personalities and one local businessman. After completing
                    its consultations, the Commission concluded that the escalation of fraud on
                    creditors had reached epidemic proportions in the Straits Settlements. It was
                    deeply troubled by the fact that (see para 5(c) of the Commission
                    Report):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The clannish nature of the native traders … enable[d] those
                        fraudulently disposed to make over their property to their friends and

                        storm ha[d] blown over. …</p>

                    para 23).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Similar concerns were unrestrainedly echoed in
                    the course of the debate in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council on the
                    Bill which was subsequently enacted as the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888, <em>viz</em>, the Bankruptcy Bill 1887 (“the Bankruptcy
                    Bill”) (a copy of this Bill can be found in <em>SS Govt
                        Gazette</em> (19 August 1887) at pp 1539–1605). It is
                    apparent from the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons to the Bankruptcy Bill that
                    bankruptcy was to be considered as being <em>prima
                        facie</em> an offence to be investigated by the State (see <em>SS Govt Gazette</em> (19 August 1887) at
                    p 1603):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It will be sufficient to point out the principal changes effected
                        by the [Bankruptcy] Bill. <em>Of these the most important is
                            the change in the manner in which insolvency is regarded in its relation
                            to the community</em>. Speaking generally, the present Ordinance
                            [<em>ie</em>, the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1870], which
                        was based on the English Act of 1869 [<em>ie</em>, the
                        Bankruptcy Act 1869 (c 71) (UK)], views insolvency as a matter
                        affecting only the creditors, and the Ordinance is drawn on the assumption
                        that the matter can be safely left in their hands, that self-interest will
                        lead them to realise the estate in the most economical and beneficial
                        manner, and that the sense of personal injury will prompt them, in cases
                        where the debtor has been guilty of fraud, to bring him to justice.
                            <em>This system proved a failure in England, and, as
                            might have been expected, in a mixed community like this has been a
                            still greater failure. This Bill, therefore, proposes that bankruptcy
                            should be treated as being</em> prima facie <em>an
                            offence requiring investigation on the part of the State. This
                            investigation will be made by the Court with the assistance of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The same view was emphatically reiterated by
                    the then Attorney-General, J W Bonser, in the course of the first
                    reading of the Bankruptcy Bill. The Attorney-General emphasised that the law on
                    bankruptcy had malfunctioned in the Straits Settlements. In the result,
                        cl 32(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Bill, which
                    was later enacted as s 33(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888 (which is, in all essential details, <em>in pari materia</em> with s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA), was introduced to rectify this problem. The
                    Attorney-General’s observations merit reproduction here (see Straits
                    Settlements, Colony of Singapore, <em>Proceedings of the
                        Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements for 1887</em>
                    (15 August 1887) at pp B104–B106):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he law had entirely broken down [by 1885, the year in which the
                        Commission Report was published], [in] that it afforded means by which
                        dishonest debtors could defraud their creditors with impunity, so that, with
                        many, the way to wealth was through the Bankruptcy Court. … Now, the
                        English Bankruptcy Act of 1883 [<em>ie</em>, the
                        English BA 1883], which forms the basis of the Bill which I have now the
                        honour to lay before you [<em>ie</em>, the Bankruptcy
                        Bill], takes a different view of insolvency. <em>It is drawn
                            on the assumption that bankruptcy does not affect the creditors alone,
                            but is a matter in which the community as a whole is interested; that
                            insolvency is something approaching a crime …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Part II of the Bill deals with the disqualifications of undischarged
                        bankrupts. <em>At present the refusal of his discharge
                            occasions little or no inconvenience to a bankrupt. It does not
                            interfere, in practice, with his commencing and carrying on business
                            again, and thus it has no terrors for him. But if this part of the Bill
                            passes into law, the undischarged bankrupt will, in future, find himself
                            in a very awkward position, and will labour under certain decided
                            disadvantages. For instance, he will be incapable of maintaining an
                            action without the previous sanction of the Official
                        Assignee</em>. He must render to the Assignee every six months, an
                        account of all moneys received by him, and must pay over to the Assignee the
                        balance which remains after providing for the necessary expenses after
                        providing for the necessary expenses of the maintenance of himself and his
                        family. And, thirdly, <em>he cannot leave the Colony without
                            the permission of the Official Assignee or the Court</em>.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the light of the above, we are satisfied
                    that the predecessor provisions of both s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) and s 131(1)(<em>b</em>) of the BA
                    were introduced to ensure that bankrupts would be in “<em>a very awkward position</em>, and [would] <em>labour
                        under certain decided disadvantages</em>” [emphasis added] (see
                    Straits Settlements, Colony of Singapore, <em>Proceedings of the
                        Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements for 1887</em>
                    (15 August 1887) at p B106) during the entire duration of their
                    bankruptcy. These disadvantages included an absolute bar on maintaining an
                    action without the previous sanction of the OA, a regular six-month accounting
                    of all income earned and an absolute restriction on travel outside the Colony of
                    Singapore without the permission of the OA or the court (see, respectively,
                        s 33(1)(<em>a</em>), s 33(1)(<em>b</em>) and s 33(1)(<em>c</em>) of
                    the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We should pause here to observe that, while
                    personal insolvency is today no longer viewed as being in itself suggestive of
                    criminal behaviour, Parliament has not in the slightest manner modified the
                    stringent disabilities imposed on bankrupts more than a century ago via
                    s 33(1) of the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888. Even the requirement of rendering
                    an account to the OA every six months, which was originally stipulated in
                        s 33(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Bankruptcy Ordinance
                    1888, can now be found in s 82(1) of the BA. Today, although there is a
                    more enlightened view prevailing in the community which acknowledges that
                    businesses and personal undertakings can falter and/or fail for entirely
                    legitimate reasons and that bankrupts should not be permanently stigmatised,
                    there is no gainsaying the fact that Parliament nevertheless still considers it
                    important that significant disabilities should continue to be imposed on
                    bankrupts during their bankruptcy. Indeed, instead of removing or diluting the
                    painful disabilities imposed by bankruptcy which have stood for more than a
                    century, Parliament in 1995 only opted to provide for accelerated mechanisms to
                    discharge deserving individuals from bankruptcy (see Pt VIII of the
                    Bankruptcy Act 1995 (Act 15 of 1995), which is now Pt VIII of the
                    BA).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our ruling on the third issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     With the foregoing legislative background in
                    mind, we can now turn to the question which forms the crux of the third issue,
                    namely, whether the “previous sanction of the Official Assignee”
                    required by s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA means
                        <em>prior</em> sanction and not <em>retrospective</em> sanction, the latter being what was granted in the
                    present case. In our view, the answer is clear beyond doubt.
                        Section 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA was
                    introduced to give the OA full control of the administration of a
                    bankrupt’s estate for the benefit of the creditors. If the Legislature had
                    intended that the OA’s consent could be given retrospectively, then it
                    would not have used the word “previous” in s 131(1)(<em>a</em>). In this connection, comparison may be made with
                        s 76(1)(<em>c</em>) of the BA, which forbids any
                    creditor from enforcing a debt against a bankrupt “except by leave of the
                    court”, without stating whether such leave should be prior or whether it
                    may be retrospective. In granting retrospective leave under
                        s 76(1)(<em>c</em>)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act
                    (Cap 20, 1996 Rev Ed) in <em>Overseas Union Bank v Lew
                        Keh Lam</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 219 (“<em>Lew
                        Keh Lam</em>”), the Court of Appeal stated that, if Parliament
                    had intended the court’s leave to be a “precondition” (at
                    [35]) that had to be fulfilled before a creditor could commence an action
                    against a bankrupt, “<em>the Legislature would have
                        provided for it in more emphatic terms</em>” [emphasis added]
                    (at [35]). The word “previous” in s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA is certainly an “emphatic” (see
                        <em>Lew Keh Lam</em> at [35]) and unequivocal statement
                    that the OA’s sanction cannot be granted <em>ex post
                        facto</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether an assignment of the property sued on is necessary if the
                OA’s previous sanction has been obtained</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Before we proceed to deal with the fourth
                    issue, we should pause to address an argument made by the respondent <em>apropos</em> the scenario where a bankrupt seeks to sue in
                    respect of <em>property which has vested in the OA upon
                        bankruptcy</em>, namely, that “<b>only the
                        OA’s sanction alone</b> is required for a bankrupt to sue on or
                    maintain an action [in respect of such property] … [n]o further
                    assignment of [the property in question] is required or
                        necessary”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in bold in original]. In
                    considering this argument, it is important to bear in mind the effect as well as
                    the scope of s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Section 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA expressly restricts the competence of a bankrupt,
                    so long as he has not obtained his discharge, to maintain any action (other than
                    an action for damages in respect of an injury to his person) without the
                    previous sanction of the OA (for ease of reference, we shall, in this part of
                    the judgment, use the term “the s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) BA restriction” to denote the stipulation that the
                    bankrupt must obtain the OA’s previous sanction before commencing an
                    action which is not an action for damages in respect of an injury to his
                    person). This formulation of the rights and disabilities of a bankrupt implies
                    that it is only in cases where the bankrupt would be competent – if not
                    for the s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) BA restriction – to
                    maintain an action <em>despite his bankruptcy</em> that he
                    requires the previous sanction of the OA. What then are the actions which, if
                    not for the s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) BA restriction, a
                    bankrupt is competent to maintain notwithstanding his bankruptcy? As these
                    actions will not, for practical reasons, be actions relating to property which
                    vests in the OA upon bankruptcy (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                    above), they must be actions relating to property that does not vest in the OA
                    upon bankruptcy. In other words, the bankrupt may maintain any action with
                    respect to property which remains vested in him despite his bankruptcy, but
                        s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA declares it
                    incompetent for him to do so without the previous sanction of the OA. In our
                    view, this is the proper construction of s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA, having regard to the object of the legislation,
                    which is to (<em>inter alia</em>) “disable”
                    some of a bankrupt’s civil rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before this court, the respondent argued, with
                    reference to the Malaysian Court of Appeal’s majority decision in
                        <em>Goh Eng Hwa v M/s Laksamana Realty Sdn

                        s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MBA), no assignment of
                    the property sued on back to the bankrupt was required before the bankrupt could
                    sue in his own name on that property. The reasoning of the majority would seem
                    to be (although this was not articulated clearly) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     if the OA were to assign the
                        property sued on back to the bankrupt, it would be unnecessary for the OA to
                        also give his sanction to the bankrupt to commence legal proceedings in
                        respect of that property since the assignment would re-vest the property in
                        the bankrupt and enable him to sue on it in his own name (see, for instance,
                            <em>Goh Eng Hwa</em> at [21]–[22] and [30]);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     conversely,
                        this must mean that, where the OA’s previous sanction had been given
                        as required by s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MBA, an
                        assignment was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In this regard, the majority in <em>Goh Eng Hwa</em> disapproved of the decision of the Court of
                    Appeal of the Federated Malay States in <em>K Ismail Ganey
                        Rowther v M A Abdul Kader and The Official Assignee of the
                        Property of K P Peer Mohamed, a Bankrupt</em> [1933]
                    MLJ 98 (“<em>K Ismail</em>”) as
                    “archaic” (see <em>Goh Eng Hwa</em> at [30])
                    and declined to follow it. In contrast, the minority judge in <em>Goh Eng Hwa</em> – Abdul Aziz Mohamad JCA – was of
                    the view (at [63]–[66]) that, given the decision in <em>K Ismail</em>, an assignment of the property sued on to the
                    bankrupt was necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We have two comments to make on <em>Goh Eng Hwa</em>. First, the majority’s decision
                    –
                    <em>viz</em>, that s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MBA does not require the property sued on to be
                    assigned to the bankrupt before he may sue on it – is correct in law, but
                    we do not agree with the majority’s reasoning. The reason why an
                    assignment is not necessary is that the actions to which s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MBA (or, in our local context,
                        s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA) applies are, as
                    mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above),
                    necessarily actions in respect of property that <em>does
                        not</em> vest in the OA upon bankruptcy. Since such property remains
                    vested in the bankrupt despite his bankruptcy, it is not necessary to assign the
                    property back to him. Second, it appears to us that the majority in <em>Goh Eng Hwa</em> misunderstood the decision in <em>K Ismail</em>, specifically, Thorne Ag CJ’s
                    statement (at 99) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[T]he Official Assignee by his sanction only intimates
                            his consent to the bankrupt’s bringing or continuing an action.
                            The legislature did not intend, and the section</em> [<em>ie</em>, s 33(i)(<em>a</em>) of
                        the Bankruptcy Enactment 1912] <em>does not mean, that by his
                            sanction the Official Assignee can divest himself of the property,
                            either real or personal, which is vested in him … and revest that
                            property in the bankrupt for the purpose of bringing an
                            action</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In essence, Thorne Ag CJ held that the OA’s sanction of an
                    action by a bankrupt did not have the effect of re-vesting the property sued on
                    in the bankrupt; only an assignment could do so. We see no flaw in the legal
                    reasoning which underlies this aspect of Thorne Ag CJ’s decision in
                        <em>K Ismail</em>. In our view, <em>Goh Eng Hwa</em> is of no assistance to the respondent where his
                    argument at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> and <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The fourth issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ambit of “injury to his person” in
                    section 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Turning now to the fourth issue, the question
                    which we have to decide is whether an action for defamation is “an action
                    for damages in respect of an injury to [the] person” for the purposes of
                        s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA. The meaning of the
                    words “injury to [the] person” has not hitherto been determined by
                    any Singapore court. It is an issue of considerable importance because, as can
                    be seen from the extract from <em>Ord</em> reproduced at
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above, a claim for damages in
                    respect of injury to the person is a type of claim which is personal to the
                    bankrupt and which therefore does not vest in the OA upon bankruptcy. Since a
                    claim for damages in respect of injury to the person remains vested in the
                    bankrupt despite his bankruptcy, he can sue on such a claim in his own name and,
                    in the context of the fourth issue, he need not obtain the OA’s previous
                    sanction before commencing his action. Although (as just mentioned) the meaning
                    of the words “injury to [the] person” has not previously been
                    decided in Singapore, it has been considered by the courts in Malaysia and
                    England. We now turn our attention to the decisions of these courts, starting
                    with the Federated Malay States case of <em>K Ismail</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The existing case law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>K Ismail</em>, Thorne Ag CJ rejected the trial judge’s
                    ruling that the phrase “injury to [the] person” in
                        s 33(i)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Enactment
                    1912 (which is <em>in pari materia</em> with
                        s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA) was limited to
                    physical injury to the body. He held, instead, that the phrase covered (see
                        <em>K Ismail</em> at 99):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… any injury which the bankrupt suffers in mind or body, which
                        might give rise to an action for damages, and which cause of, or chose in
                        action, or right to sue remain[s] in the bankrupt after the bankruptcy
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In so far as Thorne Ag CJ’s definition of “injury to
                    [the] person” specifies that such injury is an injury for which
                    “[the] right to sue remain[s] in the bankrupt after the
                    bankruptcy” (see <em>K Ismail</em> at 99), this
                    definition is consistent with English cases, which hold that a cause of action
                    personal to a bankrupt is not property that vests in the OA (or a trustee in
                    bankruptcy) upon bankruptcy (see the quotation set out at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Thorne Ag CJ went on to state in
                        <em>K Ismail</em> (at 99) that an action to
                    recover damages for injury to reputation –
                    <em>ie</em>, an action to recover damages for defamation
                    – fell within the ambit of actions for damages in respect of
                    “injury to [the] person” (for an example of a later Malaysian
                    defamation case which took the same position, see <em>Sharifah
                        Aini binte Syed Jaafar v Karangkraf Sdn Bhd</em> [1989] 2 CLJ
                    1269, although it should be noted that the court in that case did not actually
                    refer to <em>K Ismail</em>). With respect, we are of
                    the view that this particular aspect of Thorne Ag CJ’s decision is
                    questionable for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     First, Thorne Ag CJ did not cite any
                    authorities in support of his ruling that the phrase “injury to [the]
                    person” included injury to a person’s reputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, although Thorne Ag CJ did not
                    cite any authorities in his decision, he appeared to have had in mind English
                    cases such as <em>Beckham v Drake</em>, where it was held
                    (at 604; 1222) that the right to sue for damages in respect of injury to a
                    bankrupt’s mind, body or character remained vested in the bankrupt despite
                    his bankruptcy. In this regard, Thorne Ag CJ appeared to have overlooked
                    the fact that s 33(i)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy
                    Enactment 1912 was unique to the bankruptcy regime of the Federated Malay States
                    and, thus, in construing the words “injury to his person” in this
                    provision, it might <em>not</em> be appropriate to rely on
                    the then existing English case law delineating the types of claims which were
                    personal to a bankrupt (<em>ie</em>, the types of claims
                    which would not vest in a trustee in bankruptcy or the OA upon
                    bankruptcy).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Third, Thorne Ag CJ’s decision that
                    injury to reputation is a type of “injury to [the] person” for the
                    purposes of s 33(i)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy
                    Enactment 1912 is inconsistent with English case law, which shows that the
                    English courts have all along regarded injury to the <em>person</em> and injury to <em>reputation</em> as
                        <em>different</em> types of injury, even though they
                    are both examples of injury which gives rise to a cause of action personal to
                    the plaintiff. In <em>Beckham v Drake</em>, for instance,
                    Erle J, in discussing the types of injury in respect of which the right to
                    sue remained vested in a bankrupt despite his bankruptcy (<em>ie</em>, the types of injury which gave rise to a cause of action
                    personal to a bankrupt), held as follows (at 604; 1222):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The right of action does not pass where the damages are to be estimated by
                        immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his body,
                        mind, or character, and without immediate reference to his rights of
                        property. Thus it has been laid down that the assignees [<em>ie</em>, the OA, in the context of this judgment] cannot sue for
                        breach of promise of marriage, for criminal conversation, seduction,
                            <em>defamation</em>, battery, <em>injury to the person</em> by negligence, [such] as by not
                        carrying safely, not curing, not saving from imprisonment by process of law
                        … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As can be seen from the italicised portion of
                    the above quotation, Erle J regarded defamation (<em>ie</em>, injury to reputation) and injury to the person as different
                    types of injury, even though both fell within the ambit of injury which gave
                    rise to a cause of action personal to the bankrupt. At least four other judges
                    in <em>Beckham v Drake</em> likewise regarded injury to
                    reputation and injury to the person as <em>different</em>
                    examples of injury which gave rise to a cause of action personal to a bankrupt,
                    namely, Platt B (at 601; 1221), Maule J (at 621; 1228), Parke B
                    (at 626; 1230) and Wilde LCJ (at 635; 1233). The same view –
                    <em>viz</em>, that injury to reputation is not the same as
                    injury to the person – is also reflected in later English cases. In the
                    House of Lords case of <em>Wilson v United Counties Bank,
                        Limited</em> [1920] AC 102 (“<em>Wilson</em>”), for instance, Viscount Finlay stated that
                    the types of claims which would “remain vested in [a bankrupt] in spite
                    of his bankruptcy” (at 120) –
                    <em>ie</em>, the types of claims which were personal to a
                    bankrupt – included claims for “damage to the person <em>or</em> reputation of the bankrupt” [emphasis added]
                    (at 120). More recently, Aldous LJ stated in <em>Ord</em> (at 360) that “actions which relate[d] to a
                    bankrupt’s personal reputation <em>or</em> body
                    … [did] not vest in anybody other than the bankrupt” [emphasis
                    added] and thus did not pass to the OA upon bankruptcy. If injury to reputation
                    is part and parcel of injury to the person, Viscount Finlay in <em>Wilson</em> and Aldous LJ in <em>Ord</em> need not have specifically mentioned injury to reputation
                        <em>in addition to</em> injury to the person when
                    setting out examples of injury which gave rise to a cause of action personal to
                    a bankrupt; neither would they have used the word “or” in relation
                    to these two types of injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     With respect, it seems to us that
                    Thorne Ag CJ’s definition of “injury to [the] person”
                    in <em>K Ismail</em> confuses the concept of injury
                    which gives rise to a cause of action personal to a bankrupt (<em>ie</em>, injury in respect of which the right to sue remains vested
                    in a bankrupt despite his bankruptcy) with the concept of injury to the person.
                    These two concepts are <em>not</em> the same. Injury to the
                    person is merely a type of injury which gives rise to a cause of action personal
                    to a bankrupt; the latter can take the form of other types of injury (apart from
                    injury to the person) such as injury to reputation or injury in the form of
                    false imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our ruling on the fourth issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In our view, therefore, the respondent’s
                    claim for defamation was not “an action for damages in respect of an
                    injury to his person” for the purposes of s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA. This phrase <em>does
                        not</em> include an action for damages for defamation as such an
                    action (<em>ie</em>, an action for damages for defamation)
                    is concerned with the <em>character or reputation</em> of
                    the bankrupt, whereas an action for damages in respect of injury to the person
                    is concerned with physical injury to the bankrupt’s <em>body</em> (which may include, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, injury to the bankrupt’s <em>mind</em> such as nervous shock and psychological or psychiatric
                    injury). Accordingly, a bankrupt must obtain the previous sanction of the OA
                    before he can commence an action for defamation; and, if a defamation action has
                    already been commenced at the time when bankruptcy supervenes, the bankrupt must
                    obtain the OA’s sanction before the action can be continued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the present case, “<em>previous</em> sanction” [emphasis added] (<em>per</em> s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the BA) was not given by the OA to the respondent to pursue his claim for
                    defamation in the DC Suit. It follows that that claim had no legal basis and
                    should also (along with the claims for breach of duty in contract and in tort)
                    have been struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In conclusion, we find for the appellant on
                    all the essential issues. None of the respondent’s claims in the DC Suit
                    were claims for “damages in respect of an injury to [the] person”
                        (<em>per</em> s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA); thus, the respondent had to obtain the previous
                    sanction of the OA before he could commence the DC Suit. This was not done, and
                    this failure to comply with s 131(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the BA could not be cured by the retrospective “sanction” which
                    the respondent received from the OA. Further, the respondent was the sole
                    plaintiff throughout the DC Suit and currently still remains the sole plaintiff
                    (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). However, as we pointed out
                    earlier, the respondent cannot sue in his own name in so far as his claims for
                    breach of duty in contract and in tort are concerned as these claims now vest in
                    the OA because of s 76(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the BA.
                    For these reasons, we allow the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Considering that our decision is premised upon
                    arguments that were not adequately developed by the parties, we think that the
                    appropriate costs order is for each party to bear its own costs here and below
                    in respect of the striking-out proceedings. The security provided by the
                    appellant for the respondent’s costs of the appeal is to be released to
                    the appellant.</p>
