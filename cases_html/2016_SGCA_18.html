The parties had entered into a two-year lease agreement, with an option to renew for another two years (“the Lease Agreement”). One year into the lease, the respondent-landlord (“the Respondent”) wanted to renovate the premises and thereby gave notice to terminate the lease prematurely. As a result, the appellant-tenant (“the Appellant”) had to find new premises for his business in a relatively short space of time. This caused the Appellant to first move into interim premises before he could find more suitable permanent premises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Having, on 23 May 2012, successfully obtained judgment for breach of contract against the Respondent

However, dissatisfied with the award, the Appellant appealed to us. While a significant part of the present appeal involved quantifying the exact loss the Appellant suffered, an important question about the legal and conceptual basis for awarding and quantifying damages pursuant to a breach of contract arose and had to be clarified. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Appellant is a sole proprietor of several businesses.

</div> The Appellant assumed occupation of 51 Merchant Road, #02-06 to #02-09, Merchant Square (“the Original Premises”) as a tenant under the Lease Agreement from December 2010. He used the Original Premises for his agency distributorship business. At this juncture, we should explain that the Lease Agreement was signed by the Appellant with the then-owner and landlord on 9 November 2010. The Lease Agreement was subsequently assigned by the then-owner to the Respondent, who took over as landlord.

In arriving at the sum of $62,654.39, the Judge had regard to the Respondent’s expert’s assessment of the estimated additional rent which the Appellant needed to pay based on the higher rate of rental payable for the Interim Premises as well as the Current Premises. The Respondent’s expert’s assessment is summarised in the following table

Item 1 was calculated on the basis that an extra $1.17 had to be paid per square foot per month for the Interim Premises, which was 3,993 square feet. Item 2 was calculated on the basis that an extra $1.17 had to be paid per square foot per month for 5,685 square feet. The “Nil” award for item 3 represents the Respondent’s expert’s assessment that the Appellant should not be awarded the extra rent incurred for the additional area (2,388 square feet), it being the difference in area between the Original Premises and the Current Premises (“the Excess Area”). Item 4 represented the additional rent which the Appellant had to pay for the next two years on account of the increased rental for the Current Premises, giving consideration to the fact that the rental of the Original Premises would have been increased by 20%. Similar to item 3, item 5 gives nothing for the additional rental for the Excess Area from 15 December 2012 to 14 December 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Judge largely agreed with the Respondent’s expert’s estimate of the additional rental which the Appellant had to pay, but disapproved of awarding any damages for the increased rent paid during the period when the Appellant was occupying the Interim Premises<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, item 1).

We agreed with the Judge that the Appellant’s move to larger premises was, based on the evidence before the court, likely to have been a <span class="font-italic">deliberate</span> move on his part. The Appellant claimed that his business did not require the additional 2,388 square feet of space (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Excess Area), and that he only accepted the Current Premises because he could not find smaller alternative premises that suited his needs. However, when questioned, the Appellant could not point to <span class="font-italic">any evidence </span>that he had been looking for premises that were approximately the size of the Original Premises. Instead, the Respondent brought to the court’s attention the fact that the Appellant’s shortlist of 18 possible properties only included premises which had an area of at least 7,000 square feet.

</div> In the circumstances, given that there was no evidence that the Appellant had made any effort to find premises with similar dimensions to those of the Original Premises, we found that the Appellant had failed to mitigate his losses.

If he did, he would not have incurred (a) two relocation costs and (b) the increased rent for the Interim Premises prior to the move to the Current Premises. The Appellant however appealed against this finding on the ground, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that it was not unreasonable for him to have left the Original Premises before the renovations started on 1 March 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It is a well-established principle that “the aggrieved party must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the defaulting party’s breach, and cannot recover damages for any loss which it could have avoided but failed to avoid due to its own unreasonable action or inaction”: <span class="font-italic">The “Asia Star”</span> [2010] 2 SLR 1154 (“<span class="font-italic">Asia Star</span>”) at [24].

The Appellant cited issues of safety for his handicapped employees, noise, inconvenience, and the lack of parking space to explain why he could not stay on in the Original Premises after renovations thereto commenced. Moreover, it being a standard stipulation in a lease that a tenant is entitled to quiet enjoyment of the premises, in our view, it was reasonable for the Appellant to want to avoid the inconveniences the renovations would have brought about, even if shifting into the Interim Premises would have involved incurring some extra costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Further, we took into account the fact that the Respondent had initially demanded that the Appellant vacate the Original Premises by 29 February 2012 and confirmed that it was terminating the Lease Agreement prematurely.

</div> In the circumstances, we found that the Appellant had acted reasonably on the basis that he had to leave before 29 February 2012 to avoid any allegation that he was affirming the Lease Agreement despite the Respondent’s repudiatory breach, or to avoid over staying on the Original Premises when he had no right to given that the Lease Agreement was effectively terminated from 29 February 2012.

It is to <span class="font-italic">place the innocent party, so far as money can do so, in the same position as if the contract had been performed</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Following this principle, damages for breach of contract are ordinarily assessed in terms of the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">expectation loss</span>, which refers to the value of the benefit that the claimant would have obtained but for the breach of contract, or, to put it another way, the gains the claimant expected as a result of the full performance of the contract: Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span>”) at para 21.033. On occasion, damages for breach of contract may be quantified in terms of the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">reliance loss</span> – that is, the costs and expenses the claimant incurred in reliance on the defendant’s contracted-for performance, but which were wasted because of the breach of contract: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract </span>at para 21.034. The basis for awarding reliance loss is the assumption that were the contract performed, the claimant would have at least fully recovered the costs and expenditure incurred: <span class="font-italic">Van Der Horst Engineering Pte Ltd v Rotol Singapore Ltd</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 586 at [54]–[55].  Indeed, in cases where a claimant enters into a bad bargain and would not have recovered all his costs/expenditure even if the contract had been performed, his losses may not be quantified by reference to his reliance expenditure: <span class="font-italic">C &amp; P Haulage v Middleton</span> [1983] 1 WLR 1461 at 1468. Thus, the underlying principle, <span class="font-italic">even in cases where reliance loss is awarded</span>, is to place the innocent party in the position he would have been in <span class="font-italic">had the contract been performed</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It should be noted that claims for expectation losses and reliance losses are generally <span class="font-italic">alternative</span> claims: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> at para 21.037.

He would effectively have obtained the gains he expected as a result of the full performance of the contract, yet would not have had to incur the necessary costs in securing those gains. The claimant would thus be over-compensated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Putting it in the plainest terms, had the Lease Agreement been wholly performed by the Respondent, the Appellant would have been entitled to enjoy the use of the Original Premises at the agreed rental for a total of four years subject to the qualification that in respect of the second two year period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the renewed term), the Appellant would have had to pay up to 20% more in terms of rental in order to enjoy the use of the Original Premises. However, in view of the breach of the Lease Agreement by the Respondent, the Appellant had to suffer the payment of higher rental rates for the use of the Interim Premises and the Current Premises. In addition, the Appellant had to incur relocation costs, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the costs of relocating from the Original Premises to the Interim Premises, and then from the Interim Premises to the Current Premises. Of course, besides the higher rental and relocation expenses incurred, the Appellant had also suffered the inconvenience of relocating, for which the Judge had awarded him the sum of $20,000 (see [7(b)] above). These were the losses suffered by the Appellant <span class="font-italic">on account of the</span><span class="font-italic"> Respondent’s breach</span>. On payment of these sums as damages, the Appellant would effectively have been placed in a position, as far as money can buy, as if there was no breach on the part of the Respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The problem with the award of wasted costs made by the Judge lay in the fact that it would be over-compensating the Appellant. Had the Lease Agreement been performed by the Respondent, the Appellant would still have incurred the “wasted costs”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the costs of renovating the Original Premises, to render them suitable for his purposes. In this regard, we noted that the Judge did not grant the sum claimed by the Appellant for the costs of the second relocation. In our view, there seemed to be a slight misunderstanding on the part of the Judge as to the underlying principle upon which damages were assessed. By awarding the appellant <span class="font-italic">both wasted costs </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">and</span><span class="font-italic"> the costs of</span><span class="font-italic"> the first relocation</span>, the Judge effectively exempted the Appellant from having to pay <span class="font-italic">any costs</span> for renovating the Original Premises. While denying the Appellant damages for the costs of the second relocation did reduce the total damages which the Appellant was entitled to receive from the Respondent, such an approach was not correct conceptually. If, as the Judge found, the Appellant was not entitled to be indemnified as to the costs of the second relocation, there should be no question of the Appellant being compensated in a different way by awarding him the costs incurred in doing up the Original Premises, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by an award of wasted costs.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In this regard, we should add that the Respondent suggested that the Appellant ought to have been awarded wasted costs rather than relocation costs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, reliance rather than expectation loss)

</div>. We did not think that this suggestion would be in accord with principle. Conceptually, and in the circumstances here, an award of relocation costs would, as opposed to wasted costs, better achieve the law’s aim of placing the Appellant in the position he would have been in <span class="font-italic">had the Lease Agreement been performed</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 For the reasons given, we held that the Judge should not have awarded the Appellant $150,000 for wasted costs. We noted that the Appellant had asked for an even higher amount for wasted costs. In view of our opinion on this item of claim, the question of increasing the quantum of award for wasted costs did not arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In conclusion, we found that the Appellant should have been awarded an extra $14,099.28 for the increased rent he incurred whilst he occupied the Interim Premises (see item 1 in [8] above), and an extra $41,963.06 for the costs of relocating from the Interim Premises to the Current Premises (see [21] above). However, we also found that the Appellant should not have been awarded damages of $150,000 for wasted costs (see [27]-[29] above). In the result, the Appellant was therefore better off without any appellate intervention. Given that there was no cross-appeal by the Respondent, we dismissed the Appellant’s appeal and awarded costs of $30,000 (all in) to the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin   Quentin Loh  <br/>Judge of Appeal  Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Suresh Damodara and Clement Ong Zi Ying (Damodara Hazra LLP) for the appellant;<br/>Sim Bock Eng and Jasmine Chan Mei Wen (WongPartnership LLP) for the respondent.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
