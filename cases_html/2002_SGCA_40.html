        In this case, the prosecution appealed against

the sentence imposed by the trial judge on the respondent, Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid,<b>
</b>who was found guilty of committing an offence punishable under section 436 of the

Penal Code, Chapter 224, which provides as follows:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Whoever commits mischief by fire

    or any explosive substance, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will

    thereby cause, the destruction of any building which is ordinarily used as a place for

    worship, or for the administration of justice, or for the transaction of public affairs,

    or for education, or art, or for public use or ornament, or as a human dwelling, or as a

    place for the custody of property, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with

    imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        The appellant, who contended that the trial

judge’s sentence of imprisonment for four years was manifestly inadequate in the

circumstances of the case, asserted that an order of preventive detention under section

12(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC") should have been made.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        At around 11 pm on 4 November 2001, the

respondent returned to his flat at Block 38, Bedok South Road, #02-653. He could not enter

his flat because there was a padlock on his gate. He called his mother, the deceased, to

open the gate. When his mother, who was lying on her bed in the front bedroom, did not

respond to his shouts, the respondent took a brick and threw it at her though the window

louvres. Although the brick landed on his mother’s shoulder, she did not stir. The

respondent, who became more angry, threw another brick at her but she still did not get

up. The respondent then rolled some newspapers into a ball and threw the lighted object at

his mother. It landed on her mattress, which caught fire. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        A police officer, Sergeant Rohaizad bin Majnen,

who lives five floors above the respondent’s flat, rushed down to investigate after

he saw smoke emitting from a unit below. He saw the respondent standing outside his flat,

smoking a cigarette. When questioned, the respondent said that his flat was on fire and

that his mother was inside the flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        The respondent’s mother’s body was

found badly charred and lying on her burnt bed frame. The autopsy report stated that the

cause of her death was unascertainable. All the same, fire was ruled out as the cause of

the death of the respondent’s mother, who was 77 years old and suffering from

diabetes, a lung infection and ischaemic heart disease with interstitial fibrosis, which

could cause her to die suddenly.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        The fire started by the respondent damaged the

flat and the common corridor outside it. Repairs costing around $3,000 were carried out by

the HDB and the East Coast Town Council.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The trial</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        The prosecution urged the trial judge to impose

an order of preventive detention under section 12(2)(a) of the CPC on the respondent in

view of his numerous previous convictions. The trial judge initially agreed that such an

order was appropriate and sentenced the respondent to 14 years of preventive detention. At

this juncture, the prosecution pointed out that section 12(3) of the CPC requires the

court to consider the physical and mental condition of the offender and his suitability

for preventive detention before imposing such a sentence. The trial judge accordingly

called for a preventive detention report and the matter was adjourned for three weeks. The

report concluded that this was a case where an order for preventive detention was

appropriate. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        After studying the report in question, the

trial judge noted that the respondent’s terms of imprisonment ranged in the main from

eight weeks to six months and were mostly for theft. He said that an order for preventive

detention should not be made as it was too great a jump from sentences of six months to a

period of incarceration ranging from seven to 20 years under a preventive detention order.

He then sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for four years. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The appeal</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        To determine whether or not the appeal ought to

be allowed, reference must first be made to section 12(2) of the CPC, which sets out the

regime for preventive detention and provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) Where a person who is not

    less than 30 years of age —</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) is convicted before the High

    Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years

    or upwards, and has been convicted on at least 3 previous occasions since he attained the

    age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least two of

    those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">then, <i>if the Court is

    satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained

    in custody for a substantial period of time</i>, followed by a period of supervision if

    released before the expiration of his sentence, the Court, unless it has special reasons

    for not so doing, shall pass, in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, a sentence of

    preventive detention of such term of not less than 7 nor more than 20 years as the Court

    may determine. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        A sentence of preventive detention is intended

for habitual offenders, aged more than 30 years, whom the court considers to be too

recalcitrant for reformation (see <i>PP v Wong Wing Hung</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49471&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 329</a>). Preventive

detention ought to be imposed if the accused has shown that he is such a menace to society

that he should be incarcerated for a substantial period of time (see <i>PP v Perumal s/o

Suppiah</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59028&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 3 SLR 308</a>). While the court will consider the need for the public to be

protected from physical bodily harm, offences against property, such as theft, offences

against the peace, such as affray, and offences against society in general, such as the

consumption and possession of drugs, may also be taken into account for the purpose of

determining whether it is appropriate for an order of preventive detention to be made. In <i>Tan

Ngin Hai v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61620&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 3 SLR 161</a>, 163, Yong Pung How CJ explained: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In my view, there is no rule of

    law which states that protection of the public necessarily refers to protecting them only

    from physical harm…. As such, the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be

    restricted only to persons with a history of violent behaviour as exhibited though the

    commission of violent crimes. Instead, the real test is whether or not the degree of

    propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to

    be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest

    opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        The respondent is 41 years old. The offences

previously committed by him are numerous. In 1976, he was put on probation for two years

for theft. He did not turn over a new leaf as he was fined $300 in 1981 for committing

theft again. In 1982, he was imprisoned for a year for housebreaking and theft by night.

In 1984, he was fined $2,500 for theft and fraudulent possession of property. He was

imprisoned for 5 months as he failed to pay the fine. In 1986, he was fined $500 for

criminal trespass and was imprisoned for one month after he failed to pay the fine. In

1986, he was imprisoned for a day and fined $400 for committing theft. As the fine was not

paid, he was imprisoned for an additional month. By 1987, he had turned to drugs and was

sent to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre for 6 months. In 1988, he was placed under drug

supervision. In the same year, he committed theft for yet another time and was imprisoned

for 8 weeks. In 1990, he was found guilty of unlawful possession of an offensive weapon

and three counts of theft. He was imprisoned for 8 months and given 6 strokes of the cane.

In 1990, he was sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for 6 months and was subjected to

drug supervision for 24 months. In 1993, he was once again sent to the Drug Rehabilitation

Centre for 6 months and was subjected to drug supervision for 24 months. He could not get

himself off drugs and in 1996, he was imprisoned for a total of six months for possession

and consumption of drugs. In 1997, he was sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for a

third time and was again subjected to drug supervision. Finally, in 2000, he was

imprisoned for 12 months for failing to report for a urine test on three occasions. Within

a few months of his release from prison, he threw a lighted projectile at the mattress on

which his mother was lying and was found guilty of committing mischief by fire, an offence

for which the punishment prescribed in section 436 of the Penal Code includes life

imprisonment or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        The respondent’s string of previous

convictions and the circumstances of his latest offence reveal his propensity for criminal

activity. In our view, there is a real danger that the respondent will commit more

offences in the future. As such, this is a case where the trial judge should have made an

order for preventive detention. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        As for the period of detention, we were minded

to have the respondent detained for a very long time. The respondent pointed out to us

that although he had committed numerous offences in the past, he had never been imprisoned

for a long period of time. However, in <i>PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59028&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 3 SLR 308</a>,

316<i>, </i>Yong Pung How CJ made it clear that any comparison between the sentences

previously imposed on the offender and the minimum period of preventive detention is

misconceived and constitutes a misreading of the law and objective of preventive

detention. He explained as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The criteria for the imposition

    of preventive detention is that set out in s 12(2)(a) or s12(2)(b) CPC. The provision does

    not stipulate a minimum term for an offender’s previous sentences and does not

    require the previous sentences to correspond to the minimum period of preventive

    detention. Indeed an offender who has committed a perpetual string of offences for which

    he was sentenced to varying imprisonment terms of under one year is precisely the type of

    offender targeted by the provision.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        We considered two cases where the maximum

period of 20 years’ preventive detention was imposed. In the first case, <i>PP v Wong

Wing Hung</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49471&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 329</a>, the appellant, who was 35 years old, pleaded guilty to a

charge under section 332 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt to a public

servant. He had been previously charged and convicted a total of 16 times since 1980 and

had been sentenced to a total of 15 years of imprisonment. In addition, he had received as

punishment a total of 25 strokes of the cane. His previous convictions were in respect of

outrage of modesty, rape, causing grievous hurt, criminal intimidation, armed robbery and

using an offensive weapon. The court was of the view that the appellant’s large

number of criminal convictions and his apparent lack of repentance proved that an order of

preventive detention for the maximum possible period should be imposed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        In the second case, <i>Heng Jong Cheng v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48285&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 2 SLR 345</a>, the appellant, who pleaded guilty to a charge of affray, was found guilty of 23

counts of abetment of cheating and one charge of abetment of attempted cheating. He had

many previous convictions involving dishonesty over a period of more than three decades.

For instance, in 1991, he was convicted of two charges of housebreaking and theft by night

and was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 24 months’ imprisonment. Shortly after

he was released from prison, he was found guilty of three counts of assisting in the

concealment or disposal of stolen property and sentenced to three terms of imprisonment,

each of a duration of two years and six months, with two of the terms running

consecutively. After his release from prison, he was charged with, inter alia, 23 counts

of abetment of cheating. He was sentenced by the district judge to 9 years of preventive

detention. On appeal, the period of detention was increased to 20 years. Yong Pung How CJ

said that faced with an offender who had evinced a complete lack of remorse and whose

record indicated that he was highly likely to return to a life of crime once he was

released from detention, 9 years of preventive detention was manifestly inadequate to

protect the public. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        The respondent’s position is not better

than that of the offenders in the two cases referred to above. His first crime was

committed way back in 1976, when he was merely 15 years old and he has gone from bad to

worse over the years. He has been convicted on innumerable occasions over a period of 26

years and has been imprisoned for a total of 49 months. The imposition of a punishment of

six strokes of the cane has had no effect whatsoever on his bent for criminal activity. In

regard to his latest offence, it is rather alarming that he displayed such a blatant

disregard for his own frail and aged mother when he threw bricks at her and when he threw

a lighted ball of newspaper onto the mattress on which his mother was lying. He also

showed how callous he was about the safety of his neighbours as the fire could easily have

spread to other flats and could have caused death and injury but for the timely

intervention of the civil defence force. When the fire started, the respondent took no

steps whatsoever to put out the fire or to call the fire brigade even though his mother

was trapped in the flat. He merely stood outside his house and smoked a cigarette. Indeed,

in his skeletal submissions, he stated that he was "unable to do anything except to

watch while waiting for the arrival of the police and fire brigade … and he could

only prevent himself from getting caught in the raging fire".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        The respondent’s dependence on drugs and

alcohol should not be overlooked. He has not been able to hold a steady job and many of

the offences committed by him stemmed from the need to find money for drugs. Taking all

circumstances into account, detaining the respondent for a long period of time would be in

the interest of the public. As such, we sentenced the respondent to preventive detention

for a period of 20 years.</font></p>
