<p xmlns="">: These are four related originating summonses heard together and they concern a plot of land, one part of which has been assimilated by 1 Bedok Rise and the other by 3 Bedok Rise. The plaintiff in OS 1628 and 1629 of 2000 is a company (`the company`) which owns 7A Bedok Rise which adjoins both 1 and 3 Bedok Rise. The company claims against the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise possession of the respective portion of the plot in issue together with an injunction to restrain them from remaining on the said plot, mesne profits and/or damages from the date of trespass until the delivery up of possession, interest and costs on an indemnity basis.<br/><br/>Originating Summons 1925 of 2000 and OS 600154 of 2001 are the actions by the owners of 3 and 1 Bedok Rise respectively against the company for a declaration that they are the owners of the relevant portion of the plot of land in question by virtue of adverse possession. They also seek an order that the Singapore Land Registry be directed to rectify the entries in the registry to exclude the plot in question from the title of 7A Bedok Rise.<br/><br/>The portion of the plot occupied by 3 Bedok Rise is about 48.10sq m with an estimated market value of $210,000 while the portion occupied by 1 Bedok Rise is about 80.16sq m with an estimated market value of $345,000.<br/><br/><strong><i> The company`s case </i></strong></p>
<p xmlns="">
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p xmlns="">The company is the registered owner of the piece of land described as Lot 8187W Mukim 27 Bedok (`the property`) of which 7A Bedok Rise is a part. The property`s parent lot used to be known as Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 Bedok/Lot 98170L Mukim 27 Bedok.<br/><br/>The company purchased the property from another company known as Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd which had in turn acquired it from one Thulasi Velayutham. Pursuant to an Indenture of Conveyance dated 17 December 1993, Thulasi conveyed the land known as Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 Bedok to Double L &amp; T Pte  Ltd. Thereafter, Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd applied for the parent lot (comprising the property) to be registered under the Land Titles Act.<br/><br/>On 20 June 1994, Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd obtained a qualified certificate of title of the parent lot which was subdivided into Lot 8187W (the property), Lot 8188V and Lot 8189P.<br/><br/>On 15 June 1996, the property was transferred from Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd and registered in the name of the company. The company, which is a housing developer, then built houses on the property. The company intends to sell the house now known as 7A Bedok Rise together with its compound. The plot in dispute falls within the compound of 7A Bedok Rise but the respective portions thereof have been fenced up and assimilated by 1 and 3 Bedok Rise.<br/><br/>On 9 April 1996, the company`s solicitors wrote to the owner of 1 Bedok Rise in the following terms:  </p>

<br/>A letter in similar terms was sent to 3 Bedok Rise. However, there was no response from either 1 or 3 Bedok Rise.<br/><br/>The company claims that its title has become absolute on 17 December 1998, five years after the Indenture of Conveyance by Thulasi to Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd. No one has filed a caveat against the property alleging an interest in it.<br/><br/><strong><i> The defendants` case </i></strong></p>
<p xmlns="">
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p xmlns="">The case of the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise is contained in their affidavits filed in OS 1925/2000 and OS 600154/2001.<br/><br/>1 Bedok Rise was transferred to the present owner on 25 April 1988. The previous owner bought this property in 1975.<br/><br/>1 Bedok Rise was part of a housing project developed by Lucky Realty Co Ltd. An application was made sometime in 1973 by the developer to subdivide the parent lot (Lot 235-24 Mukim 27 Bedok) into individual lots which included 1 Bedok Rise.<br/><br/>When the present owner purchased 1 Bedok Rise, it was separated along its entire boundary with 3 Bedok Rise by a brick wall with metal grilles at the top. In 1978, this brick wall was built in place of the chain fencing put up by the developer and it has been in continuous existence since then. The first owner of 1 Bedok Rise was in continuous possession of the relevant portion of the plot of land in dispute since the date of purchase of 1 Bedok Rise from the developer and there was undisturbed possession for more than 12 years before this property was transferred to the present owner in 1988.<br/><br/>The company reiterates its position set out in its originating summons in respect of 1 Bedok Rise. None of the directors of the company has any knowledge of the owner`s allegations spelt out above and the company does not admit them as the truth. The company points out that the assertion that the chain fencing put up by the developer had annexed the disputed plot is a bare one. In fact, the site plan of the developer attached to its application for subdivision in 1973 clearly indicated that the plot in issue was excluded from 1 Bedok Rise. The company also points out that the present owner has no personal knowledge about the developer`s chain fencing nor any documents as to the date of construction of the brick wall. In the ordinary course of events, there ought to have been various queries regarding the unauthorised use of the plot in issue in the purchases of 1 Bedok Rise in 1971, 1975 and 1988 but no documentary evidence of such has been adduced. There was also no response when the company and its predecessor demanded the cessation of encroachment.<br/><br/>The present owners of 3 Bedok Rise are a married couple who bought it in 1986. The husband was told by the previous owner that he bought this property from Lucky Realty Co Ltd in 1971 and was given possession in August 1973. The previous owner also told him a chain fencing had been constructed between 1 and 3 Bedok Rise at the time he took possession of his property and that it enclosed the disputed plot as well.<br/><br/>He was further told that sometime in 1978, the chain fencing was replaced by a brick wall with metal grilles on top. Beyond the boundary walls of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise (ie the company`s property) was a strip of land reserved as a backlane or access which was covered with wild vegetation and which had never been used. In fact, the access to this strip was sealed up with a wooden fence.<br/><br/>The previous owner of 3 Bedok Rise is now residing in Canada. An affidavit was filed by him confirming what has been stated by the present owner. The previous owner also confirms that he was in continuous possession of the relevant part of the disputed plot since the time he took possession of 3 Bedok Rise from the developer in 1973. He had also maintained, repaired and carried out improvements to the disputed plot.<br/><br/>The company filed an affidavit raising the same points as it did in the case of 1 Bedok Rise.<br/><br/><strong><i> The issues </i></strong></p>
<p xmlns="">
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p xmlns="">On 1 March 1994, acquisition of title by adverse possession was effectively abolished. The present owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise who took possession in 1988  and 1986 respectively would therefore not have satisfied the requirement of 12 years of continuous adverse possession in their own right. The issues for determination are therefore the following:   </p>
<p xmlns="">(1) whether by 1 March 1994, the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise have acquired the disputed plot through adverse possession; </p>
<p xmlns="">(2) if they have so acquired, whether such interest can be defeated by the company`s interest as bona fide purchaser under the Land Titles Act and whether the company`s title to the disputed plot has become an unqualified title on 17 December 1998.<br/><br/><strong><i> The decision of the court </i></strong></p>
<p xmlns="">
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p xmlns="">The first issue is one of fact. In the light of the documentary evidence which shows that the disputed plot was not included as part of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise, the assertions of the present owners and those of the previous owner of 3 Bedok Rise must be tested by cross-examination in court. I therefore ordered a trial of this factual issue and directed that all affidavits on record stand as the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of the respective witnesses. I also directed the parties to proceed for a pre-trial conference before the Registrar on the question of the need for further witnesses and to take dates for the trial of the issue. This part of my decision is not under appeal by the company.<br/><br/>The second issue is a question of law. The company`s case is that its title has become an absolute one with effect from 17 December 1998, five years after the conveyance from Thulasi to Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd, as no caveat was lodged before 17 December 1998 to assert any claim against the property. On 20 June 1994, when the property was brought within the regime of the Land Titles Act, the conveyance which was cancelled upon the issuance of the qualified certificate of title to Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd was Thulasi`s 17 December 1993 conveyance. The company`s certificate of title dated 15 June 1996 was also a qualified title.<br/><br/>Sections 19 and 20 of the Land Titles Act set out the process of bringing land within the said Act. The relevant parts of these sections provide:<br/><br/></p>

This was because under s 25(4), the caution constituted a defunct entry and the making of an entry regarding its lapsing was a purely administrative act in which the Registrar had no discretion.

In that case, Balwant Singh had been in adverse possession of a triangular plot of some 70.4sq m which formed part of Lot 235-25 Mukim 27 belonging to one VK Samy. This plot of land was in the adverse possession of Thulasi since 1941. On 17 December 1993, Thulasi obtained consent judgment against VK Samy and was declared owner in fee simple by virtue of adverse possession. On the same day, Thulasi conveyed Lot 235-25 including the said triangular plot to Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd. This conveyance was duly registered in the Registry of Deeds. On 1 March 1994, the new Land Titles Act came into force. On 20 June 1994, the property was brought within the new Land Titles Act with Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd as the registered proprietor under a qualified certificate of title. On 17 February 1995, Balwant Singh lodged a caveat against the property claiming an interest in the triangular plot as an adverse possessor.<br/><br/>Goh Joon Seng J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, set out the issues before the court and the law on adverse possession of both common law land and registered land as follows (at pp 729-731):  </p>

<i>Before we proceed, it would be convenient to trace briefly the development of the law relating to acquisition of title to land by adverse possession with regard to registered and unregistered land. Prior to 1 March 1994, for land which was held under the common  law system, title acquired by adverse possession need not be registered since all that was required to acquire the same was the necessary intention and physical possession to extinguish the documentary owner`s title. The Limitation Act also provided that if the documentary owner did not assert title to the land within 12 years, his claim would be barred and his title extinguished and the person in adverse possession would then acquire a possessory title. See ss 9(1) and 18 of the Limitation Act.</i>

<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>On the other hand, claims to adverse possession of registered land were governed by s 42 of the repealed LTA which read:</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p>`(1) Any person in adverse possession of registered land who, if that land had not been brought under the provisions of this Act would have become entitled thereto by virtue of that adverse possession, may apply to the Registrar for a certificate of title to that land, provided that not less than 12 years have elapsed since the land was brought under the provisions of this Act, or since the entry in the land-register of the most recent memorial of registration or notification of an instrument (other than an instrument of statutory obligation) affecting that land.  </p>
<p>(2) Except as in this Division provided, no title to land adverse to or in derogation of the title of a proprietor shall be acquired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation Act or otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor be extinguished by the operation of that Act.  </p>
<p>(3) Nothing in this Act affects the operation of the Limitation Act with respect to the right of a person in adverse possession of land comprised in a qualified certificate of title where the possession commenced before the land was brought under the provisions of this Act and that right has been protected by caveat.`</p>

<i>Section 42(2) is the precursor of s 50 of the new LTA. In  <font color="#330099"><strong>Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph</strong></font> <a class="remove" href="SLR:1992:2:161:" href1="SLR:1992:2:161:">  [1992] 2 SLR 161 </a>, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of this court dealt comprehensively with the provisions of the repealed LTA. There the adverse possessor`s occupation of the encroached land began in 1969. On 23 August 1974, the land, of which the encroached land was a part, was brought under the provisions of the repealed LTA then applicable and a qualified certificate of title issued. On 23 June 1988, the registered proprietor of the land lodged a notice of reassertion of ownership. On 27 June 1988, the adverse possessor lodged a caveat claiming an interest as an adverse possessor of the encroached land. It was held that the adverse possessor`s claim fell within s 42(3) in that he had five years` adverse possession before the land became registered land. This was an inchoate interest which crystallised into an indefeasible title by December 1981 and the registered proprietor`s title was thereby extinguished long before he lodged his reassertion of ownership. At p 172 Chan Sek Keong J stated:</i>

<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>`... Having regard to the policy of the LTA in continuing to apply the Limitation Act to registered land, subject only to the provisions of Div 2 of the Act, the short answer must be that unless Div 2 expressly provides to the contrary, the appellant`s title was extinguished long before he lodged his reassertion of ownership. In our view, the lodgment of the reassertion of ownership could not have the effect of reviving a title which had been extinguished by limitation as there is no provision in Div 2 which so provides. A reassertion of ownership is not intended by the LTA to revive an extinct title but to stop the accruing right of an adverse possessor before limitation sets in.`</i>

<i>As Baalman in  <font color="#330099"><strong>The Singapore Torrens Systems</strong></font> <font color="#330099">[1961]  at p 96</font> described, these permitted exceptions under the repealed LTA effectively steered a middle course between exposing the land-register entirely to claims based on adverse possession, and excluding entirely the principle of limitation of action.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>However, as of 1 March 1994, the repealed LTA was repealed by the 1993 LTA. Section 50 of the 1993 LTA is now s 50 of the new LTA. It reads:</i>

<p xmlns=""> </p>

<i>Section 50 of the new LTA is thus similarly worded as s 42(2) of the repealed LTA except for the transitional provisions. Effectively under s 50 of the new LTA, except in limited instances falling within the transitional provisions, no title to registered land could be acquired by adverse possession. These transitional provisions are found in s 172(7) and (8) of the new LTA. Section 172(7) states:</i>

<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>Section 50 of the new LTA therefore provides for the preservation of an adverse possessor`s claim to title in two situations. Firstly, under s 172(7), where the land was registered under the repealed LTA and an application for possessory title had been lodged prior to 1 March 1994. Secondly, under s 172(8) where there was a subsisting entitlement to lodge such an application in respect of such registered land as of 1 March 1994 and the adverse possessor, within six months, makes an application to the court for an order to vest the title in him or lodges an application for possessory title.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">
<br/>
<br/>After referring briefly to an Australian case, the Court of Appeal went on to say (at pp 732-733):  </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>It is therefore clear that, under the new LTA, adverse possession for registered land was to be abolished once and for all, save for the transitional provisions as provided in s 172(7) and (8). But adverse possession of unregistered land is still governed by the Limitation Act as amended by s 177(1) of the 1993 LTA. Section 177 of the 1993 LTA provides as follows:</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p>`(1) Section 9 of the Limitation Act is amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (2), the following subsection:  </p>
<p>(3) This section [referring to s 9 of the Limitation Act] shall not apply to an action to recover land from a person by reason only of his unauthorised occupation of the land. [This subsection is now s 9(3) of the Limitation Act.]  </p>
<p>(2) ...   </p>
<p>(3) Nothing in this section [referring to s 177 of the 1993 LTA] shall -  </p>
<p>(a) enable any action to be brought which was barred by the Limitation Act immediately before the commencement of the Land Titles Act 1993 (referred to in this subsection as the appointed day);  </p>
<p>(b) affect any action commenced before the appointed day; or  </p>
<p>(c) revive any title to land which was extinguished by the operation of the Limitation Act in force immediately before the appointed day.`</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>For convenient reference we set out below the provisions of s 9(1) and (2) of the Limitation Act:</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p>`(1) No action shall be brought by any person to recover any land after the expiration of 12 years from the date on which the right of action accrued to him, or, if it first accrued to some person through whom he claims, to that person.  </p>
<p>(2) Nothing in this section or in section 11(2) shall be deemed to affect the provisions of the Government Proceedings Act, or to apply to any person registered under or by virtue of the provisions of the Land Titles Act as the proprietor of the land sought to be recovered, or to any person claiming through a person so registered, except to the extent that such Act so provides or permits.`</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>Thus s 177 of the 1993 LTA by sub-s 1 amended s 9 of the Limitation Act thereby abolishing claim by way of adverse possession. At the same time by sub-s 3 it preserved rights that had accrued as of 1 March 1994.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>Section 177(3) of the 1993 LTA was omitted from the new LTA. But though omitted, it remains in force by virtue of s 5 of the Revised Edition of the Laws Act (Cap 275) which reads:</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p>`(1) The Commissioners shall omit from the revised edition of Acts such Acts as may be specified by the President by notification in the Gazette.  </p>
<p>(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, such Acts and any Parts, sections or other divisions of such Acts shall remain in force until they have been expressly repealed or have expired or become spent or had effect.`</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>To sum up the position as of 1 March 1994, there were thus three categories of adverse possession claims. Firstly, for land held under the common law system if the adverse possessor did not have 12 years of adverse possession as of 1 March 1994, he would now not be able to make a claim - see s 9(3) of the Limitation Act. Conversely, if he had the requisite 12 years, he could rely on s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA to preserve his possessory title. Secondly, for registered land held under the provisions of the repealed LTA, the adverse possessor could rely on s 172(7) and (8) of the new LTA. Thirdly, for registered land held under the provisions of the new LTA, no adverse possession claims are now allowed unless s 172(7)or (8) of the new LTA applies.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>The question we had to consider was whether the new LTA was intended to apply to claims by way of adverse possession even in respect of registered land in circumstances where the adverse possessor had already acquired title before the land became registered land under the provisions of the new LTA, where a qualified certificate of title was issued and where the adverse possessor had lodged a caveat in respect of his claim.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">
<br/>
<br/>The Court of Appeal then considered the views of the Select Committee on the Land Titles Bill as well as the Parliamentary debates on that Bill (at pp 733-734):  </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>In the Report on the Land Titles Bill, the Select Committee had this to say:</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>`...</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>The amendment will not be retrospective. They will not affect squatters or mortgagees in possession who have already perfected their title by effluxion of time prior to the amendments.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>An adverse possessor who has perfected his claim to a possessory title to unregistered land will not be required to apply to court for a vesting order within a specified time-frame. However, should the land be brought under the Land Titles Act through the issue of a qualified certificate of title, the adverse possessor`s claim will remain protected so long as -</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p>(a) a caution as to title remains on the certificate of title; or  </p>
<p>(b) the adverse possessor lodges a caveat before such caution has lapsed or been cancelled.`</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>This view was reiterated by the Minister for Law, Professor S Jayakumar, when he moved that the Land Titles Bill be read for the third time:</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>`...</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>I also wish to stress that the amendment is not retrospective. It will not affect those in possession who have already acquired their title by adverse possession prior to the amendment coming into force. Nor will such persons in possession be required to apply within a time-frame to the court for an order as to their title to the land.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>I should point out that should any land become registered land through the issue of a qualified certificate of title, an adverse possessor`s claim to the land will remain protected only as long as, first, a caution as to title remains on the certificate of title; and second, the adverse possessor lodges a caveat before such caution has lapsed or been cancelled.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>Secondly, cl 172(9) [now s 172(8) of the new LTA] enables persons who have prior to the coming into operation of the Bill, established their title by way of adverse possession of registered land to apply to court for an order or to the Registrar of Titles for a possessory title. Clause 172(9) has been amended to give such persons six months instead of three months to do so as it was represented to the Select Committee that six months would give more flexibility.`</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">
<br/>
<br/>At the end of the analysis, the Court of Appeal concluded (at p 735):  </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>Thus we agreed with the learned judge when he said that as of 1 March 1994 there were only two categories of adverse possession claims in respect of registered land under the new LTA which were found in s 172(7) and (8) of the same Act. However, it is quite clear that these two categories apply to land which was already registered land as of 1 March 1994 as can be seen from the wording of s 172(7) and (8). For unregistered land or land which becomes registered land after that date, the applicable provisions are s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA.</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>Consistent with this view is <strong> Wong Kok Chin</strong>`s case and also  <font color="#330099"><strong>Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd</strong></font> <a class="remove" href="MLJ:1991:3:234:" href1="MLJ:1991:3:234:">  [1991] 3 MLJ 234 </a> which dealt with a similar claim as that of Balwant`s under the repealed LTA. It was held there that where the adverse possessor had completed the requisite period of 12 years` possession before the land was brought under the repealed Act and a qualified certificate of title issued, the adverse possessor`s interest would still subsist. This is because where there had been 12 years of adverse possession before the land became registered land, the rights of the documentary owner would already have been extinguished before the conversion to registered land. Accordingly s 50 of the new LTA would not apply to defeat the adverse possessor`s accrued claim. The adverse possessor`s claim in those circumstances were preserved by s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA.</i>

<br/>In  <font color="#330099"><strong>Shell Eastern Petroleum v Goh Chor Cheok</strong></font> <a class="remove" href="SLR:2000:1:45:" href1="SLR:2000:1:45:">  [2000] 1 SLR 45 </a>, in or about 1961, when developers built a block of flats on land adjoining the plaintiffs` land,  they built a retaining wall which, it was since discovered, encroached on the plaintiffs` land. By 1973, the plaintiffs` right of action over the encroached portion would have been extinguished. Three events occurred since 1973. Firstly, in November 1992, the plaintiffs` then common law land was brought under the Land Titles Act and a qualified title issued. Secondly, the 1993 amendments to the Land Titles Act limited or abolished the acquisition of title by adverse possession in respect of both common law land and registered land. Thirdly, the caution on the qualified title was cancelled on 2 May 1996 upon the plaintiffs` application and their title became unqualified thereafter. The question before the court was whether any of these three events had any effect on the position, which had been reached by 1973, that action to recover the strip of land in question had become statute-barred. The adverse possessors did not lodge any caveat in respect of the disputed plot.<br/><br/>Warren Khoo J dismissed the plaintiffs` claim. On the question of the failure to lodge a caveat, the judge referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Chan Sek Keong J in  <font color="#330099"><strong>Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph</strong></font> <a class="remove" href="SLR:1992:2:161:" href1="SLR:1992:2:161:">  [1992] 2 SLR 161 </a>:  </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p>11 The relevant provisions of s 20 read as follows:  </p>
<p>`(2) any person claiming an interest in land which was subsisting at the date of issue of a qualified certificate of title for that land may, so long as a caution remains on the folio of the land-register, protect that interest by a caveat pursuant to section 104, and the Registrar shall enter a notification of such a caveat in the land-register.`  </p>
<p>His honour held that the failure to lodge a caveat did not have the effect of reviving the title of the true owner which had been extinguished by limitation. He said:  </p>
<p>`It is clear from s 20 of the Act that until the registered proprietor of land held under qualified title obtains the cancellation of the caution, his title will always be subject to subsisting interests affecting his title.  </p>
<p>The only person who is able to obtain title free from any prior interests affecting such land is a purchaser when that caution expires against him after five years from the date of conversion and when the caution is cancelled on his application.`  </p>
<p>His honour went on to say:  </p>
<p>`The caveat referred to in s 42(3) is intended to protect the rights of an adverse possessor against a purchaser, and not against the registered proprietor. The right of a person in adverse possession of registered land falling within the terms of s 42(3) can only be defeated by a purchaser where such right is not protected by caveat, or by the registered proprietor lodging a reassertion of ownership before his title has been extinguished by limitation.`  </p>
<p>12 Similarly, in the instant case, the plaintiffs` title to the disputed land had been extinguished when the land was brought under the provisions of the Act. The failure of the defendants to lodge a caveat would only have had an adverse effect on them in relation to a purchaser from the plaintiffs. Vis-.-vis the plaintiffs as the original registered proprietor against whom the defendants had acquired title by adverse possession, the absence of a caveat had no effect on the defendants` title.</p>

<i>
<p>27 As for caveats, there is no relevant difference between the provisions of the current Act and those in the repealed Act. Section 27(2) of the current edition of the Act provides as follows:  </p>
<p>`Any person claiming an interest in land which is subsisting at the date of the creation of a qualified folio for that land other than an interest excepted by section 46 may, so long as the folio remains qualified as to title, protect that interest by lodging a caveat pursuant to section 115, and the Registrar shall enter a notification of such a caveat in that folio.`  </p>

<p>34 As for the fact that the defendants have never lodged any caveat to protect their title, here again, that failure is of consequence only in relation to a purchaser, but not in relation to the plaintiffs as the original registered proprietor upon the land being brought under the provisions of the Act. I would regard this point as having been settled by the <strong><i> Wong Kok Chin </i></strong> case. See the dicta of Chan J in the passages earlier set out. I think what he said there is valid in a case where the title has become unqualified as where it has not.</p>

<strong> Conclusion</strong>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i>
<p>35 It is my conclusion, therefore, that the defendants` adverse title, which had matured long before the land was brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Act, remains valid notwithstanding the fact that they never lodged any caveat while the land was subject to qualified title and notwithstanding that the plaintiffs` title has since become unqualified as a result of the cancellation of the caution. The defendants` title, however, stands on an extremely precarious footing. It is exposed to the risk of being over-reached by a purchaser from the plaintiffs, as it has not been notified on the register. That is a consequence to which all persons who have an interest in registered land which is not within the exceptions in s 46 or which has not been notified on the register, are exposed. Whether the defendants can still protect their interest by lodging a caveat in accordance with the general provisions of s 115 is not a matter before me.</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">
<br/>
<br/>Similarly, in  <font color="#330099"><strong>Chuan Hong Auto v Shell Eastern Petroleum</strong></font> <a class="remove" href="SLR:1996:1:415:" href1="SLR:1996:1:415:">  [1996] 1 SLR 415 </a>, the Court of Appeal held that the automatic lapsing of the caution did not affect the interest of equitable lessees of the land who had already lodged a caveat before the lapsing.<br/><br/>The question of law in the present case therefore turns entirely on the effect of the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise not having lodged any caveat against the disputed plot before the expiration of the five-year period provided under s 25(2) of the Land Titles Act. Clearly, the company here is a purchaser of the entire estate or interest within the meaning of that subsection and no fraud has been alleged against it.<br/><br/>Section 42 of the repealed Land Titles Act could not have applied to the land here as it was brought within the registered land regime only in June 1994. For the same reason, s 172(7) and (8) of the present Act can have no application to the land here. This is clear from the Court of Appeal`s reasoning in <strong><i> Balwant Singh </i></strong> (supra). Accordingly, s 177(3) of the 1993 Land Titles Act would protect the  existing rights of the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise if adverse possession of the disputed plot has crystallized before 1 March 1994.<br/><br/>However, there is great force in the company`s arguments that those owners ought to have been vigilant and lodged caveats, particularly as notice of the purchase of the land was given to them back in 1996, although no notice of the conversion to registered title appears to have been similarly given. It would appear from the Select Committee`s Report and the Parliamentary debates that a caveat is an essential step to protecting an adverse possessor`s claim should the land become registered land through the issue of a qualified certificate of title. This was also the view of Warren Khoo J in <strong><i> Shell Eastern Petroleum v Goh Chor Cheok </i></strong>(supra), at least where protection is sought against a purchaser of the registered land. Lodgment of a caveat is permissible under s 27(2) of the Land Titles Act. This is not an entirely new provision. It has a broad equivalent in s 20(2) of the repealed Act (see Warren Khoo J`s judgment in the abovementioned case). However, apart from this general provision which includes interests beyond adverse possession, there is no specific provision along the lines of s 42(3) of the repealed Land Titles Act which spelt out clearly that the right of an adverse possessor was protected only if `that right has been protected by caveat`. I therefore hold that s 177(3) of the 1993 Land Titles Act applies here notwithstanding the failure of the owners to lodge caveats before the lapsing of the caution. The adverse possessors` rights are thereby preserved and Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd`s and the company`s rights have been extinguished.<br/><br/>Accordingly, on the question of law in issue, I held that, if adverse possession has crystallized before 1 March 1994, the owners of 1 and 3 Bedok Rise have become the owners of the disputed plot and their rights and interests over the said plot cannot be overreached by the events thereafter. I also ordered costs to be paid by the company to the said owners in respect of the arguments pertaining to this issue of law.<br/><br/><font color="#800040" size="+1"><strong><a name="Outcome">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p>
