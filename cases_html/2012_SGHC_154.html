<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action concerned a claim in conversion. The
                    acts which were the subject of the complaint in conversion were alleged against
                    the Defendant, McTrans Cargo (S) Pte Ltd, whose Indonesian principal was PT
                    Prolink Logistics (hereinafter the Indonesian principal is referred to as
                    “Prolink” or “Prolink Logistics”). The Defendant
                    denied liability for conversion and alleged, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that (a) it was an innocent agent who acted in good faith
                    in relation to the 30 x 40’ FCL containers (hereinafter referred to as
                    “the 30 FCL containers” or “the subject
                    containers”), and that it was the named consignee appointed by Prolink to
                    receive the subject containers from the carriers, handle the customs clearance
                    process and store the subject containers in Singapore; (b) the detention of the
                    30 FCL containers was in lawful exercise of a possessory lien until storage and
                    ancillary charges were paid, and (c) the Plaintiffs were not entitled to the
                    reliefs claimed as their claims were tainted with illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview of the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       These proceedings have had a lengthy procedural
                    history. The history revealed a striking absence of ordinary commercial
                    behaviour on the part of a small forwarder with limited financial resources like
                    the Defendant. A reasonable and commercially minded party in the
                    Defendant’s position would have been anxious to extricate itself from the
                    legal proceedings soonest possible. Instead, it entrenched itself in these
                    proceedings. By the same token, there were opportunities where the Plaintiffs
                    could have adopted a more robust attitude to reign in matters somewhat so that a
                    full blown trial for a case of this nature could be averted. As it happened, the
                    court proceedings dragged on. Even the duration of the trial was extended from
                    15 days to 20 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       A notable feature of these proceedings was the
                    inconsistent defences adopted by the Defendant that directly advanced
                    Prolink’s dispute with the first three Plaintiffs, and the
                    Defendant’s own case. The Defendant’s conduct at different stages of
                    the proceedings contradicted the Defendant’s proclaimed role of an
                    innocent agent acting in good faith in relation to the 30 FCL containers.
                    Another unusual feature of this case concerned storage charges for the
                    containers and the Defendant’s willingness and apparent ability to keep up
                    with the storage charges that were allegedly incurred and continued to be
                    incurred at a third party warehouse and bonded godown. Significantly, no
                    counterclaim was brought against the Plaintiffs to recover any of the alleged
                    outstanding storage and ancillary charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Writ of Summons issued on 13 October
                    2009 was for the 30 FCL containers in the Defendant’s possession.
                    Thereafter, the Defendant over a period of time released about 83.84% of the
                    total volume of the goods shipped in the 30 FCL containers to various cargo
                    interests. I will refer to this lot of cargo as the “Group A
                    Cargo”. At the time I gave judgment, the Defendant was still in
                    possession of the goods consolidated in three FCL containers (<em>ie</em>, the subject matter of the dispute), and I will refer to them
                    as “the Group B Cargo”. The three FCL containers were detained at
                    two locations: Goodway Agencies (Shipping) Pte Ltd at Keppel District Park
                    (“Goodway Agencies”) and at PSA Keppel Godown F5 Module K
                    (“PSA Godown F5”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the early days of the trial, I was surprised
                    to learn that the parties had no idea of what the value of the Group B Cargo was
                    and the state of its condition since the last survey conducted in late April
                    2010. It was amazing to see this case come all the way to trial with little
                    inkling and concern on the part of the Defendant as to whether or not the value
                    of the Group B Cargo exceeded the relatively sizable outstanding charges
                    indicated by the Defendant. The condition of the Group B Cargo ought also to
                    have concerned the Plaintiffs since delivery up was their alternative relief. On
                    my prompting, the parties agreed to conduct a condition survey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I found myself sufficiently troubled at the
                    early days of the trial to inquire about the Defendant’s intentions. Here
                    was a Defendant who had professed to have no personal knowledge of the subject
                    matter of the various disputes in Indonesia but nonetheless had taken upon
                    itself the task of proving all sorts of matters about liens and relationships
                    arising from bailment as well as the subject of the decisions of the Indonesian
                    courts in connection with the 30 FCL containers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It was incomprehensible that the Defendant, who
                    had claimed a lien and who had actually withheld the 30 FCL containers until the
                    Defendant’s and Prolink’s charges and expenses were paid, had real
                    difficulties working out the total amount that was being secured by the exercise
                    of the lien for the charges and expenses. Certainly, the difficulties it
                    displayed undermined the credibility of the Defendant’s claim. By the end
                    of the trial, it was patently clear that the Defendant’s claim of lien to
                    justify the detention of the containers was illusory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The two matters that occupied most of the trial
                    were the proprietary title of the 4<sup>th</sup> to
                        8<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs, the
                        10<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup>
                    Plaintiffs and the 15<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs, and the
                    Defendant’s illegality defence. Essentially, these Plaintiffs were put to
                    strict proof of their proprietary title. As for the illegality plea, was there
                    really a case for the illegality defence? Notably, the Group A Cargo was
                    released despite the Defendant’s position on illegality. It appeared that
                    the Defendant was willing to admit that the illegality did not go to the
                    Plaintiffs’ rights to the Group B Cargo so long as they paid for their
                    release. The Defendant’s illegality defence involved allegations that the
                    Plaintiffs smuggled the goods in the 30 FCL containers in contravention of
                    Indonesian customs law and regulations to defraud the Indonesian customs
                    authority, but no expert witness was called to testify on Indonesian law. This
                    led to a late application to call an expert on Indonesian law. Suffice it to say
                    that the application was dismissed for reasons that will be explained later in
                    this Grounds of Decision. There were also other legal and evidential problems
                    that caused the illegality defence to fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 27 February 2012, I gave judgment in
                    favour of the 4<sup>th</sup> to
                        8<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> Plaintiffs,
                        10<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> to
                        13<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup>
                        Plaintiffs<sup></sup>and the 15<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup>
                    Plaintiff with damages to be assessed. I will refer to<sup></sup>the 4<sup>th</sup> to
                        8<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs, the
                        10<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> to
                        13<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs and the
                        15<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs as “the Group B
                    Plaintiffs”. I also found the Defendant liable in conversion as against
                    the first three Plaintiffs, and granted them a declaration that the Defendant
                    was to indemnify them against all liabilities and losses incurred arising from
                    the conversion of the Group A Cargo and Group B Cargo. As for the
                        14<sup>th</sup> and
                        16<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> Plaintiffs, their
                    claims were dismissed with costs due to their failure to file Affidavits of
                    Evidence-in-Chief and their non-attendance during the trial.<sup></sup>The 9<sup>th</sup> Plaintiff’s claim had
                    also been earlier dismissed by the Assistant Registrar on 4 October 2010
                    due to its failure to file a list of documents for discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Dramatis Personae</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It would be convenient to begin by briefly
                    identifying the parties to the proceedings, the individuals and their
                    participation in the events giving rise to these proceedings, and those who gave
                    evidence at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The first three Plaintiffs were companies
                    incorporated in Singapore. The companies operated a door-to-door service for
                    shipment of goods from Singapore to Jakarta, Indonesia. The first three
                    Plaintiffs would consolidate goods belonging to different customers into
                    containers for outward shipment to Jakarta. On arrival at the warehouses
                    designated by the first three Plaintiffs in Jakarta, the containers would be
                    devanned and the parcels within separated and delivered to the first three
                    Plaintiffs’ customers or to their order. At the Indonesian end, insofar as
                    the first three Plaintiffs (who acted as main forwarders) were concerned, they
                    used agents to receive the containers and to arrange for customs clearance and
                    container transport to the designated warehouses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Tie Hari Mulya (“Hari”) was a
                    director of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs. Hari’s wife, Linda Irawaty
                    Lim, was the sole director and shareholder of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Plaintiff. The first three Plaintiffs were managed by Hari and his wife. Hari
                    was the person who made arrangements with Nurdian Cuaca (“Cuaca”)
                    in respect of the door-to-door services required to be performed at the
                    Indonesian end for the outward shipment to Indonesia in February 2009 and the
                    return shipment to Singapore in September 2009. Hari gave evidence at the trial
                    on behalf of the first three Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Lola Heng Kim Mui (“Lola”) was
                    the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff’s shipping administrator who
                    coordinated the consolidation and shipment of the subject containers from
                    Singapore to Jakarta, Indonesia for discharge and delivery at the container yard
                    designated as “Jakarta UTC 1”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Lola had liaised with Radius Artha
                    Djaya (“Radius”) of Prolink Logistics on the documentation for the
                    subject containers to be landed at “Jakarta UTC 1” in February
                    2009. She again liaised with Radius on the documentation for the shipment of the
                    subject containers back to Singapore in September 2009. Lola’s impression
                    from her association with Radius was that the latter was from Prolink
                        Logistics.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Lola testified at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Kim Sutandi Tan (“Kim”) was the
                    first three Plaintiffs’ representative in Jakarta. Kim testified at the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Cuaca was an Indonesian in the freight
                    forwarding and logistics business. He was Hari’s business associate of
                    four years prior to the outward shipment of the subject containers from
                    Singapore to Jakarta in February 2009. Through Hari, the first three Plaintiffs
                    had an oral arrangement with Cuaca who through Prolink, would handle the
                    receipt, custom clearance and container transport to warehouses designated by
                    the first three Plaintiffs. For these services, they would be paid by the first
                    three Plaintiffs. Cuaca did not testify at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In May 2009, Hari agreed with Cuaca to appoint
                    Jonny Abbas (“Jonny”) to arrange for the subject containers to be
                    shipped back to Singapore under three bills of lading, two of which were issued
                    by APL Co Pte Ltd (“APL”) on 17 September 2009 and one by
                    Samudera Shipping Line Ltd (“Samudera”) on 17 September 2009.
                    The three bills of lading are collectively referred to as “the September
                    B/Ls”. Jonny and Radius were the controllers of Prolink Logistics and PT
                    Prolink Clare (“Prolink Clare”). Prolink Clare was the party named
                    on the September B/Ls as shipper of the subject containers. The name Prolink
                    Clare also appeared in some documents used in this case. Jonny and Radius did
                    not testify at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Defendant was the consignee named on the
                    September B/Ls and was at all material times the agent appointed by Prolink
                    Logistics. Fabian Tan (“Fabian”), the sales director of the
                    Defendant was Jonny’s contact. Fabian took instructions from Jonny in
                    relation to the subject containers. Fabian testified at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Two other groups also testified at the trial.
                    They were the cargo interests (hereinafter referred to as “the cargo

                    Plaintiffs purchased goods from suppliers in Singapore and other countries, and
                    they individually appointed either the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff or 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Plaintiff to provide door-to-door freight forwarding services from Singapore to
                    Jakarta. The last two persons who took the witness stand were the surveyors of
                    the Group B Cargo.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">February 2009 shipment from Singapore to Jakarta</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first stage was the outward shipment from
                    Singapore to Indonesia of the 30 FCL containers in February 2009 (“the
                    February shipment”). In this case, the cargo owners (including the Group
                    B Plaintiffs) purchased general goods from suppliers in Singapore and other
                    countries, and they individually appointed either the
                        1<sup>st</sup><sup></sup>Plaintiff, 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff or
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiff as their freight forwarders to
                    provide door-to-door freight forwarding services. For their services, the
                    customers were charged an “all-in-price”. In January 2009 to early
                    February 2009, the customers’ general goods were consolidated and stuffed
                    into 40’ containers by Euro-Trans Logistics Pte Ltd
                    (“Euro-Trans”) who was appointed by the first three Plaintiffs.
                    Besides Euro-Trans, Lola had appointed the Defendant to stuff two
                    full-container-load of general cargo. Thereafter, the 30 FCL containers were
                    shipped on board the vessels <em>Sinar Sumba</em> and
                        <em>APL Shenzhen</em> pursuant to three bills of lading
                    – B/L No APLU 057309975 and B/L No APLU 057309976 both dated
                    18 February 2009, and B/L No SSLSGJK1CHB682 dated 15 February 2009
                    (collectively, “the February B/Ls”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The February B/Ls were surrendered in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Upon the vessels’ arrival at the port of
                    discharge, the carriers were to deliver the subject containers to the consignees
                    named on the February B/Ls. It transpired that the carriers could not deliver
                    the subject containers and they were left at a designated area known as the
                    Temporary Hoarding Area (TPS) which was presumably used by the carriers’
                    seeing that the first three Plaintiffs had to pay demurrage to carriers when the
                    time came to ship the subject containers back to Singapore in September
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     According to Hari, he met Cuaca in Jakarta in
                    February 2009. At this meeting Cuaca informed him that there was a delay as the
                    30 FCL containers had not yet cleared Indonesian customs. Cuaca was instructed
                    to look into sending the 30 FCL containers back to Singapore if delays
                    persisted. It transpired, and this was not disputed by the parties, that Prolink
                    had written to the Indonesian customs authority for permission to take out the
                    30 FCL containers in order to ship them back to Singapore on 26 February
                    2009. Under Indonesian regulations, the Indonesian customs authority had to give
                    its decision within 30 days of the export request. Contrary to the regulations,
                    the Indonesian customs authority replied on 18 June 2009, after more than 3
                    months, and in its reply rejected Prolink’s request. Prolink then turned
                    to the Jakarta State Administrative Court (“JSA Court”) to review
                    the Indonesian customs authority’s decision. On 14 August 2009, the
                    JSA Court decided that the Indonesian customs authority’s decision of
                    18 June 2009 was made out of time and directed the latter to issue a
                    “decision letter” to permit export of the February
                        shipment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">September 2009 shipment from Jakarta to Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     This stage concerned the shipment of the 30
                    FCL containers from Jakarta to Singapore in September 2009 (“the
                    September shipment”). After the decision of the JSA Court, Cuaca in
                    August 2009 informed Hari that the Indonesian customs authority had finally
                    permitted the February shipment to be returned to Singapore. Hari and Cuaca
                    agreed that the February shipment was to be returned to the first three
                    Plaintiffs, and the arrangement was to name the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Plaintiff as consignee on the bills of lading.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Kim had liaised with Jonny on the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In early September 2009, Jonny allegedly
                    requested payment of US$170,000 for the carriers, APL and Samudera, and Rp 1.2

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     Rp 1.2 billion being the demurrage fees (specifically for

                    representative of the first three Plaintiffs, went to APL’s Jakarta office
                    on 17 September 2009 and obtained pro-forma bills of lading, B/L No APLU
                    073913272 and B/L No APLU 073913274.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff was named as consignee on both

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, things went awry for the first three
                    Plaintiffs thereafter. I noticed from the September B/Ls that the 30 FCL
                    containers were shipped on board the vessel <em>Sinar
                        Sumba</em> on 17 September 2009. Kim learned of the change in the
                    name of the consignee on 18 September 2009. She was informed on
                    18 September 2009 at 11 am by Samudera’s manager, one Dwi, by text
                    message that the consignee for the Samudera bill of lading, B/L No
                    SSLJKSINCF7963, had been changed to the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Kim asked
                    Jonny about the sudden change of consignee, but was simply told to inform Hari
                    to contact Cuaca. On the same day, Kim also received a call from one Mr Paulus
                    from APL’s Jakarta office. Mr Paulus informed her that the APL bills of
                    lading had been telex-released to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Hari then tried to call Cuaca. When they
                    eventually spoke sometime on 18 September 2009, Cuaca assured Hari that
                    although the September B/Ls had named the Defendant as consignee, he would
                    arrange for the 30 FCL containers to be released to the first three
                        Plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It was against the backdrop of the narrative
                    set out above that the Defendant took possession of the 30 FCL containers from
                    the carriers on 19 September 2009 and stored them with Goodway Agencies and
                    at PSA Godown F5 pending instructions from Prolink.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal proceedings against the Defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Despite Cuaca’s promise to Hari, the
                    September shipment was not released to the first three Plaintiffs in Singapore.
                    As the evidence unfolded, the change of consignee from the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to the Defendant had to do with
                    Prolink’s claim of Rp 45 billion against the first three Plaintiffs, and
                    Prolink wanted to be paid before the first three Plaintiffs could have the
                    subject containers. The first three Plaintiffs’ attempts to secure release
                    of the 30 FCL containers including contacting the Defendant for the same were
                    unsuccessful. On 8 October 2009, Hari met Cuaca during which Cuaca demanded
                    that the first three Plaintiffs pay a further Rp 45 billion for the release of
                    the 30 FCL containers in Singapore. Hari rejected his demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the meantime, on Prolink’s
                    instructions the 30 FCL containers were unstuffed between 25 September 2009
                    and 12 October 2009. Radius was present at the unstuffing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     After their earlier failed attempts to contact
                    the Defendant for the release of the 30 FCL containers, the first three
                    Plaintiffs appointed Messrs Rajah &amp; Tann (“R&amp;T”), to write
                    to the Defendant on 12 October 2009 demanding that the Defendant deliver up
                    the subject containers to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs. The
                    Defendant did not respond by the deadline stipulated in R&amp;T’s letter
                    of demand. Thereafter, the first three Plaintiffs instituted these proceedings
                    on 13 October 2009 and, at the same time, applied for a mandatory
                    injunction <em>vide</em> Summons No 5358 of 2009
                    (“SUM 5358/2009”) to compel the Defendant to deliver up the
                    subject containers. The Defendant responded with an application to strike out
                    the Writ of Summons <em>vide</em> Summons No 5649 of 2009
                    (“SUM 5649/2009”) on 29 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I will refer to the two applications
                        (<em>ie</em>, SUM 5358/2009 and SUM 5649/2009) as
                    “the 2009 Interlocutory Applications”, and affidavits filed in
                    relation thereto as “the Interlocutory Affidavits”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Arrangements between Prolink and the Defendant to release
                cargo</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In his Interlocutory Affidavit filed on
                    29 October 2009, Fabian said that he was contacted by Prolink Logistics on
                    or about 14 or 15 September 2009 to receive the 30 FCL containers. More
                    than a year later, in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief affirmed in May 2011,
                    the contact date was changed to on or about 18 September 2009. The next
                    day, <em>ie</em> 19 September 2009, the Defendant took
                    delivery of the 30 FCL containers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     At the time the instructions to receive the
                    subject containers were given either on 14, 15 or 18 September 2009, the
                    fact of the matter was that in September 2009, Prolink had clearly <em>no</em> authority to represent the cargo owners or deal with
                    their goods. However, the situation had changed by the time Fabian filed his
                    Interlocutory Affidavit on 29 October 2009 whereby Fabian stated in
                    paragraph 11 that the Defendant was obliged to “take instructions from PT
                    Prolink Logistics Indonesia on behalf of the owners of the Cargo with regards to
                    the distribution of the Cargo to the owners of the Cargo in Singapore.”
                    It transpired from a later Interlocutory Affidavit filed on 19 November
                    2009 that Fabian was alluding to Powers of Attorney granted to Prolink by the
                    owners of the Group A Cargo<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> (“the Prolink POAs”). It
                    was nonetheless clear that as at 29 October 2009, the Defendant did not
                    have copies of the Prolink POAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     What happened was that Prolink had contacted
                    various cargo owners (<em>ie</em>, the first three
                    Plaintiffs’ customers) to secure the appointment of Prolink Logistics
                    and/or Prolink Clare as attorney to deal with the goods in the Defendant’s
                    possession, and Prolink also concurrently sought the revocation of the authority
                    previously given to the first three Plaintiffs. Powers of Attorney were executed
                    at various dates ranging from 14 October 2009 to 13 November 2009. It
                    is worthwhile setting out the text of the standard Power of Attorney, and in
                    particular the paragraph revoking the authority of the first three

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I now turn to the Defendant’s Further
                    &amp; Better Particulars filed on 22 June 2010 (“June
                    F&amp;PB”) wherein the Defendant acknowledged that Fabian had received
                    oral instructions from Jonny to release the cargo <em>from about
                        the first week of October 2009</em> to the third week of November
                    2009. This was despite the Defendant’s averment that it did not know the
                    dates that the Prolink POAs were granted since it was Prolink who had obtained
                        them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> However, it
                    was clear that Fabian had wanted the release of the goods to be authorised by
                    cargo owners. Prolink POAs were granted to either Prolink Clare or to both
                    Prolink Logistics and Prolink Clare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In addition, the June F&amp;BP stated the
                    actual release of cargo started as early as 13 October 2009 to Comstar
                    Mobile Pte Ltd (“Comstar”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The documentation covering the cargo

                    to the Defendant dated 12 October 2009, which was marked for Fabian’s

                    acknowledge receipt of the goods. This release to Comstar on 13 October
                    2009 was <em>before</em> the Power of Attorney was executed
                    by Comstar on 14 October 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Another instance of an early

                    covering the cargo released to UBTS Technologies (“UTBS”) on

                    authorisation to the Defendant dated 13 October 2009 and marked for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As at 19 November 2009, the Group A Cargo

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Joinder of 4<sup>th</sup> to
                    16<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs in 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     After the Group A Cargo was released, R&amp;T,
                    on behalf of the remaining cargo owners, repeatedly asked the Defendant to
                    provide the full claim amount of the charges and expenses allegedly owing to the
                    Defendant so that the cargo owners could consider payment into court <em>in lieu</em> of the Defendant withholding the Group B Cargo
                    as security. No figure on the quantum was forthcoming. I would venture to state
                    that had the Plaintiffs taken a more robust attitude on this issue, the illusory
                    lien would have come to light much earlier in the proceedings. Instead, their
                    response was to file an application to join the 4<sup>th</sup>
                    to 16<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs to the action, and an order was
                    obtained on 25 January 2010. Their pleaded case was conversion by
                    detention: that the Group B Cargo was detained by the Defendant, and that this
                    detention amounted to conversion. The Defendant adopted the same three defences
                    outlined in [1] above against the Group B Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outcome of the Interlocutory Applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     SUM 5358/2009 (<em>ie</em>, the Plaintiffs’ application for mandatory injunction
                    to deliver up) was adjourned numerous times. Eventually, no order was made on
                    SUM 5358/2009 on the final hearing on 28 June 2010. The issue of costs of
                    the application was reserved to the trial Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     SUM No 5649/2009 (<em>ie</em>, the defendant’s application to strike out the Writ of
                    Summons) was dismissed by the Assistant Registrar on 20 January
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The main issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The claim in this action was in conversion.
                    The determinative issues raised by the Defendant to challenge the claim in
                    conversion were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     Issue 1: Conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       Whether the Plaintiffs had
                                <em>locus standi</em> to sue the Defendant in
                            conversion; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Whether the Defendant was an “innocent
                            agent”, and if not, whether its conduct amounted to acts of
                            conversion rather than mere ministerial acts of a <em>bona fide</em> intermediary.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     Issue 2: Possessory lien as a defence
                        to conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       Whether the Defendant
                            enjoyed a lien over the September shipment including the Group B Cargo
                            and was entitled to claim storage and other charges pursuant to a
                            possessory lien.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     Issue 3: Illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       Whether the
                            Plaintiffs’ claim was tainted by illegality and as such the
                            Plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs
                    claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I will set out the grounds for my decision on
                    Issue 1 first. The other two issues were easily disposed of primarily because
                    they were not made out as a matter of law and evidence. The Defendant’s
                    blunderbuss arguments not only undermined the credibility of its defences, but
                    also contributed to this lengthy Grounds of Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     To succeed in a claim for conversion, a
                    plaintiff must show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     it has actual possession of, or the
                        right to immediate possession of the chattel converted; and
                    that</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     the right to
                        sue for conversion existed at the time of the conversion; and
                    that</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     the defendant
                        acted in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff’s superior
                        possessory title.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These elements have been set out in
                        <em>The Cherry </em><em>and
                        others</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 471 at [58] (<em>“The Cherry”</em>) and <em>Tat Seng
                        Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Leasing Singapore Ltd</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 (“<em>Tat
                        Seng</em>”) (see also <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell
                        on Torts</em> (Michael A Jones &amp; Anthony Dugdale gen and
                    consultant eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2010) (“<em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>”); and Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee
                    Pey Woan, <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> (Academy
                    Publishing, 2011) (“<em>The Law of Torts in
                        Singapore</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Conversion can take many forms. At its core,
                    an act of conversion occurs when there is an unauthorised taking of possession
                    of a chattel with the “intention of exercising a permanent or temporary
                    dominion over it” (<em>Tat Seng</em> at [45]
                    affirming R F V Heuston and R A Buckley, <em>Salmond &amp;
                        Heuston on the Law of Torts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 1996);
                    see also <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> at para 17-09 to
                    17-10). Conversion has also been characterised as “conduct which has the
                    effect of denying the claimant of his superior possessory title in the
                    goods” (<em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at
                    para 11.004 citing Sarah Green &amp; John Randall, <em>The Tort
                        of Conversion</em> (Hart Publishing, 2009) at p 65–66).
                    Generally, it is not a viable defence to a claim in conversion that the
                    defendant was ignorant of the plaintiff’s rights or was merely acting
                    innocently as an agent for someone else (<em>Clerk &amp;
                        Lindsell</em> at para 17-72 to 17-73).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     However, an innocent agent’s act in
                    ignorance of the plaintiff’s rights has been successfully raised as a
                    defence in cases involving an intermediary agent whose act was seen as <em>prima facie</em> ministerial because it was performed in good
                    faith and without notice of his principal’s lack of title. Given the
                    factual scenario outlined, it is hardly surprising that no presumption of a
                    conversion can be raised (<em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> at
                    para 17-75). The Court of Appeal in <em>Tat Seng</em> held
                    at [48] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]n intermediary who stores goods, such as a forwarding agent who packs
                        and ships goods or a warehouse operator, does not render himself liable in
                        conversion merely because his employer has no title, if he acts in good
                        faith (see <em>Clerk and Lindsell</em> ...at
                        para 17-71). However, where an intermediary agent, such as an auctioneer,
                        interferes with the title of the true owner by making a sale on behalf of a
                        person without title or proper authority, altogether different
                        considerations apply. In the former instance, there is a long line of
                        established authority that accepts that the temporary possession by the
                        carrier or warehouse operator does not <em>sufficiently
                            interfere</em> with the title to the goods to warrant
                        liability for conversion (see [57]–[64] below). It will
                        be readily appreciated that in the latter case the involvement of the agent
                        is not merely ministerial. An auctioneer's conduct goes beyond the mere
                        transport or storage of goods and constitutes a <em>substantial and real interference</em> with title as he is
                        asked to sell the goods (see [65] below). However, <b><em>it is not always easy to draw a distinction between justifiable
                            handling and acts of conversion when different types of
                            intermediaries handle goods. In the ultimate analysis, the degree of
                            involvement is crucial, as is the question of whether the intermediary
                            was acting in the ordinary course of business.</em></b></p>

                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The underlying rationale of the line of cases
                    on innocent intermediaries was explained in <em>Tat
                        Seng</em> (at [58]) as arising from “the compelling need to
                    ameliorate the hardship engendered by the remedy of conversion... for
                    intermediaries who deal[t] with goods in good faith”. Thus, in <em>Francis Hollins v George Fowler</em> (1874–5)
                    LR 7 HL 757 (“<em>Fowler</em>”) at 766–767 (affirmed in <em>Tat Seng</em> at [58]–[60]), Blackburn J observed
                    in <em>Fowler</em> that:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The facts of <em>Tat

                    (“Orix”) leased a Heidelberg 4-colour off-set print machine
                    (‘the machine”) to a company, Rav Graphics Pte Ltd
                    (“RGPL”), on hire-purchase terms. In 2006, RGPL shifted its office
                    from Toh Guan to new premises. One Crispian Tan (“Crispian”) who
                    was a director and shareholder of RGPL hired Kenzone Logistics Pte Ltd
                    (“Kenzone”) to facilitate the shift. Kenzone then approached Tat
                    Seng to transport the machine to the new premises. The initial instruction from
                    RGPL was to shift the machine to a warehouse owned by a third party, Hock Cheong
                    Transport Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The warehouse refused to accept the machine
                    when Tat Seng’s lorries arrived. Kenzone then requested Tat Seng to
                    provide temporary storage space for the machine. Tat Seng stored the machine for
                    four days until 4 September 2006, when it was removed from their premises
                    at the request of Crispian and loaded on Malaysian-registered trailers pursuant
                    to an alleged sale that Crispian had arranged. Orix sued Tat Seng for conversion
                    of the machine.</p>

                    where the burden of proof lies) where a defendant seeks to rely on the argument
                    that it is an innocent intermediary:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    When an allegation of conversion is made
                            against a carrier (which includes, in the present summary of principles,
                            a bailee such as a warehouse operator), typically, <b><em>the carrier will be able to absolve itself from a finding of actual

                            plead in its defence the relevant facts it intends to rely on to show
                            that it reasonably acted in the ordinary course of business. <b><em>To discharge this burden of proof, we think that the

                                in the course of its ordinary business.</em></b> What will usually
                            be important is the nature of the defendant-carrier's business, how it
                            is normally engaged and the particular circumstances in which it
                            received and carried out the terms of the relevant

                            were the subject of competing claims or that the circumstances in which
                            the engagement was either received or carried out were unusual. If the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     With the above principles and guidance in
                    mind, I now turn to the various issues identified earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiffs’ legal standing to sue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first three Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It is reasonably clear that all that is
                    required to sue in conversion is a right to immediate possession. This right to
                    immediate possession arises from the existence of a legal relationship of bailor
                    and bailee as a matter of general principle of law on bailment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I examined the course of dealings to see
                    whether the first three Plaintiffs and the customers who had engaged them for
                    their door-to-door freight forwarding services in respect of the subject
                    containers stood in a bailor and bailee relationship. I was satisfied that the
                    evidence supported the relationship as described. It was not disputed that the
                    first three Plaintiffs received and through Euro Trans (who was appointed by the
                    first three Plaintiffs) consolidated the goods into containers. At the
                    consolidation stage, so far as the possession of the goods was concerned, the
                    legal position is that the goods were sub-bailed to Euro-Trans into whose actual
                    possession the goods came into. The Defendant was also involved with the
                    consolidation of goods into two other containers. More importantly, the 30 FCL
                    containers were loaded on board the vessels <em>Sinar
                        Sumba</em> and <em>APL Shenzhen</em> for carriage
                    from Singapore to Jakarta for discharge and delivery at Jakarta UTC 1 container
                    yard. During this voyage by sea, the carriers were in possession of the 30 FCL
                    containers as sub-bailees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The first three Plaintiffs had appointed, as
                    their receiving agent, Prolink Logistics (which Hari believed was Cuaca’s
                    company), to make the necessary arrangements for customs clearance of the 30 FCL
                    containers and other services for which the first three Plaintiffs had
                    undertaken responsibility <em>vis-à-vis</em> their
                    customers. As such, the first three Plaintiffs would have had a right of
                    indemnity against their sub-bailee in respect of any loss that the first three
                    Plaintiffs might incur.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It was not disputed that it was the
                    responsibility of the first three Plaintiffs <em>vis-à-vis</em> their customers to send back the 30 FCL containers to
                    Singapore after the carriers could not deliver the 30 FCL containers. After all,
                    the first three Plaintiffs as head bailees under the door-to-door service
                    agreement with their customers who had purchased the goods were entitled, if not
                    obliged, to protect and preserve the February shipment. It was not surprising,
                    and it was clear on the evidence, that the first three Plaintiffs had appointed
                    their receiving agent (<em>ie</em>, sub-bailee), Prolink
                    Logistics, to arrange for the 30 FCL containers to be shipped back to
                    Singapore. The first three Plaintiffs’ rights and interests in the
                    30 FCL containers were acknowledged by Cuaca and/or Prolink as evident from
                    the efforts they took to keep the subject containers out of the control and
                    possession of the first three Plaintiffs in order to pressurise Hari into paying
                    what Prolink wanted. It was not clear on the admissible evidence what the
                    precise dispute between Hari and Cuaca and/or Prolink was save that Hari was
                    asked to pay Rp 45 billion. Their dispute presumably had to do with
                    services of Prolink that were rendered to the first three
                Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     After permission to ship back the subject
                    containers was obtained, it was incumbent upon Prolink to ensure that the
                    subject containers were consigned to the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Plaintiff as instructed by the first three Plaintiffs, and not to unilaterally
                    send the subject containers to a different consignee. By reason of the
                    unauthorised switch of consignee to the Defendant as Prolink’s agent, I
                    held that the sub-bailment ended and the right of possession to the bailed
                    property (<em>ie</em>, the 30 FCL containers)
                    re-vested in the first three Plaintiffs as the head bailees (<em>Tat </em><em>Seng</em> at [52]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The legal position (as I found) was that the
                    first three Plaintiffs had (as early as 18 September 2009, and certainly by
                    13 October 2009) a cause of action in conversion against Prolink, and the
                    cause of action could not be extinguished by virtue of the fact that Prolink had
                    purported to perfect (or perfected) its subsequent possessory title to the goods
                    by virtue of the Prolink POAs obtained from the owners of the Group A
                    Cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In the circumstances, the true nature of the
                    Defendant’s title to the goods (as I found as a determination of a
                    preliminary question on 15 November 2011) was a bare possessory title. The
                    Defendant’s title was only as good as its principal’s. The
                    Defendant’s bare possessory right was limited in the sense that the
                    Defendant could retain the goods until a party with a superior interest came
                    into the picture to ask for the goods. Lightman J in <em>Costello v Chief Constable of Derbyshire Constabulary</em>
                    [2001] EWCA Civ 381 at [14] affirmed the principles laid down in
                        <em>Webb v Chief Constable of Merseyside Police</em>
                    [2000] 2 WLR 546 on the strength of a party’s bare possessory
                    title as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    The fact of possession of a chattel of itself
                            gives to the possessor a possessory title and the possessor is entitled
                            to rely on such title without reference to the circumstances in which
                            such possession was obtained: his entitlement to do so is not prejudiced
                            by the fact that he obtained such possession unlawfully or under an
                            illegal transaction. His claim can only be defeated by proof of a title
                            superior to his possessory title;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  In the case of competing claims to ownership, (in
                            the case of personalty as in the case of realty), titles are relative
                            and the issue falls to be determined by reference to the relative
                            strengths of the two claims and the party with the better title (however
                            frail it may be) is entitled to succeed...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The fact that the Defendant was the named
                    consignee on the September B/Ls did not add anything to its bare possessory
                    title. As named consignee on a bill of lading, this status merely gave the
                    Defendant a contractual right to obtain delivery of the containers <em>vis-à-vis</em> the carrier (Sir Richard Aikens, Richard Lord
                    and Michael Bools, <em>Bills of Lading</em> (Informa Law,
                    2006) at para 5.3 (“<em>Bills of
                    Lading</em>”)). This proposition was succinctly laid down by the
                    court in <em>The “Future Express”</em> [1992]
                    2 Lloyd’s Law Reports 79 at 96 (which was affirmed on
                    appeal in <em>The “Future Express”</em>
                    [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Law Reports 542) (see also <em>Bills of Lading</em> at para 5.11 to 5.18):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As to the second reason why the transfer of the bills [of lading] did not
                        operate as an attornment... once it is held that the effect of a transfer of
                        a bill of lading depends on the presumed intention of the parties, then it
                        makes sense <em>only to recognize that the parties have used
                            a bill of lading to pass constructive possession of the goods to the
                            transferee if it was intended that following the transfer the transferee
                            should have some property in or possessory right to the goods. This
                            seems to me the reason why there is no reported case where the law has
                            provided a remedy to a party who can establish no more than that he is
                            the lawful holder of a bill of lading.</em> It may therefore be
                        impossible for a party who acquires no property in or possessory right to
                        the goods to establish a title to sue the owners [in conversion for example]
                        by virtue of an attornment arising simply from the transfer of the
                        bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Therefore, as between the first three
                    Plaintiffs and the Defendant, the former as head bailees had a title superior to
                    the Defendant’s bare possessory title to the 30 FCL containers. The first
                    three Plaintiffs had the right to immediate possession of the 30 FCL containers,
                    and, therefore, had the right to sue the Defendant in conversion on
                    13 October 2009. This was clearly the legal position until their authority
                    to act for the owners of the Group A Cargo was revoked by the Prolink POAs
                    obtained between 14 October 2009 and 13 November 2009. However, the
                    first three Plaintiffs continued to enjoy the right to immediate possession of
                    the Group B Cargo as against the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Group B Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Defendant also challenged the Group B
                    Plaintiffs’ proprietary title to the Group B Cargo. For easier reading of
                    this already lengthy Grounds of Decision, the detailed findings on this issue
                    are found in Annexure A to this Grounds of Decision. Suffice it to say for
                    present purposes that I found for the Group B Plaintiffs on the issue of
                    proprietary title. I was satisfied on the evidence that they had fully paid for
                    their respective goods. Representatives of the Group B Plaintiffs and, in some
                    cases, the suppliers from whom they purchased the goods came to testify that the
                    goods were paid for. Whilst the Defendant tried to attack some of Group B
                    Plaintiffs’ proprietary title for the incomplete documentary proof, the
                    overall evidence on a balance of probabilities was in favour of the Group B
                    Plaintiffs’ claim to proprietary title. An added factor in their favour
                    was that at no point in time had any other person come forward to make an
                    adverse claim for the goods. I was satisfied with the evidence on the Group B
                    Plaintiffs’ proprietary title, and I found in their favour on the issue of
                    ownership of the Group B Cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Besides their proprietary title, counsel for
                    the Plaintiffs, Mr Winston Kwek (“Mr Kwek”), submitted that the
                    Group B Plaintiffs had the right to immediate possession by virtue of their
                    “paramount possessory rights” as owners of the Group B
                        Cargo<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>, with the reversionary interests or
                    title to sue for their respective goods in the Group B Cargo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I digress for a moment to emphasise that
                    ownership is neither a necessary nor determinative criterion for the purposes of
                    determining whether a party can sue for conversion (see <em>Tat
                        Seng</em> at [49] affirming <em>"The Cherry"</em>
                    at [58] and [64]). Ownership and the right to immediate possession are distinct
                    concepts and the distinction is important in a claim for conversion (see
                    generally <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at para
                    11.020 for an explanation of this distinction in a claim for
                conversion).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Returning to the Group B Plaintiffs’
                    status, I was satisfied that the Group B Plaintiffs enjoyed the right to
                    immediate possession as bailors of their respective shares in the Group B Cargo.
                    This is notwithstanding the evidence that the Group B Plaintiffs never came into
                    actual possession of the Group B Cargo – actual possession of the goods is
                    not necessary to constitute a party as bailor (<em>Belvoir
                        Finance Co Ltd v Stapleton</em> [1971] 1 QB 219 at 217
                        (“<em>Belvoir”</em>)). The learned
                    authors of <em>Goods in Transit and Freight Forwarding</em>
                    (Sweet and Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2010) thus noted at p 165:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There can be a bailment by an owner without his ever having taken
                        possession of the chattel bailed so long as the title to it or at least the
                        right to possess it has passed to him. Generally it is not necessary for the
                        bailor himself to have made the actual delivery of the goods to the
                        bailee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>Belvoir</em>, the
                    plaintiff finance company purchased three cars from motor dealers. Belgravia Car
                    Hire Co Ltd (“Belgravia”) obtained these cars from the plaintiff
                    under a hire-purchase agreement. Belgravia then let these cars out on hire. The
                    plaintiff did not take actual possession of the cars; the cars were instead
                    delivered by the dealers directly to Belgravia. The defendant, Belgravia’s
                    assistant manager, subsequently sold the three cars to another party, without
                    the plaintiff’s consent. The plaintiff sued the defendant for conversion.
                    The defendant sought to argue that the contracts of sale between the motor
                    dealers and the plaintiffs were tainted with illegality, and that the plaintiff
                    had to rely on the illegal contract as it never gained possessory title in the
                    cars. Lord Denning MR dismissed the appeal, holding the following (at p
                    217):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Ross-Munro laid great stress on the fact that here the finance company
                        had never taken delivery of the car. It had gone straight from the dealers
                        to Belgravia. He submitted that, where a transferee had never taken
                        possession of the thing, he could not rely on the proposition: “As
                        against a wrongdoer, possession is title”: because he never had
                        possession. So the finance company had to rely on the agreement of sale to
                        them in order to give them title or a right to possession. But the agreement
                        was illegal. And the courts would not allow them to rely on it...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not accept this distinction taken by Mr. Ross-Munro. I think that the
                        proposition stated in <em>Singh v. Ali</em> [1960]
                        A.C. 167, 176, applies even where the transferee has not taken possession of
                        the property, so long as the title to it has passed... The dealers, who sold
                        the car to the finance company, cannot claim it back from anyone. They have
                        received their price and are out of the picture. Belgravia, who re-sold the
                        car illegally to a purchaser, cannot claim it from him or anyone else: for
                        they have received the price too. The only persons who can claim it are the
                        finance company who paid for it and have not been re-paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     While these observations were made in the
                    context of a hire purchase contract, I was of the view that the principle to be
                    drawn was that the party with the “ultimate possessory
                    entitlement” could be a bailor notwithstanding that it never came into
                    actual possession of the goods (<em>Palmer on Bailment</em>
                    (Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<em>Palmer on Bailment</em>”) at para 2-015). This was
                    exemplified in the relationship between the Group B Plaintiffs and the first
                    three Plaintiffs. Title passed to the Group B Plaintiffs when the goods they
                    ordered from their suppliers were delivered to the first three Plaintiffs as
                    their appointed agents, or, at the latest, when payment for the goods was made
                    in full (where payment was subsequent to the delivery of possession to the first
                    three Plaintiffs). On the facts, I was satisfied that the Group B Plaintiffs
                    were bailors of the goods with the ultimate right to immediate
                    possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Concurrent standing to sue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I now turn to a related argument. Mr Timothy
                    Tan (“Mr Tan”), counsel for the Defendant, claimed that the first
                    three Plaintiffs as head bailees and the Group B Plaintiffs as bailors could not
                    concurrently enjoy the right to immediate possession to the Group B Cargo. Mr
                    Tan submitted that “it is not possible for all the Plaintiffs to have
                    rights of immediate possession of all of the [30 FCL containers] all at the same
                        time”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and
                    complained that the Plaintiffs had put forth “contradictory and
                    overlapping claims” through the joinder of the Group B Plaintiffs to the
                    action. This submission was ill-founded and erroneous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Mr Tan made no distinction between a bailment
                    for a term and a bailment at will. It is true that where there is a bailment for
                    a term, only the bailee enjoys the right to immediate possession during the
                    subsistence of that term. Hence, only the bailee, and not the bailor, can sue in
                    conversion <em>(see Siew Kong Engineering Works (a firm) v Lian
                        Yit Engineering Sdn Bhd and another</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 736

                    at para 11.028). On the other hand, under a bailment at will, both the
                    bailor and the bailee enjoy the concurrent standing to sue third parties and
                    sub-bailees for conversion <em>(The “Endurance

                        The plaintiffs there were international carriers who had subcontracted the
                        United Kingdom leg to another carrier. The argument that they wished to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In this case, the relationship between the
                    first three Plaintiffs and the Group B Plaintiffs was a bailment at will,
                    because the first three Plaintiffs received the Group B Cargo on their behalf
                    for the primary purpose of shipping them to the Group B Plaintiffs in Indonesia,
                    rather than for a term. The Group B Plaintiffs had the right to revoke the
                    bailment at any time; indeed, it was intended that the first three Plaintiffs
                    send the Group B Cargo to the Group B Plaintiffs in Indonesia as quickly as
                    possible. Until delivered, the first three Plaintiffs were obliged to preserve
                    and protect the Group B Cargo. In fact, the Group B Plaintiffs confirmed the
                    authority of the first three Plaintiffs to continue to deal with the Group B
                    Cargo by granting Powers of Attorney in favour of Hari and his wife (below at
                    [82]). My conclusion that the bailment was a bailment at will was reinforced by
                    the ease in which the owners of Group A Cargo could and did revoke at will the
                    first three Plaintiffs’ authority by signing the Prolink POAs.
                    Accordingly, both the first three Plaintiffs and the Group B Plaintiffs had
                    concurrent standing to sue in conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     This proposition is, of course, subject to the
                    rule that if either the bailor or the bailee recovers from a wrongdoer in full,
                    the other may not bring a “separate and independent” claim against
                    the wrongdoer (<em>Palmer on Bailment</em> at
                    para 4-116). In <em>Tokai Maru</em>, the High Court
                    held at [38] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There stems from the above an important derivative rule which is relevant

                        bailor is barred further recovery from the third person. "The wrongdoer

                    no contradictory and overlapping claims. He confirmed that the reliefs sought by
                    the Group B Plaintiffs were different from that of the first three Plaintiffs
                    whose claim was limited to seeking an indemnity against any recourse by their

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Defendant’s sales director, Fabian,
                    who was the Defendant’s only witness (other than a cargo surveyor),
                    maintained that the Defendant did not know of the arrangements between the first
                    three Plaintiffs and Cuaca, Jonny, Radius, and Prolink. He maintained that the
                    Defendant was authorised by Prolink to receive the 30 FCL containers on behalf
                    of the cargo owners, and that the Defendant was entitled to take possession of
                    the 30 FCL containers as the consignee named on the September B/Ls. To
                    demonstrate that the Defendant’s appointment was in the ordinary course of
                    business, Fabian testified that Prolink had contacted the Defendant to inquire
                    about its charges in July or August 2009, and that he had responded with the
                    usual quotation. He did not hear from Prolink after the quotation was sent until
                    September 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Arrival notices from APL and Samudera

                    containers on 19 September 2009. The unstuffing of the 30 FCL containers
                    were authorised by Prolink. The subsequent release of Group A Cargo and
                    detention of Group B Cargo were on the instructions of Prolink. For all intents
                    and purposes, Mr Tan submitted that the Defendant’s acts were ministerial

                    of any competing claims and in the <em>bona fide</em>
                    belief that the principal were in a position to give lawful instructions could
                    not be further from the truth. In fact, the Defendant’s acts and conduct
                    were intentional and had the effect of denying the first three Plaintiffs of
                    their superior possessory title to the subject containers. The evidence showed
                    that, at all material times, the Defendant knew that the first three Plaintiffs
                    were entitled to the 30 FCL containers, and that the Defendant’s principal
                    had no authority to give lawful instructions in relation to the subject
                    containers. The evidence also showed that the Defendant assisted Prolink to
                    interfere with and to undermine the first three Plaintiffs’ right to
                    immediate possession.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In this part of the grounds, the matters set
                    out under the sub-heading “Arrangement between Prolink and the Defendant

                    context of my analysis of the overall evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     A good starting point is 18 September
                    2009 when Lola spoke to Brendan Wee (“Brendan”), the
                    Defendant’s managing drector,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> about the 30 FCL
                    containers. Her unchallenged testimony was that in that telephone conversation,
                    Brendan acknowledged that the 30 FCL containers were supposed to be consigned to
                    the first three Plaintiffs, but he would require Fabian’s permission
                    before releasing the 30 FCL containers to the first three Plaintiffs. Lola
                    called Brendan again on the same day, but was informed that Fabian was in a
                    meeting. Brendan again reiterated that he would need specific instructions from
                    Fabian before he could release the 30 FCL containers to the first three
                        Plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Lola and Charles attended the unstuffing of
                    the Cargo from 25 September 2009 to 12 October 2009 at Goodway
                    Agencies after Lola was informed of the unstuffing of the 30 FCL containers by
                    Radius. Lola was further notified by Radius that the unstuffing would go ahead
                    whether Lola was present or not. At the unstuffing, Lola met Radius and she
                    demanded the release of the 30 FCL containers from Radius.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Fabian was present at the unstuffing. He
                    admitted in cross-examination that he knew that the first three Plaintiffs were

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Incidentally, Lola was no stranger to Fabian.
                    As Fabian admitted, she had given him some business by engaging the Defendant to
                    consolidate two full-container-load that was part of the February
                        shipment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The same two containers (<em>ie</em>, Container No TCNU 831958-2 (Seal No 0226555) and

                    received by the Defendant on 19 September 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     After Lola’s oral demands went unheeded,
                    R&amp;T sent a letter of demand on 12 October 2009 on behalf of the first
                    three Plaintiffs. Contemporaneously, the Defendant had received Prolink’s
                    instructions to release the goods since the first week of October 2009 (above at
                    [36]). Prolink approached some of the first three Plaintiffs’ customers to
                    obtain their Powers of Attorney in exchange for release of their goods in the
                    Defendant’s possession.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> The evidence showed that Powers of
                    Attorney required by the Defendant served two purposes: to revoke the authority
                    of the first three plaintiffs to deal with the goods and in their stead appoint
                    Prolink to deal with the goods. Thus, Fabian’s reaction on being told by
                    Brendan of R&amp;T’s letter of demand was to “hurry” Jonny
                    to obtain Powers of Attorney from the cargo owners. The reaction was
                    understandable seeing that the Defendant released goods to Comstar on
                    13 October 2009 before the relevant Power of Attorney was executed on
                    14 October 2009 (above at [37]). I was satisfied on the evidence that by
                    the time the letter of demand was received, the Defendant already knew that the
                    Defendant’s principal had no authority to give instructions to the
                    Defendant for the release of the goods. The urgency of obtaining Powers of
                    Attorney was explained by Fabian under cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>

                        2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Defendant was aware that Prolink could not lawfully instruct it to release
                        the goods in the 30 FCL containers before 14 October
                    2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Defendant
                        was, however, willing to bypass the first three Plaintiffs and to release
                        the goods to any third party. To safeguard the Defendant, Fabian wanted the
                        cargo owners to revoke the previous authorisation to the first three
                        Plaintiffs, and in their place appoint the Defendant as their attorney to
                        deal with the goods including the release of goods to cargo owners or to
                        parties instructed by cargo owners;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Defendant intentionally withheld release of the goods
                        to the first three Plaintiffs and continued to withhold the same despite
                        receiving R&amp;T’s letter of demand on 12 October 2009. The
                        Defendant did not reply within the time stipulated in the letter of demand.
                        In the context of the prevailing facts and circumstances, it was reasonable
                        to interpret the non-communication or silence as a refusal to release the
                        goods. The non-communication or silence was intentional in order to buy time
                        for the Defendant and Prolink to contact the cargo owners and to persuade
                        them to revoke the authority of the first three Plaintiffs and to execute
                        Powers of Attorney to new attorneys. It was significant that the goods were
                        withheld until such time as Prolink obtained and the Defendant received the
                        requisite revocation of the Group A Cargo owners’ previous authority
                        given to the first three Plaintiffs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_e"></a>(e)     As at 13 October 2009, the authority of the first
                        three Plaintiffs had not been revoked; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_f"></a>(f)     As at 14 October 2009, five owners of the
                        goods in the Group A Cargo appointed Prolink as their attorney to deal with
                        the Group A Cargo and, at the same time, revoked the authority of the first
                        three Plaintiffs. The rest of the Prolink POAs were executed thereafter
                        between 19 October 2009 and 13 November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     After the Group A Cargo were released,
                    R&amp;T, now also acting for the owners of the Group B Cargo, repeatedly asked
                    the Defendant to provide its claim amount so as to consider payment into court
                        <em>in lieu</em> of the withholding of the Group B
                    Cargo. No figure on the quantum was forthcoming. Mr Kwek, for the Plaintiffs,
                    questioned Fabian as to why he did not recognise the Plaintiffs’ POAs, but
                    Fabian was evasive and he prevaricated by not answering the question directly.
                    Instead, he complained that the Plaintiffs had not paid for the release of the
                        goods:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>

                    thereafter the Group B Cargo was also to further its principal’s interest
                    in these proceedings. The Defendant continued to take instructions from its
                    principal and it withheld the Group B Cargo because its principal had
                    unspecified “charges in Jakarta” to settle with the first three

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     It was also not disputed that the
                    Defendant’s initial legal fees were funded by its principal. A
                    Singapore-incorporated company called D’League Pte Ltd (in which Cuaca was
                    a director with a 70% beneficial interest<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>) provided $15,000 for the
                    Defendant’s legal fees. Although there was no further evidence that
                    financial support for the litigation continued, it bears noting that the
                    Defendant as late as 5 September 2011 was still accepting instructions from
                    Prolink. The Defendant continued to withhold the Group B Cargo with the
                    concomitant daily storage charges despite appearing to be balance-sheet
                    insolvent based on the statement of accounts for three successive financial
                    years of 2007, 2008 and 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> A reasonable and commercially minded
                    party in the Defendant’s position would have been anxious to extricate
                    itself from the legal proceedings soonest possible. Instead, the Defendant
                    became firmly entrenched in the proceedings having taken on Prolink’s
                    fight with the first three Plaintiffs in Singapore. As stated, it was openly
                    pleaded in the Defence filed on 17 March 2010 that “storage charges

                    added]. Some 18 months later, the Defendant was still taking instructions from
                    Prolink. In the amended Defence filed on 13 September 2011, the Defendant
                    disclosed Prolink’s instructions on 5 September 2011 which the
                    Defendant continued to obey by not parting with the Group B Cargo. The amended
                    pleadings referred to:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a letter from Prolink to the Defendant dated 5 September 2011

                        the outstanding storage and ancillary charges but the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Fabian and Cuaca were no strangers to each
                    others. Fabian admitted that Cuaca was Fabian’s boss when Fabian was
                    working for another forwarding company in 1996 or 1997.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    Moreover, the Defendant had enjoyed business relations with Prolink Logistics
                    since 2002 or 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Fabian was also on familiar terms with

                    plausible and not unreasonable to deduce that they were people whose goodwill
                    Fabian was willing to further cultivate, develop and maintain for the sake of
                    future business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In conclusion, for all the reasons stated, the
                    Defendant was not an innocent intermediary and its involvement and participation
                    in the detention of the 30 FCL containers could not be characterised as
                    ministerial acts. The Defendant’s acts were not performed in good faith
                    and the Defendant knew of its principal’s lack of authority and possessory
                    title.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on the Defendant’s liability for conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In this case, there were two categories of
                    conduct that could amount to conversion: (1) the taking of the 30 FCL containers
                    and (2) the Defendant’s refusal to deliver up the 30 FCL containers on
                    demand. I found that there were sufficient facts in evidence to make out a case
                    of conversion in both categories.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The Plaintiffs’ case in conversion
                    proceeded mainly on the Defendant’s refusal to deliver up the 30 FCL
                    containers on demand. The Defendant attacked the first three Plaintiffs’
                    evidence of a “demand and refusal” arguing that the elements of a
                    demand and refusal were not established before issuance of the Writ of Summons,
                    and there was thus no cause of action at the time the Writ of Summons was filed
                    (see <em>Clayton v Le Roy</em> [1911] 2 KB 1031
                        (“<em>Clayton</em>”)). It should be noted
                    that the plaintiff’s case in <em>Clayton</em> was
                    based primarily on detinue and not conversion. However, the majority was of the
                    view that the same would apply to a claim in conversion where the plaintiff
                    relied on “demand and refusal” as the mode of proof
                    (notwithstanding a strong dissent by Vaughan Williams LJ). Fletcher Moulton LJ
                    in <em>Clayton</em> held at p 1050:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he plaintiff must establish that at the moment of its issue he was in a
                        position to bring an action of detinue; in other words, that there had been
                        a wrongful denial by the defendant of the plaintiff’s title to the
                        watch... <em>[U]p to the date there was nothing equivalent to
                            a wrongful refusal or conversion on the part of the defendant, and that
                            action therefore cannot be maintained.</em> It is said that from
                        events that happened subsequently to that date a previous conversion may be
                        proved; I am of the opinion that that view is wrong. If there be any
                        evidence of a conversion before writ, it is possible that there may be acts
                        and admissions afterwards which it would be proper to take into
                        consideration when determining whether there had been in fact a conversion
                        before writ, but if nothing had happened before the writ which is equivalent
                        to a detention, that which happens afterwards cannot mend the flaw.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Apart from Lola’s oral demands,
                    R&amp;T’s letter of demand also stated that “unless we receive your
                    confirmation by 3.00 pm today (12 October 2009) that you will forthwith
                    deliver up the Containers and their contents to our clients, our clients shall
                    have no alternative [sic] but to commence legal proceedings to compel you to
                    deliver up the same”. I was satisfied that this letter constituted an
                    unequivocal demand for delivery up. As an illustration, in <em>Tavoulareas v Lau and another</em> [2007] EWCA Civ 474, it was found
                    there was an unequivocal demand for return as constituted by the following
                    statement at [14] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[i]f the property is not made available for collection by close of
                        business hours on Tuesday 1 March 2005 my client will take all

                        clients are set on the intentional deprivation of my client of his property
                        then the matter will be reported to the police”...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The written demand was specific (as opposed to
                    a merely general demand) because the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff
                    claimed to be entitled to the goods in the 30 FCL containers pursuant to the
                    “3 Bills of Lading”, which expression was reasonably referable to
                    the pro-forma bills of lading from APL and Samudera for the September shipment
                    enclosed in the letter of demand. The container numbers stated in the pro-forma
                    bills of lading corresponded with that on the Arrival Notices sent to the
                    Defendant on 18 September 2009. It was also not alleged by the Defendant
                    that there was any misapprehension as to the goods that were the subject of the
                    demand in this letter. The Defendant, however, argued that the letter of demand
                    was not a “proper demand” made for delivery up of the Group B
                    Cargo because the letter was only written on behalf of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff, and it was made on the wrong basis
                    given that the Defendant, and not the 1<sup>st</sup> to
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Plaintiffs, was the named consignee on the
                    September B/Ls. This argument was misconceived. The first three Plaintiffs were
                    not demanding for the Group B Cargo as consignee but in their capacity as head
                    bailees, and the direction was for the Group B Cargo to be released to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In applying the law to the evidence, it is
                    important to start from the point in time when the first three Plaintiffs
                    decided to nominate the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff to receive the
                    30 FCL containers in Singapore, and duly instructed Prolink to name the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as consignee on the September B/Ls.
                    As regards Prolink’s unauthorised and unilateral switch of consignee to
                    their own agent, this act constituted taking of the 30 FCL containers in respect
                    of which no demand in law was necessary (see <em>Cuff v
                        Broadlands Finance</em> [1987] 2 NZLR 343). This name
                    change effectively prevented the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff from
                    taking delivery of the 30 FCL containers from the carriers. The switch also
                    manifested Prolink’s intention to exercise dominion or control over the 30
                    FCL containers for a time and to deprive the first three Plaintiffs of their
                    right to immediate possession of the 30 FCL containers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The receipt of the 30 FCL containers in
                    Singapore by the Defendant as agent for Prolink constituted taking of the 30 FCL
                    containers which excluded the first three Plaintiffs from the containers. I have
                    already analysed the events that transpired between the first week of October
                    2009 and 14 October 2009 (above at [83]). As I have already found, the
                    Defendant intentionally detained the 30 FCL containers to give Prolink time to
                    get Powers of Attorney from owners of the goods in the 30 FCL containers. Put
                    another way, the Defendant’s refusal was in disregard of the first three
                    Plaintiffs’ possessory title, and (a) was designed to buy time in order to
                    strip the first three Plaintiffs of their authority, and hence their right to
                    immediate possession of the 30 FCL containers as head bailees; and (b) was for
                    the purpose of enabling Prolink to claim possession of the 30 FCL Containers.
                    Clearly, Prolink and the Defendant had acted in a manner that had the effect of
                    denying the first three plaintiffs of their superior possessory title (<em>ie</em>, in their right to immediate possession of the 30 FCL
                    containers), and that denial was a substantial interference with their right,
                    and it was committed with clear intention of exercising a temporary dominance
                    over the 30 FCL containers (<em>Tat Seng</em> at [45]) for
                    the purpose of enabling Prolink to claim possession of the 30 FCL containers and
                    give instructions in relation to the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Mr Tan submitted that the reason the Defendant
                    did not revert by the deadline stipulated in the letter of demand of
                    12 October 2009 was because the Defendant was taking instructions from
                    Prolink, and that reasonable time should be given for that purpose. I did not
                    accept the submission. First, there was no evidence that Fabian had specifically
                    sought instructions on the letter of demand. This was a case in which the
                    Defendant had been made aware of the first three Plaintiffs’ interest in
                    the 30 FCL containers for a considerable period of time before the Writ of
                    Summons was filed. The Plaintiffs had also made several prior attempts to
                    contact the Defendant for the 30 FCL containers. The letter of demand also
                    alluded to this, stating that “[o]ur client’s representatives had
                    on several occasions spoken to your Mr Brendan Wee and Mr Fabian Tan, as well as
                    sent SMS to the latter, in relation to release of the Containers and their
                    contents to our clients, but Mr Wee and Mr Tan have not reverted in substance,
                    only to say that they are awaiting instructions”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Second, ostensibly the
                    deadline was missed deliberately and I found the Defendant’s silence to be
                    tantamount to an unequivocal refusal to release the 30 FCL containers to the
                    first three Plaintiffs (see Eady J’s observations in <em>Schwarszchild v Harrods Ltd</em> [2008] EWHC 521 at
                [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As at 19 November 2009, the Group A Cargo
                    was released. In my view, the release of Group A Cargo would not assist in
                    determining whether the Defendant converted the Group B Cargo on 13 October
                    2009. The release of Group A Cargo must be viewed in the context of how the
                    Prolink POAs were obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I had no difficulty concluding that as against
                    the first three Plaintiffs, the Defendant had converted the 30 FCL
                    containers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I now come to the Group B Plaintiffs’
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The Defendant raised a technical argument:
                    that no cause of action or “demand and refusal” arose before the
                    issuance of the Writ of Summons. This technical argument would not affect the
                    Group B Plaintiffs’ claim in conversion at all. The Group B Plaintiffs
                    were joined as co-plaintiffs on 25 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I should mention that upon joinder of a
                    person as party to an action, that person becomes a party (and the amendment
                    correspondingly only takes effect) from the date the Writ of Summons was amended
                    and served on him (O 15 r 4(8) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”); Singapore Civil Procedure (G
                    P Selvam ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2007) at para 20/8/3). The amendment does not
                    date back retrospectively to the time the Writ of Summons was first filed
                        (<em>Ketteman and others v Hansel Properties Ltd and
                        Others</em> [1987] 1 AC 189). Thus, even if the Group B
                    Plaintiffs’ cause of action was not constituted before the Writ of Summons
                    was filed on 13 October 2009, it was sufficient that their cause of action
                    was constituted by the time they were joined as parties to the action (<em>Teo Gracie v Tay Leng Hong and others</em>
                    [1987] SLR(R) 315 at [9] to [10]). That was indeed the case
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The Group B Plaintiffs had refused to grant
                    Powers of Attorney in favour of Prolink Logistics. The Group B Plaintiffs had
                    consistently maintained that the Defendant was not in lawful possession of the
                    Group B Cargo, and subsequently engaged R&amp;T to represent them. By letters
                    dated 9, 23 and 28 December 2009, the lawyers proposed that the Defendant
                    specify the nature and quantum of sums demanded from them. It was also stated
                    that they would consider paying these sums into Court to avoid further delay in
                    delivery of their cargo on a without prejudice basis. When no reply on quantum
                    was forthcoming, the Group B Plaintiffs applied to be joined as co-plaintiffs in
                    this action <em>vide</em> SUM 6569/2009 filed on
                    29 December 2009. As previously stated, they were finally joined as party
                    to the action on 25 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    It was patently clear that the
                    Defendant’s conduct up till the 25 January 2010 was consistent with
                    an intention to exercise dominion over the Group B Cargo and to act
                    inconsistently with the Group B Plaintiffs’ entitlement to the
                    goods:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Defendant continually
                        maintained that it had the right to detain the Group B Cargo and refused to
                        release the goods to the first three Plaintiffs as the appointed freight
                        forwarders. In its letter of response to R&amp;T, the Defendant maintained
                        that they would “vigorously defend the action brought against
                        them” as well as SUM 5358/2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> As
                        bailors of the Group B Cargo, the Group B Plaintiffs were entitled to
                        interpret this conduct as an act of conversion by the
                    Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_b"></a>(b)     Another
                        act of conversion was evident from the Defendant detention of the 30 FCL
                        containers initially, and thereafter the Group B Cargo, in purported
                        exercise of a lien which I found at [105]–[130] below that the
                        Defendant did not in fact possess (see <em>Tear v
                            Freebody</em> (1895) 140 ER 1071).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    For completeness, I should mention that the
                    3 February 2010 letter from the Defendant’s lawyers in response to
                    the Plaintiffs’ proposal that the sums be paid into court (above at [101])
                    was unhelpful. The Defendant alleged in the letter that it was the Plaintiffs
                    who had failed to contact them and did not provide verification that the Group B
                    Plaintiffs were in fact the owners of the Group B Cargo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Given that the
                    description of the Group B Cargo was provided to the Defendant,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> and that the
                    release of Group B Cargo was on a without prejudice basis, the reply was with
                    hindsight indicative of the Defendant’s inability to fix a quantum. Almost
                    two years later, the Defendant was still struggling to state the quantum at the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In conclusion, for the reasons stated, I was
                    satisfied that the Defendant was liable to the Group B Plaintiffs in conversion
                    in respect of the Group B Cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Possessory lien as a defence to a claim in
                conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Defendant enjoyed a possessory lien over the 30 FCl
                containers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    There were fundamental difficulties that
                    stood in the way of the Defendant’s possessory lien claim, which was
                    raised as a defence to the claim in conversion. The Defendant was unable legally
                    and evidentially to prove that it had either a contractual lien or
                    warehousemen’s lien. Its fallback argument was to claim a freight
                    forwarder’s lien by reason of a trade custom but the Defendant did not
                    call a witness to testify on the alleged trade custom in Singapore. A very late
                    application was filed for leave to call as witness a representative from
                    Singapore Logistics Association or a freight forwarding company to testify on
                    trade custom during the trial. This was Summons No 4820 of 2011 filed on
                    25 October 2011 (“SUM 4820/2011”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    There was also an earlier application vide
                    SUM 4218/2011 which was filed on 22 September 2011 for a declaration that
                    the Defendant had a contractual and/or customary and/or freight forwarder and/or
                    warehousemen lien over Group B Cargo for the storage and ancillary charges
                    incurred in respect of or in connection with the same. The Defendant also prayed
                    for an order that the Plaintiffs pay $946,601.53 being outstanding storage and
                    ancillary charges as at 30 September 2011, plus a daily accruing rate of
                        S$1,290.00.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The Defendant termed SUM 4218/2011 as an
                    “interpleader summons”, claiming that the Plaintiffs’
                    amendment to the Statement of Claim to claim for delivery up on 24 August
                    2011 created “adverse and competing claims”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The Defendant cited the eleventh hour
                    amendment to the Statement of Claim to include the alternative relief to deliver
                    up the Group B Cargo as a reason for the filing of SUM 4218/2011. Another reason
                    proffered was that the Defendant was now faced with contradicting and
                    overlapping claims of the first three Plaintiffs and Group B Plaintiffs, and
                    Prolink’s instructions not to release the Group B Cargo until the first
                    three Plaintiffs paid Prolink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The Defendant’s explanations were
                    untenable. Notably, the Defendant’s lawyers had as early as
                    22 February 2010 cited contradicting and overlapping claims of the first
                    three Plaintiffs and Group B Plaintiffs as a reason for the Defendant to
                    interplead. In any case, as explained, there were no competing claims between
                    the first three Plaintiffs and the Group B Plaintiffs (above at
                    [67]–[71]). Despite the lien claimed by Prolink, and the demands of the
                    first three Plaintiffs for the 30 FCL containers to be released, the Defendant
                    did not see the need to interplead way back in 2009 when the Defendant was first
                    sued. It was only on 24 August 2011 – almost two years after the Writ
                    of Summons was filed – that the Defendant filed SUM 4218/2011. In the
                    context of this case, the Plaintiffs could have sued Prolink or the Defendant,
                    or both. They chose to sue the Defendant and that ought to have compelled the
                    Defendant to take out interpleader proceedings. Nothing was done after the
                    action started because the Defendant had not taken a neutral stand. The
                    Defendant’s alliance with Prolink defined the conduct and set the tone of
                    the proceedings. Its partisan stand persisted and was still evident in the
                    pleaded Defence that the lien which the Defendant asserted and exercised was not
                    only for storage and ancillary charges due to the Defendant but also included
                    all amounts due and owing by the first three Plaintiffs to Prolink. Furthermore,
                    the Defendant at no point in time pleaded its entitlement to storage and
                    ancillary charges as a counterclaim. Instead, it sought to go by the backdoor to
                    obtain a declaration that the Defendant enjoyed a “contractual and/or
                    customary and/or freight forwarder and/or warehousemen lien” over the
                    Group B Cargo in SUM 4218/2011. I will explain my reasons for dismissing SUM
                    4218/2011 on 27 February 2012 later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    During the trial the Defendant asked that
                    SUM 4820/2011 be heard. Mr Tan explained that if SUM 4820/2011 was allowed, the
                    Defendant would ask for the trial to be adjourned to organise the evidence of
                    the witness. The Defendant had even offered not to claim storage charges for the
                    duration of the adjournment. It was in these circumstances that Counsel for the
                    parties were directed to deal with the following preliminary point: whether the
                    Defendant had lawful possession of the 30 FCL containers –“lawful
                    possession” being an important ingredient to found a lien. If there was
                    no lien, the Defendant’s detention on the basis of a lien which it did not
                    have would amount to conversion. An answer to the common question would assist
                    in the determination of both SUM 4218/2011 and SUM 4820/2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In the final analysis, the alleged lien was
                    illusory. The Defendant’s detention of the 30 FCL containers was on the
                    basis of a lien which it did not possess. The Defendant could not show that it
                    enjoyed any type of lien recognised in law whether as a contractual lien,
                    warehousemen’s lien or freight forwarder’s lien. The defence failed
                    because it did not satisfy the test of lawful possession to found a lien.
                    Besides, the Defendant could not show that there was an accrued debt owing from
                    the Plaintiffs to support a lien.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Defendant have lawful possession of the 30 FCL containers to
                found a lien?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I start with the directions made pursuant to
                    O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court on 25 October 2011. I directed the parties
                    to file and exchange submissions on the following preliminary issues by
                    8 November 2011:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Defendant obtained
                        lawful possession of the 30 FCL containers; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the contracts of carriage contained in
                        or evidenced by the September B/Ls were a nullity, and if so, the
                        consequences of such void contracts in respect of the Defendant’s
                        possessory right to the 30 FCL containers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    On 15 November 2011, I ruled that the
                    Defendant had no lawful possession to found a lien. Consequently, SUM 4820/2011
                    for leave to call a witness on trade custom was dismissed. SUM 4820/2011 would
                    also have been dismissed for the reason that the Defendant could not establish
                    that there was an accrued debt owing from the Plaintiffs to support the exercise
                    of a lien by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Preliminary question (b) was easily dealt
                    with. This issue related to whether the September B/Ls were a nullity
                    considering that Prolink Clare was purportedly in liquidation but was the named
                    shipper of the contracts of carriage with the carriers. Hari’s testimony
                    on the liquidation of Prolink Clare was based on hearsay evidence. The documents
                    relating to the purported liquidation of Prolink Clare were not admissible
                    evidence in the absence of formal proof of their authenticity and
                    contents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I now set out my reasons for my decision on
                    preliminary question (a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    A possessory lien is “a right at
                    common law to retain..<em>. rightfully</em> and
                    continuously in his possession [goods] belonging to another until the present
                    and accrued claims of the person in possession are satisfied [emphasis
                    added]” (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        England</em> vol 68 (LexisNexis,<sup></sup>5<sup>th</sup> Reissue Ed, 2008) at para 802). It
                    is settled law that possession derived from the wrongful act of a third party
                    will not suffice to found a possessory lien (<em>Bowmaker Ltd v
                        Wycombe Motors Ltd</em> [1946] KB 505).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    
          <em>Bowstead and Reynolds on
                        Agency</em> (Peter Watts and F M B Reynolds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    19th Ed, 2010) (“<em>Bowstead and
                    Reynolds</em>”), commented (at para 7-078):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Lawfully obtained.</b> A lien cannot be acquired
                        by a wrongful act. Thus, if an agent obtains goods from his principal by
                        misrepresentation, he has no lien over them, though the circumstances in
                        other respects are such that he would have been [sic] a lien if the goods
                        had been obtained lawfully. And where the agent takes goods without
                        authority, or is given goods by the principal after the latter’s
                        bankruptcy, he acquires no lien.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    With these principles in mind, I now turn to
                    the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    It surfaced during Mr Tan’s
                    cross-examination of Lola on her part in preparing documents for the 30 FCL
                    containers to be returned to Singapore that Radius had instructed Lola to
                    prepare some documents for Prolink Logistics. While Mr Tan’s line of
                    questioning was on the defence of illegality, the answers potentially implicated
                    the Defendant’s claim of a possessory lien seeing that the Defendant had,
                    at the trial, wished to take a wider position that had not been pleaded: that
                    the entire adventure involving the February shipment and the September shipment
                    was unlawful. This wider position invited a counter-argument that the
                    Defendant’s very possession of the 30 FCL containers could be
                        tainted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Be that as it may, it was not
                    disputed that false documents were amongst some of the documentation
                    accompanying Prolink Logistics’ application to the JSA Court to review the
                    Indonesian customs authority’s refusal to allow the 30 FCL containers to
                    be exported to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The decision of the JSA Court was based
                    narrowly on the JSA Court’s interpretation of the applicable regulations
                    to reach the conclusion that Indonesian customs authority’s decision
                    refusing export of the 30 FCL containers was made out of time and hence
                    ineffective. Notwithstanding the JSA Court’s decision was based on an
                    application that named Prolink Logistics as owner of the subject containers, I
                    am entitled to take cognisance of the false documents. The documents were false
                    and Prolink Logistics derived no ownership or special right in the 30 FCL
                    containers. In these circumstances, the legal position of Prolink
                    Logistics’ bare possession of the 30 FCL containers could be likened to
                    that of a thief in possession of stolen goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    It is equally possible to look at the matter
                    in another way instead of characterising Prolink Logistics’ bare
                    possession (and hence the Defendant’s bare possession) to be akin to that
                    of a thief in possession of stolen goods. Previously, the first three Plaintiffs
                    had agreed to Prolink Logistics arranging the September shipment. Prolink
                    Logistics would be in possession of the 30 FCL containers, and its legal
                    position would be that of a sub-bailee. As stated earlier, the bailment was
                    terminated when Prolink Logistics consigned the goods to the Defendant contrary
                    to the agreement between Hari and Cuaca/Prolink Logistics, and the right of
                    possession to the 30 FCL containers thereby reverted to the first three
                    Plaintiffs. The Defendant’s possession as agent was directly traceable to
                    the wrongful act(s) of its principal, Prolink Logistics. The <em>nemo dat quod non habet</em> rule applied and in the result, the
                    Defendant did not have lawful possession of the 30 FCL containers to assert a
                    lien.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The Defendant’s claim that it received
                    the 30 FCL containers from the carriers as the named consignee and that in and
                    of itself gave legitimacy to its possession. This contention ignored the
                    circumstances in which the Defendant came to be named as consignee on the
                    September B/Ls. I agreed with Mr Kwek that even though the Defendant was a named
                    consignee, this did not add anything to the Defendant’s bare possessory
                    title.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No contractual lien from want of authority to exercise a
                lien</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The Defendant argued that Prolink Logistics
                    had express, implied or ostensible authority from the Plaintiffs to allow the
                    Defendant to take the 30 FCL containers and create a lien for unpaid
                        charges.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As a matter
                    of law, it is possible for a freight forwarder to exercise a particular lien
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> a chattel belonging to a person
                    other than his principal provided his principal has the authority to contract
                    for the lien. <em>Bowstead and Reynolds</em> at para 7-086
                    states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The possessory lien of an agent attaches only upon goods or chattel in
                        respect of which the principal has, as against third parties, the power to
                        create the lien, and except in the case of money or negotiable securities,
                        and subject to any statutory provision to the contrary, is confined to the
                        rights of the principal in the goods or chattels at the time when the lien
                        attaches, and is subject to all rights and equities of third parties
                        available against the principal at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The legal principles are clear. However,
                    there were difficulties in the way of the Defendant’s arguments. I will
                    mark out the problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    First, the Defendant’s pleaded case
                    did not aver to any express, implied or ostensible authority from the Plaintiffs
                    to allow the Defendant to take the 30 FCL containers and contract for a lien for
                    unpaid charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Secondly, the Defendant’s plea of a
                    contractual lien was not made good by particulars, let alone evidence. The
                    Defendant would not have been able to argue that Prolink Logistics was
                    authorised to contract for a lien on behalf of the Defendant. This argument
                    would have been a non-starter. The first three Plaintiffs did not know the 30
                    FCL containers were consigned to the Defendant until it was too late to stop
                    Prolink Logistics. The first three Plaintiffs could not have known, let alone
                    agreed to, Prolink Logistics contracting for a lien on the Defendant’s
                    behalf. Again it would be a non-starter to advance an argument that Prolink
                    Logistics had an implied or ostensible authority to create the lien. Authority
                    to create a lien may be implied if the freight forwarder’s principal was
                    in lawful possession of the goods when possession was transferred to the freight
                    forwarder, and the transfer was not inconsistent with the purposes for which the
                    principal was in possession of the goods as regards the owner of the goods
                        (<em>Cassils &amp; Co and Sassoon v Holden Wood Bleaching Co
                        Ltd</em> (1915) 84 LJKB 834). In this case, for the reasons earlier
                    stated, Prolink Logistics did not have lawful possession of the 30 FCL
                    containers. Equally, ostensible authority to create a lien was not pleaded nor
                    particularised. Neither did the Defendant explain how ostensible authority could
                    have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Thirdly, the contention that the Defendant
                    was exercising the lien for Prolink Logistics<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> was also a non-starter. The Defence averred to
                    the detention of Group B Cargo in respect of the Defendant’s storage and
                    ancillary charges as well as for the sums due to Prolink. There were no
                    particulars or evidence on how Prolink Logistics’ possessed a lien. How
                    and when Prolink Logistics delegated the enforcement of its lien to the
                    Defendant was not particularised, let alone supported by evidence. To this end,
                    the Defendant’s attempt to exercise a lien for Prolink Logistics’
                    claim against the first three Plaintiffs was entirely without legal
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No debt due from the first three Plaintiffs to the
                Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I will now set out the other problem that
                    faced the Defendant. I found that the Defendant could not claim to enjoy a lien
                    because there was no debt due from the first three Plaintiffs to it at the time
                    the Defendant refused to release the 30 FCL containers. It is settled law
                    that the debt on which the lien is founded must have accrued at the time the
                    lien was exercised (<em>Crawshay v Homfray</em> (1820)
                    4 B &amp; Ald 50). In addition, the party asserting the lien
                    must either claim for a definite amount or give the owners or lienor particulars
                    from which he can calculate the amount for which the lien is due (<em>Singh v Thaper</em> (unreported) (28 July 1987)
                    (Transcript Association)). In the present case, there was no debt due from the
                    first three Plaintiffs to the Defendant when the lien was purportedly asserted
                    on 13 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    First, Fabian admitted that the storage and
                    ancillary charges commenced only from 15 October 2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> two days after
                    the first three Plaintiffs sued on 13 October 2009. At any rate, no debt
                    was due when the Defendant took possession of the 30 FCL containers on
                    19 September 2009. In any event, charges and expenses incurred before the
                    Defendant took possession of the 30 FCL containers (if any) would have been
                    incurred by Prolink Logistics and not the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    In addition, it was telling that the
                    Defendant had struggled to give a definite amount or particulars of its debt
                    throughout the proceedings despite claiming that storage and ancillary charges
                    were owed to it. Fabian was also unable to explain the calculations for the
                    different figures that appeared in the Defence and in his various affidavits.
                    The Defendant finally submitted handwritten calculations to the court on
                    24 October 2011 showing that the storage costs from 15 October 2009 to
                    31 May 2011 were S$480,990.11. On 20 February 2012, Mr Tan tendered a
                    revised computation showing that the storage costs from 15 October 2009 to
                    20 February 2012 were S$787,598.15. Given its elusive history, it would be
                    unwise to accept the latest figure of S$787,598.15 without corroborative
                    evidence. I was mindful that the Defendant was not able to explain how the
                    earlier sums were reached and to explain the disparity between the figures. At
                    the end of the trial, the impression the Defendant left with the court was that
                    the alleged outstanding storage and ancillary charges were decidedly
                    questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    For the reasons stated, the Defendant did
                    not possess a lien to justify the detention of the 30 FCL containers, and
                    thereafter the Group B Cargo. The lien defence therefore failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">
<b>Overview</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The Defendant’s pleaded case was that
                    the Plaintiffs were part of an unlawful adventure to evade Indonesian customs
                    duty for the shipment of the 30 FCL containers from Singapore to Jakarta. Like
                    the lien defence, there were difficulties with this illegality defence. I need
                    only mark out two problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    First, the Plaintiffs’ claim in
                    conversion would not be defeated given that it was not founded on the
                    “unlawful adventure” but on superior possessory title. Second, the
                    Defendant could not surmount the evidentiary difficulties to prove that an
                    “unlawful adventure” was even perpetuated. The reliance on the
                    misdescription of the goods on the February B/Ls to infer smuggling and evasion
                    of Indonesian customs duty would have failed without the introduction of
                    evidence on Indonesian customs law and regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The parties referred to the decision of the
                    JSA Court in 2009 and the decisions of the Central Jakarta District Court and
                    Jakarta High Court in 2011 in relation to the release of the subject containers
                    by the Indonesian customs authority. The parties separately urged this court to
                    rely on the findings of the Indonesian courts to advance different points.
                    However, I was not inclined to do so as the narration and findings in the
                    decisions were strictly inadmissible evidence that could not, without more, be
                    taken as evidence of the truth or correctness of the matters that transpired in
                    Indonesia or the participation of persons in any illegality perpetuated there
                        (<em>Trans-World (Aluminium) Ltd v Cornelder China
                        (Singapore)</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 501 at [19] and

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there really a case for the illegality defence?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">As against the first three Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The question to be asked was whether there
                    was really a case for the illegality defence to operate. The Defendant faced a
                    number of difficulties with this defence. The first difficulty was with the
                    scope of the Defendant’s case on illegality. The Defendant alleged from
                    the outset that the first three Plaintiffs were engaged in an “unlawful
                    adventure” to smuggle the 30 FCL containers into Indonesia without paying
                    Indonesian customs duty relying on the discrepancy between the actual goods in
                    the 30 FCL containers and the goods declared on the February B/Ls to infer such
                    intention on the part of the first three Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The complaint centred on the manner in which
                    general goods in the 30 FCL containers were described in the February
                    B/Ls:</p>

                        being “PT HEGAR MULYA”, with the goods on the bill of lading
                        described as “5600 PKGS OF NON WOVEN FABRICS”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>

                        HEGAR MULYA”, with the goods on the bill of lading described as
                        “8600 PKGS OF POLYESTER YARN”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_c"></a>(c)     B/L No
                        SSLSGJK1CHB682, the shipper being “XIAMEN ZHONGTIAN PLASTICS CO
                        LTD”, and the consignee being “PT TEXMACO MICRO INDO
                        UTAMA”, with the goods on the bill of lading described as
                        “9200 BAGS POLYPROPYLENE GRADE Y 4600”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span><sup></sup></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Apart from the misdescription of the cargo
                    on the February B/Ls, no other particulars were provided as to how this unlawful
                    adventure was to be perpetuated by that misdescription. The Plaintiffs had asked
                    for particulars but the Defendant refused, claiming that its pleadings were
                    clear enough.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The Defendant’s case was made
                    difficult by the fact that much of the evidence as to what transpired in
                    Indonesian after the 30 FCL containers arrived in Jakarta was not within the
                    personal knowledge of the Defendant. It was the Defendant’s principal who
                    alleged that the smuggling took place and they should have been called as
                    witnesses to explain how the misdescription <em>per se</em>
                    could perpetuate an evasion of Indonesian customs duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    There was also no evidence that the February
                    B/Ls would be required to clear the Indonesian customs. Factually, the original
                    February B/Ls were already surrendered to the carriers in Singapore after the 30
                    FCL containers were loaded on board the vessels in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The Defendant wanted to bolster the
                    smuggling allegation by seeking leave to amend the Defence to include the
                    following additional matters: that the shippers on the September B/Ls were
                    companies that had no relationship with the first three Plaintiffs with
                    addresses merely taken from the Internet; that they were not the intended
                    consignees of the goods; that the shippers’ names and description of goods
                    on the February B/Ls were provided to Lola by Radius;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> and that false
                    documents had been prepared by Lola on Radius’ instructions for the
                    September shipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The Defendant applied <em>vide</em> Summons No 4641 of 2011 (“SUM 4641/2011”)
                    filed on 14 October 2011 for leave to amend the Defence. SUM 4641/2011 was
                    dismissed on 17 October 2011. I was of the view that allowing the amendment
                    would not have made any material difference to the illegality defence. Whilst
                    misdescription in the nature of the goods, named shippers and named consignees
                    on the February B/Ls could arguably have constituted evidence of extraneous
                    circumstances pointing to an illegal object to avoid Indonesian customs duty,
                    the Defendant had no witnesses to prove this. Without calling Radius, Jonny and
                    Cuaca to testify in these proceedings, the whole of the relevant circumstances
                    of the alleged illegality would not be before this court. In addition, foreign
                    law was not pleaded and no expert on Indonesian customs law and practice was on
                    the Defendant’s list of witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    I should record another eleventh hour
                    interlocutory application by the Defendant for leave to call an expert on
                    Indonesia law. Illegality as a defence was raised as early as 29 October
                    2009 in Fabian’s Interlocutory Affidavit and it was subsequently pleaded
                    in the Defence filed on 17 March 2010. No valid excuse was proffered for
                    the exceedingly late application filed on 19 October 2011. This was Summons
                    No 4730 of 2011 (“SUM 4730/2011”) filed on 19 October 2011.
                    SUM 4730/2011 was dismissed on 24 October 2011 (see Annexure
                B).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The expert witness the Defendant wanted to
                    call in SUM 4730/2011 was one Andrew Sriro who was a foreign qualified lawyer
                    working in Indonesia. Mr Sriro’s area of practice was largely in
                    commercial law and advising international clients in corporate transactions. Mr
                    Sriro read law in McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California, and
                    practiced corporate and business law in California before moving to Jakarta. Mr
                    Sriro obtained the equivalent of a Masters degree from Universitas Padjadjaran,
                    Bandung, Indonesia but it was not disclosed what the Master degree was in. For
                    the reasons stated, the Defendant had not satisfied me that Mr Sriro was
                    qualified to testify as an expert on Indonesian law in the area of import tax
                    and customs law and regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">As against the Group B Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The Defendant made the same arguments of
                    illegality against the Group B Plaintiffs as it did against the first three
                    Plaintiffs. Although the Defence was pleaded in broad language to cover all
                    Plaintiffs, no particulars of any illegality were directed against the Group B
                    Plaintiffs. It was also not established in evidence that any of the Group B
                    Plaintiffs were aware or participated in the misdescription or misdeclaration of
                    the goods at all. As a final point, the Defendant also did not cross-examine the
                    Group B Plaintiffs on this illegality defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiffs’ claims were independent of the alleged
                illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    For completeness, even if, for the sake of
                    argument, there was an unlawful adventure as alleged, the Plaintiffs’
                    claims in conversion could be brought as their rights were independent of the
                    alleged illegality and not tainted as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    
          <em>Bowmakers Ltd v Barnet
                        Instruments Ltd</em> [1945] KB 65 is authority for the
                    proposition that a claimant will be able to reclaim property if doing so does
                    not involve reliance on the illegality. This principle was approved by the House
                    of Lords in <em>Tinsley v Milligan</em> [1994] 1 AC 340
                        (“<em>Tinsley v Milligan</em>”) which
                    held that the principle applies even where the proprietary interest was acquired
                    in the course of an illegal transaction. This was also followed by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Siow Soon Kim</em> v <em>Lim
                        Eng Beng alias Lim Jia Le</em> [2004] SGCA 4 at [38] (see also
                        <em>Top Ten Entertainment Pte Ltd v Lucky Red Investments
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 559 at [34]; <em>Chee Jok Heng Stephanie v Chang Yue Shoon</em>
                    [2010] 3 SLR 1131).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    A good example of the application of the
                    principle is the case referred to in Carole Murray, David Holloway and Daren
                    Timson-Hunt, <em>Schmitthoff’s Export Trade, The Law and
                        Practice of International Trade</em>, (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    11th Ed, 2007) at p 482 where export invoices were falsified in order to deceive
                    the customs authorities of the importer’s country. The exporter was not
                    prevented from recovering damages in England from the carriers when the
                    exporter’s goods were stolen from their lorry while in transit to the
                    docks of London.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    As I noted earlier (above at [62]), I was
                    satisfied that the Group B Plaintiffs established their proprietary interests in
                    the Group B Cargo (see Annexure A). The facts in this case present a stronger
                    basis than <em>Tinsley v Milligan</em> because unlike the
                    plaintiff in <em>Tinsley v Milligan</em>, the Group B
                    Plaintiffs acquired their proprietary interest independent of any illegal act or
                    transaction. Similarly, the first three Plaintiffs’ were head bailees
                    under the door-to-door service agreement with the cargo owners, and as head
                    bailees were persons with right to immediate possession of the 30 FCL
                    containers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In the circumstances, the Defendant’s
                    argument that this court should still not grant relief to the Plaintiffs, for to
                    do so would be an “affront to the public conscience”, was
                    misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The Defendant cited without developing a
                    myriad of rationales in one paragraph of its submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> underpinning the illegality defence as to why
                    relief should not be granted to the Plaintiffs and that the granting of relief
                    would compromise the dignity and reputation of the courts. I do not propose to
                    dwell on this matter except only to comment on Mr Tan’s reliance on
                        <em>Geismar v Sun Alliance and London Insurance Ltd and
                        Another</em> [1977] 1 QB 383 (“<em>Geismar</em>”). When I queried Mr Tan on the rationale for the
                    illegality defence that he was relying upon in citing <em>Geismar</em>, he stated that it was for the public conscience test.
                    The House of Lords in <em>Tinsley v Milligan</em> cited
                        <em>Geismar</em> but was of the view that no broadly
                    applicable public conscience test could be derived from this case (<em>Tinsley v Milligan</em> at 350). In addition, the House
                    of Lords had unanimously rejected the public conscience test as no longer good
                    law in England. Mr Tan also cited <em>Geismar</em> without
                    explaining why the public conscience test is part of Singapore law. In addition,
                    the facts in <em>Geismar</em> were
                distinguishable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overall conclusion on liability in conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In conclusion, the Plaintiffs succeeded in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The first three Plaintiffs claimed the

                        arising from the conversion and/or wrongful detention of the 30 FCL

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    I awarded the first three Plaintiffs the
                    declaration that the Defendant indemnify the first three Plaintiffs for all
                    liabilities and losses incurred, directly or indirectly against them, arising
                    from the conversion and/or wrongful detention of the 30 FCL containers. However,
                    I dismissed the first three Plaintiffs claim for US$170,000 and Rp 1.2 billion
                    against the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Group B Plaintiffs’ reliefs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    I awarded damages to be assessed to the
                    Group B Plaintiffs. I did not award delivery up to the
                        4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>,
                        8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and
                        15<sup>th</sup> Plaintiffs because the Plaintiffs ran their
                    entire cause of action in conversion rather than detinue (as would be explained
                    below). Strictly, the relief of delivery up is not available in a claim for
                    conversion. The only remedy for a claim in conversion at common law is an award
                    of damages. Diplock LJ in <em>General and Finance Facilities Ltd
                        v Cooks Cars (Romford) Ltd</em> [1963] 1 WLR 644 at 649
                    noted that “the action in conversion is a purely personal action and
                    results in a judgment for pecuniary damages only”. At common law, the
                    courts may only order the specific delivery of an asset for an action of
                    detinue. I refer to <em>Winfield &amp; Jolowicz
                        </em><em>on Tort</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    18th Ed, 2010) (“<em>Winfield &amp;
                        Jolowicz”</em>) at para 17-29:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only remedy for conversion at common law was the purely personal one
                        of damages. However, when the defendant was in possession of the goods and
                        refused to deliver them up on demand his act was not only conversion but
                        also detinue and the form of judgment in detinue might include an order for
                        the delivery up of the goods. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    In seeking the remedy of delivery up, Mr
                    Kwek relied primarily on authorities based on the position in England following
                    the enactment of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 (c 32) (UK)
                    (“the 1977 TIGA”). By virtue of the 1977 TIGA, the tort of detinue
                    was abolished in England with the remedies for detinue being made available for
                    the statutory tort of conversion, in particular delivery up. Indeed, the
                    Plaintiffs’ counsel themselves cited <em>Winfield &amp;
                        Jolowicz</em> at para 17-29 which stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Detinue has now been abolished but the remedies for conversion
                        where goods are detained by the defendant are now found in s. 3 of the Torts
                        (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, which is modelled on the common law
                        remedies available for detinue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    There is no equivalent statutory reform in
                    Singapore. As a result, the position in Singapore is that the tort of detinue
                    still had to be pleaded if a plaintiff seeks the remedy of delivery. This was
                    noted in <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at
                    para 11.067:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In practice, the much broader scope of conversion has rendered
                        the tort of detinue largely obsolete, leading to its statutory abolition in
                        the UK in 1977. For Singapore, however, detinue remains very much a live
                        tort. In practice, the claimant’s desire to recover the property
                        constitutes the main reason for pleading the tort. This is because <em>at common law, a court may only order the specific delivery of
                            the asset in an action for detinue and not for conversion</em>.
                        For that same reason, detinue is usually only pleaded as against a defendant
                        who is still in possession of the goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    A local decision, <em>Yoong
                        Yuet Hoe v Shenson Engineering &amp; Trading (S) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1994] SLR(R) 950, was cited to me for the proposition that delivery
                    up could be ordered in an action for conversion. However in that case, counsel
                    did not appear to put in issue the distinction in remedies between conversion
                    and detinue. I was thus of the view that if the Plaintiffs wanted to claim
                    delivery up as a remedy, it was necessary to plead detinue as a cause of
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Mr Kwek submitted that the Plaintiffs’
                    pleadings, as they then stood, were wide enough to include the tort of detinue.
                    To provide some context, I set out the relevant paragraph of the amended
                    Statement of Claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    In the premises, the Defendants and/or Mr Cuaca
                            and/or PT Prolink Logistics and/or PT Prolink Clare and/or Mr Jonny
                            Abbas and/or Mr Radius have converted and/or wrongfully detained the
                            Cargo to their own use and have wholly deprived the Plaintiffs of the
                            use of the same. By reason of the aforesaid matters, the Defendants
                            and/or Mr Cuaca and/or PT Prolink Logistics and/or PT Prolink Clare
                            and/or Mr Jonny Abbas and/or Mr Radius have denied and/or acted in a
                            manner inconsistent with the rights of the Plaintiffs to the
                            Cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    I was not persuaded by his arguments for
                    various reasons. The parties conducted the trial on the basis of a cause of
                    action in conversion. The plea of demand and refusal was proof of the act of
                    conversion rather than a reliance on the cause of action of detinue. This was
                    the Defendant’s objection as well. As an illustration, the Plaintiffs
                    submitted in their Opening Statement at paragraph 3 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiffs’ primary contention is that the Defendants’
                        failure to forthwith deliver up the cargo to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs upon demands made for the same
                        (beginning with a letter sent on 12 October 2009 from the
                        Plaintiffs’ solicitors to the Defendants) and continued detention of
                        the cargo, <em>amount to conversion of the
                        cargo</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I thus awarded damages to be assessed to the

                        10<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Several summonses were dealt with at the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Annexure A: the Group B Plaintiffs proprietary title to the Group B

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1_1"></a>1       The Defendant challenged the Group B
                    Plaintiffs’ proprietary title to the Group B Cargo claiming that they did
                    not provide proper verification of their title to the goods.<sup></sup>On reviewing and evaluating the evidence, I was satisfied on a
                    balance of probabilities that the Group B Plaintiffs had established their
                    proprietary title to the respective goods. There was evidence of payment by the
                    Group B Plaintiffs for the Group B Cargo. Suppliers who sold on credit terms did
                    not reserve title to the goods during the credit period or until payment. For
                    purchasers who were able to their suppliers to testify at the trial, the
                    suppliers testified that the goods were paid for. In all cases, the evidence was
                    that payments were made before August 2009 and with that, title no longer lay
                    with the suppliers.</p>
