However, other matters that will lead the court to subsequently refuse to sanction a scheme should also be brought to the court’s attention (see the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re T&amp;N Ltd (No 3) </span>[2007] 1 BCLC 563 at [19]). Therefore, issues that should be raised and considered at the leave stage include:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) classification of creditors, and in this regard, “[a]ny issues in relation to a possible need for separate meetings for different classes of creditors ought to be unambiguously brought to the attention of the court” (see <span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [62]);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) whether there is a realistic prospect of the proposed scheme receiving the requisite approval of the creditors, as the court “should not act in vain in granting the application for meetings to be convened” (see <span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [64]); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii)  any allegation of an abuse of process by the applicant-company: “… given the inherent jurisdiction of the court to ensure that its processes are not improperly invoked, an order under s 210(1) would be refused if it is shown that the application amounts to an abuse of process” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Punj Lloyd Pte Ltd</span> [2015] SGHC 321 at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Importantly, the company bears a duty of disclosure at the leave stage, in that, amongst other things, it must “unreservedly disclose all material information” to assist the court in determining how the creditors’ meeting is to be conducted (see <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Other aspects of the court’s inquiry at the leave stage include:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) that the court should generally not the consider the merits and reasonableness of the proposed scheme, as these are issues that should be left for the creditors to decide (see <span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [63]); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) that as time is ordinarily of the essence in restructuring matters, the leave application “should be heard on an expedited basis” (see <span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In the present case, Parastate’s objections were essentially made in relation to the requirements that: (a) the creditors of the applicant-company ought to be classified correctly (see [8(b)(i)] above); (b) the scheme must be feasible and merit due consideration by the creditors when it is eventually placed before them (see [8(a)] above); and (c) and the applicant must have provided full and frank disclosure in its application (see [8(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Despite these objections, I found that the requirements for the granting of leave to convene a scheme meeting were met.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parastate should not be classified separately from other unsecured creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Taking first the issue of creditor classification, I was of the view that Parastate was correctly classified together with the rest of the unsecured creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The test for whether the creditors have been appropriately classified is found in the statements of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>: that those creditors whose rights are so dissimilar to each other that they cannot sensibly consult together with a view to their common interest must vote in different classes. The test is based on similarity or dissimilarity of legal rights against the company, not on similarity or dissimilarity of interests not derived from such legal rights (at [130]–[131]). There are three broad steps involved in undertaking the inquiry of creditor classification (see <span class="font-italic">Pathfinder </span>at [88]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, identification of the appropriate comparator, which compares the relative rights of creditors among each other under the scheme, against their relative rights in the most likely scenario in the absence of scheme approval (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [140]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, assessment of whether the relative positions of the creditors under the proposed scheme mirror their relative positions in the comparator. This implies that at least four positions must be identified and compared: the positions of the two groups of creditors under the proposed scheme, and their positions in the comparator; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, if there is a difference between the creditors’ relative positions identified in the second step, the court must assess whether the extent of the difference is such as to render the creditors’ rights so dissimilar that they cannot sensibly consult together with a view to their common interest. This is a question of judgment and degree, and the court generally takes a broad, practical and objective approach that seeks to avoid an impractical mushrooming of classes that could potentially result in the creation of unjustified minority vetoes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 First, I agree with the parties

In these circumstances, the creditors would appear to have similar, if not identical, rights and it would, therefore, be appropriate for them to be consolidated in the same class.

Parastate was not a secured creditor because it had a claim for breach of trust. If a trust exists over specific property held in the name of a company, that property would simply not be part of the company’s assets. Here, however, the supposed trust property was no longer in the hands of Babel Asia or Babel Finance anyway: the undisputed fact was that the alleged trust assets had been lost

In any event, I also found that there was no certainty of intention on the part of the applicant to create a trust. This was evident from the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there is no express contractual requirement for Babel Asia to segregate funds received as part of the Management Programme in the management agreement between Parastate and Babel Asia.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Therefore, I agreed with the applicant that any claims on Parastate’s part against Babel Asia/Babel Finance would be at best claims for equitable compensation for breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duties, or damages for breach of contract, which are unsecured personal claims which rank <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> with those of other unsecured creditors (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd (in administrative receivership) and others </span>[2012] Ch 453 at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Turning to Parastate’s second argument, I disagreed that any potential claim by Parastate against a third party to the Proposed scheme, Del Wang, for dishonest assistance would affect its relative position under the Proposed Scheme. Indeed, counsel for the applicant correctly submitted during the hearing that it is trite that any scheme does not compromise a creditor’s claim against a third party, such as a guarantor whose liability is joint and several with that of the debtor-company, for the same debts and liabilities of the debtor-company (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Daewoo Singapore</span> <span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v CEL Tractors Pte Ltd </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 791 at [32]). Accordingly, even if one takes the view that the nature of the dishonest assistant’s liability is shared jointly and severally with that of the trustee in breach, which is a question left open by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Von Roll Asia Pte Ltd v Goh Boon Bay and others </span>[2018] 4 SLR 1053 at [117], any potential claim by Parastate against Del Wang would not be affected by the Proposed Scheme. But more fundamentally, the relevant comparison at this stage relates to the relative rights of the creditors against the company which is proposing the scheme, and not a creditor’s rights against a third party. Thus, Parastate’s arguments in respect of its potential claim against Del Wang were misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Given the conclusions above, it was clear that Parastate’s interests are not so dissimilar to those of other unsecured creditors that it cannot sensibly consult with such creditors with a view to their common interest. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the creditors under the Proposed Scheme, including Parastate, are appropriately classified in a single class.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Proposed Scheme is feasible and merits due consideration by the creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I turn to the second issue of whether the Proposed Scheme is feasible and merits due consideration by the creditors when it is eventually placed before them, a question which in my view is answered in the affirmative. Key to this issue was that the applicant had proposed a Deed Poll Structure where a single company would execute a deed poll to become a primary co-obligor in respect of all claims against the companies in the Babel Group so that a single scheme of arrangement may be proposed in respect of the entire corporate group. The Proposed Scheme is also premised on substantial consolidation which means that the assets and/or liabilities of the companies in the Babel Group would be pooled together.

It was also alleged that the Deed Poll Structure was created as a matter of administrative convenience only and not for any justifiable reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Turning to the applicable law, a preliminary view was expressed in <span class="font-italic">Re Babel Holding Ltd and other matters </span>[2023] SGHC 98 that the court does not find either substantive consolidation or the Deed Poll Structure to be inappropriate in principle; and, importantly, the language of s 210 of the Companies Act seems to be broad enough to encompass such actions as the words “compromise” and “arrangement” in s 210 are not limited in their meaning. There is therefore no reason to find that these terms cannot encompass mechanisms such as substantive consolidation and the Deed Poll Structure (at [20]–[21]). As the occasion has now arisen, I conclusively affirm this position. Going further, I am of the view that the factors to consider in determining whether a Deed Poll Structure and/or substantive consolidation is appropriate include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the affairs of the group companies are so hopelessly intertwined that a pooling of their assets, with a distribution enabling the like dividend to be paid to the companies’ creditors, is the only sensible way to proceed (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 3) </span>[1993] BCLC 1940 (“<span class="font-italic">Re BCCI</span>”) at 1501; see also the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re DSG Asia Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2022] 3 SLR 1250 (“<span class="font-italic">Re DSG Asia</span>”) at [71]). While <span class="font-italic">Re BCCI </span>concerned a liquidator’s entry into a scheme on a pooled basis, I am of the view that there is no reason why this consideration should not apply in situations where the company proposing the scheme has not yet entered into liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the structure unfairly overrides the legitimate interests of creditors pursuant to the contracts governing their relationship with the primary obligor companies (see <span class="font-italic">Re DSG Asia </span>at [71]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the terms of the restructuring demonstrably benefit the affected creditors (see <span class="font-italic">Re DSG Asia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [71]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Having regard to the factors above, I was of the view that a Deed Poll Structure and substantial consolidation is appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 First, I was satisfied that the affairs of the Babel Group are so hopelessly intertwined that a pooling of their assets is the only sensible way to proceed.

It was also said that vast expenditure and time would be needed to identify which entity in the Babel Group owns the money and cryptocurrency, which the Babel Group cannot afford. I thought that this is not inherently unbelievable; indeed, there was no evidence admitted contradicting this claim.

As mentioned above (at [17]), the trust assets which Parastate claims to have a proprietary claim over have been lost. While it might be conceivable that Parastate might be prejudiced by this structure if it has a legitimate proprietary claim which is the subject of a promised compromise, this consideration no longer applies now. As such, there is no discernible detriment to Parastate even if the proposed structure forms the basis of the scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, there is some possibility that this structure can demonstrably benefit the affected creditors.
