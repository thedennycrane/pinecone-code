</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.    This was an appeal from the decision of Woo

Bih Li JC dismissing an application by the appellants, Golden Village Multiplex Pte Ltd

(‘Golden Village’), for an order that the agreement for a lease dated 28

February 1995, which they made with the respondents, Marina Centre Holdings Pte Ltd

(‘Marina Centre’), was void, illegal and/or unenforceable. We dismissed the

appeal and now give our reasons.

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background facts</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    The relevant facts giving rise to the appeal were

not in dispute and were briefly these. Marina Centre own and manage a building known as

‘Leisureplex’ and the adjoining shopping mall, both of which are located in a

complex known as the Marina Square. By an agreement dated 28 February 1995 made between

them and Golden Village, they agreed to lease to Golden Village the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>

levels and a part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> level of the Leisureplex, more particularly

described in the Agreement (collectively called ‘the premises’) to be used as a

cinema complex for a term of 15 years. The entire complex stands on lots 357 and 358 of

Town Subdivision 11 situate at Raffles Boulevard. Annexed to the Agreement was a form of

the lease (‘annexed lease’) which was agreed to be executed by the parties

eventually. The agreement and the annexed lease are together hereinafter referred to as

‘the Agreement’. Clause 8 of the Agreement provided as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">8. <u>TENANT TO EXECUTE THE ANNEXED LEASE</u></p>
<p align="justify">The Tenant shall on or before the time fixed for the commencement

  of the TERM upon receipt of a twenty-eight (28) day written notice from the Landlord duly

  execute the ANNEXED LEASE with such amendments or variations thereto only as may be agreed

  between the parties hereto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    The annexed lease was not in the form prescribed

under the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 1994 ed) (‘LTA’), and therefore was not

capable of being registered with the Registry of Titles. It was not the intention of

Marina Centre to apply for and obtain subdivision approval for the premises comprised in

the Agreement and accordingly no registrable lease could be granted to Golden Village.

This intention was communicated to Golden Village at an early stage in the negotiations.

Initially, this was not acceptable to Golden Village, which required the proposed lease to

be registered with the Registry of Titles. There were subsequent negotiations between them

on the point, and eventually Golden Village were prevailed upon to accept the lease in the

form of the annexed lease. The Agreement was duly signed by Golden Village and was

returned to Marina Centre on 9 January 1995 for stamping. In July 1996 or thereabouts,

Golden Village took possession of the premises pursuant to the Agreement.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    To reflect the agreement that the lease of the

premises to be executed by the parties would not be in a registrable form, cl 9 of the

Agreement provided as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">9. <u>COVENANTS BY THE TENANT</u></p>
<p align="justify">The Tenant hereby covenants with the Landlord as follows:-</p>
<p align="justify">9.1 That it shall during all periods of use and/or occupation of the

  PREMISES prior to the commencement of the TERM be bound by all terms, covenants,

  conditions, stipulations and provisions set out in the ANNEXED LEASE so far as the same

  may be applicable.</p>
<p align="justify">9.2 That it shall not, during the continuance of the TERM, register the

  lease to be granted under this Agreement to Lease and the ANNEXED LEASE at the Registry of

  Land Titles and Deeds, Singapore or at any other registry in Singapore, or to require the

  Landlord to subdivide the BUILDING or any part thereof or to do any act or thing which

  could result in the Landlord being required to subdivide the BUILDING or any part thereof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    Nothing of any consequence in relation to the

Agreement happened until some four years later. On 12 April 2000, Golden Village wrote to

Marina Centre requesting a formal lease of the premises for their review and execution.

Marina Centre forwarded a lease to Golden Village for execution. In response, the latter

commented that the terms set out in the enclosed lease were the same as those set out in

the annexed lease. They further pointed out that Marina Centre had not forwarded to them a

lease in an approved form under the LTA. In reply, Marina Centre drew Golden

Village’s attention to cl 9.2 of the agreement. Further correspondence between them

ensued, and Golden Village insisted that the lease had to be registrable under the LTA.

Thereafter, from January 2001, Golden Village failed or refused to pay rent for the

premises, and Marina Centre called on the guarantee issued by The Hongkong And Shanghai

Banking Corporation Ltd for the sum of $198,971.20 in payment to account of the rent of

$215,245.28.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    On 12 February 2001, Golden Village took out an

application by way of an originating summons seeking a declaration that the Agreement was

void, illegal and/or unenforceable and consequential relief. Before the court below,

several arguments were advanced on behalf of Golden Village. It was contended, inter alia,

that (a) there was a failure of consideration or that the consideration was illusory,

since Golden Village would not be getting a lease which could be registered; (b) that

although they knew they would not get a registrable lease, that was due to a mistake of

law which was shared by them and Marina Centre, as both parties thought that the agreement

had conferred some kind of interest in the premises; (c) the lease was tainted with

illegality and unenforceable as it was in breach of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1990 Ed)

(‘Planning Act’) on the ground that the lease constituted a subdivision of the

premises from the rest of the building without complying with the requirements of the

Planning Act.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The decision below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    The judge held that the Agreement was void at law.

In such an event, the position at common law was that the term created was a tenancy at

will, and since Golden Village had entered into possession of the premises and were paying

rent, a periodic tenancy was created. However, in equity, Golden Village had a term for

the period as stated in the agreement, and equity would also grant specific performance of

the Agreement, unless by reason of the conduct of the party concerned the court refuses to

grant any relief. The judge relied also on s 45(2) of the LTA which provides that nothing

therein is to be construed as preventing any unregistered instrument from operating as a

contract. The judge held that in the present case, Golden Village would not be getting a

registrable lease under the Agreement. That notwithstanding, should Marina Centre choose

to jeopardise Golden Village’s interest as a tenant in the premises, their interest

would be protected by the court granting the suitable remedy.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    Finally, the judge held that s 2(2) of the

Planning Act applied to instruments in an approved form. Thus, if a lease was in an

approved form and was executed without obtaining a subdivision from the relevant

authorities, the lessor would be in breach of s 10(3) read with s 2(2) of the Planning

Act. As the Agreement was not in an approved form, there was no breach of the Planning

Act. In any case, the judge held that breach of the Planning Act did not necessarily mean

that the lease was void and unenforceable.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appeal</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    There were mainly three issues raised in this

appeal. The first is whether the Agreement being void at law would operate as a contract

in equity. The second is whether the Agreement contravened the provisions of the Planning

Act on the ground that no sub-division approval had been obtained. The third issue is

whether under s 87 of the LTA the lease granted to Golden Village must be in the approved

form.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Equitable lease</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    The first submission of counsel for Golden

Village was that the Agreement was void at law under s 53(1) of the Conveyancing and Law

of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 ed) (‘CLPA’). That, in our view, was correct,

as s 53(1) provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">53.–(1) A conveyance of any estate or interest in land other than

  a lease for a period not exceeding 7 years at a rack rent shall be void at law unless it

  is by deed in the English language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Plainly the Agreement fell within the terms of s 53(1) of the CLPA and

was void at law. Under s 2 of the CLPA, the term ‘conveyance’ includes a lease,

and a ‘lease’ includes ‘an agreement for a lease where the lessee has

become entitled to have his lease granted’. In this case, since the Agreement was not

executed by way of a deed, it was therefore void under s 53(1) of the CLPA.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    Next, counsel submitted that the Agreement not

being registered under the LTA was ineffectual to pass any estate or interest in the

premises. Here counsel was also correct. Section s 45(1) of the LTA provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) No instrument until registered as in this Act provided is effectual

  to pass any estate or interest in land under the provisions of this Act, but upon

  registration of an instrument the estate or interest therein specified shall pass, or the

  land shall become liable as security for the payment of money (as the case may be),

  subject to such covenants and conditions as are set forth in the instrument and are

  capable of taking effect, and subject to such covenants and conditions as are by law

  declared to be implied in instruments of a like nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    These submissions, though incontrovertible, did

not conclude the matter in issue. As the judge below held, and we agreed, it does not

follow that the Agreement is devoid of any legal effect and is incapable of creating any

rights. The Agreement operates as a contract and the terms thereof and the rights of the

parties thereunder are enforceable in equity under the doctrine of <i>Walsh v Lonsdale</i>

(1882) 21 Ch D 9. It will be treated as an equitable lease for the term agreed upon and as

between the parties to the agreement is equivalent to a lease at law. The authorities in

support are legend. No less than four Australian cases have been cited by the judge and

were considered by him in depth: <i>Leitz Leeholme Stud Pty Ltd v Robinson</i> [1977] 2 NSWLR 544; <i>The Progressive Mailing House Proprietary Limited v Tabali Proprietary </i>Limited

[1985] 157 CLR 17; <i>Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd</i> [1989] 168 CLR 242 FC; <i>Telado P/L v

Vincent &amp; Anor</i> [1996] NSW Conv R 56,035. For our purpose, it is sufficient to

quote below the following passage of the judgment of Mason J in <i>The Progressive Mailing

House Proprietary Ltd v Tabali Proprietary Ltd</i> (supra) at p 26:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In equity, however, a written lease not under seal was regarded as

  evidencing an agreement for lease. As an agreement for lease was capable of specific

  performance equity would decree specific performance of the written lease by ordering the

  execution of a lease under seal. In the meantime, in accordance with the doctrine of <i>Walsh

  v Lonsdale</i> (1882) 21 Ch D 9, the relationship between the parties in equity was that

  of landlord and tenant: <i>Carberry v Gardiner</i> (1936) 36 SR (NSW) at p 569. The

  landlord could, if necessary, be restrained by injunction from acting on the footing that

  the other party was merely a tenant at will or a tenant from year to year: <i>Walsh v

  Lonsdale</i>; <i>Dockrill v Cavanagh</i> (1944) 45 SR (NSW) 78 at p 83.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    Counsel for Golden Village, while accepting these

authorities, submitted that in this case, under the Agreement, the lease agreed to be

executed by the parties was in the form not registrable under the LTA. Therefore, the

Agreement was not capable of being enforced by specific performance in the sense that the

execution of a registrable lease and registration thereof with the Registry of Titles

could not be specifically ordered; that was not what was provided in the Agreement. In

other words, the equitable remedy of specific performance according to the principles in <i>Walsh

v Lonsdale</i> (1882) 21 Ch D 9 would not be available to Marina Centre.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.    This argument was totally misconceived. Once an

agreement is enforceable in equity, the court in enforcing it is not confined to giving

only the remedy of specific performance. In enforcing an agreement, the court may grant

such other remedy as it may deem fit and as circumstances may require, for instance, an

injunction restraining a party from breaching or continuing to breach an agreement or a

mandatory injunction compelling a party to perform certain acts under the agreement. A

clear statement in support is the following passage of the judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan,

Deane and McHugh JJ in <i>Chan v Cresdon Proprietary Ltd </i>(supra) at p 252:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">For present purposes these authorities establish two propositions.

  First, the court’s willingness to treat the agreement as a lease in equity, on the

  footing that equity regards as done what ought to be done and equity looks to the intent

  rather than the form, rests upon the specific enforceability of the agreement. Secondly,

  an agreement for a lease will be treated by a court administering equity as an equitable

  lease for the term agreed upon and, as between the parties, as the equivalent of a lease

  at law, though the lessee does not have a lease at law in the sense of having a legal

  interest in the term.</p>
<p align="justify">The first proposition requires some elaboration or qualification in

  order to accommodate what has been said in later cases. Although it has been stated

  sometimes that the equitable interest is commensurate with what a court of equity would

  decree to enforce the contract, whether by way of specific performance (<i>Connolly v Ryan</i>

  (1922) 30 CLR 498, at pp 506-507; <i>Brown v Heffer</i> (1967) 116 CLR 344, at p 349;

  <i>Chang v Registrar of Titles</i> (1976) 137 CLR 177, at pp 184-185, 189-190), injunction

  or otherwise (<i>Taliby v Official Receiver</i> (1888) 13 App Cas 523, at pp 546-549; <i>Redman

  v Permanent Trustee Co</i> (1916) 22 CLR, at p 96; <i>Legione v Hateley</i> (1983) 152 CLR

  406, at pp 446, 456), the references in the earlier cases to specific performance should

  be understood in the sense of Sir Frederick Jordan’s explanation adopted by Deane and

  Dawson JJ in <i>Stern v McArthur</i> (1988) 165 CLR 489, at p 522:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Specific performance in this sense means not merely specific

    performance in the primary sense of the enforcing of an executory contract by compelling

    the execution of an assurance to complete it, but also the protection by injunction or

    otherwise of rights acquired under a contract which defines the rights of the

    parties’: … ‘Chapters on Equity in New South Wales’, <i>Select Legal

    Papers</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> ed (1947), p 52, n.(e)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In relation to the second proposition stated above Maitland, in his <i>Lectures

  on Equity</i>, 2nd ed (1936), p 158, in a statement quoted by Latham CJ in <i>Williams v

  Frayne</i> (1937) 58 CLR, at p 720, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"An equitable right is not equivalent to a legal right; between

    the contracting parties an agreement for a lease may be as good as a lease … But

    introduce the third party and then you will see the difference."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.    In our judgment, in protecting the rights of the

parties under the Agreement in equity, the appropriate equitable remedy is not confined by

<i>Walsh v Lonsdale</i> principles to the strict and narrow meaning of specific

performance. It is open to the court to make the appropriate orders to protect the rights

of the parties. Hence, notwithstanding that the Agreement remains unregistrable under the

LTA, the rights of the parties thereunder are enforceable in equity and will be protected.

We therefore agreed with the judge that a lease or an agreement for a lease, which is not

by deed or in an approved form under the LTA, is nevertheless enforceable in equity under

the <i>Walsh v Lonsdale</i> principles.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16    It bears mentioning that that the LTA has specific

provisions which are intended to preserve and protect equitable interests in land. In so

far as a lease is concerned, s 45(2) of the LTA reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing any

  unregistered instrument from operating as a contract….</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Planning Act</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.    The next issue turns on the construction of

certain provisions of the Planning Act. On this issue, counsel for Golden Village raised

extensive arguments contending that the Agreement was in breach of the Planning Act as

Marina Centre had subdivided the premises without obtaining the requisite permission from

the relevant authority. As such, the Agreement was illegal and void at law and in equity.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.    On this issue we need to turn to the relevant

provisions of the Planning Act. First, s 10 by sub-s (3) provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(3) No person shall subdivide any land unless — </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) he has obtained the written permission of the competent

    authority…</p>
<p align="justify">(b) he has made an application to the Collector and has deposited a sum

    sufficient to cover the fees for the survey of all lots comprised in the permitted

    subdivision…" </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The penalty for a breach of this subsection is provided by sub-s(8) of

s 10, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(8) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) or (3), shall be guilty

  of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 and, in the

  case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $100 for every day after the

  first day during which the offence continues after conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Next, the term ‘to subdivide’ is specifically defined in s

2(2) which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">… for the purposes of this Act, a person is said to subdivide land

  if, by any deed or instrument, he conveys, assigns, demises or otherwise disposes of any

  part of the land in such a manner that the part so disposed of becomes capable of being

  registered under the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap. 269) or, in the case of registered

  land, being included in a separate folio of the land-register under the Land Titles Act

  (Cap. 157), and "subdivide" and "subdivision" shall be construed

  accordingly:</p>
<p align="justify">Provided that a lease for a period not exceeding 7 years without the

  option of renewal or purchase shall not be deemed to be a disposal within the meaning of

  this definition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.    The Agreement, being an agreement for a lease of

the premises comprised therein for 15 years, was clearly a disposal in relation to these

premises. But the question is whether such premises are ‘capable of being included in

a separate folio of the land-register under the Land Titles Act’. In our opinion, the

answer lies in s 51 and more importantly in 165 of the LTA. Section 51 provides as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) The forms from time to time approved by the Registrar shall be used

  for all instruments intended to affect registered land.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) The Registrar may register any instrument containing departures

  from an approved form and the instrument shall be deemed to be in a form approved by the

  Registrar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.    Thus, s 51(1) of the LTA requires approved forms

for dealing in land to be used for the purpose of registration. In the present case, the

Agreement was not in an approved form, and cannot be registered under the LTA. However,

this is only a matter of form, and the Registrar has discretion to register an instrument

containing departures from the approved form. In our opinion, the real difficulty in the

way of counsel’s argument is s 165 of the LTA which, in so far as relevant, provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) Except as provided in this section, the Registrar shall not

  register any instrument affecting part of the land in a folio until he is satisfied

  that -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the authority for the time being charged with the duty of

    controlling or supervising the subdivision of the land has certified that the lawful

    requirements of that authority relating to subdivision have been complied with; ...</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the boundaries and dimensions of part of the land in a folio

    described in an instrument are in accordance with the final boundaries and dimensions

    shown in the plan lodged with and approved by the Chief Surveyor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) Where the Registrar has created a new folio pursuant to a

  registration of part of the land which is not conclusive as to boundaries and dimensions,

  he shall enter thereon a caution to that effect, and he shall cancel that caution when the

  boundaries and dimensions have been shown on the plan lodged with and approved by the

  Chief Surveyor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The effect of these provisions is that an instrument affecting a part

of the land not included in a separate folio of the land-register is not registrable,

unless subdivision approval for that part of the land has been obtained from the relevant

authority under the Planning Act. In the instant case, the Agreement affects only those

premises, which form part of the land included in the folio of the land-register, and no

subdivision approval for those premises have been obtained. That being the position, the

Agreement is not registrable under s 165(1) of the LTA and in consequence the premises

comprised therein are not ‘capable of being included in a separate folio of the

land-register’ under the LTA.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.    A case directly in point is <i>Chin Hwa Trading

Pte Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=2591&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1986] 1 MLJ 207</a>. There, a sub-sub-purchaser

purchased an uncompleted property put up at an auction sale by the mortgagee bank. The

property was one of the lots that the original purchaser had subdivided into separate

factory units without having first obtained the requisite permission from the relevant

authorities. Following a notice to complete, the sub-sub-purchaser made an application to

court for determination whether the auction sale agreement was unenforceable because it

amounted to an agreement to complete the sale and purchase of property by an act in breach

of the equivalent sections of the Planning Act relating to subdivision. The

sub-sub-purchaser argued that the contract was not one that the mortgagee could lawfully

perform because in order to perform it, the mortgagee, inter alia, had to execute an

instrument assigning to the sub-sub-purchaser ‘all the estate right and title to the

property’, and it was contended that this instrument amounted to a subdivision of the

land within the meaning of the Planning Act. Wee Chong Jin CJ approached the argument as

follows at p 209:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">First, it is contended on behalf of the sub-sub-purchaser that as no

  approval has been given by the competent authority as provided in section 9(3)(a) of the

  Planning Act for the subdivision of the ground floor of Block B into more than one

  separate factory unit, the auction sale agreement of April 18, 1984 is "tainted with

  illegality". It is said that the contract is illegal because it amounts to an

  agreement to complete the sale and purchase of the property by an illegal act in breach of

  section 9(3) and punishable under section 9(9).</p>
<p align="justify">The argument, as I understand it, is that it is a contract that the

  mortgagee could not lawfully perform because in order to perform it the mortgagee has to

  execute an instrument assigning to the sub-sub-purchaser, <i>inter alia</i>, "all the

  estate right and title to the property" and which instrument subdivides land within

  the meaning of the Planning Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The learned Chief Justice then came to the following conclusion at p

210:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether or not the argument advanced on behalf of the sub-sub-purchaser

  is right depends on the construction of the expression "subdivide" as defined in

  section 2. In my opinion it must be implicit in that definition that it is the instrument

  which becomes capable of being registered or being included in a separate folio of the

  land register before a person can be said to subdivide land within the meaning of the

  Planning Act. The reason is because the Registration of Deeds Act and the Land Titles Act

  provide for the registration of instruments affecting land and not of land.</p>
<p align="justify">In the present case the agreement itself is clearly not capable of

  becoming registered under the Registration of Deeds Act or being included in a separate

  folio of the land register under the Land Titles Act and accordingly the agreement does

  not subdivide land within the meaning of the Planning Act and does not infringe the

  provisions of section 9(3) of the Planning Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There is only a minor point on which we did not quite agree with the

learned Chief Justice. His Honour held that it was implicit in s 2 of the Planning Act

that the matter to be considered as capable of being recorded in a separate folio was the

instrument disposing of the part of the land in question. However, in our opinion, on a

plain reading of s 2, the matter to be considered for the purpose was that part of the

land disposed of by the instrument, and not the instrument itself. In all other respect,

we agree fully with the learned Chief Justice. In the instant case, Marina Centre by the

Agreement leased those premises comprised therein to Golden Village, but no subdivision

approval for those premises had been obtained under the Planning Act. That being so, the

Agreement is not capable of being registered under the LTA and following from this the

premises comprised therein are not capable of being included in a separate folio of the

land-register. It further follows that the Agreement did not amount to a subdivision of a

part of the land in question within the meaning of the Planning Act.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Lease not in approved form</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    Finally, counsel for Golden Village sought to

argue that s 87(1) of the LTA is a mandatory section, and that if registered land was to

be leased for more than seven years, then the instrument used must be in the approved form

so that it can be registered. She submitted that a failure to do so would render the

agreement illegal and unenforceable, and that was what had happened in this case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    We were unable to agree. Section 87(1) reads as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) Registered land may be leased for any term of years exceeding 7

  years by an instrument of lease in the approved form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In our opinion, s 87(1) of the LTA is by its terms not a mandatory

provision. There is nothing in the context of that section or the surrounding

circumstances which impelled us to construe it as a mandatory provision. Accepting the

argument advanced on behalf of Golden Village would amount to requiring all leases

exceeding seven years to be registered. This cannot be correct as the Torrens system of

registration permits and recognises the existence of interests in land other than

registered interests, and in particular, equitable interests. Furthermore, s 87 (2) of the

LTA provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(2) The Registrar shall not register any lease unless —</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the term is expressed to exceed 7 years;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the date of commencement of the term and its maximum duration are

    certain; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) the lease purports to confer on the lessee exclusive possession of

    land.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    This follow-on provision does not in any way

suggest that s 87(1) of the LTA is mandatory. Rather, it merely limits the

Registrar’s discretion to register a lease subject to the satisfaction of the

conditions listed therein. Accordingly, in this case, the equitable lease continued to be

valid and subsisting, and there was therefore no illegality involved in the Agreement.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Conclusion</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    Our conclusion is that Golden Village had not

bargained for a lease with indefeasible title as provided for under the LTA. What it had

agreed to, however, was an unregistrable lease which, while it may not be registered under

the LTA, created an equitable interest in land, which as between the parties is capable of

being specifically enforced. The unregistrable lease did not amount to subdivision of the

land as defined under the Planning Act and so had not breached any of the provisions

stated therein.</p>
