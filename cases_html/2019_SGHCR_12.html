In this regard, counsel explained that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) in the light of a recent case decision in <span class="font-italic">Ahmad Kasim bin Adam (suing as an administrator of the estate of Adam bin Haji Anwar and in his own personal capacity) v Moona Esmail Tamby Merican s/o Mohamed Ganse and others</span> [2019] 1 SLR 1185, the plaintiff has formed the view that the Land Acquisition Challenge Claim should be dealt with by way of a judicial review proceedings instead; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Land Acquisition Challenge Claim is, in the plaintiff’s opinion, dependent on the prior question of whether there is any merit in the Title Claim – a question which should remain to be determined in the Action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 As a result, the substantive oral arguments at the hearing revolved largely around the question of whether the Title Claim ought to be struck out under Order 18 Rule 19(1) and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendants’ case for striking out </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Insofar as the Title Claim is concerned, the main thrusts of the defendants’ case for striking out are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the plaintiff’s Endorsement of Claim and Statement of Claim (i) fail to disclose a reasonable cause of action, and/or (ii) are scandalous, frivolous, vexatious and/or an abuse of the process of the court; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Action is time-barred under the doctrine of laches and acquiescence, pursuant to the court’s equitable jurisdiction as statutorily preserved under section 32 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (the “Limitation Act”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In support of [10(a)] above, much of the arguments focussed on the circumstances in which a perpetual <span class="font-italic">wakaf </span>under Syariah law was established in respect of the Siglap Land, shortly after Kassim acquired an interest in fee simple therein in 1919.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff alleges that on 19 January 1920, Kassim and three other persons (who shall hereinafter be individually referred to as “Oona Said”, “Pana Shaik” and “Ibrahim”) entered into an Indenture of Deed (the “1920 Deed”), whereunder: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Kassim, Oona Said and Pana Shaik became tenants-in-common holding shares in the ratio of 21:3:2 respectively in the Siglap Land;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Kassim, Oona Said and Pana Shaik conveyed the Siglap Land to Kassim and Ibrahim as joint tenants; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Kassim and Ibrahim were to manage or superintend the management of the Siglap Land “upon trust”, and permit the Siglap Land to be “appropriated and used by the general public of the Mohamaden community in Singapore as a public burial ground for Mohamedans under the name of Bukit Wakaff Siglap, according to such rule and regulation as may from time to time be prescribed by them”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff further alleges in the Statement of Claim that on 30 April 1921, a Deed of Settlement expressed to be supplemental to the 1920 Deed (the “1921 Deed”) was entered into between Kassim and the same three persons (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Oona Said, Pana Shaik and Ibrahim), wherein it was stated that the Siglap Land “shall be a charitable property according to the custom or usage of Tanah Wakaf”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Counsel for the defendants submitted <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that by the plaintiff’s own account in the Statement of Claim, Kassim would not have retained any beneficial interest in the Siglap Land after both the 1920 Deed and 1921 Deed were executed, as the terms of those Deeds did not reserve any beneficial interest in the same to be vested in Kassim. In this regard, counsel highlighted <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> section 2 of the AMLA and <span class="font-italic">Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura v Saeed Salman and another </span>[2016] 2 SLR 26 (at [34]), where a <span class="font-italic">wakaf</span> as understood under domestic law is “the permanent dedication by a Muslim of any movable or immovable property for any purpose recognised by the Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable”, and a “foundation endowed in perpetuity”, which “[i]n the eye of the law, the property belongs to God, and as such, the dedication is both permanent and irrevocable”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Counsel for the defendants further raised arguments addressing Zainal’s conduct in his lifetime and his legal position <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Siglap Land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Notably, counsel also invited the Court to accept the defendants’ case that the Action is a “sham” and a “scam” perpetuated in bad faith by the plaintiff in the hope of seeking a monetary pay out from the Government. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The defendants’ submissions in respect of the alleged time bar under the doctrine of laches and acquiescence (see [10(b)] above) are as follows. The defendants contend that Zainal’s failure to raise any claims over the decades during his lifetime (be it in his personal capacity or in his capacity as administrator of Kassim’s estate) amounted to an approval or acquiescence not to pursue the claims that are now brought in the Action. The defendants further claim to be prejudiced, given that information and evidence (including Zainal’s testimony) that may be useful are now unavailable due to the delay, and that it is unconscionable for the plaintiff to seek to “contradict the positions taken by her grandfather and father since about 100 years ago, in order to bring this [Action] in 2019”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 For completeness, the defendants also raised two further (and alternative) grounds concerning time bar, namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Time bar under section 9(1) of the Limitation Act, which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No action shall be brought by any person to recover any land after the expiration of 12 years from the date on which the right of action accrued to him or, if it first accrued to some person through whom he claims, to that person.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Time bar under section 22(2) of the Limitation Act, which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to subsection (1), an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property or in respect of any breach of trust, not being an action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by any other provision of this Act, shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the right of action accrued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 However, it should be mentioned that these other grounds appear to be couched in terms suggesting that they are addressing more the Land Acquisition Challenge Claim than they are calculated to target the Title Claim specifically. For instance, in the defendants’ written submissions, they stated that the Action is time-barred under section 9(1) of the Limitation Act “because by the time the [Action] was commenced on 1 February 2019, more than 12 years have passed <span class="font-italic">since the Government took possession of the Siglap Land and title was vested in the State</span>” (emphasis added). Likewise on section 22(2) of the Limitation Act, the defendants stated that “<span class="font-italic">if</span> (which is denied) section 9(1) did not apply, <span class="font-italic">then</span> the [Action] was time-barred under section 22(2) of the Limitation Act by the time the [Action] was commenced on 1 February 2019 <span class="font-italic">(as more than 6 years have passed since title to the Siglap Land was vested in the State)</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s case resisting the striking out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The plaintiff did not tender any written submissions in respect of the Application. In oral submissions, her counsel dedicated a significant amount of time in the attempt to persuade this Court that because the dispute concerns matters involving a <span class="font-italic">wakaf</span> under Islamic law, it is necessary for the dispute to be adjudicated in a trial with expert evidence led from Islamic jurists. This is in conjunction with what seems to be the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">key</span> contention in the Title Claim, pleaded in the Statement of Claim as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7 The effect of the 1920 Deed and the 1921 Deed by Kassim, Oona Said, Pana Shaik and Ibrahim was to establish a perpetual <span class="font-italic">wakaf</span> under Syariah law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 <span class="font-underline">However, under Syariah law, a </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">wakaf</span><span class="font-underline"> may only be made in respect of up to one-third of the property of the person making the same. To the extent that a </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">wakaf</span><span class="font-underline"> exceeds one-third, it is only valid in respect of up to one-third</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9 <span class="font-underline">Accordingly, the </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">wakaf</span><span class="font-underline"> purportedly created over the other two-thirds of the Ancestral Siglap Land is invalid, and </span><span class="font-underline">Kassim and Ibrahim, continued to hold an interest in the same as joint tenants</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in underline added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Counsel for the plaintiff suggested that a court deciding the substantive merits of this key contention should draw a distinction between the applicable doctrines of the <span class="font-italic">Hanafi </span>school of Islam on the one hand, and those under the other established schools of Islam on the other. In particular, counsel contended that the former is the relevant school of Muslim law under which the plaintiff’s key contention is to be assessed, citing <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>the plaintiff’s assertion that she belongs to the <span class="font-italic">Hanafi</span> school, as well as documentary evidence in the form of an Inheritance Certificate previously issued by the Syariah Court in respect of Zainal’s estate, stating that “THIS CERTIFICATE OF INHERITANCE IS ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HANAFI SCHOOL OF MUSLIM LAW”. Counsel also adduced a couple of extracts from Muslim law literature purportedly covered under section 114(1) of the AMLA, to suggest that the doctrines of the <span class="font-italic">Hanafi</span> school would make good, in a substantive hearing, the plaintiff’s key contention mentioned above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In response to the defendants’ claim of time bar under the doctrine of laches and acquiescence, the plaintiff disputes any suggestion that Zainal had sufficient knowledge at the material time(s) as to warrant a finding that he had, in the course of his life, approved or acquiesced in not pursuing the claims that are now brought in the Action. In respect of the other time bar claims (see [16]-[17] above), it was asserted that section 9(1) of the Limitation Act is inapplicable as there is no recovery of land sought in the Action, and that section 22(2) of the Limitation Act is not intended to apply to <span class="font-italic">wakafs</span> (as distinct from trusts).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The plaintiff also denies the defendants’ attack on her <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in bringing the Action, as outlined in [14] above.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court’s decision </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of court process?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 This Court will first deal with the defendants’ allegations regarding the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in bringing the Action (see [14] above), in order to determine whether those allegations constitute any basis for striking out in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is established that an action not brought <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>for the purpose of obtaining relief but for some ulterior or collateral purpose is liable to be struck out for constituting an abuse of court process (see <span class="font-italic">Lonrho Plc and others v Fayed and others (No 5) </span>[1993] 1 WLR 1489 (“<span class="font-italic">Lonrho Plc v Fayed</span>”) at 1502D, endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners v Wee Chong Jin </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span>”) at [22]). Nevertheless, for such a striking out to be ordered, the case for striking out must be clear. As Stuart-Smith LJ opined in <span class="font-italic">Lonrho Plc v Fayed</span> (at 1502D):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If an action is not brought bona fide for the purpose of obtaining relief but for some ulterior or collateral purpose, it may be struck out as an abuse of the process of the court. The time of the court should not be wasted on such matters, and other litigants should not have to wait till they are disposed of. It may be that the trial judge will conclude that this is the case here; in which case he can dismiss the action then. <span class="font-italic">But for the court to strike it out on this basis at this stage it must be clear that this is the case</span>. […]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the present case, the defendants’ contentions in support of a striking out on this ground can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of demand dated 28 December 2018, the plaintiff demanded that the first defendant “takes all immediate and necessary steps to restore <span class="font-italic">the ownership</span> of the Siglap Land” (emphasis added) to the plaintiff, as if asserting rightful ownership over the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of the Siglap Land. Nothing in the letter of demand (including other previous correspondence sent by or on behalf of the plaintiff on the same matter dating back as early as 5 September 2017) evinced any assertion that the <span class="font-italic">wakaf</span> in respect of the Siglap Land was invalid to any extent or at all.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the Endorsement of Claim in the Writ of Summons filed on 1 February 2019, nothing was also stated therein to put into issue the validity of the <span class="font-italic">wakaf</span> to any extent or at all. In this regard, the contents of the Enforcement of Claim only revealed, as the gravamen of the plaintiff’s complaint, that no valid notice of the “purported” compulsory acquisition of the Siglap Land was given to “<span class="font-italic">inter alios </span>Zainal”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It was only much later when the Statement of Claim was filed on 28 March 2019, that the plaintiff alleged – for the very first time – that the <span class="font-italic">wakaf</span> was invalid to the extent of two-thirds, signifying her intention to assert a two-thirds beneficial share in the Siglap Land in favour of Zainal’s estate. This, according to the defendants, is inconsistent with what the plaintiff had asserted in the letter of demand and Endorsement of Claim, and is symptomatic of the plaintiff’s lack of <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in pursuing her claims against the Government.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The plaintiff had further been untruthful in claiming that prior to 2016 she and her family members were not aware that the Siglap Land had been compulsorily acquired, despite having allegedly made several entries into the Siglap Land over the years to maintain the premises. In this regard, the defendants contended that there is ample evidence demonstrating, for example, that the State had been making significant and noticeable improvements to the premises ever since the Siglap Land was compulsorily acquired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In this Court’s view, while several of these allegations, considered either in combination with one another or as a whole, do give some pause to an unquestioning acceptance of the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in the Action, they are not sufficiently clear or probative enough – at this stage – to warrant an absolute finding of bad faith as contended by the defendants. These allegations, though concerning, are at best circumstantial. As such, this Court does not find it appropriate to arrive at a determinative finding on this point in the absence of a trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Granted, the plaintiff appears to demonstrate a propensity to change the parameters of her substantive claims in the Action as the case unfolds (see [8] above, and [34] below). However, this on its own falls shy of lending <span class="font-italic">full</span> credence to the serious aspersions cast by the defendants on the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In sum, this Court finds that the case for striking out on the ground of abuse of court process has not been adequately made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other grounds advanced for striking out under Order 18 Rule 19(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I now turn to assess whether the defendants have nevertheless succeeded in establishing any other basis for striking out under Order 18 Rule 19(1) of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ground based on “no reasonable cause of action”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In the Application, the defendants have included “no reasonable cause of action” as one of the bases for striking out. Bearing in mind Order 18 Rule 19(2) of the Rules of Court, read with Rule 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) thereof, this Court finds that the defendants have not succeeded on this ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In the Endorsement of Claim, it is clear that the plaintiff is seeking relief based on the case that valid notice of the “purported” compulsory acquisition of the Siglap Land was not given to “<span class="font-italic">inter alios </span>Zainal”. The Statement of Claim, in turn, also quite comprehensibly presents the plaintiff’s case as comprising both the Land Acquisition Challenge Claim and the Title Claim. Short of a minute examination of the documentary material and factual matrix, the claims do appear, on their face, to have “some chance of success” (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span> at [21], citing <span class="font-italic">Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association </span>[1970] 1 All ER 1094 (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Pearson)). It thus cannot be said that it is plain and obvious that a striking out is warranted under this ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 For completeness, it is noted that the defendants have, in the Application summons, also stated as one of the grounds for striking out that “The Plaintiff’s claims in this action cannot be made by way of a Writ of Summons”. Although this seems to be suggesting that one or more of the claims in the Action ought to be commenced by way of a judicial review proceedings instead (see also [8(a)] above), this Court observes that the defendants have not actively advanced detailed arguments on this in the course of the current proceedings. As such, little weight was accorded to this ground in the Court’s analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ground based on “scandalous, frivolous or vexatious”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I come now to the ground of “scandalous, frivolous or vexatious” under Order 18 Rule 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court, although for reasons that will become apparent below, the focus is on the “frivolous or vexatious” limbs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is trite that the test of whether a claim or action should be struck out under Order 18 Rule 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court depends on whether the claim or action is plainly or obviously unsustainable (see <span class="font-italic">The “Bunga Melati” 5</span> [2012] 4 SLR 546 (“<span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati</span>”) at [32]). A plainly or obviously unsustainable claim or action is one which is either legally or factually unsustainable (see <span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati</span> at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In relation to the Title Claim, the plaintiff’s key contention as pleaded in the Statement of Claim is that two-thirds of the <span class="font-italic">wakaf</span> is invalid, such that Kassim and Ibrahim continued to hold a two-thirds interest in the Siglap Land as joint tenants (see [18] above). In the Application, particularly at the oral hearing, the plaintiff argued –  again, for the first time – that the <span class="font-italic">Hanafi </span>school of Islam is the relevant school of Muslim law under which the contention would have to be assessed in a substantive hearing, relying on (a) her own assertion that she belongs to the <span class="font-italic">Hanafi</span> school of Islam, (b) an Inheritance Certificate previously issued by the Syariah Court in respect of Zainal’s estate, and (c) extracts from Muslim law literature relating to doctrines of the <span class="font-italic">Hanafi </span>school (see [19] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The point of the plaintiff’s argument, it appears, is to distinguish <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>past local case authorities (involving Muslims of the <span class="font-italic">Shafi</span><span class="font-italic">’i</span> school of Islam) where the Court of Appeal and the High Court recognised that while a Muslim testator only has the power under Mohammedan Law to dispose of not more than one-third of his property at the time of death, he has complete freedom to dispose of all his property <span class="font-italic">inter vivos</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, during his lifetime) (see <span class="font-italic">Shafeeg bin Salim Talib and another v Fatimah bte Abud bin Talib and others </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1123 at [23]-[25]; <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ismail bin Ibrahim and another v Mohammad Taha bin Ibrahim </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 756 at [31]-[35] and [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, the plaintiff’s entire case in this regard is problematic for two crucial reasons. First, there is clear and compelling historical evidence that Kassim in fact belonged to the <span class="font-italic">Shafi’i </span>school of Islam. In the grant of letter of administration in Kassim’s estate (see [3] above), the petition seeking the grant stated in no uncertain terms that Kassim was himself “a Muslim of Shaffi Sect”. The petition was furthermore signed off by Zainal (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Kassim’s only child) stating that he “make oath and say that the contents of the foregoing petition are to the best of my knowledge, information and belief in all respect true”. Thus, as a matter of fact, court records indicate that Kassim belonged to the <span class="font-italic">Shafi’i </span>school of Islam, as endorsed by the High Court under Zainal’s oath. In this Court’s view, this constitutes far more concrete and preponderant proof of Kassim’s affiliation to the <span class="font-italic">Shafi’i </span>school of Islam than the plaintiff’s rather suppositive assertions would suggest otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Second, and in any case, it is common ground between the parties (and indeed, an integral part of the plaintiff’s pleaded case) that the <span class="font-italic">wakaf </span>was purportedly established by Kassim <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> his lifetime</span>, as opposed to by way of a testamentary disposition. Nothing in relation to the Application placed before this Court (including the Muslim law literature specifically referred to by the plaintiff’s counsel) actually suggests that a <span class="font-italic">Hanafi </span>Muslim’s freedom under Islamic law to make an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos</span> disposition of property is to any extent more limited than that enjoyed by a <span class="font-italic">Shafi’i </span>Muslim. Indeed, this became increasingly apparent at the hearing as it progressed, where the plaintiff’s counsel struggled, upon challenge by this Court, to draw the Court’s attention to any statement in the Muslim law literature adduced that supported the contention that the <span class="font-italic">Hanafi</span> school differed materially from the <span class="font-italic">Shafi’</span><span class="font-italic">i</span> school in this area of Islamic law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Seen in the light of these difficulties, the Title Claim unravels itself as a claim that could neither withstand evidential scrutiny, nor find any footing or basis in the relevant area of Islamic law. This renders it a plainly and obviously unsustainable claim. In other words, this is clearly not a claim in respect of which court time and the State’s litigation resources should be wasted on.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Time bar issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Given the findings in [36]-[38] above, it is unnecessary for this Court to address the issues concerning time bar <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Title Claim. The Court will accordingly pass no comment on these issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 This is similarly the case to the extent that any issues of time bar are otherwise relevant to the Land Acquisition Challenge Claim, given the plaintiff’s intention to withdraw the Land Acquisition Challenge Claim from the Action (see [8] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Action as a whole comprises two categories of claims, namely the Land Acquisition Challenge Claim and the Title Claim (see [7] above). The plaintiff has indicated that she wishes to withdraw the former on the basis that it should be pursued separately by way of a judicial review proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Title Claim, on the other hand, has for the reasons included in this judgment been found to be plainly and obviously unsustainable (see [36]-[38] above). This is even as the plaintiff seems to be moulding her case progressively with time (see [24]-[26] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As a result, it is appropriate for the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> Action to be struck out, and the Court so orders. Costs relating and incidental to the Application will be determined after the Court has heard the parties’ costs submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Colin Seow <br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Li Qun Kelvin, Niklas Wong See Keat and Thara Rubini Gopalan (TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>Khoo Boo Jin, Tang Shangjun, Szetoh Khai Hoe Terence and Jessie Lim (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
