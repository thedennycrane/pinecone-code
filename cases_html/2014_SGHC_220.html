<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
plaintiff, Triulzi Cesare SRL (“Triulzi”), a company incorporated in
Italy, is in the business of, <em>inter alia</em>,
manufacturing and producing horizontal and vertical washing machines
for glass sheets. The defendant, Xinyi Group (Glass) Company Limited
(“Xinyi”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong, is in the business
of manufacturing and selling, <em>inter alia</em>, float
glass products, solar glass products, automobile glass products
and other associated products in the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Triulzi
and Xinyi entered into three contracts on 17 November 2009 for Xinyi’s
purchase of Triulzi’s washing machines. The precise contractual arrangements
between the parties are not relevant to the present application.
Suffice to say for now, the three contracts provided for any disputes
between the parties to be resolved by arbitration in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Disputes
arose between the parties that led to Xinyi commencing an arbitration
in the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber
of Commerce (“ICC”) <em>vide</em> Case No.
18848/CYK) (“the Arbitration”). The sole arbitrator, Mr Woo Tchi
Chu (“the Tribunal”), was appointed by the end of September 2012.
The Arbitration was governed by the ICC Rules of Arbitration 2012
(“the ICC Rules 2012”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On
12 August 2013, the Tribunal issued a final award dated 12 August 2013
(“the Award”) which was forwarded to the parties by the ICC Secretariat
on 19 August 2013. The Tribunal allowed Xinyi’s claim and dismissed
Triulzi’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Triulzi
filed Originating Summons No 1114 of 2013 (“OS 1114/2013”) on 18
November 2013 to set aside the Award under Art 34(2) of the UNCITRAL
Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (“the Model
Law”), as set out in the First Schedule to the International Arbitration
Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”), and s 24(<em>b</em>)
of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr
Paul Tan (“Mr Tan”) represented Triulzi in OS 1114/2013 while Mr
Shum Wai Keong (“Mr Shum”) was Triulzi’s counsel in the Arbitration. Ms
Koh Swee Yen (“Ms Koh”) represented Xinyi in both OS 1114/2013 and the
Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Gist of the underlying dispute
in the Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Xinyi’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       By
cl 15 of each contract, upon the installation of each washing machine
at Xinyi’s premises, an acceptance test would be conducted by both
parties in accordance with the technical specifications. This involved an
8-hour uninterrupted test with different sizes of glass sheets.
If the installed machine failed the acceptance test, Xinyi could
then cancel the respective contract and Triulzi would have to refund
Xinyi the purchase price. Triulzi was allowed to make modifications
to the machine twice but the acceptance period must not extend beyond
70 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Xinyi’s
case, as stated in the Award, was that sometime during July 2010,
the first washing machine was delivered to and installed at Xinyi’s facility
by Triulzi pursuant to the first contract. The machine was found
to be faulty on several occasions and it underwent modifications.
Despite all that, the machine still failed to meet the technical
specifications stipulated in the first contract. Stains were found
on the glass sheets after being washed in the machine. An acceptance
test was carried out from 7 to 12 May 2011 and the machine failed
the acceptance test. In or around May 2011, Xinyi cancelled the
first contract by asking Triulzi to take back the machine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On
or around 15 February 2011, the second washing machine was delivered
to and installed at Xinyi’s facility by Triulzi pursuant to the second
contract. Xinyi informed Triulzi that the machine also failed to
meet the technical specifications stipulated in the second contract.
Xinyi cancelled the second contract on 8 June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
or around 5 March 2011, Xinyi paid 10% of the purchase price of the
third washing machine pursuant to the third contract. In view of
the defects found in the second machine, Triulzi was requested,
on or around 25 April 2011, to conduct a detailed factory inspection
of the third machine before delivering it to Xinyi’s facility. Triulzi
did not respond to this request and did not deliver the third machine
to Xinyi. Thereafter, Xinyi cancelled the third contract on or around
8 June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In
the Arbitration, Xinyi claimed for a refund of the purchase price paid
under all three contracts as well as damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Triulzi’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Triulzi’s
Answer and Counterclaim in the Arbitration was that the first washing
machine was fully operational by late December 2010 or early January
2011. Triulzi alleged that the first machine’s faulty performance was
due to the dirty and dusty environment of Xinyi’s premises where
it was installed and the lack of proper maintenance of the machine
by Xinyi. Furthermore, the stains on the glass sheets were not caused
by the first machine but from another machine which processed the
glass sheets in the manufacturing process. According to Triulzi,
all issues with the first machine were resolved by March 2011. Xinyi
did not reject the first machine and did not ask Triulzi to take
the machine back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As
regards the second washing machine, Triulzi’s position was that
its technician could not properly install and test the second machine
as Xinyi failed to provide the necessary facilities for proper testing.
However, the second machine was thereafter found to be operational
during the technician’s second visit. Despite the fact that the
first and second washing machines were properly installed and functional,
Xinyi failed to make full payment of the purchase price for both
machines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Triulzi
also claimed that the third machine was never delivered because
of Xinyi’s stated intention to reject the delivery of the machine
in a letter dated 8 June 2011 to Triulzi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Triulzi
therefore counterclaimed for the balance of the purchase price owing
under the first two contracts and specific performance of the third contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
evidential hearing was held from 22 to 25 April 2013. The events, prior
to 22 April 2013 and at the evidential hearing itself, are at the
heart of OS 1114/2013. A chronology of the relevant events is set
out below (at [25]– [43]). Paragraphs of the Award that are relevant
to OS 1114/2013 are set out in the course of this Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Outline of the issues in OS
1114/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Triulzi
alleges a number of serious breaches in the Tribunal’s conduct of
the arbitral proceedings which had caused it prejudice. According
to Mr Tan, the Tribunal’s conduct violated a number of obligations
under the IAA and the Model Law. Triulzi submits that the Award
should be set aside on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     on
the basis of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of
the Model Law in that the Tribunal’s decision to admit Xinyi’s expert
witness statement was in breach of the parties’ agreed arbitral
procedure (“Issue 1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     on
the basis of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of
the Model Law and s 24(<em>b</em>) of the
IAA in that Triulzi was, <em>inter alia</em>,
not afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard in respect of
expert evidence (“Issue 2”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     on
the basis of Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of
the Model Law in that the decision of the Tribunal not to apply
the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods
(“the CISG”) as the applicable law of the three contracts does not
accord with the public policy of Singapore (“Issue 3”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr
Tan’s fall-back argument, which is an alternative to Issue 1, arises in
the absence of a procedural agreement to exclude expert evidence.
His fall-back argument is that the Award may be set aside under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) if it was not in accordance with
Art 18 of Model Law (“Issue 1A”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
outline of Issues 1 and 2 above is set out in board terms based
on the challenges advanced in court. As I see it, the nub of the
complaints for Issues 1 and 2 are the same in that they are challenges
to the procedural orders or directions made in the course of the
arbitral proceedings rather than a challenge to the making of the
Award. This distinction is important. As stated below (at [52]–[53]),
complaints against procedural orders or directions cannot give rise
to the setting aside of an award unless the procedural orders or
directions in question resulted in a breach of an agreed arbitral
procedure or a breach of natural justice (<em>ie</em>,
the procedural nature of the right to be heard), as a result of
which a party’s rights have been prejudiced (see s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA). This is the first legal
obstacle that Triulzi has to overcome. I will elaborate on the case
management powers of the arbitral tribunal later in this decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Significantly,
a singular query that foreshadows the outcome of OS1114/2013 is
whether Triulzi’s complaints are due to either circumstances attributable
to the Tribunal <em>or</em> circumstances
that resulted from Triulzi’s own failures or choices (tactical or
otherwise). The features in the present case that fashioned the
circumstances that gave rise to Triulzi’s complaints described below
(at [25] to [43]) will be scrutinised in due course. For now, it
is appropriate to state that there can be no basis whatsoever to
set aside the Award under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)
of the Model Law and s 24(<em>b</em>) of
the IAA if Triulzi’s complaints are <em>not</em> premised
upon circumstances attributable to the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Finally,
Triulzi’s application cited Art 31(2) of the Model Law as a ground
for setting aside the Award. However, this ground was not developed
in Triulzi’s submissions, and I need say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Outline of Triulzi’s criticisms
of the Tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I
now outline the specific criticisms of the Tribunal said to give
rise to the present application to set aside the Award. The specific
complaints or criticisms alleged against the Tribunal are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Conduct
prior to 22 April 2013:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       The Tribunal admitted Xinyi’s expert witness statement in breach
of the parties’ purported agreed arbitral procedure to file only
factual witness statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Alternatively, the Tribunal failed to afford Triulzi a reasonable
opportunity to file a meaningful expert witness statement in response
to Xinyi’s expert witness, thereby resulting in a denial of a fair
hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Conduct
at the evidential hearing on 25 April 2013:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The Tribunal’s refusal to admit Triulzi’s expert witness statement
on 25 April 2013 was tantamount to a failure to afford Triulzi a
reasonable opportunity to respond to Xinyi’s expert witness, thereby
resulting in a denial of a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
failures described are said to be cumulative in effect with the result
that Triulzi suffered prejudice from the fact that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Triulzi
was prevented from advancing arguments to the Tribunal that the
machines in dispute had complied with the contractual technical
specifications, and that any non-performance was due to Xinyi’s
lack of maintenance and the very dirty environment of Xinyi’s facility;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Triulzi
was prevented from refuting the Tribunal’s reliance on Xinyi’s expert
evidence concerning the contractual requirement to run the subject
machines for 8 hours in the conduct of the acceptance test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Chronology of events relevant
to Issues 1 and 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On
25 September 2012, the Tribunal was formally constituted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conduct prior to 22 April 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">10 to 13 December 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
Tribunal circulated a draft procedural timetable to both parties on
10 December 2012 (“the Draft Procedural Timetable”). According to
the Draft Procedural Timetable, “Witness Statements” were to be
filed by 28 January 2013 and the evidentiary hearing was to take
place from 18 to 21 February 2013. The parties then attended a Case
Management Conference before the Tribunal held on 11 December 2012
(“the CMC”). The timelines in the Draft Procedural Timetable were
then adjusted to accommodate the various commitments of each counsel
before a revised procedural timetable was adopted by the Tribunal
(“the Procedural Timetable”). The revised timelines that were formalised
provided, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     “Filing
of Witness Statements” by 25 March 2013; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     Hearing
dates fixed for 22 to 25 April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the CMC, a preliminary issue relating to the governing
law of the three contracts was heard. The Tribunal determined the
governing law of the contracts to be Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Before
the close of the CMC, Mr Shum proposed adopting the International
Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Arbitration (“the IBA Rules”) for the purposes of the Arbitration.
Ms Koh did not object and the Tribunal duly directed that the IBA
Rules be adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The
Tribunal forwarded to the parties the Procedural Timetable and the
minutes of the CMC in its e-mail dated 13 December 2012. In the
same e-mail, the Tribunal emphasised the need to strictly adhere
to the timelines in the Procedural Timetable:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The Arbitration should be completed and
Award issued by 27 May 2013. <em>The Tribunal intends
to follow the agreed timelines strictly</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Subsequently, at the parties’ request on 22 March 2013, the
Tribunal allowed witness statements to be filed and exchanged by
1 April 2013. No changes were made to the hearing dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">1 to 5 April 2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On
1 April 2013, Xinyi filed the expert witness statement of Dr Bao Yiwang
(“Dr Bao”) along with other factual witness statements. Dr Bao’s statement
contained a 22-paragraph report pertaining to the design and specifications
of the first and second washing machines as well as the operating
environment of Xinyi’s facility (“Dr Bao’s Report”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On
2 April 2013, Triulzi wrote asking the Tribunal to exclude Dr Bao’s
Report from the arbitral proceedings. Triulzi alleged that it was indicated
to the Tribunal at the CMC that the parties would not be filing any
expert witness statements and that, consequently, the Procedural Timetable
did not provide a timeline for expert witness statements to be filed.
Triulzi’s letter dated 2 April 2013 made clear that Triulzi’s position was
that the parties’ “agreement” to dispense with expert evidence was reached
at the CMC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Triulzi further complained
that no notice of Xinyi’s intention to file Dr Bao’s Report was
given to Triulzi before 1 April 2013. In the circumstances, admitting
Dr Bao’s Report would thus be contrary to the alleged procedural
agreement reached during the CMC. Triulzi also argued in its lawyer’s
letter that the admission of Dr Bao’s Report would be prejudicial
as Triulzi would not have an opportunity to verify the contents of
Dr Bao’s Report. Besides, Dr Bao’s Report had no probative value
as the inspection by Dr Bao took place 21 months after the disputes
over the washing machines arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As
an alternative to its application to exclude Dr Bao’s Report, Triulzi sought
an order from the Tribunal to allow it to engage an expert to inspect the
two washing machines at Xinyi’s facility and to file an expert witness statement
thereafter. Triulzi further applied for the evidentiary hearing dates
in April to be vacated. Triulzi requested a total period of eight
weeks: (a) four weeks from the date of the Tribunal’s order for
inspection of the first and second washing machines at Xinyi’s facility;
and (b) an additional four weeks for the expert’s report to be filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On
4 April 2013, the Tribunal replied that the minutes of the CMC contained
no record of any agreement that the parties would not be filing expert
evidence. The Tribunal’s e-mail of 4 April 2013 reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3)    [Triulzi]
requests that [Xinyi’s] expert witness report be excluded on the
ground that during the case management conference, the parties had indicated
to the Tribunal that the parties will not be filing any expert witness statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would like to have [Xinyi’s] comments
on this by <u>noon tomorrow</u>. I have looked
at the brief minutes of the CMC, copies of which were forwarded
to the parties on 13 December 2012. The minutes, short though they
are, made no mention of any indication or understanding on the part
of the parties not to include expect witness statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On
5 April 2013, Xinyi replied stating that it had never indicated
at the CMC that it would <em>not</em> file
any expert witness statements. There was no agreement between the
parties to dispense with expert evidence. Besides, the Tribunal’s
minutes did not record any agreement between the parties. Ms Koh’s
position was that the Tribunal’s reference to the “Filing of Witness
Statements” in the Procedural Timetable meant that there was “no limit
placed on the type or number of witness statements to be filed”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> She pointed
out that, having elected not to call an expert, Triulzi had waived
its right to do so and should not be permitted to file an expert
witness statement at that late a stage. Filing an expert witness
statement at that time would prejudice Xinyi as Triulzi would have
had the benefit of Dr Bao’s Report. However, if the Tribunal was
minded to grant Triulzi an opportunity to file an expert witness
statement, then it should be filed within seven days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Triulzi
replied on 5 April 2013. It maintained that there was an agreement
between parties to dispense with expert evidence and that the agreement
was indicated to the Tribunal at the CMC. Triulzi repeated its request
that it be given time to inspect the washing machines and to thereafter
file an expert witness statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">12 to 16 April 2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On
12 April 2013, Triulzi wrote to the Tribunal complaining that the time
given by the Tribunal for it to find an expert was “just too short”,
and again raised the matter of vacating the hearing dates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On
16 April 2013, a hearing was convened for the Tribunal to give parties
further directions. At that hearing, Triulzi disclosed an e-mail
from one Jonathan Peter Wigg (“Mr Wigg”) whom it had intended to
call as an expert witness. In that e-mail, Mr Wigg stated that he
would only have been available from early June 2013 onwards. Triulzi
also disclosed an e-mail which advised that an application made
in Italy for a visa to China should be submitted one month before
the date of travel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Triulzi’s
second attempt to vacate the evidential hearing in April was rejected
by the Tribunal. In its e-mail dated 16 April 2013, the Tribunal directed, <em>inter alia</em>, that the hearing from 22 to
25 April 2013 would proceed as stated in the Procedural Timetable.
The Tribunal also noted:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for [Triulzi] has asked the Tribunal
to record his dissatisfaction at the Tribunal’s unwillingness to
vacate the dates for the hearing. His main grounds are that … there
was an agreement between the parties at the CMC that no expert witness
would be called and in any event [Triulzi] was not given enough
time now by the Tribunal to engage its own expert, send him to China
for the inspection and come up with a report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Tribunal overruled [Triulzi’s] submissions
and if necessary will refer to them in more detail at a more appropriate
stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On
the same day, Xinyi wrote to the Tribunal expressing its disapproval
of Triulzi’s conduct in relation to calling an expert witness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It said
that after the Tribunal’s decision on 5 April 2013, Triulzi did
not raise any issue with the Tribunal’s directions until 12 April
2013 when Mr Shum wrote to the Tribunal stating that Triulzi did
not have enough time. Triulzi also did not contact Xinyi at all
to arrange for an inspection at Xinyi’s factory premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conduct at the evidential hearing
on 25 April 2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     At
the evidentiary hearing which began on 22 April 2013, Xinyi called two
witnesses of fact and Dr Bao. On the last day of hearing, 25 April
2013, and before Triulzi’s last factual witness took the stand,
Mr Shum applied to the Tribunal to adduce the expert witness statement
of one Dr Alberto Piombo (“Dr Piombo”). Dr Piombo’s expert evidence
pertained to the operation of the first and second washing machines
(“Dr Piombo’s Report”). The date of the report was 22 April 2013
and it coincided with the first day of the hearing. Mr Shum explained
that he only received Dr Piombo’s Report on the morning of 25 April
2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Ms
Koh objected to Mr Shum’s very late application to admit Dr Piombo
Report after two undeniable events: (a) Triulzi had, by its own conduct,
elected not to file an expert witness statement having missed the original
and extended deadlines for doing so; and (b) Dr Bao had already testified.
She surmised that Dr Piombo’s Report would have been prepared with
the benefit of Dr Bao’s Report, including evidence given under cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In
response, Mr Shum explained that Triulzi had difficulties with the time
frame of 10 days set by the Tribunal previously on 5 April 2013
and wanted the Tribunal to hear further submissions on the admissibility
of Dr Piombo’s Report now that it was in hand. He stated that if
the Tribunal were to admit Dr Piombo’s Report, then a further hearing
could be fixed for the cross-examination of Dr Piombo. As Dr Piombo
was not in attendance at the hearing on 25 April 2013, Mr Shum explained
that he would not be using Dr Piombo’s Report at the hearing on
25 April 2013. Rather, he was bringing it up in order to have it
placed before the Tribunal in light of the fact that Xinyi had adduced
expert evidence at the hearing. He disagreed with Ms Koh’s contention
that Triulzi had elected not to call an expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     After
Mr Shum’s confirmation that Dr Piombo was not present at the hearing,
the Tribunal remarked:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Critically,
the Tribunal’s view was that Mr Shum had not raised any compelling
arguments to persuade it to admit Dr Piombo’s Report. The evidentiary
hearing hence continued without Dr Piombo’s Report being admitted.
The Tribunal subsequently rendered the Award in favour of Xinyi,
and Triulzi now seeks to set it aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Breach of an agreed
arbitral procedure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Issue
1 focuses on the Tribunal’s decision to admit Dr Bao’s Report (see
[34] above). The contention here is that the Tribunal’s decision
to admit Dr Bao’s Report was in breach of a procedural agreement
to dispense with expert evidence and that the Award should therefore
be set aside pursuant to Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)
of the Model Law. In response, Xinyi maintains that there was no
agreement to dispense with expert evidence. Thus, Triulzi’s criticisms
of the Tribunal’s conduct of the arbitral proceedings, including
the Tribunal’s procedural orders and directions prior to 22 April
20l3 (see [25]–[38] above) that related to the admission of Dr Bao’s
Report, are unfounded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevant legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Before
turning to the question whether there was, in existence, a procedural
agreement between the parties, it is useful, at this juncture, to outline
some of the relevant general principles underlying the application
of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model
Law with regard to a breach of an agreed arbitral procedure. Art
34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Article
34. Application for setting aside as exclusive recourse against arbitral
award</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    An
arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in Article
6 only if:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the
party making the application furnishes proof that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iv)   the
composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was
not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such
agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Law from which
the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not
in accordance with this Law; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I
start with the important features of party autonomy in international arbitration.
There are two aspects to this concept of party autonomy – the restricted
role of the courts in the arbitral process and the procedural freedom
and flexibility enjoyed by the parties. Section 15A(1) of the IAA provides
that “a provision of rules of arbitration agreed to or adopted by
the parties … shall apply and be given effect, except to the extent
that such provision is inconsistent with a provision of the Model
Law or [Part II of the IAA] from which the parties cannot derogate.”
Article 19 of the Model Law reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Article 19.
Determination of rules of procedure</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Subject to the provisions of this
Law, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed
by the arbitral tribunal in conducting the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Failing such agreement, the arbitral
tribunal may, subject to the provisions of this Law, conduct the
arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate. The power
conferred upon the arbitral tribunal includes the power to determine
the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This article undoubtedly
reflects the principle of party autonomy in fixing the procedure
to be adopted and followed by the arbitral tribunal. The parties
have the freedom and flexibility to determine the rules of procedure that
governs the arbitration, and failing an agreement by the parties,
the arbitral tribunal is permitted to conduct the arbitration in
such a manner as it considers appropriate. Notably, the parties’
freedom under Art 19(1) is subject to the mandatory, <em>ie</em> non-derogable, provisions in the Model
Law. One example of a mandatory provision is Art 18 of the Model
Law which prescribes the minimum procedural requirements of equality
of treatment and natural justice (<em>ie</em>,
reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present one’s own case).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In
the absence of any procedural agreement, Art 19(2) of the Model Law
gives the arbitral tribunal wide procedural powers to determine
the applicable rules of evidence on admissibility, relevance, materiality
and weight of any evidence. To this end, the power of the arbitral
tribunal under Art 19(2) is discretionary and the arbitral tribunal
is required to exercise its discretion within the confines of the
mandatory provisions of Model Law and Part II of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It
follows that within the boundaries of the minimum procedural requirements
noted in Art 18, parties are free to agree on the institutional rules
that govern the arbitration. This can happen prior to or subsequent
to the commencement of the arbitration. The Arbitration was an ICC
case and it was governed by the ICC Rules 2012. Besides the freedom
to choose the procedural rules for the conduct of the arbitration,
other matters that parties are free to agree to may include the
matters mentioned in <em>PT Perusahaan Gas Negara
(Persero) TBK v + Joint Operation</em> [2010] 4 SLR 672. In
that case, it was stated at [39] that the parties’ agreed procedure,
in the context of arbitration, may relate to “timelines for submission
of answers in response to the request for arbitration, the information
required to be provided in the submissions, notification to the
parties of the names of the members of the arbitral tribunal, <em>etc</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Arguably,
an agreement to dispense with expert evidence may be regarded as
a procedural agreement. Once the parties have agreed upon the procedure
to be adopted for the arbitration, the arbitral tribunal will be obliged
to conduct the arbitration in accordance with the procedure agreed by
the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     An
award may be set aside under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)
of the Model Law if: (a) the award is not in accordance with the
parties’ agreed procedure, unless the agreed procedure is in conflict
with a mandatory provision of the Model Law; or (b) the award is
“not in accordance with this Law” (see [45] above). As stated, equality
of treatment and natural justice prescribed in Art 18 are two of
the non-derogable minimum procedural requirements under the Model
Law as regards the procedural conduct of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On
the other hand, Article 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)
of the Model Law is <em>not</em> engaged
if the non-observance of either an agreed procedure (Art 19(1))
or the minimum procedural requirements of Art 18 is <em>not</em> due
to circumstances attributable to the arbitral tribunal but is derived
from the applicant’s own doing. A helpful commentary that stresses
the same point is made in respect of the purpose of Art 18 in the <em>UNCITRAL 2012 Digest of Case Law on the Model Law
on International Commercial Arbitration</em> (United Nations,
2012) (“the 2012 Digest”) at p 98, para 7:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The purpose of article 18 is to protect
a party from egregious and injudicious conduct by an arbitral tribunal,
and it is not intended to protect a party from its own failures
or strategic choices. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Separately,
Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) is again <em>not</em> engaged if the challenge to the award
is against the arbitral tribunal’s procedural orders or directions which
fall within the exclusive domain of the arbitral tribunal. As stated
in <em>Singapore International Arbitration: Law
&amp; Practice</em> (David Joseph and David Foxton gen eds)
(LexisNexis, 2014) (“<em>SIA: Law &amp; Practice</em>”)
at ch 6, para 4.1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once the parties have agreed upon the procedure
to be adopted for the arbitration and a tribunal has been appointed,
the way in which the matter will go forward including the decisions
that must be made over time as to the progress of the reference,
are matters falling within the exclusive province of the arbitral
tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     
          <em>SIA: Law &amp; Practice</em> continues in the
same chapter at para 5.3 that if a party is dissatisfied with procedural
orders or directions, there is no right of recourse to set aside
the order or direction by the Singapore courts. There are two reasons
for this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… First, Article 5 of the Model Law provides
that “<em>in matters governed by this Law, no court
shall intervene except where so provided in this Law</em>”,
and as was noted in para 3, Article 19(2) provides that the tribunal
may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate
(subject to contrary agreement of the parties, and the to the terms
of Model Law). Secondly, procedural orders are not an “award” within
the meaning of Article 34 of the Model Law or s 24 of the IAA, and
therefore cannot be set aside under those provisions. [emphasis
in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I
now come to technical and minor breaches committed by an arbitral tribunal.
It cannot be the case that any breach of an agreed arbitral procedure,
even that of a technical provision or minor formality, will invariably
result in an award being set aside. Most supervising courts inquire
into the <em>materiality</em> of the procedural
requirements that was not complied with and the nature of the departures
from the parties’ agreed arbitral procedures. The cases below (see
[55]–[58]) illustrate the element of prejudice (whether procedural
or substantive) that eventuates as a result of a violation of an
agreed procedure to support the materiality of the breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee v Hammermills, Inc</em> 1992
WL 122712 (DDC, 1992) (“<em>Hammermills</em>”),
an application was brought under the Convention on the Recognition
and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (“the New York Convention”)
as a defence to the confirmation of an award on, <em>inter
alia</em>, the ground that the arbitral tribunal had breached
the agreed ICC procedure when rendering its award. The complaint
was that the arbitral tribunal had inserted into the award the amount
of the legal costs to be assessed against a party after the draft
award had been approved by the ICC Court. Although the United States
District Court held that this did not amount to a breach of the
ICC procedure, it also observed at [5] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court does not believe that section
1(d) of Article V [of the New York Convention] was intended, as
CBG argues, to permit reviewing courts to police every procedural
ruling made by the Arbitrator and to set aside the award if <em>any</em> violation of ICC procedures is found.
Such an interpretation would directly conflict with the “pro-enforcement”
bias of the [New York] Convention and its intention to remove obstacles
to confirmation of arbitral awards. … Rather, the Court believes
that a more appropriate standard of review would be to set aside
an award based on a procedural violation only if such violation
worked substantial prejudice to the complaining party. … [emphasis
in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This
passage quoted above was approved in another US District Court decision
of <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas
Company, LLC v Perusahaan Pertambangan </em><em>Minyak
Dan Gas Bumi Negara</em> 190 F Supp 2d 936 (SD Tex, 2001).
It was held at 945 that for a complaining party to succeed in an
application under Art V(1)(<em>d</em>) of
the New York Convention on the ground that the arbitral tribunal
departed from the agreed arbitral procedure, it “must show that there
is a violation of an arbitration agreement between the parties and
that the violation actually caused [that party] substantial prejudice
in the arbitration.” In applying this principle, the United States
District Court in <em>Williams v National Football
League</em> 2012 WL 2366636 (D Colo, 2012) confirmed an award
even though it was rendered after a specified time limit agreed
upon by the parties as the complaining party was not substantially prejudiced
by the delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Although
the US decisions dealt with Art V(1)(<em>d</em>)
of the New York Convention, the observations are relevant to an
application of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)
of the Model Law since Art 34 of the Model Law was drafted to “align
the grounds for setting aside with the grounds for recognition and enforcement
that were listed in Article V of the New York Convention” (see Howard
M Holtzmann and Joseph E Neuhaus, <em>A Guide to
the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration:
Legislative History and Commentary</em> (Kluwer Law and Taxation
Publishers, 1989) (“<em>Holtzmann and Neuhaus</em>”)
at p 912). It must be noted that the UNCITRAL Working Group on International
Contract Practices (“the Working Group”) had also discussed and
rejected the suggestion to include additional grounds for setting
aside under Art 34 in favour of keeping to the scope delineated
by Art V of the New York Convention. As stated by the Working Group
in the <em>Report of the Working Group on International Contract
Practices on the Work of its Fifth Session</em> (A/CN.9/233,
28 March 1983) at para 187:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That solution [to align Art 34(2)(a)(iv)
of the Model Law with Art V of the New York Convention] would facilitate
international commercial arbitration by enhancing predictability
and expeditiousness and would go a long way towards establishing
a harmonized system of limited recourse against awards and their
enforcement. It was [further] stated in support that the reasons
set forth in article V of the New York Convention provided sufficient
safeguards, and that some of the grounds suggested as additions
to the list were likely to fall under the public policy reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The
Québec Supreme Court has also adopted an approach similar to that
of the US Courts in the context of a setting-aside application on
the ground that there was a violation of the agreed arbitral procedure.
In <em>Holding Tusculum BV v Louis Dreyfus Holding
SAS</em> [2008] QCCS 5904, it was argued that an award should
be set aside as the tribunal had revisited issues that have already
been decided in breach of an implied term of the applicable arbitration
procedure. Articles 940.6 and 948 of the Code of Civil Procedure
(chapter C-25) (Québec) required the Québec Supreme Court to take
into consideration the Model Law and New York Convention respectively
when dealing with international arbitral awards. In this regard, the
Québec Supreme Court agreed with and cited at [129] the opinion
of one, Fabien Gélinas, who was called by the applicant to provide
expert evidence as to matters of international commercial arbitration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The standard of a “material breach of procedure”
or a breach that “presumably affected the award” and the requirement
of prejudice, <em>simpliciter</em>, sufficient
or substantial, have one thing in common: they all operate to <b>avoid the trivialization of judicial review in cases
of minor violation of the procedure</b> … [emphasis in italics
in original, emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I
now come to the supervising court’s discretionary powers under Art 34(2)
of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Even
though the decisions above (at [55]–[58]) address the issue of prejudice
when deciding whether to set aside an award, it is also clear that prejudice
is not expressly stipulated to be a requirement for setting aside
an award under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)
of the Model Law. The issue of prejudice should instead be understood
in the context of the <em>discretionary</em> nature
of the court’s power to set aside awards under Art 34(2). As stated
in Gary B Born, <em>International Commercial Arbitration</em> vol
3 (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) at p 3177:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is equally clear that the grounds specified
in Article 34(2) of the Model Law are permissive and discretionary,
not mandatory. That is, a court <em>may</em> annul an
award if one or more of the Article 34(2) grounds are satisfied,
but the court is not <em>mandatorily required</em> to
annul the award, even where one of these grounds applies. This is
made express by Article 34(2), which provides that an “award <em>may</em> be set aside by the court … only if”
specified grounds are present. … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, the operative word which is found in the opening
sentence of Art 34(2) of the Model Law is “may”, and this word underscores
the discretionary powers of the supervising court to refuse to set
aside an award even if there was a breach of the agreed procedure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In <em>Grand Pacific Holdings Ltd v Pacific China Holdings
Ltd (in liq) (No </em><em>1)</em> [2012]
4 HKLRD 1 (“<em>Grand Pacific</em>”), the
Hong Kong Court of Appeal opined (<em>obiter</em>)
that the Hong Kong courts have a discretion to refuse to set aside
an award even where a violation of Article 34(2)(<em>a</em>)
is established. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal opined at [105] that
even if the circumstances described in Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)
are established, “the Court may refuse to set aside the award if
the Court is satisfied that the arbitral tribunal could not have reached
a different conclusion.” Emphasis was once again placed on the word
“may”. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, in upholding the decision
of the Court of Appeal, did not disturb the latter’s <em>obiter dictum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Other
Model Law jurisdictions like New Zealand and Australia have similarly
recognised the existence of the court’s discretion in a setting-aside application
(see, for example, <em>Downer-Hill Joint Venture
v Government of Fiji</em> [2005] 1 NZLR 554 at [103]; <em>Cargill International SA v Peabody Australia Mining
Ltd</em> [2010] NSWSC 887 at [242]). Some national versions of
the Model Law go even further than the Model Law in providing specifically
that the power to annul an award is discretionary. For example, s 30
of the Arbitration Act (c 55) (British Columbia) provides that where the
court finds that the arbitrator has “committed an arbitral error”,
but that “the error consists of a defect in form or a technical
irregularity,” the court may refuse to set aside the award where
“refusal would not constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Most
notably, in the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <em>CRW Joint Operation v PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero)
TBK</em> [2011] 4 SLR 305 (“<em>CRW Joint
Operation (CA)</em>”), V K Rajah JA also observed in general terms
at [100] that “the court may, in its discretion, decline to set
aside an arbitral award even though one of the prescribed grounds
for setting aside has been made out”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Understood
in the context of a general discretion, my view is that prejudice
is a factor or element relevant to, <em>rather
than</em> a legal requirement for the application of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model Law. In other words, prejudice
is merely a relevant factor that the supervising court considers
in deciding whether the breach in question is serious and, thus,
whether or not to exercise its discretionary power to set aside
the award for the breach. As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal observed
in <em>Grand Pacific</em> at [105]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… How a court may exercise its discretion
in any particular case will depend on the view it takes of <em>the seriousness of the breach</em>. Some breaches
may be so egregious that an award would be set aside <em>although the result could not be different</em>.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It can be gleaned from this passage that the Hong Kong Court
of Appeal recognises that there may be certain instances where the
court will nonetheless set aside an award despite the absence of
prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Rajah
JA in <em>CRW Joint Operation (CA)</em> at
[100] observed that where prejudice was shown, the court ought not
to exercise its discretion to refuse to set aside an award. As to
whether Rajah JA’s observation is ostensibly inconsistent with the
Hong Kong position just stated above, I do not think so. Depending
on the facts of the particular case at hand, it may be possible to
present the breach in question either in terms of prejudice or in
terms of the seriousness of the breach. In my view, the singular
point to be derived from both <em>Grand Pacific</em> and <em>CRW Joint Operation (CA)</em> is that every
case is fact-sensitive and much depends on the circumstances of
each case. I should also point out that <em>Grand
Pacific</em> was a decision on the case management powers
of the arbitral tribunal, whereas <em>CRW Joint
Operation (CA)</em> was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As
seen from the discussion above, the inquiry in a setting-aside application
in respect of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) should
focus on the materiality, or seriousness, of the procedural breach.
From this perspective, an applicant wishing to set aside an award
would endeavour to show the materiality of the procedural requirements
that were not complied with. An applicant may do so by establishing
the fact that the applicant had been prejudiced, or was reasonably
likely to have been prejudiced, by the arbitrator’s conduct of the
arbitral proceedings, including his procedural directions and orders. However,
this does not mean that the setting-aside application would necessarily
be rebuffed in the event that he fails to establish prejudice although
he would have to advance alternative submissions to evince the materiality
or seriousness of the breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Finally,
I come to a separate principle that has general application to Triulzi’s
challenges brought under Art 34(2) in respect of all four issues identified
in [17] above. This is the “second bite at the cherry argument” that
was frowned upon by the Court of Appeal in <em>BLC
and others v BLB and another</em> [2014] 4 SLR 79 (“<em>BLC v BLB</em>”). In that case, the Court of
Appeal cautioned in general terms against the use of the setting-aside
procedure to raise new arguments that were not previously before
the tribunal. The supervising court would also be wary of any attempts
by a party to re-package or re-characterise its original case and
arguments that were previously advanced in the arbitration for the
purpose of challenging the award. As the Court of Appeal observed
at [53]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In considering whether an arbitrator has
addressed his mind to an issue, however, the court must be wary
of its natural inclination to be drawn to the various arguments
in relation to the substantive merits of the underlying dispute
between the parties. In the context of a setting aside application,
it is crucial for the courts to recognise that these substantive
merits are <em>beyond</em> its remit notwithstanding
its natural inclinations. Put simply, there is no right of recourse
to the courts where an arbitrator has simply made an error of law and/or
fact. <em>A fortiori</em>, the courts should
guard against attempts by a disgruntled party to fault an arbitrator
for failing to consider arguments or points which were never before
him. <em>The setting aside application is not to
be abused by a party who, with the benefit of hindsight, wished
he had pleaded or presented his case in a different way before the
arbitrator</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, a supervising court would not hesitate to scrutinise
how the parties had approached their case in the arbitration and,
in particular, to review the respective issues and arguments that
had been put before the tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discussion and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     With
the principles set out above in mind, I now turn to consider Issue
1 in the context of the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
existence of a procedural agreement to dispense with expert evidence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
(a) is established, whether there was a breach of the procedural
agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_c"></a>(c)     If
(a) and (b) are established, whether the breach was so material that
the court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the
Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Specifically,
any inquiry into the materiality of the procedural requirements
that was not complied with and the nature of the departures from
the parties’ agreed arbitral procedures will be examined and tested
in light of Triulzi’s allegation of prejudice eventuated by the
Tribunal’s conduct in the course of the arbitral proceedings including
the latter’s procedural orders and directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The existence of a procedural
agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Alleged agreement
reached at CMC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I
now turn to the alleged agreement to dispense with expert evidence. As
I alluded to above (at [49]), an agreement to dispense with expert evidence
may be regarded as a procedural agreement. Triulzi maintains that there
was such an agreement and that the admission of Dr Bao’s Report amounted
to a violation of this agreement. Conversely, Xinyi argues that there
was no such agreement to dispense with expert evidence . A resolution
of this point in favour of Xinyi is enough on its own to defeat Triulzi’s
application to set aside the Award under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)
of the Model Law on the ground that the “arbitral procedure was
not in accordance with the agreement of the parties”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Mr
Shum’s letter dated 2 April 2013, which was addressed to the Tribunal,
specifically referred to an alleged agreement to exclude expert evidence
that was reached at the CMC. It alleged that Xingyi had, by its conduct,
reneged on it. Mr Shum further wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, [Xinyi] filed [its] Expert Report
yesterday, taking [Triulzi] by surprise. [Xinyi] had apparently
sent its expert to inspect the 1<sup>st</sup> and
2<sup>nd</sup> Unit on 16 March 2013 in secret contrary
to <em>the agreement reached at the case management
conference</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mr
Shum’s subsequent letter addressed to the Tribunal dated 5 April 2013
reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We highlight that [Xinyi’s] disagreement
that the parties had indicated to the Tribunal that the parties
will not be filing any witness statements focused solely on the
Tribunal’s minutes of the case management conference on 11 December
2012. [Xinyi] did not categorically deny that there was such agreement
between the parties. We express shock at [Xinyi’s] conduct as we had
definitely agreed with Wong Partnership that no expert witness would
be called (to minimize costs due to the amount in dispute then).
We maintain that the parties had indicated this to the Tribunal
during the conference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Finally,
at Mr Shum’s request, the Tribunal recorded in its e-mail dated
16 April 2013 the following matters:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr
Shum’s dissatisfaction with the Tribunal’s unwillingness to vacate
the dates fixed for the hearing; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr
Shum’s allegation that “there was an agreement between the parties
at the CMC that no expert witnesses would be called”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In
this present challenge, Ms Mariella Triulzi (“MT”), a director of Triulzi,
in her Reply Affidavit at para 9, deposed to Mr Shum’s telephone conversation
with Ms Koh prior to the CMC held on 11 December 2012. According
to MT, during that telephone conversation, Mr Shum had proposed
that both sides should dispense with expert evidence in order to minimise
costs. This agreement, according to MT, was then communicated to
the Tribunal at the CMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The
existence of an agreement to dispense with expert evidence was categorically
rejected by Mr Zhao Jinhui (“ZJ”), the in-house counsel of Xinyi.
ZJ maintained that no agreement to only file factual witness statements
was ever reached by the parties through their respective counsel either
at the CMC held on 11 December 2012 or prior to that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I
make two points in relation to the alleged telephone conversation mentioned
above (at [74]). First, I note that no contemporaneous telephone attendance
note was produced to prove the alleged telephone conversation between
counsel. Secondly, there was no mention of a telephone conversation
in any of the contemporaneous written communications to the Tribunal.
As ZJ pointed out in his affidavit, the alleged telephone conversation
surfaced for the first time in MT’s Reply Affidavit. Triulzi’s contention
all the while during the Arbitration was that the alleged agreement
was reached at the CMC and it cannot be afforded a “second bite at
the cherry” now by raising a fresh allegation that the Tribunal
was not informed of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The
Tribunal confirmed that there was no record of the alleged agreement
in the Tribunal’s minutes of the CMC (see [31] above). Notably, the
same minutes had been sent to the parties on 13 December 2012 and
the accuracy of the contents was never queried by Triulzi prior
to 1 April 2013. This was neither raised to the Tribunal on 22 March
2013 when parties sought an extension for the filing of witness
statements to 1 April 2013 (see above at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The
evidence adduced by Triulzi therefore does not stand up to scrutiny.
Mr Tan was also aware of the weakness of the evidence to make good
the existence of an agreement reached in a telephone conversation between
Mr Shum and Ms Koh which was ostensibly communicated to the Tribunal
at the CMC. He conceded that he was really relying on the Procedural
Timetable to deduce the existence of the alleged agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Alleged agreement
as evidenced by the Tribunal’s direction on “Filing of Witness Statements”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Mr
Tan argues that the Tribunal’s direction pertaining to the “Filing of
Witness Statements” in the Procedural Timetable meant only factual witness
statements in light of the IBA Rules that both parties agreed to
be bound by on 11 December 2012. Xinyi disagrees and contends that
the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural
Timetable was intended to encompass both factual and expert witness
statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I
make three points. First, Mr Tan’s argument goes further than the stated
position taken by Mr Shum during the course of the Arbitration.
The latter had previously based Triulzi’s case on the existence
of an agreement to dispense with expert evidence that was reached
at the CMC which was then communicated to the Tribunal. Mr Tan’s
reliance on the IBA Rules to define the meaning of the direction
“Filing of Witness Statements” was not argued before the Tribunal.
It was a new argument brought up for the first time in the present
proceedings and, needless to say, is another attempt by Triulzi
to have a “second bite at the cherry”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Secondly,
the Tribunal could not have contemplated the adoption and operation
of the IBA Rules when it issued its direction on the “Filing of Witness
Statements” in the Procedural Timetable. Significantly, prior to
the CMC, the Tribunal prepared and circulated to the parties on
10 December 2012 the Draft Procedural Timetable that provided a
deadline for the “Filing of Witness Statements”. This Draft Procedural
Timetable was sent to the parties before the IBA Rules were raised
on 11 December 2012 at the CMC. As can be seen from the Tribunal’s
minutes of the CMC, the parties had first discussed the Draft Procedural
Timetable and made modifications to the proposed deadlines so as
to accommodate the schedules of counsel before formalising the Procedural
Timetable. The IBA Rules were raised by Mr Shum <em>after</em> the
directions for “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural
Timetable were finalised. In short, there was nothing to suggest that
the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural Timetable
was intended to mean anything different from what was initially intended
by the Tribunal on 10 December 2012, and cannot be interpreted in
light of the IBA Rules which came after the finalisation of the
Procedural Timetable. Triulzi’s reliance on the IBA Rules to interpret
the words “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural Timetable
is thus without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Thirdly,
Mr Tan’s reliance on the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements”
in the Procedural Timetable to deduce the existence of an agreed
procedure to dispense with expert witness does not cohere with the nature
of a procedural timetable under the ICC Rules 2012 and is rejected for
the reasons below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Mr
Tan’s written submissions, taken to its logical conclusion, must mean
that the Procedural Timetable embodied the agreement as to arbitral procedure
between the parties. However, this contention does not sit well with
the nature of the Tribunal’s procedural order, issued in the form
of the Procedural Timetable, after the CMC. The CMC was held and
the Procedural Timetable was issued by the Tribunal in accordance
with Art 24 of the ICC Rules 2012 which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Article 24:
Case Management Conference and Procedural Timetable</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    When drawing up the Terms of Reference
or as soon as possible thereafter, the arbitral tribunal shall convene
a case management conference to consult the parties on procedural
measures that may be adopted pursuant to Article 22(2). Such measures
may include one or more of the case management techniques described
in Appendix IV.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    During or following such conference,
the arbitral tribunal shall establish the procedural timetable that
it intends to follow for the conduct of the arbitration. The procedural
timetable and any modifications thereto shall be communicated to
the Court and the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    To ensure continued effective case
management, the arbitral tribunal, after consulting the parties
by means of a further case management conference or otherwise, may
adopt further procedural measures or modify the procedural timetable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Case management conferences may be
conducted through a meeting in person, by video conference, telephone
or similar means of communication. In the absence of an agreement
of the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the means
by which the conference will be conducted. The arbitral tribunal
may request the parties to submit case management proposals in advance
of a case management conference and may request the attendance at
any case management conference of the parties in person or through
an internal representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It
is clear from Art 24(2) of the ICC Rules 2012 that a procedural timetable
is established by the arbitral tribunal and not by way of an agreement
by the parties. Even though the arbitral tribunal is required to consult
the parties under Art 24(1), the directions formalised by the arbitral tribunal
are its own procedural order. It is well within the arbitral tribunal’s power
and discretion to accept or reject the views of the parties expressed during
a case management conference as regards establishing the procedural
timetable. Article 24(3) further empowers the arbitral tribunal to
modify the established procedural timetable without being bound
by the views of the parties as well. The establishment of a procedural
timetable therefore falls under the arbitral tribunal’s exercise
of its case management powers which will be discussed in greater
detail when dealing with Issue 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Since
the Procedural Timetable constitutes a procedural order issued by
the Tribunal, the direction on “Filing of Witness Statements” cannot
be characterised as an agreed procedure between the parties for
the purposes of a setting-aside application under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The Tribunal’s implicit
acceptance that there was no agreement to dispense with expert evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I
now refer to the Tribunal’s directions on 5 April 2013 (see [34] above).
Ms Koh explained that the Tribunal considered the arguments of the
parties in the exchanges of communication and must have implicitly agreed
with Xinyi that there was no agreement to dispense with expert evidence.
She elaborated that the Tribunal’s direction to admit Dr Bao’s Report
supports her position that the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements”
in the Procedural Timetable should be interpreted as allowing for
the filing of both factual and expert witness statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     It
is possible to construe the Tribunal’s directions on 5 April 2013
in Ms Koh’s way. Since the Tribunal’s minutes did not record any
agreement to dispense with expert evidence, and considering the
fact that the criticisms of the Tribunal now raised by Mr Tan are
new, I see no reason to view the position taken by the Tribunal
differently. Besides, Mr Tan’s criticisms simply do not stand up
to analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the existence
of the alleged procedural agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     For
the reasons stated, there was no agreed procedure to dispense with
expert evidence. Triulzi’s application to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model Law on the ground
that the Award was not in accordance with the parties’ agreed arbitral
procedure is premised on the existence of an agreement to dispense
with expert evidence. This premise is not made out and the application
fails <em>in limine</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other Matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Having
reached the conclusion that there was no agreement to dispense with
expert evidence, it is not necessary to decide on the matters described
above (at [68(b)] and [68(c)]). However, I propose to discuss some
aspects of the matters raised in argument such as waiver and prejudice.
The discussions below are connected to Triulzi’s criticisms that Triulzi
was prejudiced from the fact that without its own expert’s witness statement,
it was prevented from refuting the Tribunal’s reliance on Xinyi’s expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Waiver of procedural irregularity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In
relation to Xinyi’s waiver argument, it relies on Art 39 of the
ICC Rules 2012. It argues that Triulzi is precluded from relying
on the IBA Rules to interpret the direction on the “Filing Witness
Statements” in the Procedural Timetable since Triulzi failed to
raise that issue with the Tribunal. As such, Triulzi had lost its
right to object on the basis of the IBA Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It
is now appropriate to refer to Triulzi’s request to the Tribunal
to record Triulzi’s dissatisfaction with the Tribunal’s procedural
directions issued on 16 April 2013 (see [37] above). Needless to
say, Triulzi’s insistence that the tribunal recorded its dissatisfaction
was nothing more than a precautionary attempt to state its objection
at that time to overcome any argument that the right to complain
has been forgone by waiver. However, the objections recorded did
not cover the specific waiver argument that is discussed here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Article
39 of the ICC Rules 2012 Rules states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Article
39. Waiver</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A party which proceeds with the arbitration without raising
its objection to a failure to comply with any provision of the Rules,
or of any other rules applicable to the proceedings, any direction
given by the arbitral tribunal, or any requirement under the arbitration
agreement relating to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal
or the conduct of the proceedings, shall be deemed to have waived
its right to object.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     One
of the objectives of Art 39 of the ICC Rules 2012 is to ensure that any
objection as to the conduct of the proceedings is made promptly.
If a party does not object, then it may well be deemed to have waived
its right to object pursuant to Art 39. There is no need to waive
in writing, although, as a matter of proof, an objection should
be in writing or recorded in the transcript. A bare objection without
any substantiation may not avoid a waiver of a procedural right.
As stated in Michael W Bühler and Thomas H Webster, <em>Handbook
of ICC Arbitration: Commentary, Precedents, Materials</em> (Sweet
&amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2008) at para 33-27:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there are objections to the procedure,
they <em>must be identified and in general substantiated</em>.
In the <em>Bombadier</em> case, the Respondent
raised general procedural objections and the Tribunal on several
occasions requested that the Respondent specify the procedural objections <em>so that they could be dealt with</em>. The
Respondent failed to do so and eventually brought proceedings to annul
the Award. The Paris Court of Appeal rejected the request for annulment
and noted in particular that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Considering that in order to be heard
in annulment proceeding, the grievance needs to have been invoked
in front of the arbitral tribunal each time it was possible to do
so; that this rule, which protects procedural loyalty and arbitral
awards, would be rendered useless if it was enough to utter menaces
and critics in front of the Tribunal, as shown by Bombardier, in
order to keep its options open when the time has come, to isolate
an element of the procedure and present it as a violation of the
adversarial principle.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The
passage quoted above is important. It emphasises the need to allow
the Tribunal to deal with the objections promptly and properly.
In order to do so, any party objecting to the procedural irregularity
must put forward the arguments which are available to it so as to
allow the Tribunal an opportunity to consider them. This concern
also constitutes part of the purpose behind Art 39 of the ICC Rules
2012 as stated in Jason Fry, Simon Greenberg and Francesca Mazza, <em>The Secretariat’s Guide to ICC Arbitration</em> (ICC,
2012) at pp 418–419:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Purpose.</b> Article
39 ensures that if a party fails to raise objections with respect to
the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or the conduct of the
proceedings it will be deemed to have waived its right to object.
This is especially relevant with regard to any subsequent court
proceedings. <em>The provision is intended to force
parties to raise any genuine procedural concerns promptly during
the arbitration, so that, where possible, the concern can be addressed
immediately and within the arbitration</em>. This prevents
parties from holding back any objections for use in a later attempt
to attack the award. A party that proceeds with an arbitration without
raising a procedural objection runs a serious risk that it will
be prevented (either by the Rules or relevant law) from relying
on any procedural issue in subsequent court proceedings to set aside
or resist enforcement of an award. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The rationale is that a party should not be allowed to withhold
any arguments that it could have made before the Tribunal but make
it at a later stage in a setting-aside application in the event
that the arbitral award turns out to be unfavourable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In
arguing for the exclusion of Dr Bao’s report, Mr Shum wrote in his letter
addressed to the Tribunal dated 2 April 2013:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the abovementioned case management
conference, the parties had indicated to the Tribunal that the parties
will not be filing any expert statements. Consequently, the Procedural
Timetable dated 11 December 2012 did not provide a timeline for
expert witness statements to be filed. We have also not been given
any notice that [Xinyi] will be filing any expert witness statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Apart
from a bare assertion that the Procedural Timetable did not provide
for expert witness statements to be filed, Triulzi’s objections
did not mention, let alone rely on, the IBA Rules to draw the distinction
made in the IBA Rules between factual and expert witness statements.
As stated above (at [81]), the IBA Rules were adopted after the
Tribunal’s direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” was made
and there was no reliance placed on the IBA Rules to limit the direction
on the “Filing of Witness Statements” to the filing of only factual
witness statements. On the face of it, Triulzi’s failure to raise
this issue in relation to the IBA Rules in the Arbitration precluded
it from making such a submission in this setting-aside application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Even
if waiver is not made out under Art 39 of ICC Rules 2012, the use
of the IBA Rules to draw a distinction between factual witness statements
and expert witness statements in order to ascribe a different meaning
to the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural
Timetable is plainly an afterthought. It is based on <em>ex post facto</em> reasoning derived from facts
that were not before the Tribunal when it issued its procedural
direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Admission of Dr Bao’s Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Mr
Tan raises the question of prejudice in his submissions (see [23] above).
For the sake of argument, if there was a procedural agreement as alleged,
it would then mean that expert evidence should have been excluded from
the arbitral hearing. Consequently, the examination of prejudice
in the context of Xinyi’s breach of the parties’ agreed arbitral
procedure is really a question of whether the exclusion of expert
witness statements, <em>ie</em>, Dr Bao’s
Report, would have made a reasonable difference to the Tribunal’s deliberation
(see <em>LW Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San
Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> [2013] 1 SLR 125
at [54]). The alleged prejudice that eventuated as a result of the
breach must have a causal connection with the admission of Dr Bao’s
Report. This question does not involve an inquiry into what would
have happened if Triulzi had been allowed to adduce its own expert
evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     From
this perspective, Triulzi’s argument that there would be a real
or likely difference to the Tribunal’s deliberation if it had been
allowed to adduce its own expert evidence is not relevant to this
issue of prejudice in the context of a setting-aside application
under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model
Law where the complaint relates to an alleged breach of an agreed arbitral
procedure. In this context, one is concerned with the right to have the
arbitration conducted in accordance with the agreed arbitral procedure. The
scenario here is quite different from those cases where there is
an alleged breach of natural justice which, in this case, would
concern Triulzi’s right to adduce its own expert witness statements
that flows from the right to be afforded a reasonable opportunity
to present its case. That consideration is relevant in the context
of Triulzi’s allegations of breach of natural justice which I shall
deal with when discussing Issue 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In
connection with this aspect of the application to set aside the Award
under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model
Law, the theoretical inquiry here (assuming that the admission of
Dr Bao’s Report was in breach of an agreed procedure) is whether
an exclusion of Dr Bao’s Report would have reasonably made a difference
to the deliberations of the Tribunal. I now turn to Dr Bao’s Report
to examine how the Tribunal dealt with it in the Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Dr
Bao’s Report dealt with three issues that was considered by the Tribunal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether
there were design defects in the washing machines;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether
the cleanliness of Xinyi’s facility affected the performance of
the washing machines; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether
a full 8-hour acceptance test should have been conducted by Xinyi
for the washing machines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    It
is clear that as to the first issue, Dr Bao was not an expert in industrial
washing machines and the Tribunal treated Dr Bao’s opinion as a “matter
of conjecture”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> As for the second
issue on the cleanliness of Xinyi’s facility, the Tribunal found
that Dr Bao’s opinion on the cleanliness of the facility was not
satisfactory since his inspection was conducted more than 21 months
after the washing quality issues arose. The Tribunal stated in [101]
of the Award:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, Dr Bao’s conclusion that the
cleanliness of the air at the Wuhu Facility was normal, did not
assist the Tribunal in determining the cleanliness of the Wuhu Facility
at the relevant time period when the washing quality issues were
raised (December 2010 to May 2011), as Dr Bao’s inspection and observations
were made more than 21 months after the Claimant raised the alleged
washing quality issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In
summary, Dr Bao’s Report had no bearing on the Tribunal’s determination
in respect of the first and second issues. As for the third issue,
the Tribunal agreed with Dr Bao that there was no need for Xinyi
to conduct a full 8-hour acceptance test. Whilst Triulzi argues
that this is evidence of prejudice, it must be noted that in the
same paragraph of the Award where the Tribunal seemingly agreed
with Dr Bao on this point, the Tribunal further held:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t is immaterial that [Xinyi] did not
carry out a full 8 hour acceptance test, <em>given
the evidence</em> that there were several areas that did not
comply with the contract specifications within the period of time
when the acceptance test was conducted from 7 to 12 May 2011. [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    This
finding of the Tribunal is significant for the reason that the final determination
of the Tribunal in relation to Triulzi’s defence would not have
been affected even if he disagreed with Dr Bao’s opinion on the
third issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    For
the reasons stated, an exclusion of Dr Bao’s Report would not have
reasonably made a difference to the deliberations of the Tribunal. There
is consequently no reason to set aside the award even if such a procedural
agreement excluding expert evidence existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1A: Award was not in accordance
with Art 18 within the meaning of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr
Tan’s fall-back argument is that the Award should be set aside under
Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model Law
as it was not in accordance with Art 18 of the Model Law which sets
out the non-derogable minimum procedural requirements as regards
the procedural conduct of an arbitration. In my view, Mr Tan’s fall-back
argument does not assist Triulzi because the evidence in this case
pointed, at best, to a misunderstanding of the scope of the direction
on the “Filing of Witness Statements” or some other mistake on Triulzi’s
part. Plainly, the non-filing of Triulzi’s expert evidence by 1
April 2013 was entirely its own fault, and Triulzi was in delay, even
at that stage, in complying with the Tribunal’s direction on the
Filing of Witness Statements. Furthermore, for the reasons explained
below (at [110] to [116]), the Tribunal’s subsequent procedural
orders and directions cannot be relied upon as a ground for challenging
the eventual Award. In the circumstances of this case, Art 18 is
not engaged. I have already set out the purpose of Art 18 above
(at [51]) which is about protecting a party from the arbitral tribunal’s
conduct. It is certainly not intended to protect a party from its
own “failures or strategic choices”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    It
is now appropriate to set out Article 18 of the Model Law in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Article
18. Equal treatment of parties</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties shall be treated with equality and each party
shall be given a full opportunity of presenting his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    I
accept that Art 18 of the Model Law, described as a key element
of the “Magna Carta of Arbitral Procedure” in the <em>Analytical
Commentary on Draft Text </em><em>of a Model
Law on International Commercial Arbitration: Report of the Secretary
General</em> (A/CN.9/264, 25 March 1985) (“<em>Analytical Commentary</em>”)
at p 44, is a mandatory provision, and the breach of which would
be, as stated in Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv)
of the Model Law, “in conflict with the provision of this Law” or
“not in accordance with this Law”. Consequently, a breach of Art
18 may give rise to a ground for setting aside an award under Art
34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    It
must be recognised however that Art 18 is worded with reference
to the abstract notions of “equality” and “full opportunity”. As
observed by <em>Holtzmann and Neuhaus</em> at
p 551:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The terms of Article 18 were modelled on
Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Commission
Report provides no authoritative guidelines to interpreting the
terms “treated with equality” and “full opportunity of presenting
his case”; nor do the reports of the Working Group. It is submitted
that this may be because the delegates considered that the terms
were so well understood in all legal systems that comment was unnecessary
and that detailed definitions might limit the flexible and broad approach
needed to ensure fairness in the wide variety of circumstances that must
be encountered in international arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, the exact content of Art 18 that is engaged by
a complaint of a breach of Art 18 must depend upon the level of
abstraction at which the complaint is described or characterised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In
this case, Mr Tan argues that even without the alleged procedural agreement,
the Tribunal nonetheless violated Art 18 of the Model Law as Triulzi
was not treated equally compared with Xinyi. Mr Tan raises the point
that the Tribunal should have appreciated the fact that Triulzi
was under the mistaken belief that expert evidence was to be dispensed
with. In this regard, Xinyi had the benefit of the entire duration
from 11 December 2012, after the CMC, to 1 April 2013, the deadline
for the “Filing of Witness Statements”, to produce an expert report
whereas Triulzi was effectively not afforded such an ample amount
of time as the Tribunal only gave it a ten-day time period. The
crux of Mr Tan’s complaint is that only Xinyi, and not Triulzi,
presented its expert evidence during the hearing from 22 to 25 April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I
make several points. First, the Tribunal’s decision to extend time
by ten days for Triulzi to file its expert witness statement must
not be considered in isolation. I concluded that there was no agreement
to dispense with expert evidence, and as such, Triulzi would have
had the same amount of time as Xinyi (11 December 2012 to 1 April
2013) to prepare and file an expert witness statement. It is thus
fanciful to now complain of inequality because the Tribunal gave
Triulzi only ten days to prepare an expert report. Besides, it is
risible that Triulzi now complains of inequality when the perceived
disadvantage was occasioned by its own doing. The Tribunal’s decision
to extend time by another ten days to file Triulzi’s expert witness
statement was decidedly made after taking into account parties’
arguments and a myriad of factors including the arbitral tribunal’s
obligation to conduct the arbitration fairly and expeditiously.
The Tribunal had come to grips with Triulzi’s desire to inspect
the two washing machines, but it was not told why Triulzi needed
four weeks to inspect and another four weeks to prepare the expert
report when Xinyi took four hours to inspect the two washing machines.
In those circumstances, Triulzi’s contention relating to inequality
must be rejected on this point alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Secondly,
the term “equality” must be “interpreted reasonably in regulating
the procedural aspects of the arbitration” (see <em>Holtzmann
and Neuhaus</em> at p 551). It cannot be the case that each
party must have the exact same amount of time afforded in relation
to the production of an expert report. Article 18 does not require
the arbitral tribunal to ensure that both parties are treated identically.
Notably, the principle of equality in Art 18 is about applying <em>similar</em> standards to all parties throughout
the arbitral process (see the 2012 Digest, p 97 at para 5). Furthermore, <em>SIA: Law &amp; Practice</em> make the following
comments at ch 6, paras 2.11–2.13 and 2.15:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.11  The
first requirement, that the parties be ‘treated with equality’,
means that the parties are to be treated in equal fashion. This
does not mean that the tribunal must treat the parties identically,
but it must accord them equal treatment in the procedure adopted
for the conduct of the reference. It seems that the requirement
of equal treatment must be observed by the parties and the tribunal
alike.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.12  Nevertheless the principle of equal
treatment should not, it is suggested, be confused with that of
mandating an exact equal amount of time or an equal number of pleadings,
or speeches. Whilst such a procedure may be adopted in the discretion
of the tribunal it is not mandated. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2,13  The fundamental reason that equality
of treatment does not mandate such an approach is that equality
of treatment is ultimately considered together with a full opportunity
to present its case. In other words, if a party is accorded a full
opportunity to present its case including to comment upon the case
advanced against it, then it is suggested that a tribunal is not concerned
with whether or not an exactly equal time or an exact equal number
of pleadings or speeches is accorded to each party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.15  Yet
further, it is even possible to express at the extremes a potential tension
between the two concepts of equality of treatment and a full opportunity
to present its case. Thus every tribunal is likely to make some provision
for a procedural timetable for the disposal of the matter in as reasonably
expeditious fashion as is permitted in all the circumstances. Such a
timetable will inevitably limit the amount of time given to each
party to prepare and present a case. Thus it frequently transpires
that one party or other applies to the tribunal for further permission
to extend time or present further evidence out of time or an additional
submissions. All will depend upon the circumstances of the particular
case; nonetheless a tribunal must balance the need to accord equality
to the parties which will include adherence to the timetable applicable
to each side to prepare and present its case and the requirement
to accord each party a full opportunity to present its case. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    I
now refer to a German decision by the Oberlandesgericht Celle: <em>8 Sch 3/01</em> (2 October 2001) which was
discussed by Dr Peter Binder, <em>International
Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL Model Law Jurisdictions</em> (Sweet
&amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010) at pp 279–280:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case the respondent alleged a violation
of its right to be heard and the equal treatment of parties (art.18
of the model Law) due to the fact that the arbitral tribunal had
conducted the proceedings only in the Russian language, which the
respondent could not understand, this despite the fact that the contract
itself was drafted in two languages. The Higher Regional Court Celle held
that the defendant had been given <em>sufficient
possibility to raise defences</em> before the arbitral tribunal.
Lacking any specific agreement of the parties to the contrary, it
was self-evident that the Russian Court of Arbitration would conduct
the arbitral proceedings in Russian. The court emphasised that it
was the defendant’s obligation to obtain assistance from an interpreter
in order to <em>participate fully in the proceedings</em>.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen from this excerpt, the mere fact that there
was some “inequality” as a result of the fact that it was more convenient
for the applicant, who understood Russian, to participate in the
arbitration does not amount to a violation of Art 18.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Likewise
the commentary from <em>SIA: Law &amp; Practice</em> above
(at [112]) recognises that the amount of time to be afforded to
a party cannot be based solely on the amount of time afforded to
the other party. Other circumstances may bear upon the judgment
of the Tribunal. A relevant consideration is the conduct of the
parties. The stage of the arbitral proceedings at the material time
also matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In
this regard, I note that in Triulzi’s letter dated 5 April 2013,
Mr Shum had only requested time for Triulzi to engage an expert <em>to inspect the two washing machines at Xinyi’s facility
and produce a report based on such an inspection</em>. Obviously,
the Tribunal had relied on Triulzi’s submission that it only wanted
to inspect the two machines at Xinyi’s facility. In this regard,
the Tribunal: (a) noted that Dr Bao took four hours to inspect the machines;
and (b) confined Triulzi’s inspection to the two washing machines
and that its inspection should “not extend to other units in the same
premises or other premises”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> At the same time, the Tribunal
was mindful that the extension of time to file an expert witness
statement was being sought very close to the evidentiary hearing
dates in April. In this regard, the Tribunal’s consideration of
urgency in the conduct of the arbitral proceedings was a relevant
factor. Notably, the Tribunal must have regard: (a) to the fact
that Xinyi filed its expert witness statement on time on 1 April
2013; and (b) to its obligation to get on with the arbitral proceedings
with reasonable expedition (see also [131]–[132] below). Seen against
this backdrop of circumstances, the Tribunal could not be said to have
treated Triulzi unequally. I also note that all these factors are
also relevant to the issue of whether Triulzi was afforded a reasonable opportunity
to be heard and they will be discussed in greater detail when I deal
with Issue 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Lastly,
it cannot be the case that Triulzi was treated unequally for the sole
reason that Xinyi was the only party armed with expert evidence
at the hearing. The Tribunal is only required to ensure that both
Triulzi and Xinyi had an opportunity to submit expert evidence.
It is not required to ensure that both Triulzi and Xinyi made full
and best use of such an opportunity. Triulzi cannot complain of
its own failure to make use of the opportunity given to it by the
Tribunal. Triulzi’s complaint, in effect, is premised on it being
denied an opportunity to adduce expert evidence rather than the
bare fact that it did not adduce such evidence at the hearing. From
this perspective, Triulzi’s main contention does not relate to equality
of treatment under Art 18 of the Model Law and should be re-characterised
as an allegation that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity
to present expert evidence. The question then is whether Triulzi
was afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard in the arbitration
and this is raised by Triulzi under Issue 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Breach of natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Criticisms of the Tribunal’s
procedural orders and directions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Mr
Tan’s alternative argument to the agreed procedural breach point is
founded on s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA and
Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the Model Law. Issue
2 is premised on three specific criticisms of the Tribunal’s procedural orders
and directions that were said to have effectively denied Triulzi
a reasonable opportunity to present its own expert evidence. In
particular, Triulzi was prevented from advancing arguments before
the Tribunal that the subject machines complied with the contractual
technical specifications, and that any non-compliance was due to
Xinyi’s lack of maintenance and the very dirty environment of Xinyi’s
facility. Triulzi was further prevented from refuting the Tribunal’s
reliance on Xinyi’s expert evidence in respect of the contractual
requirement to run the subject machines for 8 hours for the acceptance
test. Mr Tan also argues that, as a result of such procedural orders
and directions, Triulzi was treated unequally as compared with Xinyi (this
inequality point is already discussed above). The three procedural orders
and directions are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
direction on 5 April 2013 for Triulzi to file its expert witness
statement by 4pm on 15 April 2013;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
direction on 16 April 2013 refusing Triulzi’s application to vacate
the hearing dates; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
refusal to admit Dr Piombo’s Report on 25 April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    As
I alluded to above (at [19]), Triulzi’s challenge is effectively
against the procedural orders and directions made in the course
of the arbitral proceedings rather than a challenge to the making
of the Award. In this case, Triulzi has to persuade the court that
the Tribunal’s procedural decisions were, albeit a matter of case
management, amounted to a breach of natural justice (<em>ie</em>, the procedural nature of the right
to be heard) as a result of which Triulzi’s rights are prejudiced
(see s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA). Notably,
the accusations are not that the Tribunal had not dealt with all
the central issues of the dispute or that the Tribunal had dealt
with the issues without hearing the parties. Triulzi’s difficulty
resides in establishing that Triulzi’s complaints arise from circumstances
attributable to the Tribunal, or that the circumstances were not
a result of Triulzi’s own failures or choices (tactical or otherwise).
In the final analysis, the three procedural orders and directions
could not even be treated as evidence of the Tribunal’s culpability
and this means that Triulzi’s criticisms of the Tribunal (see also
[22]–[23] above) must fail. In my view, these criticisms were unfounded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Triulzi’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In
brief, Triulzi’s allegations as part of its natural justice arguments are
as follows: (a) that ten days to produce an expert report did not
afford it a meaningful opportunity to file an expert report; and
that this short time extension was further compounded by (b) the
Tribunal’s rejection of Triulzi’s application to vacate the hearing
dates and (c) its refusal to admit Dr Piombo’s Report which Triulzi
had attempted to file on the last day of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Triulzi’s
submits that the Tribunal’s procedural orders and directions described
in [117(a)] and [117(b)] and the Tribunal’s decision described in [117(c)]
violated its right to be heard as embodied in Art 18 of the Model Law
that requires the arbitral tribunal to give each party “a full opportunity of
presenting his case”. As a result of this violation of its right
to be heard, Triulzi argues that the Award should be set aside under
s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties’ approach in OS 1114/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Section

of the Model Law. Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in <em>ADG
and another v ADI and another</em> [2014] 3 SLR 481 (“<em>ADG v ADI</em>”) recognised at [118] that there
is “no distinction between the right to be heard as an aspect of
the rules of natural justice under s 24 (<em>b</em>)
of the IAA and as an aspect of being able to be heard within the
meaning of Article 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii).”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Furthermore,
although Art 18 uses the word “full opportunity” to present one’s
case, both parties proceeded on the understanding that this only
requires the Tribunal to accord each party a “reasonable opportunity” to
present its case. Coomaraswamy J also held in <em>ADG
v ADI</em> at [105] that “full opportunity” to be heard as
mandated by Art 18 is no different from a requirement to afford
a party a reasonable opportunity to be heard. There is in effect
no need to rely on Art 18 since the principles there accord with
the principles of natural justice in both s 24(<em>b</em>)
of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of
the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I
therefore propose to deal with s 24(<em>b</em>)
of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) together
since both provisions involve a single inquiry as to whether Triulzi was
denied a reasonable opportunity to be heard (“the fair hearing rule”).
It is noteworthy that the content of the fair hearing rule can vary
greatly from case to case depending on the circumstances of each
case since what may be a breach in one context may not be a breach
in another. At this juncture, it is useful to refer to the Queensland
Supreme Court’s observations on procedural fairness in the decision
of <em>Sugar Australia Pty Ltd v Mackay Sugar</em> Ltd
[2012] QSC 38 (“<em>Sugar Australia</em>”)
at [33]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is whether the applicant was
deprived unfairly of an opportunity to put its case, by argument
and if relevant by evidence, against the reasoning by which the
arbitrator had rejected the applicant’s case. The answer largely
turns upon whether the applicant should reasonably have anticipated
that, without the arbitrator providing such an opportunity to the applicant,
the arbitrator might determine the dispute by that reasoning. In <em>Re Association of Architects ex parte Municipal Officers
Association</em>, Gaudron J said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“As was pointed out by Deane J in <em>Sullivan v Department of Transport</em> (1978)
20 ALR 323 at 343, procedural fairness requires only that a party
be given ‘a reasonable opportunity to present his case’ and not that
the tribunal ensure ‘that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity
to which he is entitled’. And it is always relevant to enquire whether
the party or his legal representative should reasonably have apprehended
that the issue was or might become a live issue: see <em>Re Building Workers’ Industrial Union of Australia;
ex parte Gallagher</em> (1988) 62 ALJR 81 at 84; 76 ALR 353
at 358.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    If
Triulzi is able to establish that it was denied a reasonable opportunity
to present its case, it must then establish how this denial bore upon
the adverse decision or in other words that it was prejudiced as
a result. At this juncture, it is appropriate to repeat here my
comments above (at [118]). Triulzi has to first and foremost show
that the Tribunal’s procedural orders and decisions were not a matter
of case management, but a breach of natural justice (<em>ie</em>, the procedural nature of the right
to be heard). Evidentially, were Triulzi’s complaints due to circumstances attributable
to the Tribunal, or were the circumstances due to Triulzi’s own failures
or choices (tactical or otherwise)?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Case management powers of the
Tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Triulzi’s
complaints revolved around the exercise of the Tribunal’s case management
powers. The Tribunal’s discretion to determine procedure, in the
absence of agreement between the parties on such matters, is enshrined
in Art 19 of the Model Law which is set out above (at [46]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Furthermore,
by adopting the ICC Rules 2012, the parties have also agreed to
grant the Tribunal broad and flexible case management powers. As
stated in Art 22(2) of the ICC Rules 2012:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Article 22:
Conduct of the Arbitration</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The arbitral tribunal and the parties
shall make every effort to conduct the arbitration in an expeditious
and cost-effective manner, having regard to the complexity and value
of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    In order to ensure effective case
management, the arbitral tribunal, after consulting the parties,
may adopt such procedural measures as it considers appropriate,
provided that they are not contrary to any agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    In
all cases, the arbitral tribunal shall act fairly and impartially
and ensure that each party has a reasonable opportunity to present
its case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    The parties undertake to comply with
any order made by the arbitral tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    A
similarly broad and flexible authority is granted to the Tribunal
to deal with evidence under Art 9(1) of the IBA Rules which the
parties have also adopted:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Article 9.
Admissibility and Assessment of Evidence</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The Arbitral Tribunal shall determine
the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In
this regard, I refer to Tay Yong Kwang J’s description of the role
of the Tribunal as the “master of his own procedure” with wide discretionary powers
in <em>Anwar Siraj v Ting Kang Chung</em> [2003]
3 SLR(R) 287 (“<em>Anwar Siraj</em>”) at
[41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The arbitrator is, subject to any procedure
otherwise agreed between the parties as applying to the arbitration
in question, master of his own procedure and has a wide discretionary
power to conduct the arbitration proceedings in the way he sees
fit, so long as what he is doing is not manifestly unfair or contrary
to natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    This
passage was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development
Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Soh
Beng Tee</em>”) at [60]. That the Tribunal is the master of
his own procedure is one of the foundational elements of the international
arbitral process. Nonetheless, as observed by Tay J, the arbitral
tribunal’s case management powers are not without limits. The exercise
of case management powers is subject to the rules of natural justice
which includes the right to be heard. However, this right only encompasses
a reasonable opportunity to present one’s case, the fair hearing
rule, which must be considered in light of other competing factors.
For instance, the Tribunal is also obligated under Art 22(1) of
the ICC Rules 2012 to “make every effort to conduct the arbitration
in an expeditious and cost-effective manner, having regard to the
complexity and value of the dispute.” Weight must be accorded to
“the practical realities of the arbitral ecosystem such as promptness
and price” (see <em>TMM Division Maritima SA de
CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR 972
at [103]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In
this regard, an arbitral tribunal exercising case management powers
will take into consideration a myriad of factors, including the arbitral
tribunal’s obligation to conduct the arbitration fairly and expeditiously.
The supervisory role of the court over the Tribunal’s exercise of
his case management powers should therefore be “exercised with a
light hand” in the context of a challenge on the basis of the fair
hearing rule (see <em>Anwar Siraj</em> at
[42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The
decision in <em>Grand Pacific</em> which
I have discussed above (at [61]) in relation to Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) is also relevant here. In that
case, the applicant also sought to set aside an arbitral award under
Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the Model Law
on the ground that it had been unable to present its case as a result
of certain case management decisions taken by the tribunal. One
of these decisions was a refusal to consider additional authorities
which the applicant sought to rely on. The High Court set aside
the award but the decision was reversed by the Hong Kong Court of
Appeal. In its decision at [68], the Hong Kong Court of Appeal emphasised
the broad and flexible case management powers of the arbitral tribunal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The learned Judge concluded at para.129
that the refusal to receive and consider the additional authorities
prevented [the applicant] from presenting its case and therefore
a violation of art.34(2)(a)(ii) has been established. With respect,
I cannot agree with Saunders J. <em>I do not believe
he was entitled to interfere with a case management decision, which
was fully within the discretion of the [arbitral tribunal] to make.</em> [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The
Hong Kong Court of Appeal proceeded to highlight at [94] that in
relation to the exercise of the arbitral tribunal’s case management powers,
“the conduct complained of must be sufficiently serious or egregious
so that one could say a party has been denied due process.” In this regard,
I note that this phrase was also considered by Coomaraswamy J in <em>ADG v ADI</em> and I agree with his interpretation
at [116]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [The Hong Kong Court of Appeal] held
[in <em>Grand Pacific</em>] … that before
a court finds that a party was unable to present its case within
the meaning of Article 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law, “the conduct
complained of must be sufficiently serious or egregious so that
one could say a party has been denied due process”. Although the
term “due process” originates in English law (see the Liberty of
Subject Act 1354, still in force in England today), it is not a term
of art in English, Singapore or indeed Hong Kong law. Read in context, the
concept of “due process” referred to by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal directs
the focus to the elemental or fundamental aspects of the right to
be heard rather than to its technical or incidental aspects. The
violation of that right which is necessary to amount to a party
being “unable to be heard” must be a radical breach of that right
which is “serious or egregious”, though not so radical that the
public policy grounds under Article 34(2)(b)(ii) are engaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    With
these case management principles in mind, I now turn to examine
whether Triulzi is able to show that the Tribunal’s procedural decisions
were a breach of natural justice (<em>ie</em>,
the procedural nature of the right to be heard) and brought them
within the ambit of s 24(<em>b</em>) of the
IAA and Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the
Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The direction on 5 April 2013
for Triulzi to file its expert witness statement by 4pm on 15 April
2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In
connection with this aspect of the application, the case management
powers of the Tribunal need to be addressed in the context of five
other matters. First, the Tribunal’s duty was to proceed with the conduct
of the arbitration fairly and expeditiously. The history here is
that the parties were supposed to be ready for an evidentiary hearing
starting 22 April 2013; the hearing dates having been fixed since
11 December 2012 in the Procedural Timetable. The Tribunal had also
given notice to the parties on 13 December 2012 that it expected
the parties to strictly adhere to the Procedural Timetable (see
[27] above). There was already a departure from the prescribed timeline
following a request by both parties to extend the deadline for the
“Filing of Witness Statements” by a week to 1 April 2013. I also
observe that according to Art 30(1) of the ICC Rules 2012, the Tribunal was
required to render its final award six months from the Terms of Reference, <em>ie</em> 28 May 2013, and this also contributed
to the urgency of the matter. It does not matter that the Tribunal
had in fact issued the Award after 28 May 2013 as what is important
is that the Tribunal was concerned with this deadline when it issued
its procedural orders and directions. Considering all those factors
at play, and in light of Art 22 of the ICC Rules 2012 which requires
the Tribunal to conduct matters expeditiously, the Tribunal, on
learning of Triulzi’s application to vacate the April hearing dates
on the basis that it required a total of eight weeks to inspect
and file its expert witness statement, was quite entitled to conclude
that in those circumstances, it was better for the hearing to proceed
on the dates fixed and grant a time extension of ten days to Triulzi
for it to file an expert witness statement. It seems to me that
the Tribunal had, within its case management discretion, acted fairly
and was entitled to conclude that proper case management of the
Arbitration required the April hearing to go ahead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Secondly,
I have already concluded that Triulzi’s excuse for not filing its
expert’s witness statement by 1 April 2013 was not credible. The
fact of the matter is that Xinyi had in hand Dr Bao’s Report on
1 April 2013 but Triulzi, on the other hand, despite having the
same amount of time as Xinyi, was without an expert witness statement.
Triulzi’s predicament was created by its own doing and it did not
matter whether this was due to a mishap, mistake or misunderstanding
that it had an agreement with Xinyi. The suggestion that the Tribunal’s
time extension was not meaningful is symptomatic of Triulzi’s approach
throughout the entire Arbitration in that its own mistakes and misunderstandings
should not matter. As I see it, the Tribunal had conducted itself
fairly in the face of a predicament that was entirely of Triulzi’s
own doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Triulzi’s
predicament was further compounded by what it had told the Tribunal
– it wanted its expert to inspect the two washing machines in dispute.
It was also compounded by what it had <em>not</em> told
the Tribunal. Notably, the Tribunal’s decision to grant Triulzi
a time extension of ten days was set against the back drop of the
following matters: (a) the Tribunal was only told in a letter on
5 April 2013 that Triulzi wanted its expert to inspect the two machines
and to file an expert’s report on that matter; (b) the Tribunal
was neither told that the expert evidence would cover other aspects
of the dispute nor was it told that it was Triulzi’s intention to instruct
a non-Chinese expert, and that Triulzi could face difficulties in relation
to the availability of its expert and the visa application for its
expert; (c) the Tribunal observed that the length of time it took
Dr Bao to inspect the two machines was four hours; and (d) the scheduled
hearing was less than three weeks away. Besides the time extension,
the Tribunal directed Xinyi to give Triulzi’s access to the two
machines in dispute so as to expedite matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Thirdly,
when issuing procedural directions, an arbitral tribunal must consider
the interests of both parties (see <em>Sanko Steamship
Co Ltd v Shipping Corp of India and Selwyn and Clark (The Jhansi
Ki Rani)</em> [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 569). The Tribunal therefore
had to balance the interest of Xinyi to ensure that it was not inconvenienced
for what might be termed Triulzi’s “lapses” or, in a more charitable
term, “mishaps”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Fourthly,
the parties were supposed to be ready for a hearing starting 22
April 2013, which hearing dates had been fixed since 11 December
2012. Triulzi was not ready and wanted the hearing dates of 22 to
25 April to be vacated. It must be remembered that: (a) the dispute
over the alleged agreement to dispense with expert evidence arose
on 2 April 2013 which was less than 3 weeks before the start of
the scheduled hearing; and (b) Triulzi missed the deadline for filing
an expert witness statement on 1 April 2013. It was, however, given
another opportunity to prepare an expert report and an additional
ten days was given after the Tribunal heard Triulzi’s application
for more time and vacation of the April hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    For
the reasons given, the Tribunal’s conduct is not capable of criticism
whatsoever. Triulzi’s complaints are misconceived. In my view, the
Tribunal had made its decision fairly in consideration of all points raised
by Triulzi at that stage. It is not for the supervising court to
interfere in an entirely legitimate case management decision, and
one which was necessary in the light of the matters set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The direction on 16 April 2013
refusing Triulzi’s application to vacate the hearing dates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    On
12 April 2013, Triulzi wrote to the Tribunal to complain that the time
extension of ten days for the Triulzi to file an expert’s report
was too short and invited the Tribunal to reconsider its decision
not to vacate the April hearing dates. By that time, seven of the
ten days afforded to Triulzi had passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    In
that communication, Triulzi informed the Tribunal that its choice of
expert was not available. This formed the basis of Triulzi’s subsequent contention
in OS 1114/2013 that it was not given a meaningful opportunity to
file an expert report. Triulzi relies on the fact that its first
choice expert, Mr Wigg, was only available from early June 2013
onwards. It also relies on the fact that its Italian experts had
to apply for a visa one month before travel to China. This would
mean that it was impossible for either Mr Wigg or another Italian
expert to produce an expert report between 5 April 2013 and 15 April
2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I
cannot accept this argument criticising the Tribunal’s conduct on and
prior to 16 April 2013. Bearing in mind what was said to the Tribunal
at that stage, a reasonable opportunity to present Triulzi’s case
does not equate to a reasonable opportunity to optimally present <em>everything</em> that it wants to present. Triulzi’s
inability to engage either Mr Wigg or an Italian expert is not a
basis for finding that 10 days did not constitute a reasonable opportunity
to file its expert report. Neither should Triulzi’s failure to reasonably
apprehend the new issues that were, or might have become, live issues
constitute a want of procedural fairness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    I
have already stated that the Tribunal was not told prior to the
5 April 2013 decision that Triulzi wanted to engage Mr Wigg who
would need to apply for a visa to China. It was not Triulzi’s case
that it could not engage an expert that was already in China. Triulzi
also submits that aside from securing an expert, the ten days granted
by the Tribunal was insufficient for it to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_145-p2_a"></a>(a)     liaise
with Xinyi to ensure that the washing machines were available for
inspection at Xinyi’s facility; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_145-p2_b"></a>(b)     have
the expert prepare the report that not only deals with the issue
of inherent design defects within the machine, but also the impact
of the environmental conditions of the facility on the washing machines,
the adequacy of Xinyi’s maintenance of the machines and the interpretation
of technical terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    As
regards point (a), the Tribunal had on 5 April 2013 directed Xinyi to
“give reasonable supervised access to [Triulzi’s] expert to inspect
the 2 glass-washing machines.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> It transpired that Triulzi
did not contact Xinyi and Ms Koh submits that Triulzi cannot complain
of having insufficient time when its own behaviour shows that it
was not making full use of the ten days granted to it. I agree with
Ms Koh’s submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    On
point (b), Mr Shum’s letter dated 5 April 2013 and 12 April 2013 only
related to the inspection of the two machines in dispute. Notably,
Mr Wigg was also only instructed to inspect the two machines in
dispute, as seen in his e-mail to Triulzi dated 12 April 2013. Right
through to the hearing on 16 April 2013, the complaint related to
insufficient time “to engage [an] expert witness, send him to China
for the inspection and come up with a report” as seen from the Tribunal’s
e-mail of 16 April 2013 set out above (at [37]). Significantly,
it is clear from the contemporaneous documentary evidence that in
April 2013, the Tribunal was <em>not </em><em>told</em> by Triulzi that it needed its expert
not only for the inspection of the two machines, but also for the
environment of the facility and Xinyi’s maintenance regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Again,
Triulzi’s complaint that the Tribunal’s time extension was not meaningful
and it was not given an opportunity to present its own expert evidence
that covered other matters is again symptomatic of Triulzi’s approach
throughout the entire Arbitration. Triulzi seeks to criticise the Tribunal’s
conduct for something that Triulzi itself had not seen fit to put before
the Tribunal for consideration. There is no explanation as to why
the Tribunal was not told on 16 April 2013 that Triulzi wanted its
expert to inspect the environmental conditions of Xinyi’s facility,
Xinyi’s maintenance regime, or for the expert report to deal with
the interpretation of technical terms. Triulzi’s stated position
in April 2013 was that it wanted its expert to inspect the two machines
only and to file an expert statement on this, a position that is
very different from the one it is taking in OS 1114/2013. It plainly
now wants to have a “second bite at the cherry” having seen the
Tribunal’s findings and reasoning in the Award. In particular, the Tribunal
rejected Triulzi’s factual witness evidence on these issues, and knowing
that, Triulzi, with the benefit of hindsight, now alleges that time should
have been given for it to prepare an expert report to buttress its factual
witness evidence on those issues. It is also noteworthy that the
issue relating to the interpretation of technical terms, which was
not part of Triulzi’s original pleaded case, was only “brought up
belatedly at the hearing”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> by its factual witness.
It is highly unlikely that any expert report filed by Triulzi before
the hearing would have dealt with this issue in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Following <em>BLC v BLB</em>, this court should reject Triulzi’s
attempts to re-package the original arguments that were previously
advanced in the Arbitration for the purpose of challenging the Award
on the ground that it was not given a reasonable opportunity to
file an expert report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    For
the reasons above, in my view, the Tribunal’s refusal to vacate
the April hearing dates and to go ahead with the April hearing was
a proper and legitimate case management decision. There is nothing
to the contention that by refusing the application, the Tribunal
denied Triulzi its right to be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    I
would also add that the right of each party to be heard does not mean
that the Tribunal must “sacrifice all efficiency in order to accommodate
unreasonable procedural demands by a party” (see <em>Holtzmann
and Neuhaus</em> at p 551). The Tribunal was entitled to take
“the view that Triulzi have had a chance to inspect the machines”
within the ten days.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Lastly,
I also agree with the observation in the passage from <em>Sugar Australia</em> quoted above (at [125])
that procedural fairness requires only that a party be given “a
reasonable opportunity to present his case” and not that the tribunal
needs to ensure “that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity
to which he is entitled”. Here, the Tribunal did not have to ensure
that Triulzi took the best advantage of the ten days it was given.
It is obvious from the narrative above that it was Triulzi who has
to take the blame for the predicament it faced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision refusing the admission
of Dr Piombo’s Report on 25 April 2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Triulzi’s
contention in this regard is that the Tribunal’s refusal of its application
to admit Dr Piombo’s Report was a breach of natural justice. This
contention is baseless. It is quite clear from the transcripts that Triulzi’s
application to admit Dr Piombo’s Report was made on the last day of
the hearing and that Mr Shum could not satisfy the Tribunal that
there were compelling reasons for his very late application to admit
it. The same points raised previously to persuade the Tribunal to
vacate the April hearing were rehashed to persuade the Tribunal
to admit Dr Piombo’s Report and for the hearing to be part heard.
This was Triulzi’s third attempt to stop the Arbitration having
failed twice to vacate the April hearing in order to buy more time
to obtain expert evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    That
Dr Piombo was not at the hearing to take the stand meant that the
Arbitration must be definitely left part-heard if Dr Piombo’s Report
was admitted at such a late stage of the arbitral proceedings. His
absence was also not explained and his non-attendance was plausibly
viewed as entirely of Triulzi’s own making and quite deliberate.
Besides, there were no compelling arguments to satisfy the Tribunal
that Dr Piombo’s Report had to be admitted on the last day of the
hearing (see [42] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    It
would seem that Triulzi was once again adopting a tactical ploy
to adjourn the hearing. In this regard, the observation made in <em>Analytical Commentary</em> at p 46 is apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[F]ull opportunity of presenting one’s
case” does not entitle a party to obstruct the proceedings by dilatory
tactics and, for example, present any objections, amendments, or
evidence only on the eve of the award.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    It
is difficult to see how, in those circumstances, the Tribunal could
be said to have been deserving of criticism in not admitting Dr
Piombo’s Report. The Tribunal was justified in concluding that the
right course was to go ahead to complete the hearing on 25 April
2013. Taking everything together, Triulzi was indeed seeking to
admit evidence at the last day of the hearing and to have the proceedings
part-heard. As stated, the absence of Dr Piombo at the hearing to
take the stand on 25 April 2013 was not explained. Furthermore,
there was no prior indication at all that Triulzi was still trying
to admit expert evidence long after it failed to persuade the Tribunal
to reconsider vacating the April hearing on 16 April 2013 and after
it had missed the 15 April 2013 deadline for filing its expert witness statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Triulzi’s right
to be heard</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    For
the reasons given above, I reject Triulzi’s criticisms of the conduct of
the Tribunal. Triulzi was not denied a reasonable opportunity to
file an expert witness statement and the Tribunal had also exercised
his case management powers reasonably and properly. I find that
Triulzi’s application to set aside the arbitral award under s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the Model Law must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prejudice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    For
the sake of completeness, I will comment on the issue of prejudice on
the assumption that there was a breach of a natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Triulzi
argues that an expert report which dealt with the environmental
conditions at Xinyi’s facility, Xinyi’s maintenance of the washing
machines and the interpretation of technical terms could have reasonably
made a difference to the Tribunal’s deliberations. I have observed
above (at [147]–[148]) that Triulzi’s contention that it would have dealt
with these issues <em>via</em> its expert
report is premised upon hindsight. Given what was said to the Tribunal
in April 2013, Triulzi was not intending to file an expert report
dealing with these issues at that time. As such, there would consequently
be no impact on the Tribunal’s deliberation since such material
would not even have been present before the Tribunal for its consideration.
Triulzi is therefore unable to show that it suffered any prejudice
even if I had found that there was a breach of natural justice.
Its application to set aside the arbitral award under s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the Model Law would have failed
on this basis as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Breach of public policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    On
Issue 3, Mr Tan submits that the Tribunal was obliged to apply as the
governing law of the contracts the CISG which is an international
treaty that Singapore has signed and ratified. He argues that the
Award which failed to apply the CISG is in conflict with Singapore’s
public policy. I proceed to deal with this final ground of setting
aside raised by Triulzi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    During
the CMC on 11 December 2012, a preliminary issue as to the applicable
law to the three contracts was tabled for determination. According
to the minutes of the CMC, the Tribunal heard oral submissions from
both parties and decided that the governing law for all three contracts was
to be Singapore law. Mr Tan argues that the Tribunal did not apply
the CISG. He did not identify the relevant Articles in the CISG
that ought to have been applied by the Tribunal. I do not follow
Mr Tan’s point that the Tribunal did not apply CISG. First, as I
understand it, there is domestic legislation in the form of the
Sale of Goods (United Nations Convention) Act (Cap 283A, 2013 Rev
Ed) (“International Sale of Goods Act”) giving effect to the CISG
and when the Tribunal decided that the governing law was Singapore
law, the Tribunal would be referring to the common law and statutes
in force in Singapore, including the International Sale of Goods Act.
Secondly, I observe from para [111] of the Award that the Tribunal
had actually made reference to the CISG and, contrary to Mr Tan’s
contention that the Tribunal did not apply the CISG, the Tribunal
applied Art 35 of the CISG as to the requisite burden of proof.
Even if there were other relevant Articles of the CISG that should
have been applied, Mr Tan did not identify them. In any event, even
if the Tribunal did not consider other Articles of the CISG when
it ought to, it has simply made an error of law and an error of
law does not engage the public policy ground in Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law (see <em>PT Asuransi </em><em>Jasa
Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597
(“<em>PT Asuransi</em>”) at [57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I
move on to Triulzi’s other argument that the failure of the Tribunal to
apply the CISG violates Singapore’s policy of upholding international obligations
(since it has ratified the CISG) and should therefore be set aside pursuant
to Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model
Law. Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) allows the court
to set aside the award if “the award is in conflict with the public policy”
of Singapore. In <em>PT Asuransi</em>, the
Court of Appeal explained the operation of this ground of setting
aside at [59]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the concept of public policy of
the State is not defined in the Act or the Model Law, the general
consensus of judicial and expert opinion is that public policy under
the Act encompasses a narrow scope. In our view, it should only
operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award would
“shock the conscience” (see <em>Downer Connect</em> ([58] <em>supra</em>) at [136]), or is “clearly injurious
to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable
and fully informed member of the public” (see <em>Deutsche Schachbau
v Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd</em> [1987] 2 Lloyds’
Rep 246 at 254, <em>per</em> Sir John Donaldson
MR), or where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality
and justice: see <em>Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas
Co Inc v Societe Generale de L’Industrie du Papier (RAKTA)</em> 508
F 2d 969 (2nd Cir, 1974) at 974. This would be consistent with the
concept of public policy that can be ascertained from the preparatory
materials to the Model Law. As was highlighted in the Commission
Report (A/40/17), at para 297 (referred to in <em>A
Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration:
Legislative History and Commentary</em> by Howard M Holtzmann and
Joseph E Neuhaus (Kluwer, 1989) at p 914):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In discussing the term “public policy”,
it was understood that it was not equivalent to the political stance
or international policies of a State but comprised the <em>fundamental notions and principles of justice</em> …
It was understood that the term “public policy”, which was used
in the 1958 New York Convention and many other treaties, covered
fundamental principles of law and justice in substantive as well
as procedural respects. Thus, instances such as <em>corruption,
bribery or fraud</em> and similar serious cases would constitute
a ground for setting aside. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It cannot be said that the Tribunal’s failure to apply the
CISG “would shock the conscience”. It is also neither “clearly injurious
to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable
and fully informed member of the public” nor does it violate Singapore’s
“most basic notion of morality and justice.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Furthermore,
what Triulzi is essentially saying is that upholding the Award amounts
to a breach of Singapore’s international obligations and this has
to fall within the domain of Singapore’s public policy in the wide sense.
But this is contrary to the view of the Court of Appeal in <em>PT Asuransi</em> that “public policy” in Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law refers to Singapore’s
public policy in the narrow sense. Singapore has honoured its obligations
as a signatory to the CISG by passing domestic legislation giving legal
effect to the CISG. It is not surprising that Mr Tan cannot point
to any legal basis that engages Singapore’s international public
policy to require this particular Tribunal or other arbitral tribunals,
private institutions that are not bound by the CISG, to apply the
CISG. Arbitral tribunals are first and foremost bound by the agreement
of the parties which includes the agreed institutional rules. In
this case, Art 21(1) of the ICC Rules 2012 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Article 21:
Applicable Rules of Law</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The parties shall be free to agree
upon the rules of law to be applied by the arbitral tribunal to
the merits of the dispute. <em>In the absence of
any such agreement, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules
of law which it determines to be appropriate</em>. [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Given
that there is no choice of law agreement in any of the three contracts,
it is therefore clearly within the Tribunal’s powers, granted to
it by mutual consent of the parties, to determine Singapore law
to be the governing law of the contract. There is no strict obligation
on the Tribunal to apply the CISG and it is entitled to prefer another
rule of law which it “determines to be appropriate”. Triulzi, by
agreeing to apply the ICC Rules, also agreed to have its dispute
resolved in accordance with this rule of law determined by the Tribunal.
It cannot complain about the rule of law chosen by the Tribunal
even if it disagrees with the Tribunal’s choice since it has agreed
to be bound by the Tribunal’s choice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    For
these reasons, Triulzi’s application to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) also fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    For
the reasons stated, Triulzi’s application in OS 1114/2013 is without
merit and must be refused. Accordingly, OS 1114/2013 is dismissed.
The evidential foundation of Triulzi’s complaints had nothing to do
with conduct of the Tribunal and the predicaments Triulzi faced
were entirely of its own doing. This was clearly reflected in the
way it conducted its case in the Arbitration. In this application,
Triulzi’s characterisation of its case as an award that was not
in accordance with Art 18 in order to engage Art 34(2) of the Model
Law and s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA simply
ignores the evidential foundation of Triulzi’s complaints. Its public
policy argument is no better. Triulzi must bear the consequences
of its own failures and choices (tactical or otherwise) that it
made at the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    I
will hear parties on the costs of OS1114/2013. At the costs hearing, parties
are to address me on whether or not the circumstances of the present
case favour an order for costs to be taxed on an indemnity basis.</p>
