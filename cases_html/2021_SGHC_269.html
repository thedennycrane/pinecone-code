Nevertheless, I will go on to examine the relevant constitutional arguments the appellant has proffered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 9(1) of the Constitution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Article 9(1) of the Constitution states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1129 had held at [14]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before we consider the construction of these words “life or personal liberty”, it is helpful to note two key features of Art 9(1) which are apparent on a plain reading. First, it prohibits the State from unlawfully <span class="font-italic">depriving</span> an individual of his life or personal liberty, but does not impose any duty on the State to take affirmative measures to facilitate or promote a person’s enjoyment of his life and personal liberty. <span class="font-weight-bold">Second, Art 9(1) contemplates that the State may deprive an individual of, or intrude upon, rights that are within the ambit of “life and liberty” but only </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in accordance with law</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> Thus, the provision seeks to ensure that any such deprivations or intrusions are authorised by and comply with “law”. The word “law” includes legislative enactments: Art 2(1) of the Constitution. Therefore, even assuming that a particular right falls within the ambit of the words “life and personal liberty”, that does not preclude Parliament from depriving a person of that right by way of a validly enacted law. In order to challenge such an enactment, a litigant must not only show that it deprives or threatens to deprive him of his right to life and personal liberty; he must go further and establish that the enactment is void and/or inconsistent with another law that takes precedence over it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The burden is on the appellant to show that he has been deprived of liberty in a manner that is inconsistent with legislative enactments. This is so as to ensure that the government acts in accordance with valid laws when depriving a person of life or personal liberty. As was observed in S 1157/2020, the appellant has not pointed to any law or statute which states that he should be granted extra protection as a former informant. Accordingly, the appellant’s arguments that because he was a former informant, he would be deprived of his life and personal liberty without being awarded any protection by the law or protection as promised to him,

</div> Any purported correlation between this promise to allow him to meet his previous handler and the latter stepping into to prevent him from being prosecuted would have been entirely a perception on the appellant’s part.  As has been established in law, self-perceived inducement does not amount to an inducement in law (see at <span class="font-italic">Gulam bin </span><span class="font-italic">Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 498 at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Further, this would also implicitly mean that the appellant had in fact given a truthful statement in the hope that his former handler would make sure he was not charged for the offences. If the appellant had not committed any of the offences and truly believed that no action would be taken against him, why would he have incriminated himself so completely in P5. As such, I am of the view that there was no basis for the appellant’s allegation that he had been induced into providing the statement. Accordingly, I find that the DJ was justified in finding that the appellant’s statement was made voluntarily and admissible. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the DJ correct to find the defences were not credible?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Drug Utensils charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 To recapitulate, the appellant’s defence in relation to the possession of drug utensils charge was that the items had belonged to his roommates. It was not disputed that the items were in fact found in his physical possession upon his arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I agree with the DJ that the appellant has not pointed to any evidence to substantiate his claims that the utensils belonged to his roommates, and he had not called any of them as witness to the trial. In fact, the appellant does not even know the real names of those three alleged roommates of his.

</div> Accordingly, I find that this defence is wholly unsatisfactory.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Drug Consumption Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 There are two prongs to the appellant’s defence on the drug consumption charge. The first is that he might have taken codeine-containing cough medication, and the second that he had passively inhaled smoke from his roommate’s heroin use. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, there is no basis for the appellant to say that just because he has a fanciful explanation for the presence of morphine in his urine that the prosecution came under an obligation to prove that his explanation was false. Once the controlled drug is found in the urine of the appellant, s 22 of the MDA presumes that the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> of consumption are proven, and the burden of proof would fall upon the appellant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he had not consumed a controlled drug in contravention of s 8(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">Vadugaiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Mahendran v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 719 at [24]; <span class="font-italic">Zheng </span><span class="font-italic">Jianxing v Attorney-General</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1100 at [30]). This means that the appellant had to provide sufficient objective evidence and call the relevant witnesses to prove that he had not in fact consumed the drugs that were tested positive from his urine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I first address the expert evidence of Dr Bertino adduced by the appellant in his defence. First, in relation to the cough medication, I found Dr Bertino’s evidence to be unsatisfactory, as he had premised this on the unsubstantiated assumption that the cough medication had contained codeine. Dr Bertino had not analysed the cough syrup, did not have sight of it, and was not even aware of how much cough medication the appellant claimed to have consumed.

</div> He also admitted that he did not know “for certain that it contained codeine”. Second, in relation to the passive inhalation of heroin, Dr Bertino had limited information to reach his tentative conclusion that the presence of morphine could have been due to the inhalation of heroin smoke. Dr Bertino did not know how many other persons were in the flat, the size of the flat, the layout of the flat, or any other details of the appellant’s living arrangements.

</div> When Dr Bertino had sight of the appellant’s evidence that his roommates were smoking cigarette, he agreed that this would not give rise to a positive urine for morphine or codeine. Further, the scientific paper that Dr Bertino sought to rely upon, contained multiple variables which have not been accounted for in the circumstances of the present case, and therefore cannot be accorded any weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Turning next to the substance of the appellant’s cough medication defence, I agree that the appellant’s evidence in this regard is not credible, he alleges to have taken his roommate’s cough mixture but does not recall the amount consumed nor the type of mixture,
