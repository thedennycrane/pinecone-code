Although this application was not made within 28 days of the close of pleadings, which was on 26 September 2018, I granted leave for the plaintiffs to do so. Given that MSD took the position that there was an inadequate opportunity to address the O 14 r 12 issue in the course of the hearing, I granted leave for it to make further arguments. The hearing on 24 January 2019 was then adjourned.

The defendants cited no authority for this proposition. Absent authority, I also could not see any reason, supported by logic or common sense, why the defendants’ submission should be accepted. The defendants did not contend that they were otherwise not amenable to the jurisdiction of the English courts, or that they had not voluntarily submitted to their jurisdiction.

In principle, the same ought to apply even if the local judgment was handed down after the foreign judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Even if I accept the above proposition, this is not a situation where a local judgment has been handed down after the English decisions. At this point of time, no local decisions involving the present subject matter have yet been made. No defences are therefore applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The next requirement is that of identity between the parties in the English decisions and the present case. The defendants made two distinct arguments: first, that there were other parties to the English proceedings that are not present to the Singapore proceedings, and second, that Merck is not the successor company of E.Merck. In the UK Preliminary Decision, Merck brought the action against, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, MSD as well as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. The second and third defendants in the Singapore action, MSD Pharma (Singapore) Pte Ltd and MSD International GmbH (Singapore branch) were <span class="font-italic">not</span> parties to the UK Preliminary Decision. In my view, MSD and Merck &amp; Co., Inc, who are common parties to the present action and the UK Preliminary Decision, are capable of being bound by issue estoppel even if the second and third defendants are not. MSD and Merck &amp; Co., Inc are similarly parties to the UKCA decision and are also capable of being bound by issues decided by that court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Turning to the submission that that Merck is not the successor company to E.Merck, who is the original party to the 1970 Agreement, I do not agree with the defendants on this point. There is evidence that MSD had sued Merck in the United States on the same 1970 Agreement, as well as the holding of the English court in the UKCA decision that Merck is the successor company to E.Merck (see at [3]). In my view, this is sufficient to show that Merck, as the successor company to E.Merck, is party to the 1970 Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The final requirement of identity of issue necessitates careful scrutiny. The defendant did not dispute that the UK Preliminary Decision as having decided that the governing law of the 1970 Agreement and 1975 Letter to be German law. I am satisfied that there is identity of issue in relation to the governing law of the 1970 Agreement and the 1975 Letter in the UK Preliminary Decision and in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The defendants, however, argued that the issue in the UKCA decision was not identical to the issue of breach which was presently being litigated. The main thrust of its objection was that the UKCA decision which held that the use of the word “Merck” on various websites, and consequently constituted breach of the 1970 Agreement, pertained to acts committed <span class="font-italic">in the UK</span>. Accordingly, it submitted that a Singapore court “cannot import the outcome of the UK proceedings which deal with UK-specific acts, and apply that outcome to Singapore-specific acts”.

</div> Over the course of the oral hearings, and through the plaintiffs’ written submissions, it became abundantly clear that that the plaintiffs’ submission on issue estoppel was that the defendants were bound to the UKCA’s decision as to the <span class="font-italic">interpretation </span>of cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement, and not its <span class="font-italic">breach</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As such, I see no merit to the defendants’ argument that simply because the UKCA decision related to wrongful acts, <span class="font-italic">i.e.</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> questions of breach that took place in the UK, there was no identity of issue as to the interpretation of cl 7.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The materials parts of the UKCA decision relied on by Merck are at [198] – [200]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">198. I can deal with this issue relatively shortly because it is not necessary at this stage to consider whether the uses of which complaint is made constituted uses in the UK of the word “Merck” as a trade mark rather than as a corporate, business or trade name. <span class="font-weight-bold">All these uses of the word “Merck” a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">lone are precluded by cl.7.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">199. Further, there can be no doubt that extensive use of the word “Merck” alone has been made in the impugned materials. I will say more about these uses when addressing the claim for infringement of registered trade mark but for present purposes I can summarise the position as follows. The word “Merck” appears repeatedly through the pages on websites and social media, in the materials distributed at conferences and advisory boards (and it was used on slides and in oral presentations), and in the press releases, the agency briefs and the emails, In so far as it was not use of the word as a trade mark, it was use of it as a corporate, business or trade name.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">200. I would also make clear that I am satisfied that the uses of the word “Merck” as part of the addresses of the impugned websites, as part of the name Merck &amp; Co Inc (but without a geographical identifier) or as part of email addresses ending “@merck.com” also fall within the scope of cl.7. In each of these forms of use the word appears without any significant distinguishing matter and in a way which, if used by a party outside its permitted territory, would undermine the purpose of the 1970 Agreement. These uses do not incorporate and are not accompanied by any geographical identifier; nor do they have any distinguishing elements of the kind that are present in the name and mark “Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme”. I am also satisfied they do not fall within the scope of any intentional gap in the agreements such as might arise where there is a real question as to whether the use of a name or mark incorporating the word “Merck” by one party in the territory of the other party would be adequately distinguishable from the names and marks that other party uses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 From the above, I am satisfied that one of the issues decided by the court in the UKCA Decision includes the interpretation of cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement. I do not think that the fact that the court proceeded to consider whether the defendants there committed a breach of cl 7 affects my analysis of whether there is identity of issue. Given that the court decided the use of the word “Merck” alone is in breach of cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement, MSD is bound by this finding of the English court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The defendants also raised various other objections which do not fall neatly within the four conditions as set out in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Sennar (No 2)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The first objection is that the governing law of a contract is an issue to be determined by the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> – in this case, Singapore law – and cannot therefore be subject of an issue estoppel.

</div>
</div>
</div> I am unable to agree. So long as the four requirements as set out by <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Sennar (No 2) </span>are satisfied, I see no reason why the governing law of a contract is an issue which cannot be the subject of an estoppel. The defendant did not explain how any of the <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> Sennar (No 2) </span>requirements were affected by the fact that the issue at hand related to the governing law of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 During the oral hearing on 4 July 2019, the defendants’ counsel also made the point that the court cannot hold that that there is issue estoppel in relation to the interpretation of cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement as the second, third and fourth defendants were not parties to the latter agreement. In my view, this argument made little sense. In the present case, the plaintiffs’ action against the second, third and fourth defendants was for trademark infringement, and not for breach of contract. Thus, it was only against MSD that Merck was suing for breach of the 1970 Agreement. As the issue estoppel objected to by the defendants relates only to the contractual interpretation of cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement, the finding made by the court in the UKCA decision has no bearing on the remaining defendants in the present action. The estoppel is only binding on MSD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The defendants’ third objection is that it would not be fair to make a finding on issue estoppel in relation to cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement, as cll 5 and 6 (which were also the subject of Merck’s claims in breach of contract against MSD) also depended on the interpretation of cl 7. Again, I see no merit to this argument. Even if what the defendants suggested is true, this does not affect the interpretation of cl 7 itself, which is the clause that is the subject of the issue estoppel. I can therefore proceed to make a determination on the issue estoppel relating to cl 7.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The defendants’ final substantive objection centred on the impact of the two Hamburg decisions, case no 327 O 183/16 (“Case 183”) and no 327 O 184/16 (“Case 184”). On 3 May 2019, I granted leave to MSD to adduce evidence of the Hamburg decisions. This was tendered in the second affidavit of James Holston. The defendants submitted that the Hamburg decisions were relevant to the issue of the interpretation of cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement. I do not agree. Case 183 concerns Merck’s claims against MSD and Merck &amp; Co., Inc for trade name and trademark infringement under the German Trade Mark Act and under the German Unfair Competition Act.
