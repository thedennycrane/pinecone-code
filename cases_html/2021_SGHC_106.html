After a trial in the District Court, the District Judge found that it was the appellant who had enlisted the help of Mr Ong Hock Chye (“Ong”) and his thugs to slash the victim’s face (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Hong Liang and Ong Hock </span><span class="font-italic">Chye</span> [2019] SGDC 127 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span><span class="font-italic">DC</span>”) at [78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The District Judge found that the appellant was the mastermind of the conspiracy to grievously hurt the victim, primarily based on the evidence of Mr Lim De Mai Ron (“Ron Lim”) (<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span><span class="font-italic">DC</span> at [55]–[56]). Ron Lim is the appellant’s nephew who worked as a driver in the appellant’s company.

</div>
</div> On the back of Ron Lim’s evidence, the District Judge found a number of material facts which connected the appellant to the conspiracy, including the fact that the appellant, through Ron Lim, paid Ong for the attack on the victim (<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span><span class="font-italic">DC</span> at [56]). The District Judge also found that the appellant had the motive to harm the victim, because the victim was having an affair with the appellant’s mistress, Ms Audrey Chen Ying Fang (“Chen”) (<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span><span class="font-italic">DC</span> at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Accordingly, on 2 April 2019, the District Judge convicted the appellant for an offence under s 326 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment (<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span><span class="font-italic">DC</span> at [79] and [99(i)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedural History</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The matter first came up on appeal against the appellant’s conviction and sentence on 20 January 2020, in Magistrate's Appeal No. 9111 of 2019. At the hearing of the appeal, the Prosecution resisted the disclosure of a police statement made by Edwin Cheong Jia Fong on 13 May 2016 (“Edwin’s Statement”). The District Judge had refused to order the disclosure of Edwin’s Statement, but made, according to the appellant, observations that were adverse to the appellant. The matter was adjourned, pending my consideration of a decision. However, before judgment was given, the Court of Appeal issued its decision in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 1 SLR 984 (“<span class="font-italic">Nabill</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Thereafter, on 16 April 2020, the appellant sought to make further arguments on the basis of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Nabill</span> that there had been a breach of the Prosecution’s disclosure obligations in not releasing Edwin’s Statement. Just as arguments were to be heard on whether there should be disclosure, the Prosecution indicated that it did accept that Edwin’s Statement was disclosable under the disclosure regime in <span class="font-italic">Nabill</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and that it had breached its disclosure obligations under <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>”), and it then disclosed Edwin’s Statement to the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The parties were then at odds about whether Edwin’s Statement could be shown to the court in the Magistrate's Appeal, and this prompted the appellant to file a Criminal Motion on this issue. After hearing arguments, I concluded that the appellant could indeed refer to it in so far as it was to be used for indicating a possible breach of disclosure obligations and the consequences that should flow from such breach, and in so far as it was material to arguments that the conviction was unsafe, and/or that an adverse inference should be drawn due to the non-disclosure; however, I accepted the Prosecution’s arguments that if the statement was to be used as evidence of the truth of its contents, then the proper procedure would have been to have it admitted (<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 5 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span><span class="font-italic">CM</span>”) at [16] and [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Subsequently, the appellant and the Prosecution filed further submissions on 21 September 2020 and 12 October 2020 respectively on the appropriate consequences of the Prosecution’s breach of its disclosure obligations. That led us to the last oral hearing of arguments, following which I concluded that the appropriate course, given the possible effect of Edwin’s Statement on the credibility of Ron Lim’s evidence against the appellant, was that a retrial should be ordered.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reference to CA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The appellant now seeks leave from the Court of Appeal to refer questions of law, pertaining to the effect of the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the appellant’s arguments on the effect of the breach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The appellant argued that in seeking a reversal of his conviction, he only needed to show either that the breach of the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>obligations has rendered his conviction unsafe or that there was a material irregularity, unless the Prosecution could show that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned.

I was of the view that the approach favoured by the appellant did not fully reflect the position that should be taken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 While there may indeed be <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breaches that should lead to an acquittal, a <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach on its own is not a “poison pill” that automatically causes a conviction to be overturned; there must be material irregularity that occasions a failure of justice to justify an acquittal (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [120]; <span class="font-italic">Mia</span> at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In deciding on what the consequences ought to be, specifically whether a <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach should lead to an acquittal or other outcomes such as a retrial, the court should to my mind assess a number of factors including, but probably not limited to:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the effect of the breach on the evidence against the accused;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) how the breach prejudiced the accused;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether steps can be, or have been, taken to remedy the prejudice caused; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the causes of the breach, including the conduct of the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">A balancing exercise weighing these specific factors as well as the broader objectives of the administration of justice, including certainty and fairness, must be undertaken. There must be fairness not only to the accused, but also to the victims, especially when the charge is serious.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 If, upon weighing the above factors, the court comes to a decision that a retrial ought to be the appropriate consequence flowing from a <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach, the appellate court should then assess whether it can exercise its powers under s 390(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) to order a retrial in light of the established principles governing retrials in <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chai Hock v Public Prosecutor </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 112<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Bei Chai Hock</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">AOF</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”). This point will be re-visited in greater detail in the analysis below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 There may be some overlap between the first inquiry of whether the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach should lead to an acquittal or other outcomes such as a retrial, and the second inquiry of whether the ordering of a retrial under s 390(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) CPC would be in line with established authorities. But I hesitate to merge these two inquiries into one. The first inquiry focuses on the nature of the specific <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach: the causes and effect of the breach, including steps to remedy the resulting prejudice. The result of this inquiry may or may not lead to a retrial, and I do not preclude the possibility that there may be other outcomes apart from an acquittal or a retrial. These are not the only two binary options. Upon deciding the outcome that ought to have flowed from a <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach, the second inquiry concentrates on whether the court has the power to bring about that outcome. Certain requirements, either from statute or case law, may have to be satisfied before a court could have the power to grant certain orders. It may be that a particular outcome that ought to have flowed from a <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach could not be made due to the non-satisfaction of certain statutory requirements. This was not the case on the current facts, but the point is that it would be conceptually neater to separate the inquiries of what ought to be the consequences flowing from a particular <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach and whether the court has the power to bring about that outcome.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Discussion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The local authorities do not expressly lay out the consequences of a <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach. In <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>, the Court of Appeal said at [120]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, there is no reason why a failure by the Prosecution to discharge its duty of disclosure in a timely manner should not cause a conviction to be overturned if such an irregularity can be considered to be a material irregularity that occasions a failure of justice, or, put in another way, renders the conviction unsafe (see, also, <span class="font-italic">Lee Yuan Kwang v PP </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 778 at [40]). … It should be pointed out that not all non-disclosures will be attributable to fault on the part of the Prosecution (or a lack of <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>); nevertheless, as pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Lee Ming Tee </span>([88] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [142] (see [89] above), where such non-disclosures result in a conviction being unsafe the result will still be the overturning of that conviction. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal then referred to <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chai Hock </span>on when a retrial should be ordered, which is considered below at [63]. While the Court of Appeal laid down that a material irregularity that occasioned a failure of justice may cause a conviction to be overturned, it did not have to consider the specific circumstances in which such a material irregularity would arise. The actual outcome in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> turned on the evidence of a co-accused as well as the reliability and admissibility of confessions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The obligation to disclose the statement of a material witness, and the possibility of drawing an adverse inference against the Prosecution where the Prosecution failed to call a material witness, were considered in <span class="font-italic">Nabill</span> at [39] and [67] respectively, but that case did not consider the consequences of a <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach in relation to the non-disclosure of a statement. The acquittal in that case flowed from the analysis of the evidence before the court. In <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Teong Boo</span>, the acquittal on appeal was also on the basis of an analysis of the evidence before the court, with one of the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breaches in that case being found to have limited prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The question is when a <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>breach should lead to an acquittal or overturning of a conviction, and when other possible outcomes such as remittal or a retrial should result. While at one end of the spectrum, a determination can be made that a conviction is unsafe or that a failure of justice has occurred, on other occasions, it may be, as in <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Teong Boo</span>, that the prejudice suffered is not substantial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my judgment, an important consideration to my mind is how the non-disclosure affects the rest of the evidence, and consequently, whether the verdict below is supported. Where the non-disclosure is of an important piece of evidence that clearly or even strongly points towards an acquittal, then it is clear that the conviction is unsafe, provided that the evidence is clearly admissible as well. But in many instances, the non-disclosed evidence may fall short of that effect, and has to be weighed against the other evidence: it may help tilt the balance one way or another, requiring a determination by the court, as well as the attendant process of adducing that evidence properly. This was I think presaged in <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>by the Court of Appeal at [120]. In such cases, the conviction cannot be said to be unsafe on the surface, and further deliberation is called for, rather than an immediate acquittal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 This approach bears some resemblance to the principles governing the court’s exclusionary discretion in respect of statements recorded in breach of procedural requirements under the CPC and Police General Orders. Such statements will be excluded where the procedural breach has caused a statement’s prejudicial effect to outweigh its probative value (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [55]). Reliability lies at the heart of this discretion (<span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 557 at [45]–[46]; <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [55]–[56]), which has been regarded as stemming from the court’s inherent jurisdiction to prevent injustice (<span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [52]). It appears then, that there must be a causal link between the procedural breach and the occasion of injustice; and this causal link is established when the procedural breach raises serious concerns about a statement’s reliability, on the premise that written statements taken by the police are often given more weight than other pieces of evidence and can very well lead to wrongful convictions (<span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [58]–[59]). Accordingly, where the procedural breaches in statement recording have little or no bearing on the reliability of the statement, the statement will still be admitted (see examples in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Similarly, there will be a miscarriage of justice where there is a clear causal link between the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach and a wrongful conviction, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the undisclosed material is such an important piece of evidence that, on its own or along with other pieces of evidence before the court, it would have enabled the accused to cast a reasonable doubt if admitted into evidence. However, if it is unclear whether the non-disclosed evidence will have such an effect, the presence of that causal link will be doubtful, such that an immediate acquittal may not be warranted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As a point of clarification, in seeking a reversal of conviction, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the disclosure would have led to an acquittal in the proceedings in the court below. If this can be shown, the conviction will be clearly unsafe. Nonetheless, even if it is unclear how the non-disclosure will impact the evidence before the court, an acquittal may still be in the interest of justice following a holistic consideration of the circumstances and the various factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Such other factors include the impact of the non-disclosure on the accused, which is a material consideration. Where there has been substantial prejudice to the accused, such as in the conduct of his or her defence, it may be in the interests of justice that an acquittal should follow from non-disclosure. There can be a situation where the undisclosed material, on its face, does not clearly point towards an acquittal, but if admitted at trial below, would have opened up a new line of questioning against the sole Prosecution witness, thereby potentially raising a reasonable doubt in that witness’ testimony and hence the Prosecution’s case. Yet, a retrial is out of the question as that Prosecution witness had died in the meantime. In such circumstances, the accused would have effectively lost a good chance to disprove his guilt, and therefore suffer substantial and irremediable prejudice by the Prosecution’s earlier non-disclosure. In such a scenario, it may be in the interests of justice that an acquittal should be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It follows then that the issue of prejudice caused to the accused must be taken alongside the consideration of whether steps can be taken to remedy or rectify the prejudice caused to the accused. In <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Teong Boo</span>, a piece of evidence which would have adversely affected the victim’s credibility was only disclosed to the Defence after the victim had completed her evidence, including her cross-examination (at [133]–[134]). Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal found that the prejudice to the Defence was limited because it was open to the Defence to apply for the victim to be recalled under s 283(1) of the CPC so that she could be questioned on this previously undisclosed evidence (at [135]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The specific factors canvassed in the discussion so far, namely the effect on the evidence, prejudice to the accused as well as remedial steps, relate generally to the effects arising from a particular <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach. These ought to be holistically evaluated in light of the broader concern as to whether the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach has culminated in a miscarriage of justice. If so, the conviction may be overturned (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [85(h)(iii)], citing <span class="font-italic">Ward</span> at 641–642).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Effects of the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach aside, the reason for the breach, specifically the Prosecution’s conduct, can also affect what ought to be the outcome of a <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach. As highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang CM</span> at [24], in seeking a finding that the Prosecution’s non-disclosure is of such a degree that the conviction is rendered unsafe, the Defence may rely on the circumstances surrounding the non-disclosure to indicate misconduct or suppression such as to cast doubt on the integrity of the prosecution process and on the evidence presented below. In establishing this point, the Defence will be relying on the fact that material was undisclosed previously, rather than inferences from, or contents of, the undisclosed evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I do not consider however, that this examination of factors will generally include any punitive or disciplinary element as against the Prosecution. Proof that there is Prosecutorial non-disclosure alone, without showing how that puts the integrity of the prosecution process and the evidence into doubt, will be insufficient to justify an immediate acquittal. It may be that there will be situations where a salutary effect may be desired, through the granting of an acquittal, but these must involve very serious breaches in which the need for a salutary effect trumps the need for proper administration of justice. Such a situation will be very rare since it is not the trial judge’s or appellate court’s function to exercise disciplinary powers over the Prosecution’s conduct of proceedings; there are other avenues to seek redress or achieve that objective. Rather, the judicial system exists to ensure that persons are acquitted or convicted according to law, and for it to operate effectively, those who commit crimes must face the consequences. For that reason, rendering acquittals too readily because of a <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach will ill serve the needs of society, particularly the victims, especially when the crime committed is serious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 All of these various factors, set out at [22] above, must be weighed against each other: the precise facts in each case have to be carefully considered.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate consequence of this Kadar breach</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effect of the undisclosed material on the evidence against the appellant</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Overview</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Applying the approach above to the case before me, the effect of the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach must be considered alongside the other evidence, and I had to determine whether the verdict below was supported. It suffices here to note that the case turned primarily on Ron Lim’s evidence, such that his credit and credibility were of importance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On one side, the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach affected the finding of whether the appellant did speak to the primary prosecution witness, Ron Lim, on a specific occasion. While Edwin’s Statement was not tested in court and the person making the statement was not called as a witness, the Prosecution did point to other evidence that they contend supported the conviction, even if this call between the appellant and Ron Lim (which resulted in the appellant speaking directly to Ong) was disregarded.

</div> As for the change in position concerning the incident on 8 April 2016, the District Judge accepted Ron Lim’s explanation in court that he did not implicate the appellant initially because the appellant promised to pay Ron Lim for keeping quiet (<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang DC </span>at [61]). Notably, the explanations provided for these changes in position yet again banked on Ron Lim’s credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It was clear that Ron Lim was the essential link between the persons committing the actual assault and the appellant, and that the credibility of Ron Lim’s evidence was crucial to the appellant’s conviction. However, Edwin’s Statement potentially showed that Ron Lim was contradicted in material ways. Ron Lim’s evidence was that the appellant had called him when he and Edwin were at Ong’s home,

</div> Yet, on its face, Edwin’s Statement (see above at [15]) showed that the appellant did not contact Ron Lim during the visit at Ong’s home, and that Edwin did not have knowledge of the appellant’s involvement in the incident. Edwin’s Statement should thus be put into evidence, or at least the relevant party would have to be put to the test of bringing it into evidence. In other words, the party who ought to adduce it would have an opportunity to consider whether it should be put into evidence, and if it decided against doing so, the court would have to weigh what the outcome should be, and whether any adverse inference should be drawn against that party. Who should bear this burden would have to be fully canvassed. But if Edwin’s Statement was adduced, then its truth would have to be tested, both as regards its maker and recorder, as well as against the other evidence, including the evidence of Ron Lim, who should be given the opportunity to respond to it. Upon assessing the truth of its contents, there ought to be a consideration of whether and to what extent Edwin’s Statement impacted Ron Lim’s credibility, in light of all the other statements and testimony provided by Ron Lim. All of these considerations pointed to the need for a retrial or remittal. None of these matters could I think be fully considered by an appellate court.

In fact, it was the appellant’s position in this Magistrate’s Appeal that the disclosure of Edwin’s Statement would have led the Defence into calling Edwin as a witness since Edwin would have contradicted the key Prosecution witness, Ron Lim.

</div> As it was, the appellant did not call Edwin as a witness in the trial below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Teong Boo</span> at [131] aptly observed that the Prosecution’s non-disclosure of a piece of evidence could lead the Defence to infer that the undisclosed evidence is either immaterial or even prejudicial to the Defence; this inference then contributes to the calculus upon which the defence strategy is developed. In this case, the possibility could not be ruled out that the Defence, upon inferring that Edwin’s Statement was neutral or adverse to the Defence, refrained from calling Edwin as a witness at the trial below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I was satisfied that the prejudice that the appellant suffered in the conduct of his defence below could be remedied by a retrial. A retrial would afford the appellant a chance that it previously did not have, that is, to consider how its case ought to be shaped and whether it ought to call Edwin as a witness, with the benefit of assessing Edwin’s Statement along with all the other pieces of evidence. The rectification of the prior prejudice via a retrial, would not inflict further undue or unfair prejudice on the appellant (see below at [66]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Indeed, where the prejudice to the accused could be appropriately remedied, as it was in this case, the court should be slow to grant an immediate acquittal. The administration of justice requires the achievement of a just outcome by means of a fair trial, and this requires compliance with disclosure obligations on the part of the Prosecution; but at the same time, in fairness to the victims and for the protection of society, accused persons must also answer for their crimes if it could be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Accused persons ought not be allowed to get off the hook easily due to a <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach, if the prejudice that the accused suffered could be adequately remedied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prosecution’s conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Prosecution explained that the trial team had made a genuine error in assessing that Edwin’s Statement was neutral, in that it neither inculpated nor exculpated the appellant as being involved in the conspiracy, because on its face, Edwin’s Statement indicated that he knew nothing about the incident.

The countervailing principle is one of fairness to the accused person.

Given the centrality of Ron Lim’s credibility to the appellant’s conviction and the fact that Edwin’s Statement, on its face, potentially contradicted Ron Lim’s evidence in material ways, it was not safe to uphold the conviction. Yet, it could not be firmly said that the conviction was unsafe since Edwin’s Statement was not put into evidence and its interaction with other pieces of evidence was unclear. These circumstances fall within what Lord Diplock called the “category three cases”, and a weighing of various factors ought to be carried out to ascertain whether a retrial was warranted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Here, balancing the various factors, I was of the view that a retrial was the most appropriate outcome.

</div> but I did not see that that was of such a nature as to prevent a fair trial being held. I did note that further time would be taken, adding to the lapse of time since the incident in question, which dates back to 2016. The trial was conducted in 2018, with the appeal taking place some time last year because of the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>application. But such a lapse of time would not to my mind give occasion to injustice here. I did not see that a retrial would be inordinately long if properly managed, particularly as the other co-accused, Ong, would not be involved in a retrial as an accused person, though presumably he might be called. Witnesses might not be able to recall the relevant details as vividly, but this would tend to operate to the disadvantage of the Prosecution rather than that of the appellant, especially since the Prosecution here is relying heavily on a key Prosecution witness to recall details that linked the appellant to the conspiracy. There was no indication here of the loss of any other evidence. Importantly, consideration could be given by parties to the evidential effect of Edwin’s Statement and what evidence should be led at the trial on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The issue of taking additional time aside, it could be said that the accused should not be put through a second trial through no fault of his own unless the interests of justice require a retrial. But in this case, with reference to the competing principles highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Bei Chai Hock </span>at [38], the interests of justice did warrant a retrial. This was not a case where the Prosecution failed to prove its case previously such that a retrial would give it a second bite at the cherry (see <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chai Hock</span> at [38]); rather, a retrial would operate in fairness to the accused by restoring to the Defence the opportunity to properly consider the contents of Edwin’s Statement and re-shape its strategy at trial accordingly. Generally, it will also be in the interests of society and victims to ensure that those who are indeed guilty are not pardoned for their crimes due to <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breaches, where there exists an avenue to redress the prior prejudice caused without inflicting further unfair or undue prejudice on the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I had considered that costs would have been incurred through one round of the trial, but that cost consideration cannot override the other factors pointing to the desirability for a retrial, including the seriousness of the charge and the availability of evidence. I noted that whether or not costs can be sought under s 356 CPC for the first trial would have to be considered by the appellant’s legal advisors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As for the question of whom the retrial should be before, it is on occasion permissible to have a retrial before the original judge, provided there has been no finding or conclusion which may raise perceptions of prejudgment. However, the difficulty here was that the original District Judge had already come to a conclusion about Edwin’s Statement, without any justification on the evidence. There would be issues about the fairness of sending this case back to the same District Judge. I was puzzled by the conclusion reached by the District Judge about the nature of Edwin’s Statement. The District Judge came to his conclusion that Edwin’s Statement would likely inculpate the appellant based on what appeared from<span class="font-italic"> </span>Ron Lim’s evidence. I could not see how any such inference could be safely made. Given the weak inference concerning Edwin’s Statement, I did not consider it appropriate to order a retrial by the same District Judge. For the same doubts about fairness, I also did not consider that it was a viable option to have, instead of a retrial, a remittal to the original District Judge just to consider the effect of Edwin’s statement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Finally, there ought to be a retrial of the entire case by a new District Judge. A remittal before a different District Judge only on the narrow issue of Edwin’s Statement alone would, I believe, pose substantial difficulties as it goes to the credibility of Ron Lim, requiring a holistic assessment of his statements and testimony.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For these reasons, I made an order for a retrial before a different District Judge under s 390(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) CPC. I had, however, asked parties to attend before the Assistant Registrar for a Case Management Conference so that they can inform the court whether any criminal reference would be pursued, and obtain the consequential case management directions.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Narayanan Sreenivasan SC and Partheban s/o Pandiyan (K&amp;L Gates</div><div class="txt-body text-right">Straits Law LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="txt-body text-right">Lee Lit Cheng and Li Yihong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the</div><div class="txt-body text-right">respondent.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
