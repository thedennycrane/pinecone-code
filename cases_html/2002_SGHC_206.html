</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font color="#800000"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1.

        This is an appeal by the plaintiff against my

order granting the defendant’s application for orders under section 175 of the

Evidence Act to be issued to Bangkok Bank Ltd, ABN Amro Bank, Citibank N.A. and

Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. The second and third banks were represented by counsel

at the hearing, but did not take part in the arguments. The other two banks were not

represented although they were also served with the application.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        The defendant is a bank, and the plaintiff was

a customer of the bank. The plaintiff engaged in foreign exchange transactions through the

bank and incurred substantial losses. He commenced this action against the defendant for

fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, breach of contractual duty of care, breach of

duty in tort, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, mandate or instructions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        He alleged that he was not properly advised by

the defendant’s officers on the transactions that he made and in particular, that

they did not advise him on "swap points" that may be imposed. The defendant

however, asserted in its defence that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(T)he plaintiff has shown himself

    to be an experienced and/or sophisticated investor in the foreign exchange market who

    understood that the concept of "swap points" as reflecting the interest rates

    differential between US$ and the MYR for a given period and would have been aware that the

    trading of the 12-month forward hedge was affected by "swap points".<sup>1</sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        The plaintiff on the other hand maintained that

his experience was in investments in equities.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        Consequently, the defendant applied that the

plaintiff gives discovery under Order 24 of the Rules of Court of "(a)ll documents,

including without limitation, any and all statements, correspondence, confirmation notes,

confirmation advice, facility letters and documents of any other description whatsoever,

showing the date, nature and value of all Transactions effected by or on behalf of the

Plaintiff through the following entities for the period January 1987 to December

1997" with the first three of the aforenamed banks and with "(a)ny other bank

and/or financial institution and/or financial intermediary and/or brokerage and/or any

similar entity, whether situate in Singapore or elsewhere in the world." The

transactions were defined as "(a)ll investments in and/or purchase and/or sale of

listed and unlisted securities, bonds, mutual funds, unit trusts, options, futures

contracts, currencies, commodities, derivatives and/or investments and financial

instruments of any other description whatsoever."</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        The application was heard in the first instance

by an Assistant Registrar on 15 Feb 2002. The application was opposed by the plaintiff.

After hearing counsel for both parties the Assistant Registrar granted the application.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        The plaintiff appealed against this order. When

the appeal came for hearing before me the matters and issues including the relevance of

the documents were comprehensively addressed in the course of arguments on 26 and 27 Feb.

After hearing and considering the merits of the submissions, I dismissed the appeal. The

plaintiff did not appeal against my decision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        However, he did not give discovery of the

documents. He deposed in an affidavit on 5 March that the documents were not in his

possession, custody or power and he was unable to locate them despite extensive efforts

because they had been moved to different premises on four occasions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        The defendant then sought to get the same

records from the banks. It applied for and served writs of subpoenas on the Bangkok Bank

Ltd, ABN Amro Bank, Citibank N.A. and Development Bank of Singapore Ltd for them to

produce the documents.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        The ABN Amro Bank was concerned that compliance

with the subpoena may breach the obligation of confidentiality under section 47 of the

Banking Act. It applied by summons-in-chambers No. 920 of 2002P for a determination

whether it was precluded by s 47 from complying with the subpoena.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        When the application came on for hearing before

me on 29 April, counsel for the defendant submitted that s 175 of the Evidence Act

operated as an exception to s 47. I directed that the defendant apply under s 175 for the

bank to make the disclosures.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        In compliance with the direction, the defendant

filed summons-in-chambers No. 1595/2002/F that the four banks allow the defendant’s

solicitors to inspect and take copies of the documents pursuant to s 175 from the same

documents covered by the order of court of 15 Feb.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        While writing these grounds of decision, it

occurred to me that the plaintiff may not have done enough to get those documents. Even if

he did not have those documents with him, the banks would have them, and he could get them

from the banks.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        I refer to <i>Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co

Ltd</i> [1980] 1 WLR 627, a decision of the House of Lords. In this case, the plaintiff

Lonrho wanted discovery of documents in the possession of the defendant Shell

Petroleum’s subsidiary companies in Rhodesia and South Africa. The subsidiary

companies refused to disclose the documents on the grounds that they cannot do that

without ministerial licence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        The question was raised whether the documents

were in Shell Petroleum’s power for the purposes of O.24 of the Rules of the Supreme

Court, which is similar to O.24 of our Rules of Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        Lord Diplock who delivered the judgment of the

court stated at p 635 </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(I)n the context of the phrase

    "possession, custody or power" the expression "power" must, in my

    view, mean a presently enforceable legal right to obtain from whoever actually holds the

    document inspection of it without the need to obtain the consent of anyone else. Provided

    that the right is presently enforceable, the fact that for physical reasons it may not be

    possible for the person entitled to it to obtain immediate inspection would not prevent

    the document from being within his power; but in the absence of a presently enforceable

    right there is, in my view, nothing in Order 24 to compel a party.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">and held that the documents were

not in Shell Petroleum’s power because Shell Petroleum could not have access without

the ministerial licence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        In the present case, the plaintiff, as a

customer or former customer of the banks, would have a right to the documents, subject to

the payment of copying and other related charges.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        In the event the plaintiff who did not take

steps to get the documents from the banks opposed the defendant’s efforts to get them

from the same source.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The provisions in question</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        Section 47(1) and (2) of the Banking Act

provide that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

    may be specified in the third column of that Schedule.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        The Schedule provided that disclosure can be

made when "[It] is necessary for compliance with an order of the Supreme Court or a

97)."<sup>3</sup></font></p>

    compliance with Part IV of the Evidence Act.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The defendant’s submissions</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        Mr Hri Kumar counsel for the defendant stated

that the documents sought under this application were the same documents in the Assistant

Registrar’s order of 15 Feb which I affirmed on 27 Feb.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        He submitted that the issue of the relevance of

the documents had been dealt with then, and the only issue left to be dealt with is

whether the court has the power to order the banks to give discovery of the documents. He

argued that the court has the power because s 47 allows banks to comply with orders issued

under s 175. He contended further that the documents referred to were bankers’ books

under s 175.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The application is not in

compliance with Part IV of the Evidence Act</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        The plaintiff submitted that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is plain as night follows day

    that the Writs of Subpoena referred to in the Schedule in SIC 1595 are not "court

    orders" made pursuant to said s.174. In short, the Writs of Subpoena are of no legal

    effect whatsoever as they do not come within purview of the legal requirements as

    aforesaid and therefore the present SIC 1595 must fail <i>in limine.<sup>4</sup></i></font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        The schedule in summons-in-chambers No. 1595 of

2002 does not refer to any writs of subpoena.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        The defendant had caused the subpoenas to be

issued before making the present application. It then filed the application when it

realised that an order under s 175 may be necessary before a bank can comply with the

subpoenas.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        The plaintiff has misunderstood the

application. The defendant was not proceeding on the basis that a subpoena is a court

order. It was seeking a court order to ensure that a bank will not contravene with s 47 if

it complied with the subpoena.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The application is made in bad

faith and is a fishing expedition</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.

        The defendant had at the outset stated that it

wanted to have access to the documents. It applied for and obtained an order for discovery

and inspection despite the plaintiff’s objections.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.

        The issue of the relevance of the documents to

the proceedings was determined in that application. The defendant then sought from the

banks the same documents that the plaintiff should have supplied. There is no basis for

impugning bad faith on the application.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The application is made for the

collateral and improper purpose of seeking the court’s sanction to violate s 47<sup>5</sup></font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.

        The plaintiff submitted that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(T)he Plaintiff has categorically

    stated in his Affidavit that his "bank accounts are not relevant to the issue of

    ‘swap points’ in a forward foreign exchange contract".</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the circumstances, it is

    evident that the present application is also a reckless attempt by the Defendants to

    "get behind the affidavit" of the Plaintiff and so eschew one of the essential

    safeguards provided under Part IV section 175 of the Evidence Act.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.

        The defendant does not have to accept the

plaintiff’s averment on the bank accounts. It is entitled to apply to court to have

discovery of them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.

        The plaintiff’s complaint that the

defendant was seeking the court’s sanction to violate s 47 has no substance shorn of

the emotional hyperbole. A court will not sanction any violation of the law. Section 47 is

not violated when an order of court under s 175 is obtained. A court will not make an

order without careful consideration, but there is no violation of s 47 when an order is

made. The plaintiff, on the other hand asserts that he has lost possession of the

documents for which he was ordered to give discovery, but he would not obtain them from

the banks himself, and seeks to prevent the defendant from getting them from the banks

directly.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The documents are not necessary

within Order 24 r 7 of the Rules of Court</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.

        This was an issue in the application for

discovery and inspection. It was argued before the Assistant Registrar and on appeal,

before me. There being no further appeal, it has been determined conclusively that those

documents are relevant to the action.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The documents in the application

are not bankers’ books</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.

        The plaintiff submitted that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facts as presented … by

    the bank’s senior legal officer, casts the drag net far and wide to include letters

    from the Plaintiff to the Bank and vice versa including contracts of all shapes and form

    so to speak. The expression ‘bankers’ books’ has to be interpreted

    "ejusdem generis" with the other documents listed. It is, therefore, submitted

    that, correspondence, confirmation notes, confirmation advice and facility letters cannot

    be considered as being of the same genre as <i>ledgers, day books, cash books and account

    books</i>. The documents required by the Defendant are not book entries in the ordinary

    meaning intended by the Act and, consequently, they are as different as a mouthful of

    chalk and cheese.<sup>7</sup></font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.

        The plaintiff referred to <i>Williams v

Williams </i>[1988] 1 QB 161 which dealt with an application to inspect unsorted cheques

and paying-in slips in the possession of a bank. He quoted Sir John Donaldson M.R.’s

judgment where he stated at page 168</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I am quite unable to accept that

    adding an individual cheque or paying-in slip can be regarded as making an

    "ledgers, day books, cash books and account books" and unsorted bundles of

    cheques and paying-in slips are not "other records" within the meaning of the

    Act.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Relying on this, he submitted

that "if cheques and paying-in slips do not come within the meaning of

    books. Whilst I would be prepared to accept that the cheques constitute part of the

    bank’s records used in the ordinary business of the bank (<i>Reg. v. Jones (Benjamin</i>)

    [1978] 1 W.L.R. 195, a case concerned with a bill of lading put in evidence under the

    Criminal Evidence Act 1965), I am quite unable to accept that adding an individual cheque

        In the same light the documents referred to in

the application are not unsorted documents. Correspondence, confirmation notes,

confirmation advice and facility letters are documents a bank would file and keep in the

course of its ordinary business. It is necessary for a bank to maintain such records, and

to refer to from time to time, for example, to ensure that facilities are not exceeded or

that instructions are carried out. Such records are bankers’ books even if they are

not in use every day, so long as they are referred to when necessary – see <i>The

Asylum for Idiots v Handysides</i> (1906) 22 TLR 573. None of the banks served with the

application have stated that they do not keep such records. In any event it is open to the

banks to object or seek clarification on any document if any dispute or uncertainty should

arise whether it forms part of a banker’s book.</font></p>
