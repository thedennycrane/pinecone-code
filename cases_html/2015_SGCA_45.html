        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Judges and lawyers, when speaking of Mareva
                    injunctions, often allude to the famous description of them as one of the
                    “nuclear weapons” of civil litigation: <em>Bank
                        Mellat v Nikpour</em> [1985] FSR 87 at 92 <em>per</em> Donaldson LJ (as he then was). A worldwide Mareva
                    injunction is that and even more. The reach of such an injunction, stretching
                    far beyond the geographical confines of the jurisdiction of the court making the
                    order, is such that it can have a crippling effect on those against whom it is
                    directed. This underscores the need to scrutinise the basis for such an
                    injunction with utmost care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Even the English courts, which, in 1975, had
                    been the first to articulate the court’s power to grant Mareva injunctions
                    (see <em>Nippon Yusen Kaisha v Karageorgis and another</em>
                    [1975] 1 WLR 1093 at 1095 <em>per</em>
                    Lord Denning MR), for some time resisted extending the exercise of
                    that power to assets worldwide (see <em>Ashtiani and another v
                        Kashi</em> [1987] 1 QB 888 at 899F–899G and 900G–902B
                        <em>per</em> Dillon LJ). The English Court of
                    Appeal departed from this only in 1988 in a trilogy of judgments handed down
                    within just over a month of each other, namely: <em>Babanaft
                        International Co SA v Bassatne and another</em> [1990] 1 Ch 13;
                        <em>Republic of Haiti and others v Duvalier and
                        others</em> [1990] 1 QB 202 (“<em>Republic
                        of Haiti v Duvalier</em>”); and <em>Derby &amp;
                        Co Ltd and others v Weldon and others (No 1)</em> [1990]
                    1 Ch 49 (“<em>Derby v Weldon
                    (No 1)</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Lawrence Collins, writing before his elevation
                    to the bench, described this trilogy of cases as the English Court of
                    Appeal’s response to the widespread abolition of exchange controls and the
                    growth of offshore tax havens for cash and securities. These developments, he
                    said, “made it easier for defaulters involved in international business
                    to make themselves judgment proof, and for dishonest fiduciaries to enjoy the
                    illegal fruits of breaches of trust”: “The Territorial Reach of
                    Mareva Injunctions” (1989) 105 LQR 262 at p 262.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The present case concerns two appeals brought by
                    three well-heeled appellants against the refusal of a High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”) to set aside worldwide Mareva injunctions and
                    ancillary disclosure orders that she had earlier made <em>ex
                        parte</em> against them. The appellants are involved in international
                    business and operate through companies, some of which are incorporated in
                    offshore tax havens. The respondents’ claims against the appellants
                    include allegations that the latter were fraudulent or had dishonestly breached
                    their fiduciary duties. The sums involved are also sizeable. The cumulative
                    value of the assets subject to the worldwide Mareva injunctions is
                    US$1.1bn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The central question in these appeals is whether
                    it has been sufficiently shown that there is a real risk that the appellants
                    will dissipate their assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated
                    judgment of the court. This requirement lies at the heart of the court’s
                    power to grant Mareva injunctions. In our judgment, the respondents have failed
                    to establish that risk. For this and other reasons, which we elaborate on below,
                    we allow both appeals and set aside the Mareva injunctions as well as the
                    ancillary disclosure orders made against the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellants in Civil Appeal No 80 of
                    2015 are Yves Charles Edgar Bouvier and MEI Invest Limited (“MEI
                    Invest”). Mr Bouvier is a Swiss businessman who runs an art-related
                    transport and storage business. He also invests and deals in art. He resides in
                    Singapore and holds a Singapore permanent residency. Mr Bouvier has control
                    over and often acts through MEI Invest, a company incorporated in the Hong Kong
                    Special Administrative Region. He also holds substantial shareholdings in
                    companies across multiple jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands
                    (“BVI”), Seychelles and the Isle of Man.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The appellant in Civil Appeal No 81 of 2015
                    is Tania Rappo. She plays a subsidiary part in the dispute between the parties.
                    She resides in Monaco and holds dual Swiss and Bulgarian citizenships. Her
                    assets appear to be located predominantly in Monaco and are held in the names of
                    Monegasque companies. Her assets are managed by asset management agencies in
                    Monaco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The respondents in both appeals are Accent
                    Delight International Ltd (“Accent Delight”) and Xitrans Finance
                    Ltd (“Xitrans Finance”). Both are BVI companies owned wholly by
                    the family trusts of a well-known Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev. The
                    trusts are constituted under Cypriot law. The respondents appear to be
                    controlled by Mr Rybolovlev, or at the very least, have issued powers of
                    attorney for Mr Rybolovlev to act on their behalf. Mr Rybolovlev
                    resides in Monaco. He was previously resident in Switzerland until
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outline of the dispute between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The dispute between the parties arises out of
                    the respondents’ acquisition of 38 art masterpieces between 2003 and 2014.
                    These are highly-prized pieces and include the works of Picasso, van Gogh, da
                    Vinci, Modigliani and Rothko. All the acquisitions were arranged (to use a
                    neutral term) by Mr Bouvier, who was responsible for locating and obtaining
                    the artworks that the respondents wished to purchase. Mr Bouvier in turn
                    acted through either MEI Invest (which was the case for most of the 38
                    acquisitions) or one of his associated companies. As it is not necessary to
                    distinguish between MEI Invest and these associated companies for the purposes
                    of the present appeals, we shall, for ease of narration, refer solely to MEI
                    Invest as the corporate vehicle which Mr Bouvier used in respect of the
                    acquisition of the 38 artworks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The respondents contend that unbeknownst to
                    them until late 2014, when it came to light, Mr Bouvier had secured these
                    artworks at prices that were considerably less than those at which he told the
                    respondents he had secured them. The nub of the dispute between Mr Bouvier
                    and the respondents comes down to the capacity in which Mr Bouvier was
                    acting when he arranged the respondents’ acquisitions. Was Mr Bouvier
                    acting as an <em>agent</em> who negotiated for and obtained
                    the target artworks on behalf of the respondents, and who therefore owed the
                    latter fiduciary duties? Or was Mr Bouvier acting as an <em>independent seller</em> transacting at arm’s length with the
                    respondents, such that he was entitled to sell the artworks to the respondents
                    at the highest price he thought they would pay?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     This dispute as to the true nature of the
                    relationship between Mr Bouvier and the respondents is the subject of Suit
                    No 236 of 2015 (“the Singapore action”), in which the
                    respondents are the plaintiffs and the appellants are the defendants. The
                    worldwide Mareva injunctions and ancillary disclosure orders mentioned at [4]
                    above were obtained by the respondents in support of the claims which they make
                    in that suit. The appellants have separately applied for a stay of the Singapore
                    action on the ground of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> or
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em>. These applications are
                    pending and have been fixed to be heard by a High Court judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We will begin by tracing the relationship
                    between Mr Bouvier and the respondents, which will set the context for
                    their dispute. Next, we will set out the history of the litigation between the
                    parties. It began in Monaco and eventually found its way to Singapore. The
                    respondents also appear to have commenced related proceedings in France and Hong
                    Kong. We will then consider the orders that were made in the court below by the
                    Judge before explaining our decision in these appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The acquisition of the 38 artworks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Mr Rybolovlev began collecting art in the
                    early part of this century. He was introduced to Mr Bouvier in 2003 by
                    Mrs Rappo on Mr Bouvier’s request. Mrs Rappo was a close
                    family friend of the Rybolovlevs and is the godmother of one of
                    Mr Rybolovlev’s children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     From the time of their introduction in 2003,
                    Mr Bouvier played a critical role in helping Mr Rybolovlev build his
                    private art collection. The 38 artworks which the latter acquired (using the
                    respondents as his corporate vehicles) were all purchased through
                    Mr Bouvier (acting through MEI Invest). These transactions appear to have
                    followed a common pattern. Once Mr Rybolovlev confirmed his interest in a
                    particular artwork, Mr Bouvier would locate it and try to persuade the
                    owner to agree to sell it. The paperwork suggested that the artwork would be
                    purchased by MEI Invest from the original owner; MEI Invest would then issue a
                    sales invoice to either of the respondents for the purchase price. Once MEI
                    Invest received payment, it would deliver the artwork to the respondents. The
                    respondents paid Mr Bouvier a sum equivalent to 2% of the value of the
                    artwork on each transaction that he arranged. The respondents say that this was
                    a commission and was the extent of the profit that Mr Bouvier was entitled
                    to earn on each transaction. Mr Bouvier, however, says that this was only
                    an administrative fee paid to cover expenses such as shipment, storage and other
                    miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As a result of the way in which the
                    transactions were arranged, the respondents acquired the 38 artworks from MEI
                    Invest without knowing the identity of the original sellers from whom MEI Invest
                    had obtained the artworks. Mr Bouvier was the only person whom the
                    respondents dealt with. It appears that Mr Rybolovlev decided to make all
                    his acquisitions through Mr Bouvier because it was more convenient than
                    sourcing for each piece separately through multiple dealers. The only difference
                    in the way the transactions were arranged over the years is that the earlier few
                    were documented in formal written contracts between MEI Invest as the seller and
                    the respondent concerned as the buyer, and these appear to have been
                    specifically negotiated. This gave way to more informal dealings through emails
                    and invoices that served to document the transactions, and this came to
                    characterise all the transactions subsequent to 2007 or 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is not clear whether the acquisitions over
                    the years were initiated by Mr Bouvier or Mr Rybolovlev.
                    Mr Bouvier paints Mr Rybolovlev as an art aficionado who had definite
                    ideas as to what he liked and formed his own opinions as to which masterpieces
                    he wished to acquire. Mr Bouvier claims that it was always
                    Mr Rybolovlev who gave instructions as to the artworks he wished to
                    purchase. The respondents, on the other hand, say that the spark for their
                    acquisitions invariably came from Mr Bouvier. On their version of the
                    events, Mr Bouvier would inform Mr Rybolovlev or his principal
                    intermediary, Mikhail Anatolievitch Sazonov, of the opportunity to acquire
                    artworks whenever this arose. Mr Bouvier would also advise
                    Mr Rybolovlev and Mr Sazonov as to the approximate value of the
                    artwork in question and the price at which it could be obtained. We digress to
                    mention that Mr Sazonov is a business associate of Mr Rybolovlev. He
                    is employed by the Rybolovlev family trusts and was the sole director of Xitrans
                    Finance, the second respondent in these appeals, until 2009. Mr Sazonov was
                    the main representative of the respondents in their dealings with
                    Mr Bouvier. This was because both Mr Sazonov and Mr Bouvier were
                    conversant in English and French, whereas Mr Rybolovlev spoke only Russian.
                    Mr Sazonov affirmed the affidavits that were filed on behalf of the
                    respondents in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On either version of the facts,
                    Mr Bouvier’s role in the acquisition of the 38 artworks was a crucial
                    one. It appears that buyers and sellers of art masterpieces prize secrecy and
                    discretion, and as a result, masterpieces usually change hands in discreet
                    private sales, presumably so that the wealth of the parties concerned will not
                    be made public. But, this also means that the ownership of many of these
                    paintings is opaque. Mr Bouvier was able to locate the target artworks,
                    identify their owners and make the acquisitions concerned due to his extensive
                    network of contacts in the international art market. The respondents say that
                    this climate of secrecy and discretion was the reason why they never had any
                    direct dealings with the original sellers of the artworks, and why the
                    acquisitions were routed through MEI Invest. This also protected
                    Mr Rybolovlev’s privacy as the ultimate purchaser of these
                    artworks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Bouvier’s contacts arose from
                    his well-established business conducted through the Natural Le Coultre group of
                    companies, which specialises in the storage, packing and shipping of artworks.
                    Natural Le Coultre operates out of the Geneva “freeport”, which is
                    a secure and confidential facility used by the wealthy to store expensive
                    artworks, fine wines and other luxury items. Mr Bouvier is credited with
                    having successfully transplanted the freeport model from Geneva to Singapore and
                    Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev fall out with each other </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev fell
                    out with each other in late 2014. They disagree over how this came to
                    pass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Bouvier says that in September 2014,
                    Mr Rybolovlev ran into financial difficulties following his divorce
                    settlement and was unable to finance the purchase of a Rothko, <em>No 6 (Violet, vert et rouge)</em>. The purchase of that
                    artwork was the last acquisition that Mr Bouvier arranged for the
                    respondents. MEI Invest did not receive the full purchase price of €140m from
                    Accent Delight, and so did not deliver the masterpiece to the respondents. This
                    apparently upset Mr Rybolovlev, and caused his relationship with
                    Mr Bouvier to sour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The respondents, on the other hand, say that
                    Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev fell out with each other when the latter
                    discovered that Mr Bouvier had been fraudulently inflating the prices of
                    artworks that he had acquired for and on behalf of the respondents. On
                    31 December 2014, Mr Rybolovlev apparently found out that a Modigliani
                    which Accent Delight had obtained through Mr Bouvier in January 2012 for
                    US$118m had in fact been sold by the original seller for only US$93.5m. This
                    meant that MEI Invest had sold the painting to Accent Delight at more than
                    US$24m in excess of the price that it had paid for the painting.
                    Mr Rybolovlev claims that he discovered this at a meeting which he had with
                    an art expert, Sanford Heller, on 31 December 2014. Mr Heller was the
                    art dealer representing the original seller of the Modigliani in that
                    transaction, and he therefore knew the price at which it had in fact been sold.
                    Sometime in late 2014, Mr Rybolovlev also discovered that the respondents
                    had fallen for a similar ruse in respect of a da Vinci, <em>Le Christ comme Salvator Mundi</em> (“<em>Salvator Mundi</em>”), which had been bought through
                    Mr Bouvier in May 2013. Accent Delight paid MEI Invest US$127.5m for the
                    painting, which MEI Invest had obtained from the original seller for a sum of
                    between US$75m and US$80m. According to the respondents, this is what led to the
                    breakdown of Mr Rybolovlev’s relationship with
                    Mr Bouvier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The respondents say that by selling the
                    paintings at undisclosed mark-ups, Mr Bouvier had breached the fiduciary
                    duties which he owed them as their agent. Mr Bouvier, they say, was in
                    Mr Rybolovlev’s “inner circle” and was someone whom
                    Mr Rybolovlev and the respondents trusted. Mr Bouvier negotiated the
                    price of the paintings on the respondents’ behalf and was not entitled to
                    profit from the transactions beyond the 2% commission that he was paid by the
                    respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The respondents also allege that
                    Mr Bouvier’s “fraud [or] deceit is not limited to [these two
                    paintings] but extends to all, or many of, the other paintings which [the
                    respondents] purchased through him”. We shall refer to the mark-ups that
                    Mr Bouvier imposed as “the Excess Payments”. The Excess
                    Payments are said to amount in total to around US$1bn. In the Singapore action,
                    the respondents make personal claims against Mr Bouvier and MEI Invest for
                    breach of fiduciary duties and dishonest assistance respectively. There are also
                    conspiracy claims against both Mr Bouvier and MEI Invest. The respondents
                    alternatively assert a proprietary interest in the Excess Payments and their
                    traceable proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Bouvier does not dispute having
                    received the Excess Payments. His position is that he was perfectly entitled to
                    receive those payments. Mr Bouvier denies having acted as the
                    respondents’ agent. According to him, the transactions between MEI Invest
                    and the respondents took place on a “willing buyer-willing seller
                    basis”, with the respondents as the purchasers and MEI Invest as the
                    seller. Mr Bouvier, through MEI Invest, would acquire any artwork that
                    Mr Rybolovlev expressed sufficient interest in. Mr Bouvier would bear
                    all the “risks of the acquisition” of the artwork from the
                    original seller. If Mr Rybolovlev eventually decided not to purchase the
                    artwork or if there were defaults in the payment obligations to Mr Bouvier,
                    then Mr Bouvier would be solely and wholly liable to the original seller
                    for the artwork. Mr Bouvier therefore says that he was entitled to sell the
                    artworks to the respondents at any price which he wanted to. The respondents
                    obtained the masterpieces, which were precisely what they wanted, and these were
                    all transacted at the prices they had agreed to pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mrs Rappo’s involvement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mrs Rappo was drawn into the dispute
                    because she received payments from Mr Bouvier upon the completion of each
                    acquisition that Mr Bouvier arranged with or for the respondents.
                    Mrs Rappo is alleged to have received tens of millions of euros from
                    Mr Bouvier in this way. The respondents say that Mrs Rappo
                    “must have known what Mr Bouvier [was] up to”. They also
                    suggest that she deliberately concealed from the Rybolovlevs the fact that she
                    was receiving payments from Mr Bouvier. In the Singapore action, the
                    respondents make personal claims against Mrs Rappo for knowing receipt and
                    conspiracy. They assert, alternatively, a proprietary interest in the payments
                    made by Mr Bouvier to Mrs Rappo out of the Excess Payments and their
                    traceable proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr Bouvier and Mrs Rappo do not deny
                    having, respectively, made and received these payments. However, they say that
                    these payments were innocuous. Mr Bouvier’s position is that he paid
                    Mrs Rappo because he considered her to be a “business
                    finder”. She had a good relationship with Mr Rybolovlev and could
                    have influenced Mr Rybolovlev away from transacting with Mr Bouvier if
                    she had wanted to. As for Mrs Rappo, she says that the payments were to be
                    seen as a “commercial arrangement” and represented a
                    “finder’s fee” that Mr Bouvier paid her. As far as she
                    was aware, the payment of such fees was a regular practice in the art world. She
                    had never actively concealed the fact of these payments from the Rybolovlevs. On
                    the other hand, she never considered that she was under any obligation to inform
                    them of the payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proceedings in Monaco</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     These events eventually culminated in the
                    respondents filing a criminal complaint against Mr Bouvier “and any
                    participant” in the Principality of Monaco on 9 January 2015 for
                    fraud and complicity in money laundering. The criminal complaint set in motion a
                    chain of investigative and judicial proceedings in Monaco. The Monaco
                    authorities commenced initial investigations into the complaint on
                    12 January 2015. This in turn led to Mrs Rappo being investigated for
                    money laundering on the basis that she was a “participant” in
                    Mr Bouvier’s activities. On 24 February 2015, the Monaco Public
                    Prosecutor’s Office requested the appointment of an investigating judge
                    and also requested the investigating judge to initiate proceedings against
                    Mr Bouvier and Mrs Rappo. It appears that during this period up to the
                    time of their subsequent arrest, Mr Bouvier and Mrs Rappo were not
                    aware of the criminal complaint or the investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Bouvier was arrested by the Monaco
                    police in a sting operation on 25 February 2015 at
                    Mr Rybolovlev’s Monaco residence. Mr Rybolovlev had invited
                    Mr Bouvier to his home under the pretext of discussing business. The Monaco
                    police lay in wait at Mr Rybolovlev’s residence and arrested
                    Mr Bouvier when he arrived. Mr Bouvier was detained for questioning
                    for three days, and was only released on 28 February 2015 on bail of €10m
                    and with reporting conditions. Mrs Rappo was also arrested by the Monaco
                    police and brought before an investigating judge for questioning on
                    25 February 2015. She was similarly detained for three days, and was
                    released from police custody on 28 February 2015 with reporting conditions.
                    The Monaco authorities have frozen Mrs Rappo’s bank accounts in
                    Monaco in the wake of the proceedings there.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proceedings in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 12 March 2015, the respondents
                    commenced the Singapore action and simultaneously applied <em>ex
                        parte</em> to the Singapore High Court for Mareva injunctions and
                    ancillary disclosure orders against the appellants. This was a little less than
                    two weeks after Mr Bouvier and Mrs Rappo had been released from
                    detention in Monaco. The appellants were not given notice of either the
                    application or the hearing. On the same day (<em>ie</em>,
                    12 March 2015), the Judge granted the Mareva injunctions and the ancillary
                    disclosure orders sought. She also gave leave for the court papers to be served
                    either out of jurisdiction or through substituted means. In addition, orders
                    were made for the delivery up of the Rothko, <em>No 6
                        (Violet, vert et rouge)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The worldwide Mareva injunctions against
                    Mr Bouvier, MEI Invest and Mrs Rappo prevented them from disposing or
                    dealing with any of their assets in Singapore or worldwide up to the sums of
                    US$500m (in respect of each of Mr Bouvier and MEI Invest) and US$100m (in
                    Mrs Rappo’s case) respectively. There were also orders requiring them
                    to disclose their assets worldwide and other documents relating to the subject
                    matter of the parties’ dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Bouvier, MEI Invest and Mrs Rappo
                    applied to set aside the Mareva injunctions and the ancillary disclosure orders.
                    Their applications (“the appellants’ setting-aside
                    applications”) were heard <em>inter partes</em> by
                    the Judge on 25 March, 6–8 and 10 April 2015. The Judge did not
                    set aside either the Mareva injunctions or the ancillary disclosure orders, but
                    attenuated them. Among other things, the carve-outs built into the Mareva
                    injunctions for Mr Bouvier’s and Mrs Rappo’s ordinary
                    expenses were increased to €50,000 per month. Exceptions were also made for the
                    payment of the legal fees of the appellants’ solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In addition, the scope of the ancillary
                    disclosure orders was pared down and conditions were imposed on the disclosure
                    of information. These conditions were put in place to meet the appellants’
                    concern that the respondents would make public the disclosed information or use
                    it for improper purposes. The ancillary disclosure orders were made conditional
                    on an undertaking by the respondents’ solicitors that the affidavits filed
                    pursuant to those orders would be disclosed only to them (<em>ie</em>, the respondents’ solicitors) and no one else unless
                    leave from the court was obtained. These conditions prevented the disclosed
                    information from being released to even the respondents or their foreign
                    lawyers, except for Ms Tetiana Bersheda, the respondents’ Swiss
                    lawyer who was at that time (and currently is still) instructing their Singapore
                    solicitors. The Judge also ordered the respondents to fortify their undertaking
                    as to damages by providing a banker’s guarantee in the sum of
                    US$20m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is against these orders that
                    Mr Bouvier, MEI Invest and Mrs Rappo have appealed. We did not have
                    the benefit of a reasoned judgment from the Judge because of the expedition with
                    which these appeals were brought and heard. We were nonetheless assisted by the
                    Judge’s comprehensive notes of the arguments made at the <em>inter partes</em> hearing of the appellants’
                    setting-aside applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Two broad issues arise for our consideration.
                    The first is whether the requirements for the grant of Mareva relief have been
                    satisfied. The second is whether we should alternatively grant interlocutory
                    proprietary injunctions to prevent the appellants from dealing with the Excess
                    Payments and their traceable proceeds pending the resolution of the dispute. In
                    respect of the latter, we note that the summons which the respondents filed in
                    the court below in applying for the Mareva injunctions did not include a prayer
                    for interlocutory proprietary injunctions. The respondents, nonetheless,
                    presented arguments on such injunctions before the Judge, although ultimately,
                    no orders were made on it. Each of the two broad issues we have just outlined in
                    turn raises subsidiary factual and legal issues. We will elaborate on these
                    subsidiary issues together with the parties’ submissions in the course of
                    our analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Bouvier and MEI Invest were jointly
                    represented in the court below as well as in these appeals. As their positions
                    are aligned, we will use Mr Bouvier as shorthand for both unless it is
                    necessary to distinguish between them. Thus, when we refer to the
                    respondents’ claims and the Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier, we
                    include their claims and the Mareva injunction against MEI Invest; references to
                    Mr Bouvier’s assets include MEI Invest’s assets; and so on.
                    This is purely for the sake of convenience, and is not the result of a finding
                    that there is no separate personality between them. Also before us were two
                    applications by Mrs Rappo. One was for the introduction of further evidence
                    on appeal, which the respondents consented to. The other was for a stay, pending
                    the resolution of these appeals, of the disclosure orders made against her by
                    the Judge, which she has yet to comply with. We make no order on the latter
                    application since it has become academic in the light of our decision to allow
                    these appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the requirements for the grant of Mareva relief have been
                satisfied</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The requirements for the grant of Mareva
                    relief are well established. Two are relevant to these appeals, namely:
                    (a) a good arguable case on the merits of the plaintiff’s claim; and
                    (b) a real risk that the defendant will dissipate his assets to frustrate
                    the enforcement of an anticipated judgment of the court (referred to hereafter
                    as a “real risk of dissipation” for short where appropriate to the
                    context). A good arguable case is one which is “more than barely capable
                    of serious argument, but not necessarily one which the judge considers would
                    have a better than 50 per cent chance of success”: <em>Ninemia Maritime Corporation v Trave Schiffahrtgesellschaft
                        GmbH</em> [1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 600 at 605 <em>per</em> Mustill J. In respect of a real risk of
                    dissipation, there must be some “solid evidence” to demonstrate
                    the risk, and not just bare assertions to that effect: <em>Guan
                        Chong Cocoa Manufacturer Sdn Bhd v Pratiwi Shipping SA</em> [2003]

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Worldwide Mareva injunctions have rightly been
                    said to be exceptional, but the same rationale and test informs the grant of a
                    Mareva injunction, whether over assets within the jurisdiction or over assets
                    without. Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR put it this way in <em>Derby &amp; Co Ltd and others v Weldon and others (Nos 3 and
                        4)</em> [1990] 1 Ch 65 at 79D–79F:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he key requirement for any <em>Mareva</em> injunction, <em>whether or not it
                            extends to foreign assets</em>, is that it shall accord with the
                        rationale upon which <em>Mareva</em> relief has been
                        based in the past. That rationale, legitimate purpose and fundamental
                        principle I have already stated, namely, that no court should permit a
                        defendant to take action designed to frustrate subsequent orders of the
                        court. If for the achievement of this purpose it is <em>necessary</em> to make orders concerning foreign assets, such
                        orders should be made, subject, of course, to ordinary principles of
                        international law. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>While the legal test for a worldwide Mareva injunction may be
                        the same as that for a Mareva injunction over assets within the
                        jurisdiction, the circumstances that will have to be established in order to
                        cross the threshold of necessity will likely be more exacting where a
                        worldwide Mareva injunction is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The appellants challenge the satisfaction of
                    both requirements set out at [36] above. For reasons that will become apparent,
                    we are unimpressed by their arguments that there is no good arguable case on the
                    merits of the respondents’ claims against them. The main focus at the
                    hearing of these appeals was, instead, on the real risk of dissipation. We will
                    address, first, the arguments made by Mr Bouvier and then the arguments
                    made by Mrs Rappo, because they engage somewhat different factual
                    considerations. We should also add that the analysis at [39]–[142] below
                    proceeds on the assumption that Singapore law governs the respondents’
                    claims as that is the basis on which the arguments were presented to us. We are
                    nonetheless aware that there are cogent arguments that Swiss law should govern
                    the respondents’ claims instead. These arguments on the applicable law are
                    touched on in greater detail in the context of our analysis of the
                    respondents’ alternative request for interlocutory proprietary
                    injunctions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arguments by Mr Bouvier </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mr Bouvier says that there is no real
                    risk of dissipation in his case for three main reasons. The first is his
                    international standing. He runs a successful, well-established and reputable
                    business that operates in multiple countries. Second, Mr Bouvier relies on
                    his punctilious compliance with the asset disclosures ordered by the Judge.
                    This, he contends, evinces his intention to “participate fully in [the]
                    proceedings and to clear his name [through] the legal process”. Third,
                    Mr Bouvier says that a good arguable case of dishonesty is by itself
                    insufficient to give rise to a real risk of dissipation. He argues that the High
                    Court decision of <em>Spectramed Pte Ltd v Lek Puay
                        Puay</em> [2010] SGHC 112 (“<em>Spectramed</em>”) is wrong. <em>Spectramed</em> is a decision which, on one reading, appears to
                    obviate the requirement of showing a real risk of dissipation once the court is
                    satisfied that a good arguable case of dishonesty or unconscionability on the
                    defendant’s part has been established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The respondents advance the contrary position,
                    also in three parts. First, they contend that they have established a good
                    arguable case of dishonesty against Mr Bouvier, in that he perpetrated the
                    sophisticated fraud which lies at the heart of their claims in the Singapore
                    action. This alone warrants an inference of a real risk of dissipation. The
                    respondents say that <em>Spectramed</em> is consistent with
                    authority and does “no more than apply the general principles”
                    pertaining to Mareva injunctions. Second, the respondents highlight that
                    Mr Bouvier is a sophisticated international businessman who is capable of
                    moving about large sums of money globally. In this regard, the respondents point
                    to his shareholdings in companies across multiple jurisdictions. Third, the
                    respondents argue that Mr Bouvier has been untruthful in his asset
                    disclosures. This contributes to the degree of risk of dissipation by
                    Mr Bouvier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In our judgment, the Mareva injunction against
                    Mr Bouvier should be discharged, and we arrive at this conclusion for these
                    reasons. We accept that the respondents have established a good arguable case of
                    dishonesty against Mr Bouvier, but it cannot be put higher than that. And
                    it is insufficient to stop there. Rather, it is necessary to go further and
                    inquire into the nature of the dishonesty that is alleged. As we see it, the
                    nature of the dishonesty that is alleged against Mr Bouvier is not such
                    that it can in itself fairly ground an inference of a real risk of dissipation.
                    We are also not persuaded that the bare fact that Mr Bouvier operates
                    through companies internationally is on its own relevant. The combined effect of
                    these points is that the respondents have failed to establish a real risk that
                    Mr Bouvier will dissipate his assets. We deal with these points in the two
                    sections that follow (<em>ie</em>, [44]–[97]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We also find that the respondents’
                    argument predicated on Mr Bouvier’s asset disclosures is wrong in
                    principle and is, in any event, unconvincing. We deal with this argument in the
                    third section that follows (<em>ie</em>, [98]–[106]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The final reason why we discharge the Mareva
                    injunction against Mr Bouvier is that it was an abuse of the court’s
                    process, and we deal with this point in the fourth and final section (at
                    [107]–[130] below) of our analysis of Mr Bouvier’s
                    arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Good arguable case but no higher</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We mentioned at [10] above that the nub of the
                    dispute between Mr Bouvier and the respondents turns on the
                    characterisation of their relationship. The question is whether it was an
                    agent-principal relationship or a principal-to-principal relationship. There is
                    email correspondence which very strongly favours the former characterisation.
                    But, in our view, the circumstances of the transactions concerned as a whole
                    cast doubt on such a characterisation. While the respondents assert, and we
                    agree, that their claims against Mr Bouvier cross the threshold of a good
                    arguable case, there remain too many gaps in the evidence to put it any higher
                    than that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In support of the agent-principal
                    characterisation, counsel for the respondents, Mr Alvin Yeo SC, took
                    the court through numerous emails between Mr Bouvier and Mr Sazonov.
                    These were communications between them in which they discussed the price and
                    payment terms for the artworks, as well as the negotiating strategy that would
                    be adopted when dealing with the original owners. We agree with Mr Yeo that
                    the email correspondence appears damning and does suggest that Mr Bouvier
                    presented himself to Mr Rybolovlev and Mr Sazonov as though he was
                    negotiating on the respondents’ behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In this regard, there is no trace in the email
                    correspondence of Mr Bouvier (or, for that matter, MEI Invest) being
                    addressed as the “sellers”. Instead, references to the
                    “sellers” are consistently to third parties whose identities were
                    not known to the respondents. There were numerous instances where
                    Mr Bouvier held himself out as negotiating for the respondents with the
                    “sellers”. Mr Bouvier invariably also sought authorisation
                    from Mr Rybolovlev, through Mr Sazonov, as to the maximum permitted
                    price at which he could deal before he met with the “sellers”.
                    Mr Bouvier, on most occasions, described to Mr Sazonov the negotiation
                    strategy which he intended to employ in order to coax the
                    “sellers” to bring down the prices of the artworks for the
                    respondents’ benefit. The complexion of the email correspondence as a
                    whole strongly suggests that Mr Bouvier was acting as an agent of the
                    respondents and was negotiating for the artworks on their behalf. It is thus
                    consistent with the agent-principal relationship that the respondents are
                    contending for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The respondents’ characterisation of the
                    relationship between themselves and Mr Bouvier is that it was one built
                    entirely on trust. There was no written agency agreement between them because
                    they were prepared to work on the basis of a standing informal oral agreement.
                    Among the essential terms of that agreement was one that they would pay
                    Mr Bouvier a 2% commission for each transaction that he arranged. They and
                    Mr Rybolovlev relied solely and entirely on Mr Bouvier for advice on
                    which paintings to purchase and for how much. In short, they had complete
                    confidence in Mr Bouvier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     However, the email correspondence, which we
                    have referred to and which seems to corroborate the respondents’ version
                    of what transpired, presents at most a partial view of the entire factual
                    landscape that is relevant to this dispute; and when the dealings are viewed in
                    their totality, other aspects of them raise questions that hint at dealings on a
                    principal-to-principal basis, or at the very least, that Mr Rybolovlev and
                    the respondents were aware of and thus acquiesced in the profit which
                    Mr Bouvier was making on the transactions concerned. Three points stand out
                    in particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     First, it is at least doubtful, even if not
                    wholly incredible, that the respondents genuinely believed that the remuneration
                    for Mr Bouvier’s services was limited to the 2% fee that the
                    respondents plainly knew they were paying him. There is a dispute over whether
                    that amount represented a commission or payment for administrative and other
                    related services. Both sides claim that there is documentary evidence in support
                    of their respective positions. But, putting that dispute aside, it was urged
                    upon us by Mr Bouvier’s counsel, Mr Edwin Tong SC, that the
                    2% commission, if that was indeed the entirety of Mr Bouvier’s
                    return, would have been an implausibly slim margin for the expertise, experience
                    and value that Mr Bouvier had to bring to bear in order to source and then
                    secure the target artworks that Mr Rybolovlev was seeking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     There was evidence before the court which
                    indicated that art houses such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s typically
                    charged a buyer’s premium that was upwards of 20% for art auctions. The
                    exact percentage varied according to the price at which the particular piece was
                    sold. Mr Bouvier also told the Monaco authorities that it was
                    “impossible” and “unimaginable” that
                    Mr Rybolovlev could think he (Mr Bouvier) was not making money from
                    the transactions. According to Mr Bouvier, Mr Rybolovlev “knows
                    the market practices, he knows the rates of the sales houses”. If that
                    was the case, then in the absence of any other explanation, it seemed to us
                    improbable that the respondents could reasonably have thought that
                    Mr Bouvier, who was acting for them to source specific artworks, negotiate
                    the price, secure the artworks and then make them available to the respondents,
                    would limit his takings to the 2% payment that was made on these
                    transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Second, the respondents’ account of
                    their discovery of Mr Bouvier’s fraud in late 2014 leaves a number of
                    unanswered questions as to the true characterisation of the relationship between
                    Mr Bouvier and the respondents. This point will require us to delve
                    somewhat deeply into the events surrounding the respondents’ purchase of
                    the da Vinci, <em>Salvator Mundi</em>, which was made
                    through Mr Bouvier in May 2013 (and which we have alluded to at [21]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The respondents purchased <em>Salvator Mundi</em> on 3 May 2013 for US$127.5m. About a year
                    later, on 3 March 2014, the <em>New York Times</em>
                    reported that <em>Salvator Mundi</em> “was bought by
                    an unidentified collector for between <em>$75 million and $80
                        million in May 2013</em>, in a private sale” [emphasis added].
                    This article (“the NYT article”) is of considerable significance.
                    Had Mr Rybolovlev read the article, then in the absence of any compelling
                    explanation, he must have known that it was describing <em>his</em> purchase of <em>Salvator Mundi</em>.
                    The NYT article pinpointed the painting as well as the month of the transaction
                    through which the respondents purchased the painting. But, there was one jarring
                    discrepancy: the price that the respondents paid was about US$50m in excess of
                    the amount reported by the <em>New York
                Times</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The evidence is unclear as to when the NYT
                    article actually came to Mr Rybolovlev’s attention, although it was
                    common ground that he became aware of it at some stage before the end of 2014.
                    Mr Rybolovlev told the Monaco authorities that he read it when an
                    associate, Yuri Bogdanov, showed it to him “[s]ome time later”
                    after the respondents had purchased <em>Salvator
                    Mundi</em>. What is clear is that Mr Rybolovlev brought up the NYT
                    article and its reference to <em>Salvator Mundi</em> at a
                    meeting with Mr Bouvier in Monaco on 22 November 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     At that meeting, it does not appear that there
                    was any serious argument or disagreement between Mr Rybolovlev and
                    Mr Bouvier. The statements which Mr Rybolovlev gave to the Monaco
                    authorities suggest that he was more concerned with the possibility of having
                    overpaid for some of the artworks which he had acquired than the possibility of
                    having been defrauded. He cited a Modigliani sculpture that he had purchased
                    through Mr Bouvier which “sold at auction below the acquisition
                    price”. This is also consistent with Mr Bouvier’s statements
                    that when Mr Rybolovlev brought up the NYT article, Mr Rybolovlev
                    expressed his concern over whether the respondents had purchased <em>Salvator Mundi</em> at “too high a price”. But,
                    it did not go further than that. Mr Rybolovlev did not think it necessary
                    to inquire further into the purchase of <em>Salvator
                        Mundi</em> or press Mr Bouvier for written proof of the amount
                    that he had paid the original seller for the painting. It appears that
                    Mr Bouvier was able to assuage Mr Rybolovlev’s concerns by
                    explaining that the art market at that time was “very difficult”.
                    Mr Bouvier told Mr Rybolovlev that “the Russians are no longer
                    buying, the stock markets are weak, the Greek crisis is here, there is also the
                    fall in oil prices, and the market in China has yet to be created”. At
                    the meeting on 22 November 2014, Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev
                    also discussed other matters, including the financing for the purchase of the
                    Rothko, <em>No 6 (Violet, vert et
                rouge)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is notable, in this connection, that after
                    the 22 November 2014 meeting, business continued as usual between the
                    parties. There was upbeat correspondence between Mr Bouvier and
                    Mr Sazonov in mid- and late December 2014 discussing the respondents’
                    purchase of <em>No 6 (Violet, vert et rouge)</em>. The
                    exchanges were convivial and nothing appeared out of the ordinary; indeed, one
                    of the email threads was titled “Re: How are things going?
                    :-)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     On the respondents’ version of the
                    events, the relationship between Mr Rybolovlev and Mr Bouvier only
                    broke down on or after 31 December 2014, when Mr Rybolovlev met
                    Mr Heller and discovered that he had overpaid for a Modigliani (see [21]
                    above). Mr Yeo argued that the conversation between Mr Rybolovlev and
                    Mr Bouvier on 22 November 2014 marked only the beginning of suspicions that
                    took shape and eventually developed into a deep sense of betrayal, resulting in
                    an irretrievable fissure by the end of that year. It was therefore not unusual
                    that business carried on as usual after the 22 November 2014 meeting. As
                    Mr Yeo put it, a relationship of trust that had been built up over many
                    years did not simply “fall off a cliff”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     With great respect, we find it impossible to
                    accept this account of the events. If the characterisation of the relationship
                    between Mr Bouvier and the respondents is as the latter suggest,
                    Mr Rybolovlev could not possibly have been satisfied by <em>any</em> explanation of the market value of <em>Salvator Mundi</em> that Mr Bouvier might have given at or after
                    the 22 November 2014 meeting. This is all the more so because based on
                    Mr Bogdanov’s statements to the Monaco authorities, there were
                    already “some doubts [about Mr Bouvier] in <em>September or October 2014</em>” [emphasis added]. If that was
                    true, then the discovery (assuming this was the first time Mr Rybolovlev found
                    out) in November 2014 that there was a gulf of approximately US$50m between the
                    price which the respondents had paid for <em>Salvator
                        Mundi</em> and the reported selling price of that painting could not
                    possibly be explained away on the basis of a residual sense of
                trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On the respondents’ version of the
                    facts, the question in Mr Rybolovlev’s mind at the 22 November
                    2014 meeting could not have been whether he had overpaid for <em>Salvator Mundi</em> by reference to its market value. The foremost
                    – indeed, the <em>only</em> – question on
                    Mr Rybolovlev’s mind must have been whether and, if so, how he had
                    been cheated by Mr Bouvier. Mr Bouvier would not have been able to
                    give <em>any</em> convincing explanation of this marked
                    price differential when he was confronted with these facts by Mr Rybolovlev
                    at the 22 November 2014 meeting. Significantly, there is nothing in the
                    evidence to suggest that Mr Bouvier tried to deny the accuracy of the NYT
                    article or any of the details contained therein. This seems almost impossible to
                    reconcile with the notion that the respondents and Mr Rybolovlev all
                    thought that Mr Bouvier was purely the fiduciary agent of the respondents
                    earning nothing but the 2% “commission”. Moreover, it seems to us
                    inexplicable that business between the parties could carry on as usual after the
                    22 November 2014 meeting if the respondents’ version is
                    accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     We accept that we should not wade into the
                    merits in a case such as this, which is very much at an interlocutory stage.
                    But, we have examined the underlying evidence on the characterisation of the
                    relationship between Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev in some detail
                    because whereas the emails that we referred to at [45]–[46] above seem to
                    weigh strongly in favour of the respondents’ agent-principal
                    characterisation, this aspect of the case seems to weigh just as strongly in the
                    opposite direction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The third and final reason why we consider
                    that the respondents do no more than cross the threshold of a good arguable case
                    is that the early transactions between the respondents and Mr Bouvier, at
                    least, do not appear to have rested on a relationship built solely on trust. It
                    will be recalled that Mr Bouvier was introduced to Mr Rybolovlev in
                    2003. The first of the 38 artworks that the respondents purchased through
                    Mr Bouvier was a van Gogh on 26 August 2003. There is no documentation
                    of that transaction in the evidence. But, the next three transactions, which
                    involved, respectively, a Picasso (on 4 November 2004), a Modigliani (on
                    10 April 2006) and another Picasso (on 25 October 2006), were all
                    documented with formal contracts. For each of these transactions, the
                    respondents sent the contracts to their Swiss lawyers, Lenz &amp; Staehelin
                    (Switzerland’s largest law firm), for comment and review before they were
                    concluded. The email correspondence between Mr Bouvier and Mr Sazonov
                    in relation to these transactions was cordial and polite, but reserved. The
                    fifth to seventh transactions were for, respectively, two pieces of furniture
                    (one on 2 March 2007 and the other, on 10 July 2007) and a Modigliani
                    sculpture (on 25 October 2007). These transactions were documented by
                    invoices, and there is little correspondence relating to them in the
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It was only in the correspondence for the
                    eighth transaction (dated 21 December 2007) for a Modigliani and onward
                    that Mr Bouvier began to employ language which suggested that he was
                    negotiating as the agent for the respondents. Even then, the email
                    correspondence relating to that transaction was warm, but not yet informal. The
                    relationship between Mr Bouvier and the respondents was therefore not a
                    uniform one. If the relationship had started on one footing, then there would
                    have to be some explanation as to how that changed. However, no evidence was put
                    before the court to explain this. The respondents’ position before us was
                    simply that the relationship between Mr Bouvier and the respondents was a
                    fiduciary one that was built on trust from the outset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     We recognise that seven artworks are but a
                    fraction of the 38 artworks which the respondents purchased through
                    Mr Bouvier. But, these concerns add up. Together, they bring home the point
                    that at the interlocutory stage, the court must tread cautiously. It must not
                    treat allegations of dishonesty as established. This is not a case where the
                    uncontroverted documentary evidence is so firmly in the respondents’
                    favour that the court can comfortably descend into the merits and conclude that
                    Mr Bouvier was dishonest, and then assess on this basis whether his
                    dishonesty suggests a real risk of dissipation. There yet remain inflections in
                    the narrative and gaps in the plot, which will have to be filled in due course.
                    All that can be said at this stage is that there is a good arguable case of
                    dishonesty on Mr Bouvier’s part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dishonesty and a real risk of dissipation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The respondents argue that the court may infer
                    a real risk of dissipation just from the fact that a good arguable case of
                    dishonesty has been put forward against Mr Bouvier. The argument is
                    grounded in part on the following passage in <em>Spectramed</em> at [19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the cases cited above, it is clear that allegations of dishonesty are
                        relevant to the issue of whether there is a risk of dissipation of assets.
                            <em>If there is a good arguable case in support of an
                            allegation that </em><b><em>the defendant has acted
                            fraudulently, dishonestly or unconscionably</em></b>, <em>it is</em><b><em> unnecessary for there to
                            be any further specific evidence on risk of dissipation
                            </em></b><em>for the court to be entitled to take the
                            view that there is a sufficient risk to justify granting Mareva

                            Injunctions and Anton Piller Relief</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        4th ed, 1998 … at 198). [original emphasis in italics; emphasis
                        added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>We refer to this as “the <em>Spectramed</em> proviso”. It appears to obviate the need
                        to <em>separately</em> establish a real risk of
                        dissipation once a good arguable case of dishonesty against the defendant
                        has been established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Chan Seng Onn J
                    (“Chan J”), who decided <em>Spectramed</em>, cited two cases in support of this proviso. The
                    first was his own earlier decision in <em>Multi-Code Electronics
                        Electronic Industries (M) Bhd and another v Toh Chun Toh Gordon and
                        others</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1000 (“<em>Multi-Code Electronics</em>”), and the second, the decision of
                    the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <em>Patterson v BTR
                        Engineering (Aust) Ltd and others</em> (1989) 18 NSWLR 319
                        (“<em>Patterson v BTR Engineering</em>”).
                    Chan J also referred to the monograph by Steven Gee QC, <em>Mareva Injunctions and Anton Piller Relief</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 4th Ed, 1998), which makes a statement (at p 198) to a
                    similar effect. The same passage from <em>Mareva Injunctions and
                        Anton Piller Relief</em> had been cited with approval in the earlier
                    decision of the Singapore High Court in <em>OCM Opportunities
                        Fund II, LP and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and
                        others</em> [2004] SGHC 115 (“<em>OCM
                        Opportunities</em>”) at [73], where it was said to be
                    “trite law” that “an appropriate case of risk of
                    dissipation is made out, evidentially, where there is a good arguable case of
                    fraud”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In our judgment, the <em>Spectramed</em> proviso goes too far. An allegation of dishonesty
                    cannot obviate the need to establish a real risk of dissipation. This conclusion
                    stands on three planks. The first is a matter of common sense. The fact that a
                    defendant might be crooked does not in and of itself establish that there is
                    therefore a real risk that he will bury his spoils to defeat a judgment that may
                    in due course be rendered against him. The <em>Spectramed</em> proviso fails to distinguish between a defendant
                    against whom a plausible allegation of dishonesty is made but who may turn out
                    otherwise after defending the suit, and one who might be motivated by the
                    pending litigation against him to behave even more dishonestly. Moreover,
                    dishonest conduct can come in different shades and hues. The <em>Spectramed</em> proviso fails to distinguish between different types
                    of dishonest conduct, some of which might more readily support an inference of a
                    real risk of dissipation than others. To take an obvious example, it seem to us
                    wrong in principle to treat a case where there is really no dispute that a grave
                    fraud has been committed with the defendant’s involvement, leaving only
                    the precise nature of his role to be determined, in precisely the same way as a
                    case where there may or may not have been fraud or dishonest conduct on the
                    defendant’s part at all, that being a matter which can only be determined
                    at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     This leads us to our second point, which is
                    that it is incorrect for the court to treat allegations of dishonesty made at an
                    interlocutory stage as if they have already been established. Such allegations
                    may eventually be refuted. As a matter of principle therefore, the grant of
                    Mareva relief should not generally be <em>wholly</em>
                    founded upon an unproven allegation of dishonesty. This does not mean that the
                    evidence provided in support of an allegation of dishonesty is irrelevant. But,
                    the objection from principle dictates that the existence of a real risk of
                    dissipation must be assessed <em>independently</em> from
                    the prospect of the plaintiff’s eventual success (or failure) in
                    establishing an allegation of dishonesty. This point was made by Chan Sek
                    Keong J (as he then was) in <em>European Grain &amp;
                        Shipping Ltd v Compania Naviera Euro-Asia SA and others (CN Jaya SA,
                        intervener)</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 445 (“<em>European Grain</em>”) at [21], where he refused to consider
                    allegations of fraud directed at a defendant when determining whether there was
                    a real risk of dissipation. <em>European Grain</em> was not
                    considered by the court in either <em>Spectramed</em> or
                        <em>OCM Opportunities</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Third, the <em>Spectramed</em> proviso is not borne out by either the case law cited
                    in support of it or the larger body of jurisprudence dealing with Mareva
                    injunctions. The fifth edition of Steven Gee’s monograph on Mareva
                    injunctions and Anton Piller relief, which was renamed <em>Commercial Injunctions</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2004),
                    pulls back (at para 12.040) from the absolute position that the fourth
                    edition of the work (<em>ie</em>, <em>Mareva
                        Injunctions and Anton Piller Relief</em> (cited earlier at [64]
                    above)) took. <em>Commercial Injunctions</em> does not
                    appear to have been drawn at all to the court’s attention in <em>Spectramed</em>, and it had not been published yet when
                        <em>OCM Opportunities</em> was decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     We will discuss decisions from Singapore as
                    well as other jurisdictions in terms of how they weigh in on this third point.
                    Many of these decisions were raised either in counsel’s written
                    submissions or in the oral arguments before us. We summarise our detailed
                    observations on the relationship between allegations of dishonesty and a real
                    risk of dissipation at [93]–[94] below. Following that, at [95]–[97]
                    below, we examine the facts before us against the backdrop of our review of the
                    jurisprudence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It will be evident from what we have said that
                    our case law has not taken a uniform approach to whether and, if so, when
                    allegations of dishonesty may in themselves ground an inference of a real risk
                    of dissipation. In <em>European Grain</em>, the plaintiff
                    charterers brought claims against a defendant shipowner for, among other things,
                    damages for breach of a charterparty. The plaintiffs argued that there was a
                    real risk of dissipation because: (a) the defendant was a Panamanian
                    trading company with little or no assets to its name and a small market
                    capitalisation; (b) the defendant had not been forthcoming with its
                    financial records; and (c) the defendant was dishonest and was being sued
                    for fraudulent conspiracy in a separate pending suit. Chan Sek Keong J
                    disagreed with the plaintiffs and discharged the Mareva injunction that they had
                    obtained <em>ex parte</em>. He pointed out that the fact
                    that the defendant was a Panamanian one-ship company was not at all unusual. The
                    defendant had also been candid in its compliance with the asset disclosures that
                    were ordered as ancillaries to the Mareva injunction. As for the allegation of
                    dishonesty, this was given short shrift, as we have already noted (see [66]
                    above). In our judgment, it was material that in <em>European
                        Grain</em>, no allegation of dishonesty was made in the action in
                    which the injunction was sought. Rather, the allegation of dishonesty was the
                    subject of a separate, and as yet unconcluded, suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In <em>OCM
                        Opportunities</em>, the plaintiff investors brought claims against the
                    first to eleventh defendants for fraudulent misrepresentations. The
                    misrepresentations allegedly induced the plaintiffs to invest in sophisticated
                    financial instruments issued by the seventh and eighth defendants. The
                    misrepresentations were said to include the following, amongst others:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     Third-party receivables were
                        reflected in the seventh defendant’s financial statements when they
                        were actually owed by parties related to or controlled by the first
                        defendant’s family.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     Fictitious transactions were entered in the seventh
                        defendant’s accounts with the intent that they should create the
                        appearance of genuine commercial sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_c"></a>(c)     The invested funds were not channelled into the
                        seventh defendant’s expansion plans as represented. They were instead
                        diverted to illegal logging activities, and the proceeds from those
                        activities were channelled back to the fourteenth and fifteenth
                        defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The defendants
                        “categorically denied any wrongdoing”, and alleged that the
                        plaintiffs’ losses were no more than investment losses incurred in the
                        distressed debt market: <em>OCM Opportunities</em> at
                        [20]. The judge refused to discharge the Mareva injunctions which had
                        earlier been granted to the plaintiffs because she thought that a good
                        arguable case of fraud had been made out, and that was
                        “evidentially” sufficient to establish a real risk of
                        dissipation: <em>OCM Opportunities</em> at [73]. It
                        seems to us that the judge may have been swayed by the passage in the fourth
                        edition of Steven Gee’s monograph (<em>viz</em>,
                            <em>Mareva Injunctions and Anton Piller
                        Relief</em>), but, as we have noted, this was later revised in the
                        next edition (<em>viz</em>, <em>Commercial Injunctions</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In <em>Multi-Code
                        Electronics</em>, the plaintiff companies alleged that their assets
                    had been misappropriated by the first and second defendants. The first defendant
                    was the managing director of the first plaintiff and a director of the second
                    plaintiff. The second defendant was a director of the second plaintiff.
                    Together, they allegedly caused the plaintiffs to make unauthorised payments
                    totalling about RM44m out of the plaintiffs’ accounts. The plaintiffs
                    asserted on affidavit that these payments were made against forged or fictitious
                    documents. This was not disputed by the defendants: <em>Multi-Code Electronics</em> at [11]. The plaintiffs sought and
                    obtained <em>ex parte</em> Mareva injunctions against the
                    first and fourth defendants, amongst others. Chan J refused to discharge
                    the Mareva injunctions. He said, after a close examination of the documents,
                    that there was “more than <em>prima facie</em>
                    evidence … of [the first and fourth defendants’] participation in
                    the alleged fraud”: <em>Multi-Code Electronics</em>
                    at [150]. The first defendant appeared to be the mastermind using the fourth
                    defendant as a vehicle for his fraudulent conspiracy. Chan J concluded at
                    [151]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The plaintiffs clearly had more than an arguable case against the
                        first and fourth defendants. I would not need the plaintiffs to show me
                        further evidence of the propensity or the risk of dissipation of assets to
                        maintain the Mareva injunction against them. The probity, honesty and
                        integrity of the first and fourth defendants, their trustworthiness and
                        reliability to engage in fair dealing had already been called into question
                        because of the nature of the claim based on their participation in a
                        conspiracy to defraud. <em>The risk of dissipation of assets
                            was no longer in the realm of mere possibility or imagination. In my
                            view, it was very real in the case of the first and fourth defendants,
                            given what they had done to defraud the plaintiffs as
                            alleged.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In our judgment, it is evident from this passage as well as
                        the other references we have made above to the decision, that Chan J
                        was satisfied, having regard to: (a) the particular allegations of
                        dishonesty; (b) the strength of the evidence before him; and
                        (c) the absence of any denial by the defendants of some of the key
                        damning facts, that there was more than sufficient basis to infer a real
                        risk of dissipation. We see no difficulty with this, but we do not read it
                        as supporting the broader statement of the law that is set out in <em>Spectramed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Chan J issued his decision in <em>Spectramed</em> more than a year after he decided <em>Multi-Code Electronics</em>. In <em>Spectramed</em>, the plaintiff company brought claims against the
                    defendants for systematically and deceitfully running the company to the ground
                    by diverting its business to a competing company. The first defendant and her
                    husband, the second defendant, were employed by the plaintiff as the managing
                    director and the marketing manager respectively. The third defendant was an
                    administrator employed by the plaintiff. The second defendant incorporated the
                    fourth defendant while he was still in the employ of the plaintiff, and,
                    together with the first and third defendants, diverted the plaintiff’s
                    business to the fourth defendant over a period of time. The first to third
                    defendants were alleged to have taken active steps to dishonestly conceal their
                    actions. The plaintiff sought Mareva injunctions against the first, second and
                    fourth defendants. These defendants argued they had not done anything to
                    dissipate their assets. Chan J disagreed and granted the Mareva
                    injunctions. He held that there was a <em>prima facie</em>
                    case that the defendants had dishonestly misappropriated the plaintiff’s
                    assets such that a risk of dissipation existed: <em>Spectramed</em> at [20].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Despite articulating the <em>Spectramed</em> proviso (which, on the face of its wording, should
                    have been sufficient to dispose of the case since there was a good arguable case
                    of dishonesty), Chan J <em>in fact</em> went on to
                    consider evidence from the defendants as to the type of assets they held:
                        <em>Spectramed</em> at [21]. He observed that a large
                    part of their assets were held in bank accounts and unit trusts, and that these
                    could be spirited away with ease. He also thought that there was a danger of the
                    fourth defendant transferring its distributorships and goodwill (which were
                    alleged to have been misappropriated from the plaintiff) to another company in
                    the same way as they had allegedly been diverted from the plaintiff. Based on
                    all these factors, Chan J concluded that there was a real risk of
                    dissipation and granted the Mareva injunctions sought. Hence, it seems to us
                    that the learned judge, despite having articulated the <em>Spectramed</em> proviso, did not base his decision solely on it, but
                    went on to assess the evidence to determine whether it supported the inference
                    that there was a sufficient risk or likelihood of dissipation of
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We turn, next, to the English authorities,
                    which likewise have not been entirely consistent in their approach to the weight
                    that the court may attribute to allegations of dishonesty when considering
                    whether there is sufficient basis to infer a real risk of dissipation. Five
                    cases stand out, and we take them in chronological order. They serve to
                    illustrate the ebb and flow of English legal opinion on this
                point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The first case is <em>Grupo
                        Torras SA, Torra Hostench London Limited v Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al Sabah
                        and others</em> 1997 WL 1105536 (21 March 1997, unreported)
                        (“<em>Grupo Torras</em>”), a decision of
                    the English Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs in that case claimed that they had
                    been defrauded of a sum of about US$300m. US$20m of that larger sum was routed
                    through a Swiss lawyer’s client account and distributed on the
                    instructions of Sheikh Fahad Mohammed al Sabah. The person responsible for
                    distributing the money on the Sheikh’s instructions was a Mr Dawson,
                    who himself received US$2m out of the US$20m sum. The plaintiffs brought a claim
                    against Mr Dawson based on, amongst other causes of action, conspiracy,
                    dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. The plaintiffs obtained a Mareva
                    injunction against Mr Dawson. On appeal by the latter against the grant of
                    that injunction, one of the questions before the English Court of Appeal was
                    whether there was a real risk of dissipation. Mr Dawson argued that the
                    judge below had erred in concluding that such a risk existed merely because the
                    case involved allegations of fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The English Court of Appeal rejected
                    Mr Dawson’s argument. Saville LJ, with whom Judge LJ and
                    Sir Patrick Russell agreed, said that in the light of the nature of the
                    fraud which was alleged, it was not surprising that the judge concluded that
                    there was “a strong fear of dissipation”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is clear from the judgment is that the judge took the view that there
                        was a good arguable case that Mr Dawson was knowingly implicated in the
                        fraud; and that <b><em>the nature of the allegations was such
                            that there was a strong fear of dissipation</em></b>. <em>Since it is part of Mr Dawson’s own case that he was
                            expert in the sort of intricate, sophisticated and international
                            financial transactions which feature in this case, and since the
                            plaintiffs had established a good arguable case that Mr Dawson had
                            used his expertise for dishonest purposes</em>, I am not in the
                        least surprised that the judge reached the conclusion that he did. In short
                        I remain wholly unpersuaded that the judge so erred in his assessment of the
                        risk of dissipation that it would be right for this court to interfere.
                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Mareva injunction was therefore upheld by the English
                        Court of Appeal, but we pause to observe that what seemed to have been
                        decisive was the nature of the conduct that was at issue and how it bore on
                        the inference of a real risk of dissipation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The next case is <em>Thane
                        Investments Ltd v Brian Tomlinson</em> 2003 WL 22073907 (29 July
                    2003, unreported) (“<em>Thane
                    Investments</em>”), also a decision of the English Court of Appeal,
                    which seemed to curtail any trend there might have been towards generously
                    drawing inferences of a real risk of dissipation whenever dishonesty or fraud
                    had been alleged and found to be seriously arguable. In that case, the plaintiff
                    companies brought proceedings against two former directors, Mr Tomlinson
                    and Mr Knopp, for misfeasance and breach of fiduciary duties. The English
                    High Court had found, in separate proceedings which were already concluded, that
                    Mr Tomlinson and Mr Knopp were errant directors who had run the
                    plaintiff companies like “their private fiefdom”.
                    Mr Tomlinson was not a defendant in those earlier proceedings, although he
                    did give evidence therein. After the judgment in those earlier proceedings was
                    issued, the plaintiffs applied <em>ex parte</em> and
                    obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction against Mr Tomlinson and Reyall, a
                    company alleged to be controlled by him. Mr Tomlinson was resident in the
                    Isle of Man, and Reyall was also incorporated there. The application to
                    discharge the Mareva injunction was heard <em>inter
                        partes</em> and dismissed by Neuberger J (as he then was).
                    Mr Tomlinson and Reyall appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The English Court of Appeal made some
                    strongly-worded remarks on the procedural breaches occasioned at the <em>ex parte</em> hearing of the plaintiffs’ injunction
                    application. But, putting those breaches aside, the English Court of Appeal
                    turned to consider whether it should continue the Mareva injunction against
                    Mr Tomlinson and Reyall. It held that there was no real risk of dissipation
                    and set aside the Mareva injunction. Peter Gibson LJ, with whom
                    Sir Anthony Evans agreed, said at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I regret that I do not see that the judgment [in the earlier
                        proceedings] does support a conclusion that in the particular circumstances
                        of Mr Tomlinson and Reyall there was a real risk of assets being
                        dissipated. <em>[Counsel for the plaintiffs] submitted that
                            it has now become the practice for parties to bring ex parte
                            applications seeking a freezing order by pointing to some dishonesty,
                            and that ... is sufficient to enable this court to make a freezing
                            order. I have to say that, if that has become the practice, then the
                            practice should be reconsidered. </em><b><em>It is
                            appropriate in each case for the court to scrutinise with care whether

                            the order is sought in itself really justifies the inference that that

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The English Court of Appeal also did not think it persuasive
                        that Mr Tomlinson was resident in the Isle of Man or that Reyall was a
                        Manx corporation. Peter Gibson LJ said that there was nothing to
                        suggest any difficulty in enforcing English judgments in the Isle of Man. We
                        note that the English Court of Appeal, in coming to its decision to set
                        aside the Mareva injunction, did not appear to have cited or considered
                            <em>Grupo Torras</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Subsequent first-instance English decisions
                    have cited <em>Thane Investments</em> with approval, for
                    instance, <em>Michael Cherney v Frank Neuman</em> [2009]
                    EWHC 1743 (Ch) (“<em>Cherney v Neuman</em>”)
                    and <em>Irish Response Limited v Direct Beauty Products
                        Limited</em> [2011] EWHC 37 (QB) (“<em>Irish
                        Response</em>”). In both cases, the court refused to infer a
                    real risk of dissipation even though there was a good arguable case of dishonest
                    conduct by the defendant. In the former, the defendant was alleged to have taken
                    inconsistent positions in related proceedings in Spain (see <em>Cherney v Neuman</em> at [78]–[90]); in the latter, the
                    defendant was alleged to have perjured himself before a Danish court in
                    proceedings that had already concluded and that arose from a connected dispute
                    (see <em>Irish Response</em> at
                [69]–[77]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The third case that we consider is the English
                    High Court decision of Patten J in <em>Jarvis Field Press
                        Limited v Chelton and others</em> [2003] EWHC 2674 (Ch)
                        (“<em>Jarvis Field Press</em>”). In that
                    case, the plaintiff company (“Jarvis”) sought the continuance of a
                    Mareva injunction which it had previously obtained <em>ex
                        parte</em> against the defendants, Mrs Chelton and Mr Long.
                    Mrs Chelton was a director of Jarvis. Jarvis alleged that Mrs Chelton and
                    Mr Long had made unauthorised and unlawful payments out of its assets over
                    a period of two years. Mrs Chelton was also alleged to have caused Jarvis,
                    through deception, to make a loan to a third company, CSM Group Limited. Most of
                    the loan monies, however, were not paid to CSM Group Limited, but were instead
                    paid to Glenwise Limited, a company owned wholly by Mrs Chelton. The
                    documentary evidence and the particulars of claim against Mrs Chelton were
                    said to disclose (<em>Jarvis Field Press</em> at
                    [5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] consistent and determined fraud on the part of
                        Mrs Chelton and those associated with her, whereby significant sums of
                        money were extracted from the claimant company in a devious and secret way,
                        utilising in effect a secret account, with a total absence of disclosure to
                        the board of the claimant company, or indeed to anybody else.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Jarvis asked the court to infer that there was a real risk of
                        dissipation based on the alleged dishonest conduct on
                        Mrs Chelton’s part and the fact that the liquidator of CSM Group
                        Limited had recently commenced proceedings against Mrs Chelton:

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Patten J cited the passage from <em>Thane Investments</em> quoted at [78] above, but did not
                    consider it at odds with the proposition that an allegation of dishonesty
                        <em>could in itself</em> justify an inference of a real
                    risk of dissipation (<em>Jarvis Field Press</em> at
                    [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have no difficulty in accepting the general principle, emphasised by
                        Peter Gibson LJ, that a mere unfocused finding of dishonesty is not, in
                        itself, sufficient to ground an application for a freezing order. It is
                        necessary to have regard to the particular respondents to the application
                        and to ask oneself <em>whether, in the light of the dishonest
                            conduct which is asserted against them, there is a real risk of
                            dissipation. As Peter Gibson LJ made clear in the passage I have
                            already quoted, the court has to scrutinise with care whether what is
                            alleged to have been dishonesty justifies the inference.
                            </em><b><em>That is not, therefore, a judgment to the
                            effect that a finding of dishonesty (or, in this case, an allegation of
                            dishonesty) is insufficient to found the necessary inference.
                            </em></b><em>It is merely a welcome reminder that in
                            order to draw that inference it is necessary to have regard to the
                            particular allegations of dishonesty and to consider them with some
                            care.</em> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Patten J maintained the Mareva injunction which Jarvis
                        had earlier obtained because he thought that there was a real risk of
                        dissipation. He emphasised that there was a good arguable case that
                        Mrs Chelton “will have systematically defrauded the claimant
                        company in a dishonest and secretive way, and in a way that has every
                        indication of being relatively sophisticated”: <em>Jarvis Field Press</em> at [11]. He said that there was an
                        “appreciable risk” in the case of a defendant who
                        “appears to be guilty not merely of dishonesty, but [of] dishonesty
                        in financial dealings in relation to the use or misuse of assets, that she
                        will take steps to put some of those assets ... out of the
                        [plaintiff’s] reach”: <em>Jarvis Field
                            Press</em> at [17]. It is plain to see that it was the nature of
                        the dishonesty alleged in <em>Jarvis Field Press</em>
                        that led Patten J to conclude that there was a sufficiently real risk
                        of dissipation to warrant the Mareva injunction being
                    maintained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The fourth case is <em>Madoff
                        Securities International Limited v Stephen Ernest John Raven and
                        others</em> [2011] EWHC 3102 (“<em>Madoff
                        Securities</em>”), a decision of Flaux J. The two
                    plaintiffs in that case were the liquidators of the Madoff group of companies
                    and were seeking to claw back payments made to the defendants. Amongst the
                    defendants was Sonja Kohn, an Austrian who “lived and conducted her
                    affairs internationally through a series of corporate vehicles” (she and
                    her corporate vehicles were collectively referred to by Flaux J as
                    “the Kohn defendants”): <em>Madoff
                        Securities</em> at [4]. The Kohn defendants had received millions in
                    payments from the Madoff group over the course of some 30 years for introducing
                    investors to Bernard Madoff. The claimants did not plead that the Kohn
                    defendants were actually party to Mr Madoff’s fraud, nor did they
                    allege that the Kohn defendants ought to have been aware of the fraud: <em>Madoff Securities</em> at [5]. Rather, the allegation of
                    dishonesty arose from the fact that none of the invoices which the Kohn
                    defendants issued for the payments from the Madoff group indicated that the
                    payments were in the nature of commissions. The invoices contained, instead,
                    vague references to “research, analysis and consulting”,
                    “market researching” and “strategic consulting and market
                    researches”: <em>Madoff Securities</em> at [7]. The
                    plaintiffs alleged that these sham invoices were intended to conceal the true
                    nature of the payments (<em>Madoff Securities</em> at
                    [8]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he payments were illegitimate payments amounting to secret
                        kickbacks to Mrs Kohn for introducing money into Mr Madoff’s
                        scheme and … Mrs Kohn knew that the real reason for the payments
                        was secretly to pay her for introducing money into the scheme and that the
                        various invoices were sham documents intended to hide the true nature of the
                        payments to the Kohn defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The plaintiffs applied for proprietary and Mareva injunctions
                        against the Kohn defendants. On a jurisdictional point, Flaux J found
                        that he had jurisdiction only over the claims made by one of the two
                        plaintiffs. That plaintiff argued that there was a real risk of dissipation
                        by the Kohn defendants as they had issued “a whole raft of sham
                        invoices and disguised the true nature of payments received”; this
                        was said to be “evidence of deliberate misconduct on a grand scale
                        over a long period of time”: <em>Madoff
                            Securities</em> at [161].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Flaux J was referred to <em>Grupo Torras</em>, <em>Thane
                        Investments</em> and <em>Jarvis Field Press</em>.
                    He agreed with Patten J’s analysis in <em>Jarvis Field
                        Press</em>. Flaux J did not accept the Kohn defendants’
                    submission that the fact of Mrs Kohn’s cooperation with the
                    authorities upon Mr Madoff’s arrest showed that there was no real
                    risk of dissipation. Flaux J said that Mrs Kohn’s cooperation
                    was outweighed by her refusal to voluntarily disclose her assets. She had also
                    been evasive when questioned by an Austrian state prosecutor in separate
                    proceedings. Flaux J said that the false invoices which Mrs Kohn had
                    produced over many years “crie[d] out for a proper explanation”.
                    He concluded at [169]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It seems to me that what emerges is a sufficiently arguable case
                        of deliberate wrongdoing, <em>the issuing of sham invoices
                            and the disguising of the true nature of the payments of millions of
                            dollars made to the Kohn defendants over many years</em>. This
                        demonstrates <em>in itself</em> a serious risk of
                        dissipation. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Flaux J granted the proprietary and Mareva injunctions
                        sought, and also made ancillary disclosure orders against the Kohn
                        defendants. Once again, it will be evident from the passage we have just
                        quoted that what was material about the nature of the alleged fraud in
                            <em>Madoff Securities</em> is that it suggested a
                        propensity to conceal assets and payments through the device of fictitious
                        instruments. In that sense, the link to an inference of a real risk of
                        dissipation was clear. Moreover, Mrs Kohn put forward no reason or
                        explanation for what appeared to be a string of sham invoices issued by the
                        Kohn defendants that were intended to conceal the nature of the payments to
                        them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The final case is the decision of the English
                    Court of Appeal in <em>VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International
                        Corporation and others</em> [2012] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 313
                        (“<em>VTB v Nutritek (CA)</em>”). The
                    plaintiff (“VTB”), a bank incorporated in London, lent a sum of
                    more than US$220m to a Russian company (“RAP”) for the purchase of
                    Russian dairy plants from a BVI company (“Nutritek”). Nutritek was
                    owned by Marcap BVI and Marcap Moscow, which were a BVI company and a Russian
                    company respectively. RAP defaulted on the loan, and VTB only managed to recover
                    US$40.5m. It subsequently transpired that the same person, Konstantin Malofeev,
                    was effectively in control of RAP, Nutritek, Marcap BVI and Marcap Moscow, the
                    parties on both sides of the transaction. VTB brought claims against Nutritek,
                    Marcap BVI, Marcap Moscow and Mr Malofeev alleging conspiracy and joint
                    liability for deceit. VTB obtained an <em>ex parte</em>
                    worldwide Mareva injunction against Mr Malofeev.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Two applications by the defendants were before
                    the court. The first was a challenge to the service of the writs out of
                    jurisdiction. The second was an application to discharge the worldwide Mareva
                    injunction against Mr Malofeev, who was resident in Russia. In the English
                    High Court, Arnold J decided both issues in favour of the defendants. On
                    the Mareva injunction, Arnold J said that the fact that Mr Malofeev
                    had allegedly engaged in a major fraud and operated a “complex web of
                    companies” was not sufficient to establish a real risk of dissipation:
                        <em>VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corp, Marshall
                        Capital Holdings Limited, Marshall Capital LLC, Konstantin
                        Malofeev</em> [2011] EWHC 3107 (Ch) (“<em>VTB v
                        Nutritek (HC)</em>”) at [233]. Arnold J said that
                    Mr Malofeev’s operation of a web of companies was relevant, but
                    “not a strong pointer towards a risk of dissipation” as
                    “[i]t is not uncommon for international businessmen, and indeed quoted UK
                    companies, to use offshore vehicles for their operations, particularly for tax
                    reasons”: <em>VTB v Nutritek (HC)</em> at
                    [233].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     On appeal by VTB, the English Court of Appeal
                    agreed with Arnold J’s decision on jurisdiction and set aside the
                    service of the writs out of jurisdiction. Since the court no longer had personal
                    jurisdiction over the defendants, the issue of the Mareva injunction fell away.
                    The English Court of Appeal nonetheless made some observations on the grant of
                    the Mareva injunction since it had heard full arguments on the point. The
                    English Court of Appeal thought that there was a real risk of dissipation and
                    would not have set aside the Mareva injunction against Mr Malofeev.
                    Lloyd LJ’s observations on this point (at [172]–[175] of
                        <em>VTB v Nutritek (CA)</em>) are instructive and bear
                    setting out in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">172.  If the question [of the Mareva injunction] had
                            arisen, it would have been on the footing that VTB has a seriously
                            arguable case for saying that Mr Malofeev had been engaged in a
                            major fraud against VTB, by which VTB was persuaded to lend RAP
                            US$220 million to fund what was represented as a sale of assets
                            worth substantially more than that amount, whereas in fact, first, the
                            assets were worth a great deal less, and secondly the transaction was
                            not a true sale, and moreover a substantial part of the proceeds of the
                            loan (it can be assumed) disappeared into the complex web of corporate
                            entities in various jurisdictions, including several offshore, for the
                            benefit of Mr Malofeev, and maybe for that of others involved.
                            Furthermore, not only was the use of that web of corporate entities a
                            significant part of the means whereby the fraud was committed, by
                            concealing the true ownership of RAP, but it would also make it
                            difficult for VTB to enforce any judgment that it was able to obtain.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">173.  It seems to us that these propositions would have
                            provided a strong starting point for a case in favour of the grant of a
                            [worldwide Mareva injunction]. It could be inferred that <em>a wealthy individual who uses such methods to defraud a
                                bank in this way and on this scale might readily resort to similar
                                methods to render his major assets proof against enforcement in
                                response to proceedings being taken against him, at any rate if he
                                had reason to fear that the proceedings might be pursued
                                effectively.</em></p>

                            evidence and the presentation of the case, to which we need not refer.
                            In addition to discounting, for those reasons, the factors to which we
                            have referred at para 172 above, the judge observed at
                            para 233 that it was common for international businessmen to use
                            offshore vehicles for their operations, particularly for tax reasons,
                            and that this may make it difficult to enforce a judgment, but that
                            claimants such as VTB ‘have to take defendants such as
                            Mr Malofeev as they find them’, the use of offshore companies
                            not being sufficient evidence of a risk of dissipation. <em>It seems to us that while that may be a fair comment as

                                use of a web of offshore companies in connection with the fraud,
                                could properly provide a basis for taking this into account in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Lloyd LJ also cited Flaux J’s
                    judgment in <em>Madoff Securities</em> at length and with
                    approval. The appeal against the English Court of Appeal’s decision in
                        <em>VTB v Nutritek (CA)</em> was dismissed on the
                    jurisdictional point by a majority of the UK Supreme Court: <em>VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corporation and others</em>
                    [2013] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 466. The UK Supreme Court did not make any
                    substantive remarks on the English Court of Appeal’s observations on the
                    Mareva injunction against Mr Malofeev: at [72] <em>per</em> Lord Mance JSC, at [150] <em>per</em> Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC and at

                    It is evident once again that the material considerations identified by
                    Lloyd LJ included the fact that the methods allegedly used to defraud VTB
                    were precisely the sort of methods that could be used to put
                    Mr Malofeev’s assets beyond the reach of a judgment creditor
                        (<em>VTB v Nutritek (CA)</em> at [173]), and that
                    Mr Malofeev allegedly used a web of companies to defraud VTB. These factors
                    in turn could then be a basis for inferring a real risk of dissipation
                        (<em>VTB v Nutritek (CA)</em> at
                    [174]–[175]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     We turn, finally, to two Australian cases. The
                    first is <em>Patterson v BTR Engineering</em>, one of the
                    two cases relied on by Chan J in <em>Spectramed</em>
                    (see [64] above). In <em>Patterson v BTR Engineering</em>,
                    the plaintiff company obtained a Mareva injunction against a former senior
                    employee. The ex-employee was alleged to have interposed the fourth defendant, a
                    company which he apparently indirectly controlled, between the plaintiff and
                    certain overseas suppliers while he was still in the plaintiff’s employ.
                    Through this scheme, he made a secret profit by fraudulently procuring the
                    plaintiff to overpay on equipment purchases which were routed through the fourth
                    defendant. There was little or no direct evidence showing a risk of the
                    ex-employee dissipating his assets. The Court of Appeal of New South Wales
                    nonetheless upheld the decision of the first-instance judge, Giles J, to
                    maintain the Mareva injunction which had been granted to the plaintiff. The
                    appellate court inferred a real risk of dissipation from the allegations and the
                    evidence placed before it. The decision was unanimous, but there were
                    differences in the reasoning of Gleeson CJ and Meagher JA, who each
                    delivered a judgment on the point. Rogers AJA, the third member of the
                    court, agreed with Gleeson CJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Gleeson CJ said at
                    325E–326A:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I consider that Giles J was correct in taking the view that <em>the evidence as to the nature of the scheme in which the
                            [defendant ex-employee] was allegedly involved</em>, which
                        established a prima facie case against him, <em>was such as
                            to justify the conclusion that there was a danger that the [defendant]
                            would dispose of assets in order to defeat any judgment that might be
                            obtained against him and that such danger was sufficiently substantial
                            to warrant the injunction. There is no reason in principle why the
                            evidence which is relevant to the first [issue of establishing
                            a</em> prima facie <em>case] might not also have a
                            bearing on the second, and this will especially be so where the prima
                            facie case that is made out against a defendant is one of serious
                            dishonesty involving diversion of money from its proper
                            channels.</em> ... This is a case in which the plaintiff claims
                        that the defendant, making use of a corporation controlled by him,
                        fraudulently misappropriated a large sum of money which, if it is still
                        under the control of the [defendant], would be quite likely to constitute,
                        directly or indirectly, the bulk of his assets. <em>As
                            Giles J held, the nature of the scheme in which, on the evidence to
                            date, the [defendant] appears to have engaged, is such that it is
                            reasonable to infer that he is not the sort of person who would, unless
                            retrained, preserve his assets intact so that they might be available to
                            his judgment creditor.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Meagher JA put the proposition more
                    broadly. He said at 326C–326E:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Normally proof of [a <em>prima facie</em> case] alone
                        will not suffice; normally one cannot infer a risk of dissipation of assets
                        from the mere fact that the plaintiff has a prima facie cause of action. In
                        normal circumstances this is particularly so in cases like the present,
                        where there is no evidence at all what the defendant’s assets are.
                        However, in <em>exceptional</em> cases (of which the
                        present is unfortunately one) <em>one can infer the existence
                            of the latter ingredient partly or wholly from proof of the former. This
                            may well be the situation in all cases where the plaintiff’s prima
                            facie case against the defendant involves proof of gross
                            dishonesty.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The way in which the point was put by
                    Gleeson CJ is entirely consistent with the approach taken in <em>Grupo Torras</em>, <em>Jarvis Field
                        Press</em> and <em>Madoff Securities</em>, as
                    well as with the observations of Lloyd LJ in <em>VTB v
                        Nutritek (CA)</em>, which we cited earlier. In these instances, the
                    focus of attention was on the <em>nature</em> of the
                    alleged fraud and whether it supported the drawing of an inference of a real
                    risk of dissipation. Meagher JA’s <em>dictum</em>, in contrast, was framed in wider terms. It formed the
                    basis of an argument by the plaintiffs in <em>Media World
                        Communications Ltd (Administrator Appointed) v Clark</em> [2004] FCA
                    1609 (“<em>Media World</em>”) in their
                    application for a Mareva injunction. <em>Media World</em>
                    was a first-instance decision of the Federal Court of Australia. The plaintiffs
                    in that case had, in a series of transactions, purchased what was referred to as
                    “the AP Technology” from the first defendant, Adam Clark, and his
                    associated companies, which were the corporate defendants. The plaintiffs’
                    suspicions were subsequently aroused and confirmed when they discovered that the
                    AP Technology was sub-optimal and did not perform as represented. The plaintiffs
                    argued that there was a strong case of serious dishonesty and fraud against
                    Mr Clark and the corporate defendants. Mr Clark had made
                    representations to the plaintiffs about the performance of the AP Technology
                    knowing that those representations were false. The plaintiffs argued that the
                    court could “infer a risk [of dissipation] from the nature of the cause
                    of action raised against the defendants”: <em>Media
                        World</em> at [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Goldberg J rejected the argument and
                    refused to grant the Mareva injunction sought. He pointed out that
                    Meagher JA’s reasoning in <em>Patterson v BTR
                        Engineering</em> differed “in a number of …
                    respects” from Gleeson CJ’s: <em>Media
                        World</em> at [23]. Goldberg J then distinguished <em>Patterson v BTR Engineering</em> as a case that
                    “involve[d] a diversion of funds”. He said that cases where the
                    courts had been prepared to draw an inference of a real risk of dissipation
                    based on substantiated allegations of dishonesty and nothing more, were those
                    that “involved … cause[s] of action <em>which had a
                        characteristic bearing upon dissipation</em>” [emphasis added]:
                        <em>Media World</em> at [26]. Goldberg J thought
                    that although the case before him included “appellations such as
                    ‘fraud’ and ‘serious dishonesty’, the case [was]
                    essentially one of misrepresentation”: <em>Media
                        World</em> at [27]. In the absence of other evidence pointing to a
                    real risk of dissipation, Goldberg J dismissed the application for a Mareva
                    injunction against the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     It is time to round off this extended review
                    of the authorities with some observations, and we begin with the last of the
                    cases we have reviewed, namely, <em>Media World</em>. In
                    our judgment, if there is a unifying principle that can adequately rationalise
                    and explain the circumstances in which a court may legitimately infer a real
                    risk of dissipation from nothing more than a good arguable case of dishonesty,
                    it is this – the alleged dishonesty must be of such a nature that it has a
                    real and material bearing on the risk of dissipation. It will be evident from
                    our analysis of the cases that it is in such circumstances that the courts have
                    been willing to draw the necessary inference. This is sensible because whether
                    or not such an inference may be drawn is ultimately a question of fact. In
                    assessing whether the inference is warranted as a matter of fact, it is
                    appropriate, in our judgment, for the court to <em>segregate</em> the two questions (<em>ie</em>,
                    whether there is a good arguable case on the merits of the plaintiff’s
                    claim and whether it has been shown that there is a real risk of dissipation)
                    and answer them <em>separately</em>. We accept that the
                    evidence relied on to answer the first question may be the same as that relied
                    on to answer the second. But, once the inquiries are segregated, it will be
                    clear that whether the evidence pertinent to the first stage of the inquiry is
                    sufficient also for the purposes of the second stage is an assessment that
                    cannot – and emphatically must not – be made mechanistically; and in
                    that context, if an allegation of dishonesty is all that is relied on, that
                    allegation must be such as to say enough about a real risk of dissipation in the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In our judgment, a well-substantiated
                    allegation that a defendant has acted dishonestly can and often <em>will</em>, as we have said, be relevant to whether there is a
                    real risk that the defendant may dissipate his assets. But, we reiterate that in
                    each case, it is incumbent on the court to examine the precise nature of the
                    dishonesty that is alleged and the strength of the evidence relied on in support
                    of the allegation, keeping fully in mind that the proceedings are only at an
                    interlocutory stage and assessing, in that light, whether there is sufficient
                    basis to find a real risk of dissipation. That alone is the justification which
                    lies at the heart of the court’s jurisdiction to grant Mareva injunctions.
                    An allegation of dishonesty does not in itself form a substitute for an
                    examination of the degree of risk of dissipation unless, as we have said, that
                    allegation is of a nature or characteristic that sufficiently bears upon the
                    risk of dissipation. In this regard, we endorse the views of Choo Han
                    Teck J in <em>PT Sariwiguna Binasentosa v Sindo Damai
                        Shipping Ltd and others</em> [2015] SGHC 195, where he made
                    observations to a similar effect at [10]–[14]. That judgment was handed
                    down shortly after we heard the oral arguments in these appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     On the facts before us, we do not consider
                    that the allegations of dishonesty levelled at Mr Bouvier have a real and
                    material bearing upon the risk of dissipation. This is not a case where
                    Mr Bouvier misappropriated the respondents’ assets through a series
                    of fictitious or illusory transactions. Nor is this case akin to <em>Patterson v BTR Engineering</em>, where a former senior
                    employee of the plaintiff company exploited his position to procure the
                    plaintiff to purchase equipment from him at a mark-up by interposing an entity
                    that he was thought to indirectly control, thus enabling him to make a secret
                    profit by the “diversion of money from its proper channels”. In
                    the present case, the respondents, which are controlled by Mr Rybolovlev,
                    are independent entities that received what they bargained for and at the price
                    they were willing to pay. They knew that they were dealing with Mr Bouvier,
                    and that he was sourcing the artworks concerned from others. The real issue is
                    as to the legal nature of the respondents’ relationship with
                    Mr Bouvier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The fraud or dishonesty that is alleged in
                    this case is not in the nature of a complex machination or an elaborate scheme.
                    The ploy in this case, if proved, was deceptively simple: Mr Bouvier
                    exploited the asymmetries of information inherent in an opaque market to turn a
                    profit. As we have already observed, the ultimate outcome in this case turns on
                    the true characterisation of the relationship between Mr Bouvier and the
                    respondents. On one view, there will be no fraud at all: Mr Bouvier can be
                    seen as a wily businessman who employed a questionable (and perhaps barely
                    legal), although ultimately profitable, approach to business. On another,
                    Mr Bouvier can be seen as an errant agent who is liable to the respondents
                    for fraudulent misrepresentation or breach of fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     We also consider it significant that there
                    was, in this case, no use of a complex web of companies to conceal the dealings
                    in question. Mr Bouvier made no attempt to conceal his identity or mask his
                    connection with the transactions through which the 38 artworks were acquired by
                    the respondents. He always dealt in person, acting through MEI Invest. The
                    payments from the respondents were made over the course of a decade or so into
                    the same bank accounts held by MEI Invest at the Geneva branches of Banque SCS
                    Alliance and Compagnie Bancaire Helvétique. Mr Bouvier may be wealthy,
                    well-advised and sophisticated; he may also be experienced in international
                    financial transactions and corporate structures. But, to infer a real risk of
                    dissipation from these factors alone would be to penalise him for what some may
                    say are no more than the ordinary concomitants of his good fortune or his
                    success in plying his craft. In <em>Art Trend Ltd v Blue Dolphin
                        (Pte) Ltd and others</em> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 633
                        (“<em>Art Trend</em>”), Lai Kew
                    Chai J frowned on a similar argument, stating at [37] that experience or
                    “knowledge of the practice of international finance and transfers of
                    funds is not evidence of a predisposition to remove assets to frustrate any
                    judgment”. His decision was upheld on appeal: <em>Art
                        Trend Ltd v Blue Dolphin (Pte) Ltd and others</em> [1983–1984]
                    SLR(R) 105. In our view, Mr Bouvier has not misused his international
                    financial expertise in the commission or furtherance of the allegedly deceitful
                    behaviour, nor is there any solid evidence which suggests a real risk of
                    dissipation on his part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Unsatisfactory asset disclosures</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The ground that we have covered thus far is
                    ground that was traversed before the Judge, and we have, with respect, come to a
                    different conclusion from the Judge in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     On appeal, the respondents added a new
                    argument which was not before the Judge. Indeed, there was no material to
                    support such an argument before the Judge. This argument is based on the
                    information that Mr Bouvier disclosed pursuant to the ancillary disclosure
                    orders made by the Judge in support of the Mareva injunction against him. The
                    respondents argue that there are doubts over how forthright Mr Bouvier has
                    been in his asset disclosures; on this basis, they seek to persuade us to draw
                    the necessary inference of a real risk of dissipation. This argument is cast in
                    two ways. First, the respondents compare the amount of the Excess Payments that
                    Mr Bouvier received over the years (alleged to be about US$1bn) with the
                    total value of the assets that Mr Bouvier has disclosed. They say that
                    there is a disparity between these two figures, which suggests that
                    Mr Bouvier has not accounted for all his assets. Second, they raise
                    questions over the type of assets that Mr Bouvier holds. They say that
                    these assets are suspicious. Both these points feed into the respondents’
                    broader argument attacking the veracity of Mr Bouvier’s asset
                    disclosures, which is in turn said to support an inference of a real risk of
                    dissipation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Arguments of this nature are not uncommon.
                    Similar lines of attack were pursued by the plaintiffs in <em>European Grain</em> at [13], <em>VTB v Nutritek
                        (HC)</em> at [242] and <em>Choy Chee Keen Collin v
                        Public Utilities Board</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 812 at
                    [16]–[18]. When one sets this type of argument against the purpose of
                    ancillary disclosure orders and the nature of the information that is usually
                    required to be disclosed, it is unsurprising that such arguments have generally
                    not met with much success.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In <em>Petromar Energy
                        Resources Pte Ltd v Glencore International</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R)
                    115, this court cautioned (at [21] <em>per</em>
                    L P Thean JA) that the disclosure order that is granted ancillary
                    to a Mareva injunction serves a limited but focused purpose:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he disclosure order is merely an ancillary order made in aid
                        of a Mareva injunction in order for the plaintiff to determine the location
                        of the defendant’s assets and take appropriate steps to preserve them
                        pending trial. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It aims to give the plaintiff a snapshot of the
                        defendant’s assets at the time of disclosure. This is to enable the
                        plaintiff to police the injunction and ensure that the defendant’s
                        assets are kept at the steady state which the Mareva injunction seeks to
                        preserve. After all, if the court is satisfied that there is a real risk of
                        dissipation, then it generally follows, as a matter of logic, that there
                        should be a capability to police the Mareva injunction granted. The
                        ancillary asset disclosure order is thus an integral part of the
                        court’s Mareva jurisdiction and an ordinary adjunct to a Mareva
                        injunction: <em>Grupo Torras SA v Shiekh Fahad Mohammed Al
                            Sabah and others</em> (16 February 1994, unreported);
                            <em>Motorola Credit Corporation v Cem Cegiz
                            Uzan</em> [2002] EWCA Civ 98 at
                [28]–[29].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Where the Mareva injunction itself is
                    ultimately found not to have been justified on the basis of the material before
                    the court at the time it was granted, it seems to us inherently unfair to
                    nonetheless allow the plaintiff to use information that he has obtained through
                    the ancillary disclosure orders to try to shore up a case for a real risk of
                    dissipation. Ancillary disclosure orders have been recognised to be highly
                    intrusive and can entail potentially severe ramifications. But, these severe
                    intrusions on privacy are tolerated because a Mareva injunction without an
                    accompanying disclosure order will often be toothless. To further prejudice the
                    defendant by allowing the plaintiff to use information extracted from an
                    ancillary disclosure order to support an otherwise unsustainable Mareva
                    injunction would be to provide the plaintiff with an unfair and improper
                    advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Further, the information obtained from an
                    ancillary disclosure order will often have little, if any, bearing on a real
                    risk of dissipation. The disclosed information does not provide a longitudinal
                    view of the defendant’s assets. All that is disclosed are the assets
                    standing to the defendant’s name at the time disclosure is made. The
                    information will not show whether there has been a systematic and unexplained
                    attrition of the defendant’s assets over time, which, presumably, would be
                    the justification for inferring a real risk of dissipation. The disclosed
                    information is also often rough and ready. Given that the disclosure affidavits
                    usually have to be compiled and filed under stringent timelines, the information
                    set out therein is not the type of information that tends to stand up well to
                    the microscopic scrutiny of lawyers and forensic accountants. For example, in
                    the present case, the value of Mr Bouvier’s private companies was
                    estimated based on either the amounts standing to their bank accounts or their
                    net asset values at the time Mr Bouvier prepared his disclosure affidavits.
                    These are by any measure an incomplete reflection of the true value of those
                    companies. It will be unreliable or even misleading to rely on information of
                    this nature to establish whether or not a defendant has been concealing his
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In our judgment, ancillary disclosure orders
                    may only be relevant to the risk of dissipation in two narrow situations. The
                    first is where the defendant refuses to provide any disclosure of his assets at
                    all. This might, in appropriate circumstances, found the inference that there is
                    a real risk that the defendant may dissipate his assets (see <em>Z Ltd v A and others</em> [1982] 1 All ER 556 at 566B–566C
                        <em>per</em> Lord Denning; <em>Jarvis Field Press</em> at [14]; <em>Madoff
                        Securities</em> at [172]–[173]). The second is where the
                    information disclosed by the defendant reveals assets which are so glaringly
                    inadequate or suspicious that the deficiencies cannot be attributed to the
                    urgency with which the disclosures were made or other accounting or valuation
                    inaccuracies. This latter situation would rarely arise because if the defendant
                    were truly minded to conceal his assets, the likelihood is that he would not
                    provide any disclosure at all. Even in these situations, the court would have to
                    carefully consider whether, in all the circumstances, an inference of a real
                    risk of dissipation may appropriately be drawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    On the facts before us, we are not satisfied
                    that the information disclosed by Mr Bouvier is suspicious. We shall not
                    descend into the minutiae because the disclosures were ordered on condition of
                    strict confidentiality. But, it suffices to say that the disclosure affidavits
                    provided by Mr Bouvier were timeous and detailed. If the respondents had
                    any doubts about the disclosed information, it was open to them to apply to
                    cross-examine Mr Bouvier on it: <em>OCM Opportunities
                        Fund II LP and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and
                        others</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 74 at [34]–[35]. They did not,
                    however, do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    This brings us to Mr Bouvier’s
                    argument pertaining to his asset disclosures, which is an inversion of that made
                    by the respondents. He argues that his exemplary compliance with the
                    Judge’s ancillary disclosure orders militates against the conclusion that
                    there is a real risk of his dissipating his assets. Instead, he submits, his
                    compliance with those orders evinces his intention to “participate fully
                    in [the] proceedings and to clear his name [through] the legal process”.
                    We respectfully disagree. The court is entitled to expect from litigants nothing
                    less than punctilious compliance with the orders that it makes. The fact that a
                    litigant complies with an asset disclosure order does not necessarily diminish
                    the risk of dissipation if it existed in the first place, just as his
                    non-compliance would not necessarily fortify that risk if it was not
                    sufficiently established to begin with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Abuse of process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Mareva injunctions have been discharged
                    where the applicants failed to “apply for the relief promptly”, or
                    used the Mareva injunction concerned to “oppress the defendants”
                    (see <em>Meespierson NV v Industrial Commercial Bank of
                        Vietnam</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 287 at [29] <em>per</em> Judith Prakash J) in the sense of the injunction being
                    “calculated to pressurise the defendants and bring them to their
                    knees” (see <em>Art Trend</em> at
                [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In our judgment, the Mareva injunction
                    obtained against Mr Bouvier in this case was an abuse of the court’s
                    process. The injunction was not obtained by the respondents to prevent the
                    enforcement of an anticipated judgment from being frustrated. Instead, we are
                    satisfied that it was deployed as an instrument of oppression to inflict
                    commercial prejudice on Mr Bouvier. Four factors lead us to this
                    conclusion:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first is the respondents’
                        delay in making their application for a Mareva injunction and ancillary
                        disclosure orders against Mr Bouvier. The lack of urgency in their
                        application suggests that in fact, the respondents did not genuinely believe
                        there was a real risk that Mr Bouvier would dissipate his
                        assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_b"></a>(b)     This
                        shades into the second factor, which is the respondents’ failure to
                        comply with the Supreme Court Practice Directions (“the Practice
                        Directions”). There was, in the present circumstances, no reason for
                        the respondents to make their injunction application <em>ex
                            parte</em> without giving Mr Bouvier
                    notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third
                        factor is the unjustifiable breadth of the Mareva injunction against
                        Mr Bouvier. For no apparent reason, the respondents included the assets
                        and bank accounts of 14 companies owned by Mr Bouvier (the 14
                        “affected companies”) in the Mareva injunction as it was
                        worded when it was granted by the Judge on 12 March
                    2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_d"></a>(d)     The final
                        factor is the respondents’ conduct subsequent to their obtaining the
                        Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>We elaborate on each of these factors below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Delay in making the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    A plaintiff who is genuinely concerned that
                    the defendant will dissipate his assets would be expected to act with urgency in
                    seeking Mareva relief. Of course, delay by itself will not be dispositive of the
                    plaintiff’s application for such relief. The length of the delay and any
                    explanations for it should be considered against all the circumstances of the
                    case: <em>Madoff Securities</em> at
                    [156]–[157].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In our judgment, the relevant period of
                    delay in this case is between, at the latest, the time Mr Rybolovlev first
                    confronted Mr Bouvier with the NYT article on 22 November 2014 (see
                    [53] above) and the time the respondents’
                    <em>ex parte</em> application for a Mareva injunction was
                    made on 12 March 2015, a little under four months later. A few significant
                    events occurred between these dates:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 31 December 2014,
                        Mr Rybolovlev met Mr Heller. The respondents’ counsel, Mr
                        Yeo, submitted that this was the first time Mr Rybolovlev actually
                        understood what Mr Bouvier had been up to and how the latter had been
                        defrauding him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     On 9 January 2015, the respondents filed the criminal complaint
                        against Mr Bouvier with the Monegasque authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_c"></a>(c)     From 25 to 28 February 2015,
                        Mr Bouvier was detained by the Monaco police for
                    questioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_d"></a>(d)     On
                        28 February 2015, Judge Loïc Malbrancke, the Monaco investigating
                        judge, released Mr Bouvier on bail. Judge Malbrancke granted bail
                        because he considered that Mr Bouvier posed only a limited risk of
                        flight, and because the investigations were “to continue into the
                        relatively distant future given their highly international
                        dimension”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Mr Yeo argued that the respondents had
                    in fact applied for Mareva relief promptly. As noted above, he argued that
                    Mr Rybolovlev only uncovered the fraud on 31 December 2014, and that
                    should therefore be taken as the relevant date from which to assess the
                    promptness (or otherwise) of the respondents’ reaction. Mr Yeo
                    submitted that the respondents acted swiftly thereafter to prepare and file the
                    criminal complaint against Mr Bouvier in Monaco on 9 January 2015.
                    After doing that, the respondents did not commence proceedings elsewhere because
                    they were waiting for the Monaco proceedings to be resolved. They also did not
                    want to tip Mr Bouvier off as to the investigations by the Monaco
                    authorities. According to Mr Yeo, the real urgency to prevent
                    Mr Bouvier from dissipating his assets arose only after he was released on
                    bail on 28 February 2015. The respondents thereafter immediately instructed
                    solicitors in Singapore in early March 2015 and made their injunction
                    application on 12 March 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    With respect, we do not find this
                    explanation persuasive at all. We have explained at [51]–[58] above that
                    if the facts are indeed as the respondents contend, then Mr Rybolovlev
                        <em>must</em> have known or at least had very strong
                    reason to suspect Mr Bouvier’s alleged fraud by the time he discussed
                    the NYT article with Mr Bouvier on 22 November 2014. We reiterate that
                    there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mr Bouvier ever denied the
                    accuracy of the NYT article. Moreover, if the facts are as the respondents
                    contend, then by 22 November 2014, from Mr Bouvier’s
                    perspective, he must have known that the game was nearly up and that it was only
                    a matter of time before the truth was uncovered. He would have been improbably
                    naïve to think otherwise. The necessity to prevent Mr Bouvier from
                    dissipating his assets, if there was one, would have crystallised at that point
                    in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    We also do not find persuasive the
                    respondents’ explanation for holding off their injunction application
                    between 9 January and 28 February 2015 during the pendency of the
                    Monaco criminal proceedings, until Mr Bouvier was released on bail on the
                    latter date. This is because it was common ground before us that the Monaco
                    courts do not have the power to grant worldwide freezing orders. No permutation
                    of the possible outcomes of the proceedings in Monaco could have resulted in
                    Mr Bouvier’s assets being subject to a worldwide asset freeze by the
                    Monaco courts. The respondents exhibited a legal opinion of their Monaco law
                    expert, Dr Géraldine Gazo, in the affidavit which Mr Sazonov filed in
                    support of their application for a Mareva injunction. Dr Gazo’s legal
                    opinion broached various issues, including the civil and criminal jurisdiction
                    of the Monaco courts as well as the nature of the proceedings in Monaco.
                    Significantly, the opinion also stated that “it is not possible under
                    Monaco civil procedure to obtain orders which freeze a defendant’s assets
                    in another jurisdiction”. There was therefore no good reason for the
                    respondents to await the outcome of the Monaco proceedings before applying for a
                    worldwide Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier <em>if</em> they genuinely believed he would dissipate his assets. To put
                    it plainly, there was no worldwide freezing order for the respondents to wait
                    for or look forward to in the Monaco proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In our judgment, if the respondents were
                    genuinely fearful of Mr Bouvier dissipating his assets, they would have
                    instructed their solicitors to apply for a Mareva injunction immediately or
                    shortly after the meeting between Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev on
                    22 November 2014. Even giving the respondents the benefit of any possible
                    doubt, by the time they filed a criminal complaint against Mr Bouvier in
                    Monaco on 9 January 2015, there was no basis to withhold seeking a
                    worldwide freezing order against Mr Bouvier any further. Yet, they did not
                    make the requisite application, and did not give any convincing explanation to
                    account for this. Rather, it appears that the application for a Mareva
                    injunction against Mr Bouvier was the respondents’ response to his
                    perhaps unanticipated release on bail on 28 February 2015. It is telling
                    that no reason was ever put forward by the respondents as to why they waited
                    until after that date before instructing lawyers here with a view to seeking a
                    worldwide Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier from our
                courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Non-compliance with the Practice Directions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The respondents’ delay in making their
                    injunction application segues into the next point, which is their non-compliance
                    with the relevant procedure. It is established practice that an applicant for an
                        <em>ex parte</em> injunction, including a Mareva
                    injunction, <em>must</em> give notice of the application to
                    the other concerned parties prior to the hearing. Only in cases of
                    “extreme urgency”, or where the giving of prior notice would
                    defeat the purpose of the <em>ex parte</em> application,
                    will the applicant be excused from giving notice: paras 41(2) and 41(3) of
                    the Practice Directions. In such cases, the affidavit in support of the
                        <em>ex parte</em> application must give reasons for the
                    urgency of the application (see para 42A of the Practice Directions) or
                    explain why the giving of prior notice would defeat the purpose of the
                    application (see para 41(3) of the Practice Directions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In the present case, none of this was done.
                    No justification was put forward by the respondents for not giving
                    Mr Bouvier prior notice of their injunction application against him, or for
                    contending that this was a case where giving prior notice would defeat the very
                    purpose for which the application was being made. Indeed, given the progression
                    of the litigation, it could not fairly be contended that this was either a case
                    of extreme urgency or one where the giving of prior notice would have defeated
                    the purpose of the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    If Mr Bouvier was so naïve as to think
                    the 22 November 2014 meeting was insignificant, he faced the virtual
                    certainty of legal proceedings when he was arrested and detained by the Monaco
                    police on 25 February 2015. Subsequent to his arrest, Mr Bouvier
                    instructed lawyers who were present with him at the depositions before the
                    Monaco authorities. On 28 February 2015, Mr Bouvier was released from
                    custody and was presumably still getting legal advice. He was also informed that
                    the investigations in Monaco would continue. Moreover, having filed a criminal
                    complaint in Monaco, the respondents had applied to be joined as civil parties
                    in the proceedings there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    On 1 March 2015, the respondents’
                    Swiss lawyers wrote to banks in Geneva, St Gallen, Zurich, Paris and Hong
                    Kong. These letters were titled “Urgent and anticipating the official
                    requests from the authorities”, and stated that Mr Bouvier and
                    Mrs Rappo were facing fraud and money laundering charges in Monaco. The
                    letters further stated:</p>

                        of the products of the suspected criminal activities, which have already

                        were sent on the same day to the police authorities in Bern, London and
                        Singapore. The respondents’ Swiss lawyers sent further letters to
                        Singapore’s Commercial Affairs Department on 4 March 2015 and to
                        the legal department of a Swiss bank on 11 March 2015 (the letter to
                        the Swiss bank additionally indicated that Ms Bersheda, one of the
                        respondents’ Swiss lawyers (see [32] above), had spoken to one of the
                        bank’s employees over the telephone earlier that
                day).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    On 8 March 2015, a Swiss magazine,
                        <em>Economie – Le Matin Dimanche</em>, published
                    an article reporting the dispute between Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev.
                    The article quoted a press release issued by Ms Bersheda, on
                    28 February 2015, which stated that “[a]t present [the respondents]
                    are <em>looking into the possibility of starting parallel
                        proceedings</em> in coordination with other victims of similar
                    activities of which Mr Yves Bouvier has been accused” [emphasis
                    added]. The article also reported that when Ms Bersheda was contacted the
                    week before (<em>ie</em>, the week of 1 March 2015),
                    she confirmed that “collaborative efforts coordinated with those parties
                    have already been started”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In our judgment, the analysis of the events
                    subsequent to Mr Bouvier’s release on bail on 28 February 2015
                    confirms that by that stage, the respondents were in position for worldwide
                    litigation against Mr Bouvier. The simple point of all this is that if the
                    respondents believed that Mr Bouvier intended to dispose of his assets,
                    they could not have missed the fact that he had ample opportunity to do so from
                    the time of his release from detention on 28 February 2015. At that time,
                        <em>both</em> criminal and civil proceedings initiated
                    by the respondents were already afoot against Mr Bouvier in Monaco. In
                    these circumstances, it is impossible for us to see how, at the time of the
                    respondents’ injunction application 12 days later, the matter could
                    possibly be conceived as being of such extreme urgency or of such imminent risk
                    that it excused the giving of prior notice. Nor could it reasonably have been
                    thought that providing Mr Bouvier with notice at the time of the injunction
                    application would have defeated the purpose of that application if, consistent
                    with the fact of their making that application, the respondents thought
                    Mr Bouvier had yet to dispose of his assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Mr Yeo said that it was the practice
                        <em>not</em> to give notice whenever a Mareva
                    injunction was sought. If that is true, it makes a mockery of the Practice
                    Directions and is not a practice to be unthinkingly encouraged. In this regard,
                    we echo the views expressed by Sir Anthony in <em>Thane
                        Investments</em> at [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel says that it is normal practice to apply ex parte for an order of
                        this sort, and he said also that it is common for no notice to be given. I
                        am sure that may be right – I do not suggest that it is not –
                        because the very nature of a freezing order, for the reasons he explained,
                        is that it may be necessary to apply without notice, hence the importance of
                        [the provision] which requires an explanation of the reason why no notice
                        has been given in the particular case. <em>I would be very
                            surprised to hear that it is common or normal practice to make an
                            application without notice and at the same time to disregard the rules
                            which expressly cover that very situation</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>There was not even a faint attempt in this case to justify or
                        explain why the Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier was applied for
                        without giving him prior notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Breadth of the Mareva injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    We turn to the third point, which concerns
                    the Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier as it was worded when it was
                    granted on 12 March 2015. To put it simply, the Mareva injunction, as
                    worded at that time, was unnecessarily broad. Among other things, it prevented
                    Mr Bouvier from dealing with the shares that he held in the 14 affected
                    companies (as defined at [108(c)] above). This is not, in itself, objectionable.
                    But, the Mareva injunction went further, and the schedule which was appended to
                    it included the assets and bank accounts held in the names of those 14
                    companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    There was no apparent reason for the
                    respondents to disregard the separate legal personality of the 14 affected
                    companies and include the assets and bank accounts held by them in the Mareva
                    injunction against Mr Bouvier. Mr Sazonov asserted in the affidavit
                    which he filed in support of the respondents’ injunction application that
                        <em>one</em> of the 14 affected companies, Art Family
                    Pte Ltd (“Art Family”), had issued an invoice to Xitrans Finance
                    in 2009 and had received payment for it. As Art Family was owned wholly by
                    Mr Bouvier, the affidavit stated, there was reason to “believe
                    therefore that Mr Bouvier [had] control of bank accounts and any assets in
                    the name of [Art Family], with the power to dispose of or deal with them as if
                    they were his own”. No explanation was given for the inclusion in the
                    Mareva injunction of the assets and bank accounts held by the other 13 affected
                    companies, of which only some were wholly owned by
                Mr Bouvier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In any case, we do not see how the fact of
                    Art Family having issued an invoice to and received payment from Xitrans Finance
                    in 2009 could have justified the inclusion of the assets and bank accounts held
                    by Art Family, much less those held by any of the other 13 affected companies,
                    in the respondents’ injunction application and the ensuing Mareva
                    injunction granted. Art Family is not a party to the Singapore action. It is
                    thus not subject to the <em>in personam</em> jurisdiction
                    of the Singapore courts. There is no question that the court is entitled to
                    exercise the jurisdiction articulated in <em>SCF Finance Co Ltd v
                        Masri</em> [1985] 2 All ER 747 and <em>TSB Private
                        Bank International SA v Chabra</em> [1992] 2 All ER 245 (see
                        <em>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 410 at [14]–[19]) to include in a court order assets
                    belonging to a third party on the basis that the assets are “in truth the
                    assets of the defendant”. However, in the present case, there was no
                    evidence that Art Family was a sham company; nor was there any evidence that its
                    assets and bank accounts belonged to Mr Bouvier. At least eight of the 14
                    affected companies were going concerns. Yves Meyer, a director of five of the 14
                    affected companies (including Art Family), affirmed an affidavit testifying that
                    the businesses of those companies had been adversely affected. Art Family had
                    two employees in Singapore and owned a Swiss company, which in turn had seven
                    employees. The Mareva injunction prevented Art Family from paying an invoice for
                    IT engineering, and would have prevented it from paying the salaries of these
                    employees if not for the attenuating orders made by the Judge pursuant to the
                    appellants’ setting-aside applications (see [31] above as well as [125]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The possible damage done to the 14 affected
                    companies was mitigated by their early removal from the remit of the Mareva
                    injunction against Mr Bouvier. As mentioned earlier at [31] above, the
                    Judge subsequently varied the Mareva injunction as it was worded at the time of
                    its grant on 12 March 2015. Among other things, on 25 March 2015 (the
                    first of five days over which the <em>inter partes</em>
                    hearing of the appellants’ setting-aside applications took place), the
                    Judge removed the 14 affected companies from the schedule to the Mareva
                    injunction. However, it appears the respondents wrote to other parties appending
                    the Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier in a form that included the 14
                    affected companies as well as their assets and bank accounts in the accompanying
                    schedule <em>even after</em> the Judge had varied the
                    orders which she made on 12 March 2015 so as to remove them. We address
                    this point at [128]–[129] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Conduct subsequent to obtaining the Mareva
                injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    We turn finally to the respondents’
                    conduct subsequent to the grant of the Mareva injunction against
                    Mr Bouvier, which we consider also to have been unsatisfactory. The Mareva
                    injunction was put into wider circulation than was necessary for its efficacy,
                    and information was disseminated in a misleading manner. We cite two instances
                    of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    First, the respondents publicised the Mareva
                    injunction against Mr Bouvier just shortly after it was obtained. The
                        <em>Financial Times</em> published an online report of
                    the Mareva injunction within hours of its being granted. Ms Bersheda was
                    quoted as saying that “‘similar measures’ were going to be
                    taken around other jurisdictions ‘shortly’”. Nothing was put
                    forward by way of a reasonable explanation as to why it was thought necessary to
                    inform the international press of the fact that a Mareva injunction and other
                    ancillary orders had been made against Mr Bouvier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Second, we noted above (at [31] and [125])
                    that the Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier as it was worded at the time
                    of its grant on 12 March 2015 was attenuated by various orders made by the
                    Judge over the course of the <em>inter partes</em> hearing
                    of the appellants’ setting-aside applications on 25 March, 6–8
                    and 10 April 2015. Among other things, some of the entities originally
                    affected were removed from the schedule to the Mareva injunction, certain
                    exemptions were provided for, restrictions on the disclosure of the information
                    obtained were imposed and the scope of some of the disclosure orders made on
                    12 March 2015 was pared down. We reiterate that on 25 March 2015, the
                    first day of the aforesaid five-day <em>inter partes</em>
                    hearing, the 14 affected companies were removed from the schedule to the Mareva
                    injunction. The last of the attenuating amendments by the Judge was made on
                    10 April 2015. Yet, as late as 26 June 2015, the respondents were
                    still placing in circulation the Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier in
                    the way it was worded when it was granted on 12 March 2015, with the 14
                    affected companies as well as their assets and bank accounts listed in the
                    accompanying schedule. This was more than three months after the orders
                    originally made by the Judge on 12 March 2015 had been varied to remove
                    those 14 companies, among other things.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    In this regard, Mr Tong, counsel for
                    Mr Bouvier, placed before us a letter from Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, the
                    respondents’ English solicitors, to Sotheby’s dated 26 June
                    2015. The letter informed Sotheby’s that the Singapore court had issued a
                    worldwide Mareva injunction against Mr Bouvier, and appended the Mareva
                    injunction as it was worded at the time of its grant on 12 March 2015, with
                    (as we have just mentioned) the 14 affected companies as well as their assets
                    and bank accounts listed in the schedule annexed thereto. Mr Tong went
                    further to submit that this was done deliberately to damage the business
                    interests of some of these companies, which had dealings with Sotheby’s.
                    We need not go that far. It is sufficient to note that the respondents had a
                    powerful weapon in the form of a Mareva injunction (and a worldwide one at that)
                    in their armoury, and it was incumbent on them to exercise due care to ensure
                    that no greater damage was done than was <em>necessary</em>
                    to uphold the efficacy of the injunction. The gravity of the consequences of a
                    Mareva injunction, especially one that extends worldwide, mandates that close
                    and careful consideration be given to details such as its proper scope and the
                    parties who will be affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    While it might be possible to discount one
                    or another of the above factors had they transpired in isolation, the cumulative
                    picture that emerges from their totality is that the Mareva injunction against
                    Mr Bouvier was obtained by the respondents not out of a genuine fear that
                    the enforcement of an anticipated judgment of the court would be frustrated, but
                    rather, to oppress Mr Bouvier. This was an improper purpose and an abuse of
                    the process of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    We will close off this discussion on the
                    abuse of court process with an observation. When a plaintiff seeks a worldwide
                    Mareva injunction from a Singapore court, the plaintiff should ordinarily
                    undertake to the court that it shall not, without the court’s leave,
                    enforce the injunction or seek an order of a similar nature in any jurisdiction
                    outside Singapore. This is a standard undertaking found in the prescribed form
                    for a worldwide Mareva injunction: Form 7 of the Practice Directions at
                    Schedule 1, para 8. This undertaking plays a vital role because it
                    protects a defendant from the risk of oppression which may arise from a
                    multiplicity of suits: <em>Dadourian Group International Inc v
                        Simms and others</em> [2006] 1 WLR 2499 at [2] and [24]. Courts
                    have gone so far as to say that a worldwide Mareva injunction should not be
                    granted unless the plaintiff gives such an undertaking: <em>Re
                        Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA</em> [1994] 3 All ER
                    764 at 794. This undertaking was not given by the respondents, and it appears
                    that they have taken steps to enforce the Mareva injunction against
                    Mr Bouvier overseas without obtaining any leave from the court to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arguments by Mrs Rappo</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    We turn now to the position in respect of
                    Mrs Rappo. Her position is simpler than Mr Bouvier’s. She argues
                    that there is no real risk of dissipation in her case for three reasons. First,
                    none of the pleaded allegations show that she was dishonest. The fact that she
                    might have received tainted funds does not equate to dishonesty. Second, she
                    says that even if there is a good arguable case of dishonesty against her, it
                    does not equate to a real risk of dissipation. Third, she was not evasive about
                    the sums of money which she received from Mr Bouvier. She voluntarily
                    disclosed to the Monegasque police the fact that she had received payments from
                    Mr Bouvier, and she was forthright with her banks in her receipt of those
                    payments. These factors, Mrs Rappo submits, are inconsistent with a real
                    risk of dissipation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    To this, the respondents make three main
                    arguments in rebuttal. First, they contend that there is a good arguable case of
                    dishonesty against Mrs Rappo. Second, they point out that Mrs Rappo
                    “conducts her affairs internationally” through corporate vehicles.
                    They contend that given this “web of offshore companies and
                    accounts”, Mrs Rappo “clearly has the means and ability to
                    move about her funds”. Third, the respondents allege that Mrs Rappo
                    has been untruthful and evasive. They claim that she lied to the court about her
                    expenses when she asked for an increase in the carve-out for personal expenses
                    in the Mareva injunction made against her. She has also not complied with the
                    ancillary disclosure orders made by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In our judgment, on the evidence before us,
                    the respondents have not established a real risk that Mrs Rappo will
                    dissipate her assets. There are two principal reasons that underlie our
                    conclusion. First, the nature of the respondents’ allegations against
                    Mrs Rappo suggests a level of misfeasance akin to negligence or, perhaps,
                    wilful blindness rather than dishonesty. Second, there is no basis for any
                    suggestion that Mrs Rappo has attempted to conceal her assets. These two
                    reasons are addressed at [135]–[142] below. In addition, the reasons which
                    we gave at [108]–[130] above for finding the Mareva injunction against
                    Mr Bouvier to be an abuse of court process, as well as a number of the
                    points raised in those paragraphs, apply equally to Mrs Rappo. There is no
                    need for us to repeat those reasons and the salient points here. They explain
                    why we consider that the respondents’ injunction application against
                    Mrs Rappo was likewise motivated by an improper purpose. The
                    respondents’ abuse of court process therefore affords an independent basis
                    for setting aside the Mareva injunction and the ancillary disclosure orders made
                    against Mrs Rappo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Nature of the allegations of dishonesty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The respondents’ position is that
                    Mrs Rappo had been dishonest in receiving the payments from
                    Mr Bouvier. They invite us to draw this inference on the basis of the
                    following four propositions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mrs Rappo knew that
                        Mr Bouvier was acting as an agent and not a seller.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mrs Rappo knew that
                        Mr Bouvier was being paid a 2% commission for his services as an
                        agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mrs Rappo knew the price which the respondents paid for the artworks,
                        and so must have known that what she was being paid by Mr Bouvier was
                        in excess of the 2% commission that he was receiving.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_d"></a>(d)     Mrs Rappo lied to her bankers
                        and told them that she was receiving substantial sums from
                        Mr Rybolovlev in her capacity as his advisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The respondents’ position is premised on the notion that
                        Mrs Rappo had a keen understanding of the details of the commercial
                        relationship between Mr Bouvier and the
                respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In our judgment, support for that underlying
                    notion is thin. Many of the source documents which the respondents rely on do
                    not bear out the inference that Mrs Rappo had dishonestly received the
                    payments from Mr Bouvier. For example, neither Mr Bouvier’s nor
                    Mrs Rappo’s statements to the Monaco authorities suggest that
                    Mrs Rappo was aware of the workings of the relationship between
                    Mr Bouvier and the respondents. The transcripts in fact show the opposite.
                    As for the respondents’ contention that Mrs Rappo lied to her bankers
                    and informed them that the payments which she received from Mr Bouvier were
                    from Mr Rybolovlev instead for acting as the latter’s advisor, the
                    bank documents tendered by the respondents in support of their position are
                    mostly equivocal. One of them in fact refutes the respondents’ contention
                    as it states clearly that “TR [<em>ie</em>,
                    Mrs Rappo] was paid by <em>YB</em> [<em>ie</em>, Mr Bouvier] for her contribution in the business
                    …
                    <em>YB</em> pays a commission to TR for the introduction of
                    potential buyers …” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Based on the evidence before us, an equally
                    plausible account of Mrs Rappo’s role is that she interacted with
                    Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev primarily at a social level, but was not
                    privy to their business dealings. She did not know how the actual purchases of
                    the 38 artworks concerned were arranged. That was a matter between
                    Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev (acting through the respondents). The
                    extent of Mrs Rappo’s involvement was limited to her facilitation of
                    Mr Bouvier’s access to the Rybolovlevs. In our view, this alternative
                    account coheres more readily with the documentary evidence before us.
                    Mr Rybolovlev’s evidence to the Monaco police was that Mrs Rappo
                    often spoke highly of Mr Bouvier, arranged meetings between him
                    (Mr Rybolovlev) and Mr Bouvier, and was present at viewings with the
                    Rybolovlevs and Mr Bouvier. This view is also consistent with
                    Mr Bouvier’s statements to the Monaco police that “without
                    [Mrs Rappo,] [he] would not have maintained [his] relationship with
                    Mr Rybolovlev”, and that Mrs Rappo did not otherwise know much
                    about the transactions between him (Mr Bouvier) and the
                respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    But, even if the respondents’ case is
                    taken at its highest, the dishonesty alleged against Mrs Rappo goes no
                    further than her actual or imputed knowledge that she was receiving from
                    Mr Bouvier money which was being paid out of the latter’s undisclosed
                    profits. The complaint is that she was content to receive the substantial sums
                    that Mr Bouvier was paying her without inquiring further into the source of
                    those payments. To put it another way, she might have known or had reason to
                    suspect that the water supplied to her came from a tainted well, but she drank
                    it anyway. This is not a situation where Mrs Rappo took any steps to
                    deceive the respondents; nor is there anything to suggest that she was involved
                    with Mr Bouvier in the perpetration of a fraudulent scheme against the
                    respondents. It is telling that Mr Rybolovlev saw Mrs Rappo’s
                    dishonesty as stemming from (as he put it himself) her “betrayal”.
                    In our judgment, the allegations made against Mrs Rappo, even if eventually
                    found to be true, fall far short of having a real and material bearing on the
                    risk of her dissipating her assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Alleged concealment of assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    There is also no evidence which suggests
                    that Mrs Rappo attempted to conceal the payments which she received from
                    Mr Bouvier and what she did with them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Mrs Rappo was transparent with the
                    banks where she maintained the accounts into which Mr Bouvier’s
                    remittances were paid. She provided those banks with documentation relating to
                    the payments, including descriptions of the payments as
                    “commission[s]” from Mr Bouvier, the invoices that MEI Invest
                    issued to the respondents, as well as descriptions of the artworks that had been
                    sold. The money which Mrs Rappo received from Mr Bouvier was paid into
                    bank accounts held by companies that she owned, and the visibility of her
                    ownership of these companies was unobscured. Those companies listed either
                    Mrs Rappo, or both her and her husband, Jacques Rappo, as the beneficiaries
                    of the bank accounts concerned. Indeed, our attention was drawn to the fact that
                    HSBC Monaco had erroneously informed the Monaco police that Mrs Rappo and
                        <em>Mr Bouvier</em> were listed as joint
                    beneficiaries for the accounts held by Mrs Rappo’s companies at that
                    bank. Mrs Rappo’s counsel, Mr Kenneth Tan SC, suggested
                    that this was the basis on which she had been detained by the Monaco
                    authorities, and submitted that this was a consequence of the considerable
                    influence which Mr Rybolovlev exercised in Monaco. We do not need to say
                    much on this beyond observing that HSBC Monaco’s statement to the above
                    effect was found and later admitted to have been made in error – the other
                    joint beneficiary of the bank accounts concerned was in fact <em>Mr Rappo</em> and not Mr Bouvier. Moreover, when
                    Mrs Rappo was questioned by the Monaco authorities, she was candid in
                    admitting that she had received payments from Mr Bouvier. She also gave
                    information as to the bank accounts into which the money had been paid and what
                    the money had been used for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The respondents’ assertion that
                    Mrs Rappo is “experienced in intricate, sophisticated, international
                    transactions involving movements of large sums of money” is irrelevant
                    and also unsubstantiated. It is irrelevant because Mrs Rappo’s
                    alleged financial experience has nothing whatsoever to do with any allegedly
                    fraudulent conduct on her part. And it is unsubstantiated because apart from the
                    fact that Mrs Rappo holds her assets through Monaco companies, there is
                    nothing to suggest that she in fact possesses unusual international financial
                    expertise or sophistication. The evidence suggests, rather, that she leaves
                    financial matters to her financial advisors, Monaco Asset Management and Moores
                    &amp; Rowland, who control her companies and manage her assets.
                    Mrs Rappo’s reason for holding her assets through companies instead
                    of directly is, in her words, for the “transmission of wealth”.
                    Even if this may seem implausible, it nonetheless does not advance the
                    respondents’ case because we do not think that the mere fact that
                    Mrs Rappo holds her assets through companies is sufficient in itself to
                    suggest anything sinister so as to warrant drawing the inference that she is
                    therefore likely to dissipate her assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The respondents also rely on some
                    inconsistencies in Mrs Rappo’s position in the Monaco proceedings as
                    compared to the Singapore proceedings. They further point to the fact that
                    Mrs Rappo did not comply with the asset disclosures ordered by the Judge,
                    even after her application for a stay of the ancillary disclosure orders against
                    her was dismissed. These factors may in exceptional circumstances prove to be
                    relevant, but, in the absence of little else to go on in the present case, they
                    do not suffice to establish a real risk of dissipation where Mrs Rappo is
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether interlocutory proprietary injunctions should be granted to
                prevent the appellants from dealing with the Excess Payments and their traceable
                proceeds</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    We turn to the second species of
                    interlocutory injunctions sought by the respondents, namely, the interlocutory
                    proprietary injunctions (see [34] above). These are different from Mareva
                    injunctions, and the difference between them was elucidated by the English Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Polly Peck International Plc v Asil Nadir and
                        others</em> [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 238 (“<em>Polly Peck v Nadir</em>”). A Mareva injunction is
                    granted in support of a claim for personal relief. It is ambulatory and does not
                    latch on to any specific asset of the defendant. What it does is to prevent the
                    defendant from dissipating his assets beyond a certain value to defeat a
                    possible judgment that may in due course be rendered against him. The Mareva
                    injunction is a specialised form of injunction to which the principles that
                    generally govern interlocutory injunctions, as laid down in <em>American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd</em> [1975] AC 396
                        (“<em>American Cyanamid</em>”), have
                        <em>no</em> application: <em>Polly Peck
                        v Nadir</em> at 242.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    An interlocutory proprietary injunction, on
                    the other hand, is granted in support of a claim for proprietary relief. It is a
                    prohibitory injunction that fastens on the specific asset in which the plaintiff
                    asserts a proprietary interest. It prevents the defendant, pending the
                    resolution of the dispute, from dealing with that asset and its traceable
                    proceeds. An interlocutory proprietary injunction <em>is</em> governed by the <em>American
                        Cyanamid</em> principles: <em>Polly Peck v
                        Nadir</em> at 248 <em>per</em> Scott LJ and
                    at 250 <em>per</em> Lord Donaldson.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The respondents, as an alternative to Mareva
                    injunctions, seek interlocutory proprietary injunctions to protect their alleged
                    equitable proprietary interest in the Excess Payments and their traceable
                    proceeds. This is presumably on the basis that the Excess Payments (which, at
                    present, have yet to be ascertained and quantified) are secret profits that were
                    impressed with a constructive trust upon their receipt by Mr Bouvier in
                    breach of his fiduciary duties (see <em>Thahir Kartika Ratna v PT
                        Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina)</em> [1994]
                    3 SLR(R) 312 (“<em>Thahir v
                    Pertamina</em>”) at [57] <em>per</em>
                    Thean JA; <em>FHR European Ventures LLP and others v Cedar
                        Capital Partners LLC</em> [2015] AC 250 at [46]–[50] <em>per</em> Lord Neuberger). The respondents’ claims
                    for proprietary relief are <em>distinct from and made in the
                        alternative</em> to their claims for personal relief against the
                    appellants for breach of fiduciary duties, knowing assistance and knowing
                    receipt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The respondents argue that “the
                    balance of convenience plainly lies in favour of granting” them the
                    interlocutory proprietary injunctions sought. They rely on <em>Madoff Securities</em>, where Flaux J granted (among other
                    freezing orders) interlocutory proprietary injunctions in similar circumstances.
                    The respondents contend that if the interlocutory proprietary injunctions which
                    they seek are not granted, the Excess Payments and their traceable proceeds may
                    be disposed of, leaving the respondents with only claims for personal relief
                    against the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Apart from seeking interlocutory proprietary
                    injunctions in respect of the Excess Payments and their traceable proceeds, the
                    respondents also seek an interlocutory proprietary injunction over a distinct
                    and more limited pool of funds. The respondents claim that in December 2014,
                    they instructed Mr Bouvier to sell a Toulouse-Lautrec which they owned.
                    Mr Bouvier did so in February 2015 through his BVI company, Blanca Flor, at
                    a public auction at Sotheby’s. Blanca Flor then transferred the sale
                    proceeds (“the Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds”), which amounted to
                    £10,789,000, to a bank account held by MEI Invest. The respondents say that
                    Mr Bouvier has refused to hand those sales proceeds over to them, which is
                    in breach of his fiduciary duties. Mr Bouvier’s position, on the
                    other hand, is that he had agreed with Mr Rybolovlev that the
                    Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds would be applied towards discharging the debt
                    which the respondents owed for the Rothko, <em>No 6 (Violet,
                        vert et rouge)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The appellants argue against the grant of
                    interlocutory proprietary injunctions at two levels. First, both Mr Bouvier
                    and Mrs Rappo argue that there is no serious question to be tried.
                    Specifically, Mr Bouvier submits that there is no serious question that the
                    respondents will <em>not</em> be able to establish a
                    proprietary interest in the Excess Payments and their traceable proceeds. He
                    says that the respondents’ claims in respect of those payments are
                    governed by Swiss law, which does not recognise proprietary claims. Under Swiss
                    law, therefore, the respondents will be limited to claims for personal relief
                    against him. It follows, Mr Bouvier submits, that the respondents’
                    arguments in support of the interlocutory proprietary injunctions sought do not
                    even get off the ground. As for Mrs Rappo, her argument is that there is no
                    serious question to be tried that she is <em>not</em>
                    liable for knowing receipt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    At the second level, Mr Bouvier argues
                    that the balance of convenience does not lie in favour of granting the
                    interlocutory proprietary injunctions which the respondents seek. It would be
                    oppressive to him if interlocutory proprietary injunctions were imposed on the
                    Excess Payments and their traceable proceeds. No written submissions were filed
                    on this second point, but Mr Bouvier’s counsel, Mr Tong, made
                    very brief oral arguments touching on it at the hearing of these
                appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    We have considerable reservations over
                    whether Singapore law applies to the respondents’ claims in respect of the
                    Excess Payments, and thus, whether the respondents have established a serious
                    question to be tried that they have a proprietary interest in those payments and
                    their traceable proceeds under the applicable law. Be that as it may, we need
                    not dismiss the respondents’ application for interlocutory proprietary
                    injunctions on this basis. Rather, we are satisfied that that application should
                    be dismissed because, on the facts of the present case, the balance of
                    convenience does not lie in favour of granting the interlocutory proprietary
                    injunctions sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A serious question to be tried</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    It is trite that the court does not engage
                    in complex questions of law or fact at the interlocutory stage. In respect of an
                    application for an interlocutory proprietary injunction, the first requirement
                    of showing that there is a serious question to be tried will be satisfied as
                    long as “the plaintiffs have a seriously arguable case that they [have] a
                    proprietary interest”: <em>Derby v Weldon
                        (No 1)</em> at 64A–64B <em>per</em>
                    Nicholls LJ. It is also trite that if any question of foreign law arises in
                    this regard, the foreign law concerned has to be pleaded and proved. In the
                    absence of such proof, the law of the forum applies by default to the claim in
                    respect of which the interlocutory proprietary injunction is
                sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    In our judgment, there is some force in
                    Mr Bouvier’s argument that the governing law of the
                    respondents’ claims against him in respect of the Excess Payments is Swiss
                    law. The first step in the choice of law methodology is the characterisation of
                    the issue before the court. There are two possible characterisations of the
                    respondents’ claims in respect of the Excess Payments. The first
                    characterisation is contractual, with the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties
                    by Mr Bouvier arising out of and having their “root source”
                    in the alleged agency contract between the respondents and Mr Bouvier. On
                    this characterisation, the applicable choice of law rule will be the proper law
                    of the contract: <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v
                        Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [83]. The
                    second possible characterisation of the respondents’ claims in respect of
                    the Excess Payments is restitutionary, with the claims being seen as an attempt
                    to enforce an obligation to restore the benefit of an alleged unjust enrichment.
                    On this characterisation, the applicable law will be: (a) the proper law of
                    the contract (if the obligation to restore the alleged unjust benefit arises in
                    connection with a contract); or (b) the proper law of the country where the
                    enrichment occurs: <em>Thahir v Pertamina</em> at
                    [37].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    There are strong arguments that an
                    application of any of these choice of law rules will lead to Swiss law as the
                    applicable law for the respondents’ claims in respect of the Excess
                    Payments. There are multiple connections between Mr Bouvier’s
                    dealings with the respondents and Switzerland. The first few transactions
                    between Mr Bouvier and the respondents, which we described at [60] above,
                    were expressly stipulated to be governed by Swiss law and subject to the
                    jurisdiction of the Geneva courts. The parties thereafter dealt on the basis of
                    an alleged oral agency agreement as well as over emails and invoices, but on
                    very similar terms. Many of the meetings between Mr Bouvier on the one hand
                    and Mr Rybolovlev or Mr Sazonov on the other concerning the
                    acquisition of the 38 artworks continued to take place in Geneva. The payment
                    for these artworks was always made to MEI Invest’s bank accounts in
                    Geneva. We accept that the dealings in question also had links to other foreign
                    jurisdictions apart from Switzerland. For example, there were meetings in Monaco
                    between Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev at the latter’s residence,
                    but these were mostly for leisure; Mr Bouvier only went to Monaco to talk
                    to Mr Rybolovlev solely about art on one or two occasions each year. The
                    respondents also made payment for a number of the 38 artworks out of their bank
                    accounts in Monaco. However, notwithstanding such links between the transactions
                    concerned and foreign jurisdictions other than Switzerland, the facts before us
                    suggest that Swiss law has the closest and most real connection to the
                    relationship between Mr Bouvier and the respondents. It is also the law of
                    the place where the enrichment occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Swiss law does not recognise proprietary
                    claims for breaches of fiduciary duties; nor does it recognise the concept of a
                    constructive trust. Under Swiss law, any relief which the respondents may have
                    for their claims in respect of the Excess Payments will be limited to a claim in
                    damages. In the expert reports that were filed in the pending stay applications
                    in Singapore mentioned at [11] above, both Professor Corinne Widmer
                    Lüchinger (Mr Bouvier’s expert) and Mr Marc Abby Joory (the
                    respondents’ expert) were in agreement on this point. Both acknowledged
                    the non-availability of claims for proprietary relief and the absence of tracing
                    rules under Swiss law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    But, we prefer not to dismiss the
                    respondents’ application for interlocutory proprietary injunctions solely
                    on this ground because little, if any, argument was made on the governing law of
                    the respondents’ claims in respect of the Excess Payments. Mr Tong
                    raised the applicability of Swiss law as the governing law as a parting shot
                    towards the end of his oral arguments, and his written submissions on this point
                    were very brief, consisting mostly of bare assertions. The respondents have not
                    made any submissions on the law applicable to their claims in respect of the
                    Excess Payments. It suffices for us to say that even if the respondents’
                    arguments in support of the governing law and the merits of their claims for
                    proprietary relief cross the seriously arguable threshold, they do so only
                    barely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    We turn to address the second requirement
                    which must be satisfied before the interlocutory proprietary injunctions sought
                    by the respondents can be granted, which is that the balance of convenience must
                    lie in favour of granting them such injunctions, assuming that they have a
                    seriously arguable case as to the existence of a proprietary interest in the
                    Excess Payments and their traceable proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The balance of convenience</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    The balance of convenience affords a firmer
                    basis for us to rest our decision to dismiss the respondents’ application
                    for interlocutory proprietary injunctions. We should emphasise that the
                    respondents are asserting a proprietary interest in a fungible asset –
                    money. They do not assert a proprietary interest in unique property, or property
                    that cannot be readily purchased or substituted on the market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    There are benefits to asserting a
                    proprietary interest in a specific ascertained pool of funds, in that the
                    claimant will be able to prove as a secured creditor in the event of the
                    defendant’s insolvency, and will be entitled to any accretions traceable
                    to that pool of funds. In the present case, however, there is nothing in the
                    evidence that suggests that either Mr Bouvier or Mrs Rappo or any of
                    their companies face the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency. There is no
                    suggestion that either Mr Bouvier or Mrs Rappo has made a windfall
                    from what they applied the Excess Payments (in Mr Bouvier’s case) and
                    the sums received out of the Excess Payments (in Mrs Rappo’s case)
                    to. Nor is the respondents’ application for interlocutory proprietary
                    injunctions made in respect of a specific ascertained pool of money, except
                    where the Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds are concerned (see [159] below). The
                    respondents have provided no justification as to why the balance of convenience
                    lies in favour of granting them the interlocutory proprietary injunctions
                    sought. All that their argument hangs on is an assertion in their submissions
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the injunction[s] were not granted and the Respondents succeed in the
                        Suit, the Excess Payments, the [Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds] (and any
                        product in which they can be traced) may very well have been disposed of or
                        are no longer traceable, leaving the Respondents with only a monetary claim,
                        when such Payments, proceeds (and/or traceable product) belonged, in equity,
                        to the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In other words, according to the respondents, the only
                        prejudice that will be caused by the court’s refusal to grant them the
                        interlocutory proprietary injunctions which they seek is the prejudice
                        arising from their being <em>wrongly</em> refused the
                        injunctions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Of course, such prejudice can notionally
                    constitute sufficient prejudice; but, stacked against this is the prejudice that
                    would be occasioned to the appellants should the interlocutory proprietary
                    injunctions sought eventually be found to have been wrongly granted. We have
                    just highlighted (at [158] above) that, with the exception of the
                    Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds, the interlocutory proprietary injunctions which
                    the respondents seek are not directed at any specific and ascertained fund.
                    Instead, the interlocutory proprietary injunctions sought cover vast and
                    presently unquantified sums of money which were paid over the course of more
                    than a decade. A concomitant to the grant of the interlocutory proprietary
                    injunctions sought would be disclosure orders that would allow the respondents
                    to locate the traceable proceeds of this undefined pool of money down to the
                    last cent. This will place an immensely oppressive burden of disclosure on the
                    appellants. The effort, expense and disruption that would be occasioned to the
                    appellants by the grant of such interlocutory proprietary injunctions and
                    ancillary disclosure orders will be considerable, to say the least. In our
                    judgment, this shifts the balance of convenience decisively against granting the
                    interlocutory proprietary injunctions which the respondents seek.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Against such a conclusion stands
                    Flaux J’s decision in <em>Madoff
                    Securities</em>, which the respondents rely heavily on and which we have
                    considered most anxiously because of the eminence and experience of the learned
                    judge. We earlier set out the facts in <em>Madoff
                        Securities</em> at [82] above. In that case, Flaux J granted
                    interlocutory proprietary injunctions over millions of dollars that the Kohn
                    defendants were alleged to have received in secret kickbacks over some 30 years.
                    He also granted ancillary disclosure orders in support of the injunctions. At
                    [140], Flaux J rejected the argument that the injunctions would be
                    oppressive to the Kohn defendants:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, once the position has been reached, as it has in the
                        present case, that the claimant shows a sufficiently arguable case for a
                        proprietary remedy, then, as Staughton LJ stated in the Duvalier case
                            [<em>ie</em>, <em>Republic of Haiti
                            v Duvalier</em> (cited at [2] above)], the court will more readily
                        afford that claimant with interim remedies by way of injunction and
                        disclosure orders. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    We respectfully part company with
                    Flaux J on this point for three reasons. First, it is unclear whether
                    Flaux J was applying the <em>American Cyanamid</em>
                    balance of convenience test at all. His answer to the potentially oppressive
                    ramifications of the interlocutory proprietary injunctions sought by the
                    plaintiffs is set out at [140] of <em>Madoff
                        Securities</em> as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… As I said during the course of the argument, given a sufficiently
                        arguable case that the Kohn defendants have had [the plaintiffs’]
                        money, arguments by Mrs Kohn along the lines of: ‘it would be
                        frightfully inconvenient to tell you what I’ve done with your money or
                        to be prevented from continuing to use it’ when, <em>on
                            this hypothesis she should not have had the money in the first place, do
                            not cut much ice</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>With respect, the correct approach to assessing the balance of
                        convenience, in our judgment, is to consider the prejudice to the defendant
                            <em>in the event that the plaintiff’s hypothesis is
                            refuted at the trial</em>, rather than to analyse the matter
                        primarily on the assumption that the plaintiff’s hypothesis will
                        eventually be proved. Perhaps, Flaux J adopted the approach which he
                        took because the documentary evidence against the Kohn defendants was
                        overwhelming (he said at [12] of <em>Madoff
                            Securities</em> that some of the evidence against the Kohn
                        defendants “crie[d] out for a proper explanation”), and he was
                        therefore comfortable to proceed on the assumption that the plaintiffs would
                        succeed at the trial given the exceptional circumstances of that case. In
                            <em>Madoff Securities</em>, there was also no
                        dispute that if the plaintiffs’ allegations were proved, the
                        plaintiffs would have been entitled to a proprietary interest in the monies
                        concerned. In the present appeals, in contrast, as we pointed out earlier,
                        there remain many unanswered questions and, indeed, it is doubtful whether
                        the respondents are even entitled to a proprietary remedy in respect of the
                        Excess Payments (and their traceable proceeds) and the Toulouse-Lautrec sale
                        proceeds even assuming they make good their factual
                    allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Second, Flaux J’s reasoning in
                        <em>Madoff Securities</em> was based in part on
                        <em>Republic of Haiti v Duvalier</em> (cited earlier at
                    [2] above), a decision of the English Court of Appeal. In the passage from
                        <em>Madoff Securities</em> which we quoted at [160]
                    above, Flaux J referred to what Staughton LJ “stated in the
                    Duvalier case”, <em>ie</em>, to
                    Staughton LJ’s judgment at 213–214 of <em>Republic of Haiti v Duvalier</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may be that the powers of the court are wider, and certainly discretion
                        is more readily exercised, if a plaintiff’s claim is what is called a
                        tracing claim. For my part, I think that the true distinction lies between a
                        proprietary claim on the one hand, and a claim which seeks only a money
                        judgment on the other. A proprietary claim is one by which the plaintiff
                        seeks the return of chattels or land which are his property, or claims that
                        a specified debt is owed by a third party to him and not to the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus far there is no difficulty. A plaintiff who seeks to enforce a claim
                        of that kind will more readily be afforded interim remedies, in order to
                        preserve the asset which he is seeking to recover, than one who merely seeks
                        a judgment for debt or damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>With respect, this passage must be considered in its proper
                        context. Staughton LJ’s remarks were not directed at the balance
                        of convenience test in the context of an application for an interlocutory
                        proprietary injunction. Instead, Staughton LJ was discussing the
                        exercise of the court’s <em>power</em> to grant
                        interim relief in relation to assets outside the jurisdiction. The point
                        which Staughton LJ was making was that the exercise of extraterritorial
                        power at the interlocutory stage was less objectionable where a proprietary
                        rather than a personal remedy was being asserted. The above <em>dictum</em> therefore does not support the view that the
                        balance of convenience will always or even generally lie in favour of
                        granting an interlocutory proprietary injunction whenever a proprietary
                        claim is asserted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Our third and final reason for
                    distinguishing <em>Madoff Securities</em> is that we have
                    found no other decision where an interlocutory proprietary injunction has been
                    granted over a diffuse and unascertained pool of funds, although, even in the
                    absence of this point, we would still not have granted the interlocutory
                    proprietary injunctions sought by the respondents as the balance of convenience
                    does not lie in their favour. In <em>Republic of Haiti v
                        Duvalier</em>, Staughton LJ referred to “chattels or
                    land” or “a specified debt” as being the possible subjects
                    of an interlocutory proprietary injunction. In <em>A and B v C,
                        D, E, F, G and H</em> [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 200, Goff J
                    granted an interlocutory proprietary injunction over a specified sum of
                    £383,872.44 in the account of the defendant bank or the traceable proceeds
                    of that sum. In <em>Polly Peck v Nadir</em>, the
                    interlocutory proprietary injunction sought was over a sum of £8.9m in the
                    account of the defendant bank. In <em>Cherney v
                    Neuman</em>, Judge Waksman QC granted an interlocutory
                    proprietary injunction over a sum of £1m, being the amount received by the
                    defendant from specific share purchases, and any value-added tax reclaim monies
                    arising from that. Judge Waksman QC was evidently persuaded to grant
                    the interlocutory proprietary injunction because “[it was] much more
                        <em>specific and limited</em> than the general freezing
                    relief sought” [emphasis added]: <em>Cherney v
                        Neuman</em> at [102].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    We note that this final objection of the
                    respondents seeking interlocutory proprietary injunctions over a diffuse and
                    unquantified pool of funds does not apply with equal force to the
                    Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds, which form a specific and quantified sum of
                    money. But, we reiterate that even in the absence of this factor, we do not
                    think the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the respondents the
                    interlocutory proprietary injunctions which they seek. The respondents’
                    claims for proprietary relief in respect of the Excess Payments and their
                    traceable proceeds are, as indicated earlier, barely arguable, and no cogent
                    reasons have been proffered as to why the balance of convenience lies in favour
                    of granting them the interlocutory proprietary injunctions sought. To the extent
                    that the injunctions are sought in respect of the entirety of the Excess
                    Payments and their traceable proceeds, we have explained our concerns in the
                    context of orders which affect funds that are neither specific nor ascertained.
                    And to the extent that the injunctions are limited to the Toulouse-Lautrec sale
                    proceeds, even assuming there is a serious question to be tried as to the
                    respondents’ claims for proprietary relief in respect of those sale
                    proceeds, two factors tilt the balance of convenience <em>against</em> granting even such limited injunctions, namely:
                    (a) the Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds constitute a fungible asset –
                    money – as opposed to unique property or property that cannot be readily
                    purchased or substituted on the market (see [157] above); and (b) on the
                    evidence before us, there is simply <em>nothing</em> to
                    suggest that it would be beyond Mr Bouvier’s means to meet a monetary
                    judgment for the amount of the Toulouse-Lautrec sale proceeds, and in the final
                    analysis, that is all that the respondents seek where those sale proceeds are
                    concerned. We therefore refuse to grant the respondents the interlocutory
                    proprietary injunctions which they seek.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    In the circumstances, and for the reasons
                    elaborated above, we allow the present appeals and discharge the Mareva
                    injunctions and ancillary disclosure orders made by the Judge. We will hear the
                    parties on costs and on whether an inquiry as to damages should be
                    ordered.</p>
