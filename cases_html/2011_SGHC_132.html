<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Summons No 521 of 2011 is an application in
                    connection with the judicial review proceedings in Originating Summons
                    No 1252 of 2010 (“OS 1252/2010”). It is a discovery

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Applicant had by a letter, dated
                    24 January 2011, invited the SMC to provide discovery of the above
                    documents which the SMC by a letter, dated 31 January 2011,
                    declined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The application for discovery is pursuant to
                    O 24 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”). It should be noted, however, that the Applicant has
                    sought both prerogative and non-prerogative relief in OS 1252/2010. I
                    entertain some doubt as to whether the discovery process is applicable if an
                    applicant for judicial review is seeking prerogative relief. Woo Bih Li J
                    in <em>Yip Kok Seng v Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners
                        Board</em> [2010] 4 SLR 990 made the following
                    observation (at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our O 53 derives from the pre-1977 O 53 in the English
                        equivalent ("English O 53") of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965,
                        with the distinction that it is (since 1994) begun by <em>ex parte</em> originating summons and not
                        originating motion. The procedure is both uncertain and cumbersome.
                            <em>It is not clear whether certain processes applicable
                            to ordinary originating summons, such as discovery, are applicable
                            in addition to those prescribed under O</em> <em>53</em>. An applicant seeking both prerogative and
                        ordinary remedies is obliged to proceed via two separate originating
                        processes, and again it is not clear whether subsequent consolidation is
                        possible. From the perspective of a public body, it enjoys the procedural
                        protection in O 53, such as the requirement for leave and the limitation of
                        time, in respect of actions for the prerogative remedies, but not in actions
                        for other remedies. A detailed consideration of these procedural issues can
                        be found in Lord Diplock's leading speech in <em>O'Reilly v Mackman</em> [1983] 2 AC
                            237 ("<em>O'Reilly</em>") at 280-282.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There seems to have been some doubt in English law (prior to the 1977
                    amendments to O 53 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 (SI 1965
                    No 1776) (UK) (“RSC”)) as to whether discovery was
                    permissible in judicial review proceedings in which prerogative remedies were
                    sought (see Oliver Sanders, “Disclosure of Documents in Claims for
                    Judicial Review” [2006] JR 194 at 195). Denning LJ in <em>Barnard v National Dock Labour Board</em> [1953] 2 QB 18
                    held (at 43) that there is “no discovery” in <em>certiorari</em> applications (also see <em>O’Reilly v Mackman</em> [1983] 2 AC 237 at 281 (<em>per</em> Lord Diplock)). However, the UK Law
                    Commission’s <em>Report on Remedies in Administrative
                        Law</em> (Cmd 6407) in 1976 noted (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) that the general power to order discovery under O 24
                    of the RSC was <em>prima facie</em> applicable to O 53
                    of the RSC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although there is no specific rule relating to discovery in Order 53
                        of the Rules of the Supreme Court <em>there is a general
                            power under rule 3 of Order 24 to order discovery in any “cause
                            or matter (whether begun by writ, originating summons or
                            otherwise)”</em>. However, Denning LJ, in <em>Barnard v National Dock Labour Board</em>, said that
                        there was no discovery in certiorari and certainly we know of no case where
                        it has been ordered. Similarly there is a general power to order
                        interrogatories under rule 1(1) of Order 26 in respect of ‘any cause
                        or matter’, but here again we know of no prerogative order proceedings
                        in which such an order has been made. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Neither party addressed me on whether discovery
                    is in principle available in these judicial review proceedings. In my view,
                    however, whatever the historical position, discovery should, in principle, be
                    available in all judicial review proceedings. As the English Law Commission has
                    observed (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above), O 24, r 1
                    of the ROC is unqualified in its application to “any party to a cause or
                    matter”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Subject to this Rule and Rules 2 and 7, the Court may at any time
                        order <em>any party to a cause or matter (whether begun by
                            writ, originating summons or otherwise)</em> to give discovery by
                        making and serving on any other party a list of the documents which are or
                        have been in his possession, custody or power, and may at the same time or
                        subsequently also order him to make and file an affidavit verifying such a
                        list and to serve a copy thereof on the other party. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The first threshold cited by the Applicant is
                    O 24 r 5 of the ROC under which she must show <em>prima
                        facie</em> that: (a) the documents sought were or are in the other
                    party’s possession, custody or power; (b) the particular documents are
                    relevant; and (c) discovery is necessary either for disposing fairly of the
                    matter or for saving costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The core contemplation of O 24 of the ROC
                    relates to civil litigation and it is common ground that this is not such a
                    discovery application. It is a discovery application made in relation to a
                    judicial review of the actions of the SMC pursuant to the Medical Registration
                    Act (Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed) (“MRA”) . The adduction of fresh
                    evidence in judicial review proceedings is necessarily limited because in such
                    reviews the court does not make findings of fact based on evidence. The
                    court’s role in judicial review is limited to determining whether, based
                    on the record, the action of the SMC under challenge, ought to be quashed or
                    prohibited by reason of illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety (to
                    adopt the convenient categorisations enunciated by Lord Diplock in
                        <em>Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil
                        Service</em> [1985] AC 374 at 410–411).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The underlying differences between discovery
                    applications in civil actions and in judicial review is succinctly stated by
                    Lord Bingham in <em>Tweed v Parades Commission for Northern
                        Ireland</em> [2007] 1 AC 650 (“<em>Tweed</em>”) in the following terms at [2]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The disclosure of documents in civil litigation has been recognised
                        throughout the common law world as a valuable means of eliciting the truth
                        and thus of enabling courts to base their decisions on a sure foundation of
                        fact. But the process of disclosure can be costly, time-consuming,
                        oppressive and unnecessary, and neither in Northern Ireland nor in England
                        and Wales have the general rules governing disclosure been applied to
                        applications for judicial review. Such applications, characteristically,
                        raise an issue of law, the facts being common ground or relevant only to
                        show how the issue arises. So disclosure of documents has usually been
                        regarded as unnecessary and that remains the position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The relevant reasons for adopting this restrictive approach are also
                    stated by Lord Carswell in <em>Tweed</em> at
                    [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reasons which have hitherto been regarded as providing grounds for
                        maintaining these principles are (a) the obligation resting on a public
                        authority to make candid disclosure to the court of its decision making
                        process, laying before it the relevant facts and the reasoning behind the
                        decision challenged ... [and] (b) the undesirability of allowing
                        “fishing expeditions”, where an applicant for judicial review
                        may not have a positive case to make against an administrative decision and
                        wishes to obtain disclosure of documents in the hope of turning up something
                        out of which to fashion a possible challenge …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that Lord Carswell was inclined to adopt a
                    more flexible approach (at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I do consider, however, that it would now be desirable to
                        substitute for the rules hitherto applied a more flexible and less
                        prescriptive principle, which judges the need for disclosure in accordance
                        with the requirement of the particular case, taking into account the facts
                        and circumstances. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discovery of documents relating to SMC’s revocation of the
                1st DC and appointment of the 2nd DC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The judicial review record, which comprises the
                    Applicant’s statement in support, the Respondent’s affidavit in
                    reply and the Applicant’s affidavits in response, together with all
                    annexures, includes two material emails in which the members of the SMC first
                    revoked the appointment of the 1st DC and subsequently appointed the
                    2nd DC. The Applicant’s case on judicial review relating to bias or
                    apprehension of bias is founded, <em>inter alia</em>, on
                    the SMC Registrar and one witness and two 1st DC members being recipients
                    of the two emails. The recipients of the two emails are all clearly identified
                    and include the SMC Registrar and the 1st DC members and
                witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It is pertinent to note that the content of
                    these emails to all SMC members which evince the SMC’s decisions to first
                    revoke the appointment of the 1st DC and subsequently to appoint the
                    2nd DC are self-explanatory. The email dated 3 September 2010

                            Counsel made a procedural application for the Disciplinary Committee
                            (DC) to recuse itself. Details of this case can be given <u>only</u> at the conclusion of the inquiry and until
                            then, we seek your kind understanding and patience on this
                            matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    As the result of the DC having recused itself, it
                            is now necessary for the Singapore Medical Council to revoke the
                            appointment of the current DC hearing this inquiry and appoint a new DC
                            pursuant to Section 42(5) of the Medical Registration Act,
                        i.e.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“<em>The Medical Council may at any time revoke the
                            appointment of any Disciplinary Committee or may remove any member of a
                            Disciplinary Committee or fill any vacancy in a Disciplinary
                            Committee.”</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The new DC will be appointed in due course and a
                            separate email will be sent to you shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Council’s approval is sought on this
                            administrative matter to revoke the current DC to allow SMC to move
                            forward on this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    We will take it that members have no objections if
                            we do not hear from you by <u>Tuesday, 7 September
                                2010</u>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The second email dated 13 September 2010,
                    sent by and to the same parties, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    I refer to my email below [3 September 2010]
                            where a new Disciplinary Committee (DC) has to be appointed for the
                            inquiry for Dr Lim Mey Lee Susan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The DC proposed to hear the case [is] as
                            follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Proposed Members for DC – Dr Lim Mey Lee
                            Susan</u></b>
<b>:-</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prof Tan Ser Kiat (Chairman)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prof C Rajasoorya</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Abraham Kochitty</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A/Prof Koh Ming Choo Pearlie (Layperson)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Vinodh Coomaraswamy SC (Legal Assessor)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    All proposed DC members have declared that they
                            have no conflict of interests and are agreeable to the appointment. In
                            the meantime, we would be grateful that members do not discuss or
                            mention this case (despite of what has been reported in the papers) so
                            that the DC inquiry is not compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Members’ approval is sought for the
                            appointment of the above DC. We will assume that members have no
                            objections if we do not hear from you by <b><u>5pm,
                                Tuesday, 14 Sep 2010</u></b>.</p>

<u>[</u>emphasis in original<u>]</u></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both emails required no reply and the SMC confirmed that none was
                    received by the due dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In short, the Applicant’s complaint that
                    the Registrar and the two members and a witness of the 1st DC had received
                    the emails is palpably evident in the record. It is also palpably evident on
                    record that no express agreement was sought by the emails nor were any received
                    by the due response dates from any member of the SMC. In the light of the above,
                    the discovery application for all documents relating to the SMC’s action
                    first in revoking the appointment of the 1st DC and second in appointing
                    the 2nd DC is not necessary for disposing fairly of the Applicant’s
                    case for judicial review on the record.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discovery of documents relating to SMC’s appointment of the
                1st DC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     There is no correspondence, emails and minutes
                    evidencing SMC’s appointment of the 1st DC and the discussions
                    relating to the 1st DC’s appointment in the record. The Applicant
                    concedes that there is no allegation of bias or apprehension of bias against the
                    process by which the 1st DC was appointed. There is therefore, on the
                    record, no question raised of any contemporaneous bias or apprehension of bias
                    on the part of the SMC when it appointed the 1st DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is only because of the Applicant’s
                    challenge of the SMC’s appointment of the 2nd DC that the Applicant
                    now seeks discovery of the documents relating to the appointment of the
                    1st DC. The discovery application for these documents relating to the
                    appointment of the 1st DC is remote to her challenge of the appointment of
                    the 2nd DC. The subject matter of OS 1252/2010 relates to the
                    2nd DC and all the core documents relating to the 2nd DC required for
                    the Applicant to make her case are in the record. The heart of the 2nd DC
                    appointment is in the record, these being the emails, reproduced above at
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> and <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>, which are self-explanatory. The discovery application for
                    these documents relating to the appointment of the 1st DC is again not
                    necessary for disposing fairly of the Applicant’s case on the
                    record.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discovery of papers relating to reg 42</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This discovery application seeks discovery of
                    all minutes, papers and reports of the SMC in relation to the amendment of
                    reg 42 and it being brought into effect on 20 September 2010. Under
                    the MRA, regulations may be made by the SMC with the approval of the Minister
                    for Health. The Applicant has applied for a declaration that reg 42 is void
                    as it violates the rules of natural justice. It is also the Applicant’s
                    case that the amendment of reg 42 was targeted at her. In support of this
                    submission, the Applicant points out that reg 42 was brought into effect by
                    the SMC on 20 September 2010 about six days after the 2nd DC was
                    constituted (14 September 2010) and about four days after she was notified
                    that the SMC had appointed the 2nd DC (16 September 2010). It was
                    further submitted that the amendments brought into force on 20 September
                    2010 related principally to the disciplinary process and the availability of the
                    advice of legal assessors to the disciplinary committee. Further, the Applicant
                    avers that the entire amendments brought into effect on 20 September 2010
                    were subsequently repealed and reintroduced as part of a more comprehensive set
                    of regulations brought into effect in December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Insofar as the challenge to reg 42 is
                    based on it being contrary to natural justice, this challenge may be determined
                        <em>ex facie</em> on the content of the amended
                    reg 42. Insofar as the Applicant’s submission of bias or apprehension
                    of bias on the part of the SMC is founded on its content and legislative
                    chronology, this is public record. It is again not necessary for fairly
                    disposing of the Applicant’s case on the record.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     For the reasons set out above, each of these
                    applications for discovery is dismissed. The costs of these applications shall
                    be costs in the cause.</p>
