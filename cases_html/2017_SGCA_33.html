The Judge characterised Sintalow’s September letter as an offer made in the course of negotiations and not as a reflection of a binding contract. OSK’s November letter settled the list of agreed discounts and the general terms of supply and thereby superseded Sintalow’s September letter. Sintalow’s November letter was irrelevant to the contract because either it was signed before OSK’s November letter and was therefore superseded by the later letter, or, if issued later, was an ineffective attempt by Sintalow to unilaterally change terms which had already been agreed. Sintalow did not respond to it either in writing or orally.

A better, and less misleading, label for the Master Contract would be “General Terms and Conditions” applicable to the sale or supply of goods. General terms and conditions, by themselves, are not contracts for sale and purchase, but terms intended to apply to contracts of sale and purchase to be entered into by the buyer and the seller under a separate arrangement between the parties concerned.

</div> On this premise, the Judge then found that the Products Agreements subsequently entered into by the parties for the supply of the Products were subject to the Master Contract, and accordingly, the terms and conditions contained in any Products Agreement would be superseded by the terms of the Master Contract. It was on this premise that the Judge rejected Sintalow’s November letter as having any legal effect as it was “an ineffective attempt by [Sintalow] to unilaterally change terms which had already been agreed”.

</div> The Judge further found that this was also the reason why OSK did not respond to it either in writing or orally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 With respect, we are unable to agree with these findings. They are against the weight of the objective evidence. The Master Contract was drafted by OSK. There was no evidence that OSK had instructed its lawyers to draft it. But what it wanted of Sintalow was sufficiently clear. It wanted Sintalow to supply the Products on the general terms and conditions set out in the Master Contract. The terms were, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, (a) OSK was not obliged to buy any minimum quantity of the Products to obtain the Special Discounts, (b) if it did place an order for the Products, any quantity provided by OSK would be an estimated order, (c) all prices stated in Sintalow’s quotation as at 15 November 2007 would remain frozen during the duration of OSK’s sub-contract works, and (d) Sintalow must keep at least 10% extra existing stock at all times. These terms were wholly in favour of OSK and wholly uncommercial for any supplier to accept. Yet, Chew signed the Master Contract on behalf of Sintalow because, as he testified, he “gave in and signed the letter as he was in a hurry and wanted to preserve the relationship between parties”. However, what is significant is that he also “informed Mdm Oh at the same time that he would document [Sintalow’s] objections in a separate letter”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the same day, Chew sent Sintalow’s November letter in which, instead of documenting Sintalow’s objections to the Master Contract, referred to the several discussions on the TPA, and requested OSK to send its: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…final bill of quantity [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, purchase orders] for total prices consideration and our supply condition, the quantities shall be based on +/-10% with break down delivery schedule for our arrangement. Upon received your required information, we will submit our official quotation for both parties perusal and agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 What Sintalow was saying in this letter was that if and when OSK placed orders for the Products, Sintalow would quote its supply conditions, the quantities ordered would be subject to the 10% Variation Term, and OSK was required to provide delivery schedules to enable Sintalow to arrange timely deliveries in respect of any particular orders that OSK placed. The effect of this letter, while not quite in the form of documenting objections, was to make it clear that where particular orders were placed by OSK, Sintalow would stipulate these matters and to the extent it did so, it would be such stipulations rather than any other general terms in the Master Contract that would govern those particular orders. In our view, this letter set out terms of supply which were not found in the Master Contract in several aspects. First, it did not accept that under the Master Contract Sintalow was bound to supply any orders placed by OSK for any quantity of the Products. Second, it did not mention the Master Contract as being binding on any order placed by OSK which Sintalow was prepared to quote for. In fact, this letter sets out Sintalow’s own position that it would only supply the Products on its own conditions. This was a logical follow up to the Master Contract to inform OSK of Sintalow’s protocol for the placement of orders for the Products. The protocol was that Sintalow would only accept orders for the Products, on the specific terms of the Products Agreements, but in every case subject to the 10% Variation Term. OSK was requested to send a “final bill of quantity” of the eight types of Products described therein, so that Sintalow could provide the quotations and the terms and conditions of the sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As mentioned earlier, the Judge found that Sintalow’s November letter contradicted the Estimated Quantities Clause in the Master Contract, and therefore could not be part of that contract. And for that reason, “[i]t is noteworthy that [OSK] did not respond to it either in writing or orally”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Judgment at [29]</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In our view, this finding is not supported by the evidence and the conduct of the parties. Sintalow’s November letter was, of course, not part of the Master Contract. It was intended to clarify the status of the Master Contract in relation to specific Products Agreements. Its terms were sufficiently clear to OSK. Sintalow’s November letter was material to explain how the supply of the Products was to be executed by the parties. The Judge’s finding in this respect was against the weight of the evidence. First, there is no term under the Master Contract requiring Sintalow to supply to OSK whatever Products OSK might require in the future on the terms of the Master Contract. Second, there is no provision in the Master Contract which stipulated that all specific contracts for the supply of the Products were subject to the Master Contract and its terms could not be varied. Third, there is no evidence that Sintalow agreed or understood that if it agreed to supply the Products under the Products Agreements, it could not vary the terms set out in the Master Contract. The evidence shows that not only did OSK not consider the letter a repudiation of the Master Contract, it proceeded to enter into the Products Agreements for the supply of various quantities of the Products, which were subject to terms and conditions that differed from the general terms of the Master Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For these reasons, it is our view that the failure of OSK to respond to Sintalow’s November letter was because Mdm Oh understood and accepted what Sintalow was saying in its letter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Products Agreements would be negotiated on their own terms, but subject to the Special Discounts listed in the Master Contract if binding contracts were entered into. She did not consider Sintalow’s letter to be inconsistent with the Master Contract. The fundamental basis of the agreement between the parties relating to the supply of the Products was that if OSK were to buy all the designated Products, it would be entitled to the Special Discounts. In our view, the subsequent conduct of the parties in entering into the Cross Tees Agreement, the New Duker Agreement, the Rubber Sealing Agreement, and the three Products Agreements, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Valves Agreement, the Duker Hubless Agreement and the Fusiotherm PPR Agreement, all of which were on terms and conditions that were different from or inconsistent with most of the general terms in the Master Contract (except for the Special Discounts – see [99] below), proves conclusively that OSK had never taken the position, <span class="font-italic">until it was sued by </span><span class="font-italic">Sintalow</span>, (a) that these contracts were subject only to the general terms of Master Contract, and (b) that OSK was not bound to take delivery of any of the Products ordered because they were not firm orders but “estimated orders”. It may be noted that the Judge’s findings that the Cross Tees Agreement, the New Duker Agreement, and the Rubber Sealing Agreement were binding on OSK are consistent with and support this analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In our view, the Judge erred in law in holding that the Master Contract governed all specific contracts absolutely. A well-drafted contract will normally provide a hierarchy of precedence to deal with inconsistencies between contractual terms or clauses, or general terms and specific terms. However, if the contract does not expressly provide an order of precedence between the different documents or specifies that a certain class of documents should prevail over others, <span class="font-italic"> “</span><span class="font-italic">the more specific document</span> <span class="font-italic">ought to prevail over a standard form document</span>” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Law Relating to Specific Contracts in Singapore</span> (Michael Hwang SC, ed-in-chief) (Sweet and Maxwell Asia, 2008) at para 5.3.7 cited by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">LH Aluminium Industries Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Newcon Builders Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 648 at [12] (in relation to terms in construction contracts).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This principle was applied to inconsistencies between different clauses in the same contract by the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Indian Oil Corporation v </span><span class="font-italic">Vanol Inc</span> [1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 634. In that case, the Court had to deal with an inconsistency between the dispute resolution clause in the sales contract and the standard terms that were incorporated into the contract by the parties. There was no order of precedence clause stipulating the hierarchy between the contractual documents. Webster J held that, in the absence of a clause stating the order of precedence between the contractual documents, the terms of the sales contract, which contained the specifically agreed clause, an English court jurisdiction clause, took precedence over an arbitration clause, which was incorporated by reference to the general terms and conditions. This case was subsequently appealed but this particular holding was not affected: see <span class="font-italic">Indian Oil Corporation v </span><span class="font-italic">Vanol Inc </span>[1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 563.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Notwithstanding this basic principle, the court should try to reconcile the terms as far as possible, in order to preserve the general terms. In this regard, we note the recent approach of the English Courts in their treatment of order of precedence clauses. In <span class="font-italic">RWE Npower Renewables </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v J N Bentley Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 978 (TCC), Akenhead J held that (at [24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…If it is possible to identify a clear and sensible commercial interpretation from reviewing all the contract documents which does not produce an ambiguity, that interpretation is likely to be the right one; in those circumstances, one does not need the “order of precedence” to resolve an ambiguity which does not actually on a proper construction arise at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">When the case went on appeal, Moore-Bick LJ held similarly that “only in the case of a <span class="font-italic">clear and irreconcilable discrepancy</span> would it be necessary to resort to the contractual order of precedence to resolve it” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">RWE Npower Renewables</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v J N Bentley Ltd</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 150 (“<span class="font-italic">RWE Npower Renewables (CA)</span>”) at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The view that the court should be slow to resort to an order of precedence clause to resolve an inconsistency between contractual documents was echoed by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CLP Holdings </span><span class="font-italic">Co Ltd v Singh and another</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 1103 (“<span class="font-italic">CLP Holdings</span>”) which held that (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Kitchin LJ at [24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…I recognise that the contract in issue comprises special and general conditions, and includes a condition which expressly provides that, in the event of a conflict, the special conditions shall prevail, but it seems to me that the court should nevertheless preserve the general conditions so far as possible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Even though Kitchin LJ’s statement in <span class="font-italic">CLP Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and Moore-Bick LJ’s statement in <span class="font-italic">RWE Npower Renewables </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> were made in the context of an order of precedence clause, the same principle applies to a case without such a clause, such as the present case. The general terms and conditions are superseded or varied by inconsistent specific terms and conditions <span class="font-italic">to the extent of the inconsistenc</span><span class="font-italic">ies</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Since the Master Contract merely prescribed general terms and conditions of the supply of the Products, and failed to provide the order of precedence to deal with inconsistent terms in subsequent contracts for sale and purchase of the Products, the general terms and conditions were effectively default terms and conditions. They would only apply if the specific contracts did not contain any terms or conditions inconsistent with the Master Contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 To summarise our findings on this issue, the documentary evidence on record shows that until OSK placed an order for the Products and accepted Sintalow’s quotations, there were <span class="font-italic">no binding </span><span class="font-italic">sale and purchase contracts</span> between them. But once specific orders were placed and the quotations accepted, a binding contract would be formed, subject to the terms contained in those agreements. Where Sintalow’s quotations did not contain specific terms and conditions, the general terms set out in the Master Contract would remain applicable. If the specific terms within the Products Agreements could not be reconciled with the general terms on the Master Contract, they would have the effect of superseding or varying the general conditions to the extent of the inconsistency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In our view, the Judge erred in law in deciding that the general conditions in the Master Contract continued to apply in full force and overrode the inconsistent terms and conditions of the specific contracts which OSK had knowingly and unconditionally accepted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 This brings us to the next issue in this appeal – whether the Products Agreements were binding supply contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Products Agreements Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 After the signing the Master Contract, OSK signed the Products Agreements (see [21] above).

</div> In or around 2009, OSK informed Sintalow that it secured the use of Fusiotherm PPR Pipes and Fittings for OSK’s project at No 10 Holland Hill (“the Holland Hill Project”). OSK directed Sintalow to deliver the Fusiotherm PPR Pipes and Fittings ordered to OSK for the purposes of the Holland Hill Project. Subsequently, Sintalow found out that OSK was on-selling the products to a third party which Sintalow was not on good terms with (one “Nan Wah”) and not for the Holland Hill Project. After a discussion between the parties, Sintalow followed up by email that it would only supply the Fusiotherm PPR products if OSK paid the price without the Special Discounts.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Sintalow’s case is that OSK breached the Fusiotherm PPR Agreement in not issuing any the Material Order Forms to take delivery of the balance quantities of Fusiotherm PPR products in the 14 March First Schedule as listed in Annex C of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 5) (the “Excess Fusiotherm PPR products”). To date, OSK has only taken delivery of a small quantity of the 14 March First Schedule of Fusiotherm PPR products as listed in Annex C of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 5).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Judge’s findings on the Products Agreements Issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The Judge held that the three Products Agreements were not concluded contracts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, they did not bind OSK to take delivery of any of the Products ordered thereunder. The Judge’s reasons for her decision may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The terms and conditions of the Products Agreements conflicted with those in the Master Contract (at [68] of the Judgment). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mdm Oh did not object to the inconsistent terms of the Products Agreements because “she considered that they were invalid because the governing contract was the Master Contract” (at [74] of the Judgment).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Products Agreements were not separate contracts but merely confirmations of prices and indication of quantities in accordance with the terms of the Master Contract. OSK’s statement that it “was waiting for a confirmation regarding a container to store its stock” was equivocal. It could either mean that OSK was not in a position to “take delivery of stock that it had already ordered”, or that “[OSK] was not yet in a position to order stock because it had no place to store it [s]ince no Material Order Form had yet been issued” (at [76] of the Judgment).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) OSK’s request made in September 2008 “that markings be placed on the products that Sintalow had prepared for use in the [MBS] Project…was not a confirmation that orders had already been placed”, as the Master Contract had provided that Sintalow “was to hold buffer stock amounting to 10% of the estimated quantities. Given that, any markings on the goods in [Sintalow’s] warehouse would not necessarily have been evidence of orders having been placed” (at [77] of the Judgment).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e)  The failure to object strongly to terms used by Sintalow was not evidence of OSK’s acceptance of Sintalow’s position in relation to Sintalow’s notifications of “no cancellation” on the letters detailing quantities accepted by OSK (at [78]–[79] of the Judgment).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f)  Under the terms of the Master Contract, until Material Order Forms were presented to Sintalow or letters were written asking it to make delivery of products to the site, there were no confirmed orders despite the various written indications or schedules of the quantities required that OSK gave to Sintalow from time to time. These schedules had to be regarded as <span class="font-italic">estimates</span> only in accordance with the Master Contract (at [79] of the Judgment).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g)  The evidence showed that Sintalow was aware that OSK only placed orders by way of Material Order Forms and not, generally, by signing the Products Agreements or by sending schedules of quantities to it (at [80] of the Judgment). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The Products Agreements themselves were not indicative of final orders because they each contained a clause requiring a further “order confirmation” or “final confirmation of orders”. The Judge found that this required OSK to take the further step of issuing a Material Order Form to confirm the order in order for it to be binding (at [81] of the Judgment). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The contemporaneous correspondence showed that the Products which the Products Agreements were meant to cover were “subject to the approval of the consultants and the owner of the [MBS] Project”. None of the Products in the Products Agreements were approved before the Products Agreements were entered into. The fact that Sintalow acknowledged the requirement for approval showed its recognition that the contractual terms were not contained in the Products Agreements but within the Master Contract (at [88] of the Judgment). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Our decision on the Products Agreements Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Before us, Sintalow reiterates substantially all the arguments which the Judge had rejected. Sintalow also contends that the Judge’s findings that OSK’s orders for additional Duker Hubless products, Cross Tees and Rubber Collars constituted binding agreements were inconsistent with the Judge’s finding that OSK was not bound by the three Products Agreements by reason of the terms of the Master Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 OSK’s submissions before us were essentially that the Judge’s decision that the three Products Agreements was not binding on OSK was correct for the reasons given by the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Valves Agreement and Duker Hubless Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 We do not think it is necessary for us to examine each of the reasons given by the Judge for holding that the Products Agreements were not binding on OSK – that they were essentially offers to sell the Products to OSK, and that until OSK signed and delivered a Material Order Form, there was no contract for the supply of the relevant Products.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96   In our view, the Judge’s reasoning rests on three findings. First, the general terms of Master Contract applied to the Products Agreements and to the extent that the specific terms in the Products Agreements were inconsistent with those in the Master Contract they had no effect. Second, the Products Agreements were not separate contracts but merely confirmations of prices and indication of quantities in accordance with the terms of the Master Contract. Third, the Products Agreements and delivery schedules were “estimates”, and therefore OSK had no obligation to take delivery of any of the Products no matter how many times OSK sought to increase the quantities of the Products. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 We are unable to agree with the reasoning of the Judge. The first finding is the contrary to the basic principle that specific terms supersede or vary general terms to the extent of their inconsistency (see [57] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The second finding is also erroneous. In our view, the Products Agreements were not merely confirmations of prices and indication of quantities in accordance with the terms of the Master Contract. They were independent and separate contracts, as <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">is evident </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">from a close examination of the terms of </span>each Products Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Valves Agreement sets out specific terms such as price, payment terms, delivery terms, and validity periods which were either not contained in the Master Contract or inconsistent with the like headings in the Master Contract. Both the Duker Hubless Agreement and the Fusiotherm PPR Agreement set out similar specific terms that are not contained in the Master Contract or are inconsistent with it.

They were constituted by OSK issuing bills of quantity to Sintalow which then provided its quotations containing specific terms and conditions which OSK had unconditionally accepted. These terms for the supply and delivery of the Products referred to therein which were inconsistent with the Master Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 We also disagree with the Judge’s finding that OSK was only bound by purchase orders for which it had signed Material Order Forms, and not by signing the Products Agreements or by sending schedules of quantities to Sintalow (at [80] of the Judgment). The Judge came to this conclusion by treating the Material Order Forms themselves as purchase orders, even though OSK had earlier placed bills of quantity with Sintalow, and Sintalow had responded with quotations. The Judge held that until OSK sent a signed Material Order Form, it had not purchased the Products. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 We are unable to agree with this finding. It is inconsistent with the protocol for the purchase of the Products (see [59] above), and is also inconsistent with the terms of the Material Order Form. A typical Material Order Form contains the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Project: Marina Bay Sands IR</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Requested By: -</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Date Requested: 02/11/2007</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Place of Delivery: Office on 3/11/07</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ordered By: Joanne Oh [Tel: (65)…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">* PLEASE NOTIFY US IF THE STOCK IS NOT AVAILABLE, Thank You.* </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is followed by a list of item specifications and quantities required by OSK to be delivered in accordance with the information provided in the above quote. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 It is abundantly clear from the terms of the Material Order Form that it is merely a delivery order for Products already purchased and not a purchase order for Products to be purchased. In other words, the Material Order Form is an order for the <span class="font-italic">delivery </span><span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">not the purchase</span> of the Products. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In deciding that the Products Agreements were not binding on OSK, the Judge interpreted the phrase “[q]uantity given by [OSK] is an estimated order” in the Master Contract as an estimate of the quantity it would be ordering. However, the Judge did not explain the meaning she gave to the words “estimated order”. Before us, OSK has argued that they meant that OSK had no obligation to take delivery of any quantity of Products that was in excess of its needs for the MBS Project. In other words, the risk of ordering an excessive quantity of Products would fall on Sintalow and not on OSK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 This is a plausible interpretation of those words, if that term were applicable to the Products Agreement. It could then raise an ancillary factual issue as to whether or not the quantities of the Products that OSK refused to take delivery were excessive to its contractual needs for the MBS Project. However, in our view, the issue is not relevant to the determination of OSK’s liability to take delivery of all the Products that it had ordered and accepted, having regard to our finding that the terms of the Products Agreements superseded or varied the Master Contract to the extent of their inconsistency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 We reiterate our findings on the protocol agreed to by the parties. First, OSK would issue an order for the Products via bills of quantities. Sintalow would then quote the prices and other terms of sale. OSK would either accept, reject, or vary Sintalow’s offer. If OSK accepted Sintalow’s quotation, the contract for sale would be concluded. If OSK varied the quantity, the type, the price or other terms of sale, Sintalow would have to decide whether to accept the variations in OSK’s counter-offer. Sintalow reserved to itself that discretion in the sentence: “REMARKS: SUBJECT TO OUR FINAL CONFIRMATION OF ORDER”. This was Sintalow’s explanation for the purpose of the column “REMARKS” (see [82] of the Judgment). We accept this explanation, as this is consistent with the commercial meaning in the context of the Products Agreements. This term is also consistent with the fact that Sintalow was under no obligation to supply any of the Products to OSK under the Master Contract. However, the evidence shows that in each case, OSK did not make a counter-offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 We note that after OSK had accepted the quantities of Products offered by Sintalow in the Products Agreements, it had sought to vary the quantities of the Products through various correspondence and revisions to the delivery schedules, some of which were accepted by Sintalow. These changes resulted in: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Excess Valves (see [66] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Excess Duker Hubless products (see [70] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 For the reasons given above, the Judge was in error in holding that OSK was not obliged to take delivery of the Excess Valves and the Excess Duker Hubless products. Sintalow is entitled to damages to be assessed for OSK’s failure to take delivery and pay for these Products. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fusiotherm PPR Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 For the same reasons in the above section, we find that the Fusiotherm PPR Agreement was a binding contract between Sintalow and OSK for the purchase of Fusiotherm PPR products. However, in our view, OSK is not liable to Sintalow for failing to take delivery of these product for the reason that Sintalow had wrongfully refused to deliver these products to OSK unless OSK agreed to pay a higher price for them. Sintalow had decided to charge a higher price when it found out that OSK had intended to sell them to a third party rather than to use them for its other projects. In our view, since there was no such condition stipulated in the Fusiotherm PPR Agreement, Sintalow did not have a contractual right to determine how OSK would use the Products. Even though the Master Contract did provide that the contract was for “supplying…Hardware for [the MBS Project]”, there was no term in the Master Contract preventing OSK from on-selling the Products if it was unable to use them for the MBS Project. Accordingly, we agree with the Judge that Sintalow had no contractual right to interfere with any sale of the Fusiotherm PPR products by OSK to third parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Misrepresentation Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 For completeness, we briefly consider Sintalow’s alternative claim for damages for misrepresentation by OSK. The damages claimed consisted of (a) the Special Discounts which Sintalow would not have agreed to give to OSK under the Master Contract but for OSK’s representation that it would purchase not less than S$5 million, and (b) the loss resulting from OSK’s failure to take delivery of all the Products it had ordered and which Sintalow had agreed to supply. The issue of misrepresentation took up a large part of the trial, resulting in the Judge having to hear the evidence and to deal with it at [31]-[49] of the Judgment. By including this averment as part of the TPA which it alleged was the governing contract, in contrast to OSK’s defence that the governing contracts was the Master Contract, Sintalow’s line of argument might have misled the Judge into deciding the dispute as a binary issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, either the TPA or the Master Contract was the governing contract in relation to all the specific contracts that were entered into by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The Judge found that on the evidence, OSK did not represent to Sintalow that it would purchase the Products with a total value of not less than S$5m. This is a finding of fact with which we agree. First, OSK’s act of informing Sintalow that it was bidding for the MBS Project and request to Sintalow for its price list was an indication of OSK’s interest in Sintalow as a supplier of materials should OSK be awarded the MBS Project. The Judge rightly held that such an act could not amount to a representation by OSK that it would buy the Products or a minimum value thereof.  Second, the June 2007 BQ could not be relied upon to prove Sintalow’s claim in misrepresentation, however it was obtained. The June 2007 BQ contained no representation of this nature. At the highest, the evidence shows that Sintalow, <span class="font-italic">on its own</span>, studied the June 2007 BQ which showed the kinds and quantities of sanitary and plumbing wares which OSK would require for the MBS Project and unilaterally concluded that the total value of the Products required for the MBS Project would be between S$7m and S$8m (including products for which Sintalow was not a supplier) (see [5] above). Third, we agree with the Judge that OSK also did not make any representation that it would purchase at least S$5m worth of products from OSK at the 18 September 2007 meeting. Chew admitted under cross-examination that Mdm Oh had never mentioned that OSK would purchase S$5m worth of products from Sintalow.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Sintalow contends that since the trial of the issues had been bifurcated, the Judge erred in making those qualifications as they related to quantification of damages and ought to be made by the Court conducting the assessment of damages. In other words, the Judge’s articulations or qualifications were outside her purview since they did not concern liability. We are unable to accept this argument. The Judge was addressing the issue of liability in both cases. For example, in the case of the Duker Hubless pipes, the Judge effectively found as a fact that Sintalow was not in a position to supply those pipes, and therefore could not claim damages for products it could not supply. Since Sintalow has not appealed against this finding of fact, but only against the Judge’s jurisdiction to find that fact, we are unable to disturb the Judge’s finding in this regard. The same reasoning applies to the further order for the Cross Tees which the Judge found Sintalow should not have made.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of this Court’s findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 For the above reasons, we allow the appeal in part. Our findings are summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Master Contract sets out the general terms and conditions for the supply of the Products. It is not a contract for sale and purchase of the Products. Neither OSK is obliged to buy nor Sintalow obliged to sell any Product under the Master Agreement. It contemplates that the sale and purchase would be implemented by specific contracts to be entered into by the parties for specific quantities of the Products.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is a basic principle of contract law that where there are inconsistencies in the terms contained in related contractual documents, specific terms override general terms, and supersede or vary them to the extent of their inconsistencies, unless there is an express hierarchy of precedence that provides otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In the absence of any express term in the Master Contract that the general terms would apply to all subsequent specific contracts, the general terms were superseded or varied by specific terms in the specific contracts that were inconsistent with the general terms. The Judge erred in failing to apply this basic principle to the Master Contract.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Products Agreements were binding contracts upon OSK accepting Sintalow’s quotations for the Products with respect to the bills of quantities issued by OSK. In so far as the terms and conditions specified therein were inconsistent with the general conditions in the Master Contract, they would have the effect of varying and/or superseding the general conditions.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Material Order Forms were delivery orders for the Products already purchased and not purchase orders for acceptance by Sintalow.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) OSK was in breach of its obligations to take delivery of the Excess Valves and the Excess Duker Hubless products, and accordingly is liable for damages to Sintalow to be assessed.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Although OSK was under an obligation to take delivery of the Excess Fusiotherm PPR products, it was not in breach of this obligation as Sintalow had wrongfully refused to deliver the same to nominated third parties to whom OSK had on-sold. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) OSK did not represent to Sintalow that it would place orders for the Products to the total value of not less than S$5m.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) OSK is not entitled to the Special Discount of 23% for the Cross Tees as that term was superseded by the the higher discount of 41.43%in the Cross Tees Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) OSK is entitled to the 40% discount as provided in the Master Contract for the CV Couplings delivered pursuant to the Rubber Sealing Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Sintalow has succeeded on all its grounds of appeal, other than the ground of misrepresentation. However, because the claim based on misrepresentation formed a large part of Sintalow’s case, we award Sintalow 70% of the costs of the proceedings here and below plus reasonable disbursements. There will be the usual order for the release of the security for the costs of the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon            Andrew Phang Boon Leong            Chan Sek Keong<br/>Chief Justice                    Judge of Appeal                               Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wendell Wong, Denise Teo and Valerie Goh (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Andrew Ang, Andrea Tan and David Marc Lee (PK Wong &amp; Associates LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
