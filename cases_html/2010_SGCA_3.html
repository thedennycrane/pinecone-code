        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Dr Ng Boon Ching (“the
                    Respondent”) is a medical practitioner of more than 25 years’
                    standing. CLAAS Medical Centre Pte Ltd (“the Appellant”) is a
                    company incorporated on 12 January 2005 which was initially named Aesthetics
                    Associates Pte Ltd. Six general medical practitioners, Dr Wong Weng Hong
                    (“Dr Wong”), Dr Tan Eng Choon Gerard
                    (“Dr Gerard Tan”), Dr Cindy Yang
                    (“Dr Yang”), Dr Liew Kou Chuen
                    (“Dr Liew”), Dr Lim Wee How
                    (“Dr Lim”) and Dr Tan Yi Ryh
                    (“Dr Tan”), were the original shareholders of the Appellant.
                    Subsequently (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> below), the Respondent
                    also became a shareholder in the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Respondent had commenced an action below to
                    seek a refund of a total sum of $236,500 being the balance of outstanding loans
                    owed by the Appellant to the Respondent. The Appellant admitted to this claim
                    but sought to set off the debt against its counterclaim of $1m for breach of a
                    restrictive covenant by the Respondent. This appeal is against that part of the
                    decision of the trial judge (“the Judge”) where she dismissed the
                    Appellant’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent commenced private practice as a
                    general and family medical practitioner in April 1984 when he established his
                    own clinic known as B C Ng Clinic &amp; Surgery. The Respondent was trained
                    and certified in the use of laser and intense pulsed light machines for medical
                    treatment and surgical procedures. He had also acquired laser and intense pulsed
                    light machines in his clinic. Many patients came to see him for medical
                    treatment and/or surgical procedures involving the use of laser and/or intense
                    pulsed light machines. He was so successful in this area of practice that he
                    decided to concentrate almost entirely on “aesthetic medical
                    practice”. He also changed the name of his practice to that of
                    “Dr B C Ng Laser Surgery”. In 1993, he relocated his clinic
                    from Midpoint Orchard at Orchard Road to Chinatown Point at New Bridge
                    Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In 1996, the Respondent set up AHA Centre, a
                    sole proprietorship, which was and is in the business of the import,
                    distribution and sale of aesthetic laser and intense pulsed light machines and
                    skin care products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the course of his business, the Respondent
                    came to know Dr Lim who was then practising under the style of
                    “Woods Medical Clinic”. In 2004, the Respondent learned from
                    Dr Lim that a group of about six doctors (who later became the original
                    shareholders of the Appellant – see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>
                    above), all of whom had no previous experience in aesthetic medicine, were keen
                    to set up an aesthetic medicine clinic in the Orchard Road or Cairnhill
                    area and that they were also interested in acquiring several laser and/or
                    intense pulsed light machines for that practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, the six doctors decided to
                    interest the Respondent into entering a joint venture with them to assist them
                    in building the aesthetic medical clinic in Cairnhill while he continued to
                    operate his own clinic at Chinatown Point. However, this idea was later
                    abandoned and the six doctors decided instead to focus on the acquisition of the
                    Respondent’s clinic as well as his distributorship business, ie, the AHA
                    Centre, (“the plan”). Towards that end, the six doctors
                    incorporated the Appellant in January 2005. The Respondent was amenable to the
                    plan, including becoming a shareholder in the Appellant. Thus, by 28 March 2005,
                    the Respondent had subscribed for and was issued with 100,000 shares in the
                    Appellant while the other six doctors held the remaining 400,000 shares. In
                    other words, the Respondent held 20% of the shareholding in the Appellant while
                    the six doctors collectively held 80% of the shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As a vehicle for the sale of his practice to the
                    Appellant, the Respondent incorporated BCNG Holdings Pte Ltd (“BCNG
                    Holdings”) and transferred his clinic, as well as the
                    distributorship business under AHA Centre, to BCNG Holdings. Both parties
                    negotiated and agreed that the value of BCNG Holdings be fixed at
                $3.2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 6 April 2005, the Respondent, the six
                    doctors and the Appellant duly entered into a Shareholders Agreement
                    (“the April Agreement”) which set out the rights, duties and
                    liabilities of all the parties relating to their participation in and the
                    running of BCNG Holdings. In accordance with cl 2.2(b) of the April
                    Agreement, the Respondent sold 60% of his shareholding in BCNG Holdings to the
                    Appellant for $1.92m. As the Appellant had a paid up capital of only $500,000
                    and the other shareholders did not have $1.92m to pay for the Respondent’s
                    60% shareholding in BCNG Holdings, the Respondent agreed to arrange for a loan
                    of $1.328m from the United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”) to the
                    Appellant so that the Appellant could raise the funds. According to cl 5.2
                    of the April Agreement, the Respondent would use his personal fixed deposit with
                    UOB as the necessary collaterals to secure the loan which UOB was prepared to
                    give to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       By cl 8.3(a) of the April Agreement, the
                    Appellant was given an option, within two years, to purchase the
                    Respondent’s remaining 40% shareholding in BCNG Holdings at an agreed sale
                    price of $1.28m. By cl 8.3(e), if the Appellant did not exercise the
                    option, the Respondent could repurchase the Appellant’s 60% shareholding
                    in BCNG Holdings at an agreed price of $700,000. At this point, we would note
                    that, by these provisions, the scheme of things was to compel the Appellant to
                    purchase the Respondent’s remaining 40% shareholding in BCNG Holdings,
                    otherwise, the Appellant would suffer a loss of $1,220,000, ie, having paid
                    $1.92m for the 60% shareholding in BCNG Holdings, it would, however, only get
                    back $700,000. By cl 12.1(i), once all the shares in BCNG Holdings were
                    held by only one shareholder, the other shareholders would cease to be bound by
                    the restraint of trade provision in the April Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The April Agreement contained the following
                    restraint of trade covenant in cl 11(a):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    All of the parties herein shall
                        for so long as he/she remains a Shareholder and/or a Shareholder of [the
                        Appellant] for a period of three (3) years after he/she shall cease to be a
                        Shareholder of [BCNG Holdings] and/or of [the Appellant], whether by
                        himself/herself and/or jointly or together with any other person(s) and/or
                        body (ies), whether on his/her own account and/or as agent, employee and/or
                        servant, in any capacity whatsoever, directly or indirectly, be prohibited
                        from: -</p>

                            trade and/or business carried on within Singapore which is similar to or
                            in competition and/or conflict (whether directly or indirectly) with the
                            Business of [BCNG Holdings] and/or the practice of Aesthetic
                            Medicine;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii)   employ, solicit and/or entice away and/or
                            endeavour to employ, solicit and/or entice away any person(s) who
                            is employed by [BCNG Holdings], and/or induce or seek to induce any such
                            person(s) to leave his/her employment with [BCNG Holdings] for any
                            reasons whatsoever;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iii)   solicit the custom of any person and/or body
                            who is a customer of the [BCNG Holdings] and/or divert or seek to divert
                            any customer of the [BCNG Holdings] away from it; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iv)   cause and/or permit any person directly or
                            indirectly under his/her control to do any of the foregoing acts or
                            things.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Clause 11(c) provided that each of the
                    six doctors, namely, Dr Lim, Dr Gerard Tan, Dr Tan, Dr Yang,
                    Dr Liew and Dr Wong, would have to pay $700,000 by way of liquidated
                    damages to BCNG Holdings if they breached cl 11(a). Clause 11(d)
                    provided that the Respondent would have to pay BCNG Holdings a sum of $1m as
                    liquidated damages for a breach of cl 11(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Sometime in November 2005, the Appellant
                    exercised its right to purchase the Respondent’s remaining 40%
                    shareholding in BCNG Holdings. Once again, as the Appellant did not have funds,
                    the Respondent agreed to arrange for another loan of $1.28m from UOB. This
                    second loan was again secured against the Respondent’s personal fixed
                    deposits with UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Clause 8.7 of the April Agreement had
                    provided that upon the Appellant’s purchase of the 40% of the shares, all
                    the existing shareholders of the Appellant would enter into and execute a
                    Shareholder’s Agreement in the form as annexed to the April Agreement as
                    “Appendix B”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Therefore, a Shareholders Agreement dated
                    15 November 2005 (“the November Agreement”)<sup></sup>was entered into by the Respondent and the six doctors in the
                    terms of the said “Appendix B”. Unlike the April Agreement,
                    the Appellant was <em>not</em> a party to the November
                    Agreement. This November Agreement was intended to set out the terms and
                    conditions under which the Respondent and the original six shareholders of the
                    Appellant would participate in the management of the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     A restraint of trade provision similar to the
                    one in the April Agreement was included in the November Agreement.
                    Clause 11 of the November Agreement reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11. NON-COMPETITION</p>

                        person(s) and/or body (ies), whether on his/her own account and/or as agent,

                        sum of S$700,000.00 by way of liquidated damages. It is hereby agreed that
                        the payment of the said liquidated damages shall thereafter exempt the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    In the event that [the Respondent] shall for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     From 16 April 2005, soon after the April
                    Agreement, the Appellant took over the running of the Dr B C Ng Laser
                    Surgery at Chinatown Point. In May 2005, the name of this clinic was
                    changed to BCNG Laser &amp; Medical Aesthetics. In January 2006, the Appellant
                    opened a branch clinic at OUB Centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Also in January 2006, one Dr Soh Liang
                    Joseph (“Dr Soh”) became a shareholder and director of the
                    Appellant. As a result, the Respondent held 23% of the shares in the Appellant,
                    while the rest of the doctors, including Dr Soh, held the remaining 77%. A
                    Supplemental Shareholders Agreement was entered into between the six original
                    shareholders of the Appellant, the Respondent and Dr Soh on 20 January
                    2006, under which Dr Soh agreed, inter alia, to be bound by the terms and
                    conditions of the November Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As at 22 December 2006, the Respondent
                    had advanced interest-free loans amounting to $286,500 to the Appellant. The
                    loans were to fund its operational expenses and expansion plans. The Appellant
                    had repaid $50,000 of the loans leaving a balance sum of $236,500, which was the
                    subject matter of the action instituted by the Respondent (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the meantime, by the middle of 2006,
                    differences began to surface between the Respondent on the one hand and the
                    original six shareholders and Dr Soh on the other. On 24 August 2006,
                    the Respondent sent an email to the other shareholders of the Appellant
                    informing them that he was looking to sell his entire 23% shareholding in
                    the Appellant. On or about 28 August 2006, the Respondent gave notice to
                    the Board of Directors of the Appellant of his intention to sell his 23%
                    shareholding in the Appellant and he also stated that the intending purchaser
                    must attend to the release of his fixed deposits with UOB which were used as
                    security for the two loans extended by UOB to the Appellant (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> and <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above). On or about 17 March 2007, the Respondent transferred all his
                    shares in the Appellant to Dr Wong and tendered his resignation as a
                    director of both the Appellant and BCNG Holdings on the same day. The
                    Respondent’s last day of work with the Appellant was 21 March
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Following the Respondent’s departure
                    from the Appellant, on 11 April 2007, Unimedic Pte Ltd
                    (“Unimedic”), a company under the Healthway Medical Group,
                    acquired 499,993 shares, representing 99.9% of the shareholdings in the
                    Appellant from the six doctors and Dr Soh save for seven shares, which were
                    retained by them with each of them holding only one share in the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Respondent subsequently set up his own
                    general and aesthetic medical practice in the name of Dr B C Ng Aesthetics
                    at 1 Newton Road, #01-29 Goldhill Plaza, Singapore 308899. This clinic was said
                    to be operational with effect from 7 May 2007. Prior to that, he placed
                    advertisements announcing his departure from BCNG Holdings and plans to set up
                    his own aesthetic medicine clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Respondent sued the Appellant for the
                    return of $236,500 (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above). This
                    claim was admitted by the Appellant who sought to set off this debt against its
                    counterclaim of $1m for breach of cl 11. The Appellant claimed to be
                    entitled to enforce this restrictive covenant against the Respondent pursuant to
                    Section 2(1)(b) of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
                    (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed) (“CRTPA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Since the Appellant had admitted to the
                    Respondent’s claim for the sum of $236,500, the Judge allowed the claim
                    for that sum. However, she dismissed the Appellant’s counterclaim. The
                    Judge’s grounds of decision is reported at [2009] 3 SLR(R) 78
                    (“the GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the view of the Judge, the Appellant could
                    not rely on the CRTPA to enforce the restrictive covenant and, therefore, the
                    Appellant had no locus standi to sue the Respondent under the November
                    Agreement. In any case, the Judge was also of the opinion that cl 11 was
                    unenforceable because it was in unreasonable restraint of trade. In her
                    view, cl 11 was drafted in too wide a term as it prohibited the parties
                    from “being engaged and/or interested in any trade and/or business
                    carried on within Singapore” that was similar to the
                    “Business” of the Company and/or the practice of “Aesthetic
                    Medicine”. As cl 11 covered any and every type of practice of
                    aesthetic medicine it was wider than reasonably necessary to protect the
                    goodwill sold by the Respondent. Moreover, the restriction of three years was
                    unreasonably long. Therefore, the ambit of cl 11 was unnecessarily wide and
                    vitiated by unreasonableness. Moreover, the Judge held that it was not possible
                    for the court to sever the unreasonable portion of the clause. Finally, she also
                    held that cl 11(c) was not a genuine pre-estimate of the Appellant’s
                    loss but constituted a penalty clause and, as such, was unenforceable in
                    accordance with its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     There are essentially three main issues in
                    this Appeal:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the Appellant is entitled to rely on the
                            CRTPA to enforce cl 11.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether cl 11 is enforceable as a restraint
                            of trade clause.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Does cl 11 constitute a penalty or is it
                            enforceable as a genuine pre-estimate of the Appellant’s
                            damages.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Appellant had <em>locus standi</em>
                to enforce cl 11</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellant is not a party to the November
                    Agreement. Therefore, it has to rely on the CRTPA to circumvent the privity of
                    contract rule. Section 2 of the CRPTA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Subject to the provisions of this
                        Act, a person who is not a party to a contract (referred to in this Act as a
                        third party) may, in his own right, enforce a term of the contract if
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>)    the contract expressly
                            provides that he may; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>)    subject to subsection
                            (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Subsection (1) (b) shall not apply if, on a
                        proper construction of the contract, it appears that the parties did not
                        intend the term to be enforceable by the third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The third party shall be expressly identified
                        in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as answering a particular
                        description but need not be in existence when the contract is entered
                        into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Since the November Agreement did not expressly
                    provide that the Appellant may enforce cl 11, s 2(1)(a) of the CRTPA
                    would not apply. What is clearly relevant for our purpose is
                    s 2(1)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Clause 11 bars the parties to the Agreement
                    (ie, the shareholders of the Appellant, namely, the Respondent, the original six
                    doctors and Dr Soh), from engaging in a business in competition with the
                    Appellant. It is clear that the parties to the Agreement intended cl 11 to
                    inure for the benefit of the Appellant. The prescribed liquidated damages would
                    be payable to the Appellant in the event of a breach of cl 11 by any of the
                    parties to it. There is no requirement that benefiting the third party must be
                    the predominant purpose or intent behind the term. However, it must be <em>a</em> purpose of the parties. <em>Prima
                        facie</em>, s 2(1)(b) is applicable to enable the Appellant to
                    enforce cl 11 because cl 11(c) has expressly stated that the
                    liquidated damages for a breach of the clause are payable to the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rebuttable presumption </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, s 2(1)(b) must be read with
                    s 2(2). The latter provision (quoted at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) enables a party to a contract to show that, on a
                    proper construction of the contract, the parties did not intend the terms
                    therein to be enforceable by a third party. Thus, with regard to cl 11, it
                    is open to the Respondent to show that, on a proper construction of the November
                    Agreement, it was not the intention of the parties that the Appellant could
                    enforce cl 11 against any of the parties to the Agreement. It seems to us
                    that what s 2(1)(b) and s 2(2) seek to do is to distinguish between
                    intended and incidental beneficiaries to a contract, with the latter
                    beneficiaries not being entitled to sue under the contract. The burden of proof
                    rests on the party who invokes s 2(2) to show, on a proper construction of
                    the contract, that the parties did not intend the term concerned to be
                    enforceable by the third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The operation of ss 2(1)(b) and 2(2) is
                    illustrated by the case of <em>The Laemthong Glory</em>
                    (No 2), [2005] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 688. We should add that the genesis
                    of these two provisions may be found in s 1(1)(b) and s 1(2) of the UK
                    Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, 1999 (c 31) (“UK
                    Act”) and thus the English decisions are relevant to the consideration of
                    our provisions. In that case, because the bill of lading relating to the goods
                    which had been carried in a chartered ship had not reached the prospective
                    receiver (A) by the time of the ship’s arrival at the contractual
                    destination, the goods were delivered to A against the letter of indemnity
                    (“LOI”) issued by A to the charterer (B) which amounted to a
                    contract between A and B. The LOI contained a promise to indemnify “you
                    [B] your servants or agents” in respect of liability which might be
                    incurred by reason of delivery of the goods at A’s request without
                    production of the bill of lading. It was held that this promise on its true
                    construction purported to confer a benefit on the shipowner (C) within
                    s 1(1)(b) of the UK Act as C had acted as one of B’s
                    “agents” within the meaning of the LOI in delivering the goods to
                    A, and that the promise was enforceable by C against A. A had not discharged the
                    burden imposed on him by s 1(2) of proving that the LOI was not intended by
                    A and B to be enforceable by C.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the presumption has been rebutted </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     While the Judge accepted that cl 11(c)
                    conferred a benefit on the Appellant within the meaning of s 2(1)(b), she
                    found that the presumption was rebutted by the presence of inconsistent terms in
                    the November Agreement (see GD at [37] and [41]). The Judge referred to
                    cl 12.1(ii) of the November Agreement as a term which was inconsistent with
                    an intention on the part of the parties to confer a right upon the Appellant to
                    enforce cl 11. By that clause, the November Agreement could be terminated
                    if all the parties agreed <em>in writing</em> to end it.
                    The Judge accepted the Respondent’s argument that as cl 12.1(ii)
                    could be invoked by the parties to the Agreement without the concurrence of the
                    Appellant, that provision evinced the parties’ intention not to confer the
                    benefit of cl 11 on the Appellant. Another inconsistent term in the
                    Judge’s mind was cl 14.5 which prohibited the assignment of rights
                    and benefits under the Agreement without the prior consent in writing of the
                    other parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, counsel for the Appellant argued that
                    the Judge erred in her reasoning here. Clause 12.1(ii) merely expressed and
                    qualified (by the requirement of an agreement in writing) the general right of
                    the parties to terminate an agreement they had entered into. This had nothing to
                    do with the question of whether a benefit had been duly conferred upon the third
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In this regard, the first question which we
                    need address is whether the mere fact that the parties had expressly reserved to
                    themselves the right to terminate the contract meant that the presumption that
                    the parties intended the Appellant to be able to enforce the benefits under the
                    contract is rebutted. Here we must refer to s 3 of CRTPA.
                    Section 3(1), 3(2) and 3(3) state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3 – (1) Subject to this section, where a third party
                        has a right under section 2 to enforce a term of the contract, the

                        it in such a way as to extinguish or alter the third party’s
                        entitlement under that right, without his consent if —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) the third party has communicated his
                            assent to the term to the promisor;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) the promisor is aware that the third
                            party has relied on the term (whether or not the third party has
                            knowledge of its precise terms); or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>c</em>) the promisor can reasonably be
                            expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term
                            and the third party has in fact relied on it (whether or not the third
                            party has knowledge of its precise terms).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The assent referred to in subsection (1)(<em>a</em>) —</p>

                            it is received by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Subsection (1) is subject to any express term of the
                        contract under which —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) the parties to the contract may by
                            agreement rescind or vary the contract without the consent of the third
                            party; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) the consent of the third party is
                            required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of those set
                            out in subsection (1) (<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These provisions, by spelling out the circumstances which
                    would restrict the liberty of the contracting parties to rescind or vary their
                    contact, would suggest that the mere fact that a term in the contract permits
                    the parties to terminate it does not <em>ipso facto</em>
                    mean that benefits conferred therein on a third party is not intended to be
                    enforced by the third party. Of particular significance is s 3(3) which
                    provides that for the parties to override the rights acquired by the third party
                    pursuant to the latter’s assent or reliance, the contract must expressly
                    provide that the parties may rescind or vary the contract without the consent of
                    the third party. If the mere presence of a reservation of a right to the
                    contracting parties to terminate or vary the contract would amount to there
                    being no intention to confer on a named third party a right to sue for the
                    benefits conferred thereunder, then there would not have been any need to have
                    those elaborate provisions in s 3. <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> vol 1 (Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited,
                    30th Ed, 2008) at para 18-091, states the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nor is the presumption rebutted merely because in the contract, A and B
                        had reserved the right to rescind or vary the contract: this follows from
                        the provisions with regard to such rescission or variation made in s 2
                        of the [UK Act].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 2 of the UK Act referred to in the passage above is
                        <em>in pari materia</em> with s 3 of our CRTPA.
                    Therefore, the Judge erred in coming to the conclusion that the presumption was
                    rebutted by the mere presence of cl 12(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We would at this juncture also mention that,
                    in our opinion, this is also an instance where s 3(1)(a) applies, as the
                    terms of the November Agreement were set out as an appendix to the April
                    Agreement and the Appellant was a party to the April Agreement and we cannot see
                    how it could be argued that the Appellant had not assented to what was set out
                    in the November Agreement. It was patently clear that the Appellant had worked
                    out what were to be the terms of the November Agreement and had agreed to them.
                    Since there is no express provision in the November Agreement in terms of what
                    is required under s 3(3), the parties are no longer at liberty to take away
                    the benefits provided in favour of the Appellant under cl 11(c) without the
                    consent of the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Turning to cl 14.5, which prohibited the
                    assignment of rights and benefits under the Agreement without the prior consent
                    in writing of the other parties, and which provision the Judge took to be a
                    factor in determining that it was not the intention of the parties to confer a
                    right on the Appellant to sue for the benefits prescribed in its favour under
                    cl 11 (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above), we think, with
                    respect, that this view involves the conflation of two different concepts. There
                    is nothing inconsistent or incompatible between the express conferment of a
                    benefit on a named third party and the restriction on the right of assignment of
                    a contracting party without the consent of the other contracting parties. When
                    the parties by express terms confer a benefit upon a third party, that is not an
                    assignment and has nothing to do with assignment. In this regard, we note that
                    the Judge cited an article by Prof Andrew Burrows, “The Contracts
                    (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 and its Implications for Commercial
                    Contracts” [2000] LMCLQ 540, in support of her conclusion that
                    an assignment clause of this kind is an inconsistent term that is
                    sufficient to rebut the presumption of intention to confer upon a named third
                    party a right to sue, see GD at [37]. We should state that Prof Burrows was
                    a member of the Law Commission which submitted a report on reforming the
                    principle of privity in contract law – see Commission Report No 242.
                    To correctly appreciate what Prof Burrows had in mind, it is necessary to
                    examine closely the example given by Prof Burrows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So, if money is to be paid by A not to B but to an expressly identified
                        third party C, the presumption is that C has the right to enforce the term.
                        But the presumption can be rebutted … the rebuttal may occur because
                        of other inconsistent terms. For example, the contract may prohibit the
                        assignment to C of B’s right to enforce the payment term without
                        A’s written consent. That would indicate that the parties did not
                        intend to confer on C an immediate right of enforceability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In this example, Prof Burrows was
                    referring to a situation where, notwithstanding that the contract stated that
                    the money was to be paid by A to C, there was an express provision prohibiting
                    the assignment to C of B’s rights to enforce the payment without A’s
                    written consent. Obviously with such a provision, a contrary intention is
                    indicated. The contract had expressly provided the condition under which C could
                    have the right to enforce the payment against A. That, in our opinion, is a
                    different situation entirely from the position of the Appellant under the
                    November Agreement. The mere existence of a general provision like cl 14.5
                    against assignment of a party’s rights under the November Agreement does
                    not have the same effect as that referred to in the example given by
                    Prof Burrows. If cl 14.5 had specifically referred to cll 11(b)
                    and 11(c) and stated that the parties not in breach could only sue to recover
                    the specified sums with the written consent of all the parties, or of only the
                    party in default, then that would have been the situation contemplated by Prof
                    Burrows in his example. But cl 14.5 does not so provide. It is a general
                    clause restricting assignment of benefits by individual parties under the
                    contract. As discussed earlier with respect to cl 12, the parties can
                    expressly reserve to themselves the right to vary the contract without the third
                    party’s consent. This does not amount to a rebuttal of the presumption.
                    The position is similar for cl 14.5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Section 2(2) requires the court to decide
                    whether on a proper construction of the contract, the parties did not intend the
                    Appellant to have the right to enforce the restrictive covenant. The Judge
                    rightly pointed out at [38] of her GD that in construing the contract, the court
                    should adopt an objective approach to contractual interpretation taking into
                    account the background facts. The mere absence in the contract of an express
                    statement that the third party is to have the right to enforce the term is not a
                    bar to his entitlement under s 2(1) to do so. Neither is such absence an
                    indication of a contrary intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In this connection, we should also mention
                    that the Judge referred to the preamble of the November Agreement and
                    Dr Gerard’s testimony (see GD at [34], [35] and [38]) and came to the
                    conclusion that the objective of the contract was for the protection of the
                    Respondent and the other shareholders in their capacity as individual
                    shareholders, and not for the Appellant as a corporate entity. The Judge
                    emphasised that cl 11 was contained in a shareholders’ agreement
                    between the Respondent and the six doctors. The restrictive covenants applied
                    only to shareholders who were parties to the November Agreement or those who
                    have agreed to be bound by the provision when they became shareholders of the
                    Appellant (like in the case of Dr Soh). Clause D of the preamble
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which
                        the Shareholders (as defined below) will participate in the Company and
                        records the financial, administrative, managerial and other arrangements
                        agreed between them in relation to their participation in the Company, and
                        the manner in which the affairs of the Company are to be conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     While, in a general sense, the Judge was right
                    to point out that the purpose of the November Agreement was for the protection
                    of the Respondent and the other shareholders, it must not be overlooked that the
                    parties to that Agreement had decided to use a separate corporate entity, the
                    Appellant, to protect their interests. The answers given by lay witnesses like
                    Dr Gerard Tan should, therefore, be taken in their specific context. At
                    some part of his evidence, Dr Gerard Tan would appear to say that the
                    objective of the November Agreement was for the protection of the shareholders
                    of the Appellant, ie, the Respondent and the six doctors. But what benefit is
                    obtained by the Appellant would eventually inure for the benefit of its
                    shareholders. The answers of Dr Gerard Tan should be viewed in this light,
                    and we think that is the correct way of viewing the situation, and the answers
                    given by Dr Gerard Tan in no way suggest that the parties did not intend to
                    vest a right upon the Appellant to recover the sums prescribed in cll 11(b)
                    and 11(c). In short, the fact that the parties’ objective of entering into
                    the contract was to benefit themselves, the shareholders of the Appellant, does
                    not rebut the presumption that the parties intended the term to be enforceable
                    by the Appellant, a corporate vehicle they had established to advance and
                    protect their interests. To adopt the other view (ie, following the literal
                    answers given by Dr Gerard Tan) would mean that the parties had entered
                    into an agreement providing for liquidated damages for a breach of the covenant
                    which are neither enforceable by the Appellant nor by the parties (as
                    cl 11(c) does not confer a right to recover the liquidated damages upon the
                    parties), a totally senseless arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Before we move away from this issue, we ought
                    to mention that the Judge seemed, at [38], to think that the fact that the six
                    doctors and Dr Soh (“the seven doctors”) sold their
                    shareholdings in the Appellant (except for seven shares) to Unimedic was a
                    material consideration. This was what she said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no evidence or suggestion that Unimedic became bound by the
                        November Agreement as if it was an original party to the agreement when it
                        purchased shares in [the Appellant]. That being the case, Unimedic has to
                        justify (and there is no evidence on this) how it is entitled to the benefit
                        of the restrictive covenants through an action brought by [the
                        Appellant].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We are unable to see how the transfer by the
                    seven doctors of most of their shares in the Appellant should affect the right
                    of the Appellant to the liquidated damages due under cl 11 of the November
                    Agreement. It stands to reason and common sense that Unimedic would have paid
                    for the shares of the seven doctors on the basis of the November Agreement. In
                    other words, Unimedic, as the new owner of the Appellant, except for the seven
                    shares, was entitled to expect the Respondent and the seven doctors to keep to
                    the terms of the November Agreement and not start practice in competition with
                    the Appellant which managed the clinic by the name “Dr B C Ng Laser
                    Surgery”. We should at this juncture also add that the Judge, at [39],
                    seemed to think that unless Unimedic should become a party to the November
                    Agreement, like what Dr Soh did, the Appellant could no longer claim the
                    benefits under cl 11(c) on behalf of Unimedic. It is true that when
                    Dr Soh joined the Appellant, there was a novation involving all the
                    parties. On that occasion, that was the way the parties intended to admit
                    Dr Soh as a shareholder of the Appellant. That was a different situation
                    from the present where the seven doctors on their own sold almost all of their
                    shares in the Appellant to Unimedic. There is nothing in the November Agreement
                    which says that the parties to the Agreement could not sell their shares in the
                    Appellant to other parties nor is there any suggestion that the Articles of
                    Association of the Appellant contained a provision restricting the right of its
                    shareholders to transfer their shares to others. As we have explained above,
                    cl 11(c) of the November Agreement conferred a benefit on the Appellant
                    which it is entitled to enforce. The reasoning of the Judge (at [39] and [40])
                    showed that she relied on the Supplementary Agreement involving Dr Soh, as
                    well as the assignment by the seven doctors of their shares to Unimedic, to
                    construe that it was not the intention of the parties to confer a right on the
                    Appellant to recover the benefits conferred on it under cl 11(c). These two
                    events, which occurred long after the conclusion of the November Agreement, were
                    not the factual matrix upon which the November Agreement was entered into and
                    could not be relevant to the construction of cl 11(c).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether cl 11 was in unreasonable restraint of trade </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Clause 11 is undoubtedly a restraint of
                    trade covenant. The Court of Appeal has recently summarised the law on restraint
                    of trade clauses in <em>Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd v Wong Bark
                        Chuan David</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“<em>Man Financial</em>”). The case involved an employer-employee
                    relationship but this court had gone further to discuss the entire area of
                    restraint of trade clauses including the situation where there was a sale of a
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The court there cited, at [70], the statement
                    of the law by Lord Macnaghten in the case of <em>Thorsten
                        Nordenfelt v The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company,
                        Limited</em> [1894] AC 535 (“<em>Nordenfelt</em>”) at 565 as representing the law in this
                    area:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All interference with individual liberty of action in trading, and all
                        restraints of trade of themselves, if there is nothing more, are contrary to
                        public policy, and therefore void. That is the general rule. But there are
                        exceptions: restraints of trade … may be justified by the special
                        circumstances of a particular case. <em>It is a sufficient
                            justification, and indeed it is the only justification, if the
                            restriction is reasonable – reasonable, that is, in reference to
                            the interests of the parties concerned and reasonable in reference to
                            the interests of the public</em>, so framed and so guarded as to
                        afford adequate protection to the party in whose favour it is imposed, while
                        at the same time ... [being] in no way injurious to the public. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Therefore, all covenants in restraint of trade
                    are <em>prima facie</em> void. However, they can be held to
                    be valid if the party seeking to rely on the restrictive covenant can show that,
                    firstly, the clause concerned is reasonable in the interests of the <em>parties and</em>, secondly, the clause is also reasonable in
                    the interests of the <em>public</em>. Additionally, there
                    must be a legitimate proprietary interest to be protected. As was held in
                        <em>Man Financial</em>, the court will only enforce the
                    covenant if it goes no further than necessary to protect the legitimate
                    interests. There cannot be a bare and blatant restriction of the freedom to
                    trade – see the Privy Council decision of <em>Vancouver
                        Malt and Sake Brewing Company, Limited v Vancouver Breweries,
                        Limited</em> [1934] AC 181 (on appeal from the British Columbia
                    Court of Appeal). Moreover, even where a legitimate proprietary interest is
                    shown, the court will ensure that the covenant in restraint of trade goes
                        <em>no further than what is necessary</em> to protect
                    the interest concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     These being the general principles applicable
                    in this area of the law, we would, however, hasten to add that the courts take a
                    more liberal approach when considering restrictive covenants in the context of a
                    sale of business as compared to the situation where such a clause is contained
                    in a contract of employment. The following quotation from <em>Man
                        Financial</em>, at [48], is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As has been observed (see <em>Butterworths
                            Common Law Series</em> at para 5.114):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The reasons for this [<em>ie</em>, a stricter
                            application of the restraint of trade doctrine in the employment
                            context] include the following. First, unlike contracts of employment,
                                t<u>he purchaser in a sale of business of context
                                in whose favour the covenant is made is buying something tangible,
                                which includes (very importantly) the element of</u><em><u>goodwill</u></em><u>which would be necessarily depreciated if no
                                restrictive covenant were permitted</u>. An employer, on the
                            other hand, would not be deprived of what he has paid for pursuant to
                            the contract of employment (the employee’s services) when the
                            employee leaves his employ, although (as shall be seen) there are other
                            legitimate proprietary interests that may merit protection even within
                            this context. <b><em><u>Secondly, there is likely to be more

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Not contrary to public policy and legitimate interest to
                protect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We must reiterate at this juncture that we are
                    here concerned with a restrictive covenant imposed in relation to the sale of a
                    medical practice cum business. As would be apparent from the above (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> to <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>) there is a clear proprietary interest to be protected. Thus
                    cl 11 <em>per se</em> is not contrary to public
                    policy. The rationale for such a covenant was succinctly addressed in Nordenfelt
                    where Lord Herschell LC said, at 548:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that a covenant entered into in connection with the sale of a
                        goodwill of a business must be valid where the full benefit of the purchase
                        cannot be otherwise secured to the purchaser. It has been recognised in more
                        than one case that it is to the advantage of the public that there should be
                        free scope for the sale of the goodwill of a business or calling. These were
                        cases of partial restraint. But it seems to me that if there be occupations
                        where a sale of the goodwill would be greatly impeded, if not prevented,
                        unless a general covenant could be obtained by the purchaser, there are no
                        grounds of public policy which countervail the disadvantage which would
                        arise if the goodwill were in such cases rendered unsaleable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We will now restate the essential
                    circumstances of the present case. The Respondent injected his entire
                    sole-proprietorship firm known as AHA Centre, and medical practice known as
                    Dr B C Ng Laser Surgery, into BCNG Holdings. He also transferred to BCNG
                    Holdings his “book debts, existing pre-paid contracts and treatment
                    packages, stock-in trade, [clientele], patients, goodwill as well as all of the
                    assets belonging to and/or accruing to the sole proprietorship and medical
                    practice” – see cl 2.2(c)(i) of the April Agreement. The
                    Respondent subsequently sold 60% of his shares in BCNG Holdings to the Appellant
                    via the April Agreement. Therefore, the Appellant had a legitimate proprietary
                    interest which it wanted to protect through a similar restrictive covenant in
                    the April Agreement– the goodwill of the business and the medical practice
                    that had been transferred by the Respondent to BCNG Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Cl 11 is in the November Agreement. The
                    execution of the November Agreement was an event contemplated under the April
                    Agreement. Clause 8.7 of the April Agreement had provided that upon the
                    Appellant having purchased the remaining 40% of the shares which the Respondent
                    held in BCNG Holdings, all the existing shareholders of the Appellant would
                    enter into and execute a Shareholder’s Agreement in the form as annexed to
                    the April Agreement as “Appendix B”. As the Judge rightly
                    found, the November Agreement was a condition of the Appellant’s
                    purchase of the Respondent’s remaining 40% shareholding in BCNG Holdings.
                    Therefore, it was the clear understanding of all the parties that cl 11
                    would be the provision that would protect the purchaser’s legitimate
                    proprietary interest – the goodwill of the business and the medical
                    practice that was sold by the Respondent to BCNG Holdings, which is now 100%
                    owned by the Appellant. In short, the Respondent was paid for his goodwill and
                    he should not be permitted to remove parts of the goodwill by resuming practice
                    immediately after leaving the Appellant. A case very much on point is <em>Robin M Bridge v Deacons</em> [1984] 1 AC
                705.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We would end the discussion on this issue by
                    quoting the following passage from Lord Watson in <em>Nordenfelt</em> at 552:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think it is now generally conceded that it is to the advantage of the
                        public to allow a trader who has established a lucrative business to dispose
                        of it to a successor by whom it may be efficiently carried on. That object
                        could not be accomplished if, upon the score of public policy, the law
                        reserved to the seller an absolute and indefeasible right to start a rival
                        concern the day after he sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether reasonable in the interests of the parties </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We now turn to consider the reasonableness of
                    the scope of cl 11. The Judge held that the clause was drafted in very wide
                    terms and prohibited the parties from being engaged and/or interested in any
                    trade and/or business carried on in Singapore that was similar to the
                    “Business” of the Company and/or the practice of “Aesthetic
                    Medicine” in Singapore. The clause covered any and every type of practice
                    of aesthetic medicine and as such, was wider than reasonably necessary to
                    protect the goodwill sold by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Business of the Appellant” and practice of
                “Aesthetic Medicine”
            </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In this connection it is important to bear in
                    mind that the term “Aesthetic Medicine” is defined in both the
                    April Agreement and November Agreement as “moderately invasive medicine
                    in the process of laser and permanent hair reduction, photorejuvenation by
                    lasers and intense pulsed light machines and such, pigment management by lasers,
                    acne control via special skincare specific to [the Appellant] and [BCNG’s]
                    range and lasers, mesotherapy of body and face and all procedures and treatment
                    as understood by aesthetic medicine”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Clause 1.1 of the November Agreement
                    defines “Business” as the business of the Appellant as described
                    in cl 3 and such other business as the Appellant may carry on from time to
                    time. Clause 3 of the November Agreement provides that the business of the
                    Appellant shall continue to be in line with its object as set out in its
                    Memorandum of Association. The Memorandum of Association of the Appellant
                    defines the objects of the company really widely. Amongst others, the objects
                    for which the Appellant was established included the carrying on of the business
                    of medical specialists, medical surgeons, medical consultants, importers and
                    exporters or manufacturers of and dealers of in pharmaceutical, medicinal,
                    chemical, industrial and other preparations and articles, and the purchasing or
                    otherwise acquiring and holding and chartering of ships and vessels of all
                    kinds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Respondent argued that cl 11
                    therefore subjected the Respondent to a lot of restrictions. He was precluded
                    from practising even as a medical practitioner, nurse, pharmacist etc. The
                    Appellant, however, contended that there was no specific definition of
                    “Business” and cl 3 was merely a statement of intent that the
                    existing business would continue to be in line with the objects set out in its
                    Memorandum of Association. It seems to us that the parties have effectively
                    failed to define the business of the company. Clause 3, however, did
                    prescribe one limiting criterion, ie, the business must be in line with the
                    objects set out in the Appellant’s Memorandum of Association. It would be
                    incorrect for the Respondent to look only at the objects of the Appellant to
                    come to the meaning of “business” for the purposes of cl 11.
                    Understandably, the objects of the Appellant was crafted widely so that a
                    business actually undertaken by the Appellant would not be <em>ultra vires</em> its objects. The indisputable fact of the matter is
                    that the only business of the Appellant is that of a holding company, as all its
                    trading and other activities are being carried out by BCNG Holdings. It would be
                    consistent with the intention of the parties to construe the term
                    “Business of the Company” in cl 11 to mean the current
                    business of the company and any business which the Appellant actually embarked
                    upon and which is in line with the objects set out in its Memorandum of
                    Association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As regards the definition of “Aesthetic
                    Medicine” the Judge made the following observations at [71] of her
                    GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Gerard Tan admitted that the definition of “Aesthetic
                        Medicine” is wider than necessary to protect the shareholders’
                        interest as well as that of [the Appellant] and he also agreed that it
                        included other aesthetic medical procedures that [the Appellant] did not
                        provide currently. Clause 11 seems to cover any and every type of
                        practice of aesthetic medicine and as such it is wider than reasonably
                        necessary to protect the goodwill sold by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As we see it, the problem lies in the last
                    phrase of the definition of “Aesthetic Medicine” which reads
                    “and all procedures and treatment as understood by aesthetic
                    medicine”. This blanket restriction against engaging in anything that
                    comes under the rubric “aesthetic medicine” is clearly wider than
                    necessary to protect the aesthetic business that had been acquired by the
                    Appellant. It is clear what was actually sold to the Appellant via BCNG
                    Holdings. By cl 2.2(c)(i) of the April Agreement, the Respondent was to
                    transfer to BCNG Holdings his “book debts, existing pre-paid contracts
                    and treatment packages, stock-in-trade … , [clientele], patients,
                    goodwill as well as all of the assets belonging to and/or accruing to the
                    … sole proprietorship … and medical practice”. By
                    cl 2.2(c)(ii), the Respondent was to hand over and fully disclose to the
                    Appellant, “all of the trade secrets, which shall include but not limited
                    to treatment techniques and know-hows, source and suppliers of skin care &amp;
                    aesthetic equipment and products, skin care formulations
                etc”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     What the Appellant is entitled to protect is
                    the possibility, and indeed the evidence showed that it was a probability, of
                    the Appellant losing diehard customers of the Respondent to him in the event
                    that he is permitted, and not restrained, to resume medical practice in this
                    area after leaving the Appellant. The Appellant had legitimate proprietary
                    interests which should be protected. However, there is no need, indeed, no
                    justification whatsoever, to prevent the Respondent from engaging in other forms
                    of aesthetic medicine for which he had not developed a clientele when he sold
                    the business/practice to BCNG Holdings and in turn to the Appellant. The
                    specific cases/examples of aesthetic medicine which are given in the definition
                    of aesthetic medicine constituted the legitimate aspects of goodwill which the
                    Appellant had paid for and which should be protected and nothing more:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… moderately invasive medicine in the process of laser and
                        permanent hair reduction, photorejuvenation by lasers and intense pulsed
                        light machines and such, pigment management by lasers, acne control via
                        special skincare specific to [the Appellant] and [BCNG’s] range and
                        lasers, mesotherapy of body and face ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Accordingly, we hold that the very last part
                    of the definition of “aesthetic medicine” is wider than necessary
                    to protect the legitimate interests of the Appellant. We will return to this
                    clause when dealing with the principle of severance – see <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> to <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-Solicitation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Clause 11(a)(ii) prohibited the
                    Respondent from soliciting any employee of the Appellant without reference
                    to his or her seniority or importance to the business. It also prohibited the
                    Respondent from soliciting such employees even if their employment with the
                    Appellant commenced after the Respondent had left the company. At first glance,
                    it seems unreasonable that the Respondent is liable for the said sum of $1m
                    regardless of whether he breaches cl 11a(i) or cl 11(a)(ii).
                    Similarly, it would seem that the Respondent would be liable even if he were to
                    entice a cleaner. However, as emphasised by this Court in <em>Man
                        Financial</em> at [141], the court should not read such clauses
                    literally, wrenched out of its context. Very much the same point is made by
                        <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> vol 1 (Thomson
                    Reuters (Legal) Limited, 30th Ed, 2008) at para 16-097:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts will attempt to construe a covenant so as to achieve the
                        parties’ intention where there has been a “mere want of
                        accuracy of expression” with the consequence that the covenant will
                        be upheld as not being too wide. However, for this principle to apply it
                        must be clear from the contract and the surrounding circumstances what
                        exactly are the terms of the more limited covenant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the actual factual matrix is important. As we see it, the main
                    thrust of the restrictions set out under cl 11(a) (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above where this clause is quoted in full) is
                    really that in sub-paragraph (i). All the rest of the restrictions set out
                    in sub-paragraphs (ii) to (iv) of that clause flow from this. There would
                    be no reason for the Respondent, or for that matter any of the seven doctors, to
                    want to entice another doctor or shareholder doctor to leave the Appellant
                    unless he or she has already left the Appellant and has set up a competitive
                    practice or is about to do so, in which event, that person would have breached
                    sub-paragraph (i), besides breaching sub-paragraph (ii). And similarly
                    for sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv). Although sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv)
                    of cl 11 appear to be listed disjunctively, because of the use of the term
                    “and/or” at the end of sub-paragraph (iii), infringements of
                    sub-paragraphs (ii) to (iv) would in effect only occur if there is also an
                    infringement of sub-paragraph (i). That is the sensible way of reading
                    cl 11(a) and accordingly, the restrictions listed thereunder are
                    reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Area </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As regards the question of whether the present
                    restraint which extended to the whole of Singapore was reasonable, we note that
                    the Judge held that such a restraint was necessary since the Respondent had a
                    loyal following of patients wherever he was located. In the light of the
                    goodwill established by the Respondent with those diehard patients, such a
                    general restraint over the whole of Singapore was clearly warranted, otherwise,
                    the goodwill in aesthetic medicine which the Respondent had sold to BCNG
                    Holdings, and in turn to the Appellant, would be seriously undermined. On this
                    point, we agree with the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Time </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     However, the Judge found that the restriction
                    of three years was unreasonably long. The Respondent has highlighted that
                    following Unimedic’s acquisition of the Appellant, the other seven doctors
                    came to be bound under a new and much less restrictive restraint of trade
                    covenant that did not restrict any of them from practising aesthetic medicine on
                    their own, except within a two- kilometre radius of the Appellant’s
                    aesthetic medical clinics for a period of two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In this regard, we would make four comments.
                    First, the reasonableness of a clause is to be judged as at the date the
                    contract was entered into, and not after: see, eg, <em>Commercial
                        Plastics Ltd v Vincent</em> [1965] 1 KB 623 at 644 and <em>Queensland Co-operative Milling Association v Pamag Pty
                        Ltd</em> (1973) 133 CLR 260 at 281. Second, it must be remembered
                    that the Respondent was not a party to the Unimedic Agreement. The Respondent
                    was not only a medical practitioner of more than 25 years’ standing, but
                    also someone with an established reputation in aesthetic medicine. None of the
                    seven doctors was of that standing and neither did any of them have that kind of
                    goodwill with patients in that area of practice. As indicated in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, the six doctors (not including
                    Dr Soh) had sought him out because he was a leading practitioner in the
                    field. Even the Judge had noted that, “The plaintiff’s prominence,
                    seniority and experience in the market for aesthetic medicine is such that it
                    would not be easy to say that a restraint for an appropriate period of time in
                    Singapore would be in any way unreasonable if the original purchasers of his
                    business were to be able to protect their asset.” Third, in
                    cross-examination, the Respondent testified that 35% of the revenue generating
                    patients were what he called “diehards”, meaning patients who
                    would always choose him as their doctor rather than any other doctor if he was
                    available to them. Fourth, there was evidence that the period of restraint of
                    three years was proposed by the Respondent. It was not something insisted upon
                    by the six doctors who were certainly in no position to insist, as the evidence
                    showed that the Respondent was in a much stronger bargaining position. In the
                    words of the Respondent, “they persuaded me to sell to them”.
                    These aforesaid considerations must be borne in mind when considering the
                    reasonableness of the three-year period of restraint, which we find, with
                    respect to the Judge, was not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the liquidated damages of one million dollars was a penalty
                and therefore unenforceable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Judge held that the liquidated damages in
                    cl 11(c) was a penalty and therefore unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Where parties stipulate in a contract the sum
                    to be paid in the event of a breach, the contract sum is enforceable if it is a
                    genuine pre-estimate of loss but not if it constitutes a penalty. It is for the
                    party being sued on the agreed sum to show that the term is a penalty.
                    Therefore, the burden is on the Respondent to prove that the term was a
                    penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The contracting parties’ use of the
                    terms “penalty” and “liquidated damages” is not
                    determinative though they would be relevant indicators of what was intended by
                    the parties. In <em>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, Limited v New
                        Garage and Motor Company, Limited</em> [1915] AC 79,
                    Lord Dunedin explained, at 86–87, that the question whether a sum
                    stipulated was a penalty or liquidated damages was a question of construction to
                    be decided “upon the terms and inherent circumstances of each particular
                    contract, judged of as at the time of the making of the contract, not at the
                    time of the breach”. He then laid down the following guidelines, at 87,
                    to assist in determining if a clause for payment of a fixed sum was a penalty or
                    a genuine pre-estimate of loss:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_a"></a>(a)     It will be held to be a penalty if
                        the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in amount in
                        comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have
                        followed from the breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_b"></a>(b)     It will be held to be a penalty if the breach consists
                        only in not paying a sum of money, and the sum stipulated is a sum greater
                        than the sum which ought to have been paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_c"></a>(c)     There is a presumption (but no more) that it is
                        penalty when “a single lump sum is made payable by way of
                        compensation, on the occurrence of one or more or all of several events,
                        some of which may occasion serious and others but trifling
                        damage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Respondent argued that the Appellant had
                    failed to show any evidence that the clause was a genuine pre-estimate of loss.
                    The Appellant on the other hand pointed out that the Respondent’s
                    testimony shows that his “diehard patients” contributed to 35% of
                    the revenue he generated when he was practising on his own. Since the
                    Respondent’s total revenue then per annum amounted to $1.3m to $1.4m, 35%
                    of this would be $445,000 to $490,000 per year. Over 3 years, this would amount
                    to $1,365,000 to $1,470,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In <em>Philips Hong Kong
                        Limited v The Attorney General of Hong Kong</em> [1993] 1 HKLR
                    269 (“<em>Philips Hong Kong</em>”), the Privy
                    Council observed, at 279:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except possibly in the case of situations where one of the
                        parties to the contract is able to dominate the other as to the choice of
                        the terms of a contract, it will normally be insufficient to establish that
                        a provision is objectionably penal to identify situations where the
                        application of the provision could result in a larger sum being recovered by
                        the injured party than his actual loss. <em>Even in such
                            situations so long as the sum payable in the event of non-compliance
                            with the contract is not extravagant, having regard to the range of
                            losses that it could reasonably be anticipated it would have to cover at
                            the time the contract was made, it can still be a genuine pre-estimate
                            of the loss that would be suffered and so a perfectly valid liquidated
                            damage provision</em>. The use in argument of unlikely
                        illustrations should therefore not assist a party to defect a provision as
                        to liquidated damages. As the Law Commission stated in Working Paper
                        No. 61 (page 30):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The fact that in certain circumstances a party to a contract might
                            derive a benefit in excess of his loss does not ... outweigh the very
                            definite practical advantages of the present rule upholding a genuine
                            estimate, formed at the time the contract was made of the probable
                            loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This statement of the law was endorsed by this Court in <em>Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tan Gin Huay</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 755.Their Lordships of the Privy Council in <em>Philips Hong Kong</em> further added, at 283:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To conclude otherwise involves making the error of assuming that, because
                        in some hypothetical situation the loss suffered will be less than the sum
                        quantified in accordance with the liquidated damage provision, that
                        provision must be a penalty, at least in the situation in which the minimum
                        payment restriction operates. <em>It illustrates the danger
                            which is inherent in arguments based on hypothetical situations where it
                            is said that the loss might be less than the sum specified as payable as
                            liquidated damages. Arguments of this nature should not be allowed to
                            divert attention from the correct test as to what is a penalty provision
                            - namely, is it a genuine pre-estimate of what the loss is likely to be?
                            - to the different question, namely, are there possible circumstances
                            where a lesser loss would be suffered?</em><u>[</u>emphasis added<u>]</u></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Therefore, the question to be considered is
                    not whether there are possible circumstances where a lesser loss would be
                    suffered but whether the sum is so extravagant, having regard to the range of
                    damages which the innocent party was likely to suffer, that it could not
                    constitute a genuine estimate of the damages that he could have suffered. Here,
                    we would reiterate the point made in <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>
                    above that the restriction listed under cl 11(a) should not be read
                    literally wrenched out of its context. We would emphasise that the Respondent
                    had the burden of showing that the specified liquidated sum was so extravagant
                    that it could not constitute a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the
                    Appellant could suffer on account of him setting up a practice in aesthetic
                    medicine in competition with the Appellant. The Appellant has not adduced any
                    evidence to that effect. On the contrary, as can be seen from <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> above, the sum of $1m could be a genuine
                    pre-estimate of the damages which the Appellant could suffer if the Respondent
                    were to have breached cl 11(a)(i). We would further underscore the fact
                    that cl 11(c) prescribed a lower sum of $700,000 as the liquidated damages
                    payable for a similar breach by any of the seven doctors. This shows that the
                    parties had carefully considered and calibrated the liquidated damages payable
                    and the higher amount payable by the Respondent reflected the greater expertise
                    and goodwill which the Respondent has in the field of aesthetic
                medicine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether unreasonable portions can be severed </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     We turn next to consider the principle of
                    severance. Even where a restraint of trade clause is found to be unreasonable,
                    the courts should still consider whether the doctrine of severance could apply
                    so that the reasonable part of the clause can be upheld. In <em>Man Financial</em>, this court held at [127]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Put simply, in order to apply the doctrine of severance so as to save an
                        otherwise (<em>prima facie</em>) offending clause, the
                        court concerned must be able to run, as it were, a “blue
                        pencil” through the offending words in that clause <em>without altering the meaning of the provision and, of course, without
                            rendering it senseless (whether in a grammatical sense or
                            otherwise)</em>. In other words, the court will not rewrite the
                        contract for the parties. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Judge held that the court could run a
                    “blue pencil” through the words “the Business of the
                    Company”. However, as discussed earlier (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> and <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above), the
                    words “the Business of the Company” is not unreasonable.
                    Therefore, the court need not run the blue pencil through the words “the
                    Business of the Company”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     However, on the definition of
                    “Aesthetic Medicine”, the Judge held that she could not sever any
                    portion and yet not alter the meaning. We find that a little difficult to
                    understand. As we see it, by “not altering the meaning” does not
                    mean that the original version of the clause and the modified clause (after
                    running the blue pencil through) must mean the same. It is illogical to expect
                    the two versions to be the same if the court needs to run the blue pencil
                    through the original clause to excise something objectionable therein. The
                    phrase “not altering the meaning” just means not altering the
                    sense of what remains of the clause after running the blue pencil through. All
                    it means is that the obnoxious portion must be capable of being removed without
                    the necessity of adding to or modifying the wording of what remains: see
                        <em>Attwood v Lamont</em> [1920] 3 KB 571 at 593
                        <em>per</em> Younger LJ; <em>T Lucas and Co Ltd v Mitchell</em> [1974] Ch 129 and
                        <em>Sadler v Imperial Life assurance Co of Canada
                        Ltd</em> [1988] IRLR 388. In the present case, the words
                    “and all procedures and treatment as understood by aesthetic
                    medicine” can easily be severed from the definition of “Aesthetic
                    Medicine” in the November Agreement and what remains makes perfect sense
                    and is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Accordingly, we hold that the Appellant has
                        <em>locus standi</em> to enforce cl 11 in the
                    November Agreement. While cl 11 is in a sense unreasonably wide, the
                    unreasonable portion can be severed so as to render it reasonable. In the
                    premises, the appeal is allowed with costs here and below and with the usual
                    consequential orders. There shall be judgment in favour of the Appellant in the
                    sum of $763,500, being the difference between $1m and $236,500.</p>
