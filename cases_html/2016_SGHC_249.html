In this familiar situation, it has been held that the validity of the arbitration agreement and the existence of a binding contract would “stand or fall together” and the court would usually determine <span class="font-italic">both</span> issues collectively (see <span class="font-italic">Hyundai Merchant Marine </span><span class="font-italic">Company Ltd v Americas Bulk Transport Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 470 (Comm) at [35]–[36], cited in <span class="font-italic">Jiangsu Overseas Group Co Ltd v Concord Energy Pte Ltd and another matter </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1336<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The present case is a departure from that conventional approach. It concerned an International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) arbitration commenced by the defendant against the plaintiff. The dispute arose from a proposed sale of shares (“the Shares”) in a company by the plaintiff to the defendant under a sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”). Seven drafts of the SPA, which incorporated an ICC arbitration clause, were circulated and negotiated but the SPA was not eventually signed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 When the plaintiff decided not to proceed with the proposed sale of the Shares, the defendant commenced ICC arbitration proceedings, purportedly pursuant to the arbitration clause in the SPA. A sole arbitrator (“the Arbitrator”) was appointed. The plaintiff raised a preliminary objection to the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction on the basis, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that no ICC arbitration agreement had been concluded between the parties. The parties agreed to bifurcate the arbitration. There were thus to be two stages: (a) the jurisdictional challenge; and (b) the hearing on the merits, which has yet to take place. For the jurisdictional challenge, the Arbitrator sensibly proposed to the parties that in dealing with the jurisdictional issue, he should also deal with some issues on the merits, in particular, whether a legally binding SPA was concluded between the parties. This would be entirely in line with the conventional approach. However, the defendant was not agreeable to the Arbitrator’s suggestion and the parties thereafter agreed that the Arbitrator would only decide the jurisdictional issue without examining the question whether a valid SPA had been concluded between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Interestingly, the defendant’s case is that a binding ICC arbitration agreement was concluded <span class="font-italic">before</span> the conclusion of the SPA. In advancing this case theory, the defendant argued, relying on the doctrine of separability, that the arbitration clause is separate from and independent of the SPA. Given the defendant’s case that the arbitration agreement <span class="font-italic">pre</span><span class="font-italic">-dated</span> the SPA, it is perhaps explicable why the parties agreed that the Arbitrator should decide the jurisdictional challenge without reference to the question whether the SPA was <span class="font-italic">separately</span> concluded between them. For reasons as explained below, in a situation where the arbitration clause was negotiated in the context of a contract, such an approach is problematic from the perspective of the parties and consequently, the Arbitrator as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As a consequence of the defendant’s case theory, the identity of the governing law of the arbitration agreement, as distinct from the governing law of the SPA, was a hotly contested issue in the arbitration. The defendant asserted that the substantive law governing the arbitration agreement should be the same law governing the SPA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, New York law, while the plaintiff’s case was that the arbitration agreement should be governed by the law of the seat of the arbitration, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore law. That dispute continued to occupy some misplaced primacy in this application. The contest between New York law and Singapore law was misplaced simply because both parties acknowledged during the hearing that there was, in real and practical terms, no material difference between the two systems of law insofar as they relate to the only substantive issue before this court – whether an arbitration agreement was formed. This was essentially the finding of the Arbitrator as well.

</div>
</div> Nonetheless, owing to seemingly conflicting authorities on this issue, this judgment will examine the two competing positions because in some situations, the differences in the laws may well have a direct and material bearing on the outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Eventually, the Arbitrator proceeded to determine the jurisdictional issues as framed by the parties, in particular, whether a valid and binding ICC arbitration agreement had come into existence as a matter of law. In his First Partial Award dated 15 April 2016 (“Award”), he found that a valid ICC arbitration agreement was indeed concluded between the parties by 18 July 2013 principally on the basis that mutual assent to the arbitration agreement could be inferred from the exchange of drafts subsequent to the second draft SPA containing an identical arbitration provision coupled with the plaintiff’s statement that it was ready to sign the sixth draft, which contained the arbitration clause. This judgment will examine, in the context of negotiations of a contract which incorporates an arbitration clause, when and under what circumstances parties would intend to create legal relations by entering into a discrete arbitration agreement independently and, more critically, <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> the conclusion of the contract itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiff has filed this application under s 10(3) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) for a declaration that the Arbitrator has no jurisdiction to hear any claim advanced by the defendant under the SPA in the arbitration. Owing to the circumstances under which this application was filed, it is imperative to bear in mind that the issue before me is <span class="font-italic">not</span> whether the dispute as to the existence of the SPA fell within the arbitration clause. Instead, this court has been specifically tasked by the parties to decide, on a balance of probabilities, whether an arbitration agreement, independent of the SPA, was concluded between the parties by 18 July 2013. This inquiry goes to the heart of the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I start by recounting, as far as is relevant to these proceedings, the course of the negotiations leading to the aborted SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The negotiations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The plaintiff is a foreign bank and was at all material times the owner of the Shares.

The plaintiff disagrees and submits that decisive weight should be accorded to the law of the seat of the arbitration in determining the parties’ implied choice of law.

In that case, several Brazilian companies made claims under two insurance policies. The policies were stated to be governed exclusively by Brazilian law and contained a two-tiered arbitration clause: if the parties were unable to first resolve the dispute through meditation, the dispute would be referred to arbitration. London was chosen as the seat of arbitration. The insurers denied liability and gave notice of arbitration without referring the dispute to mediation. The insured companies commenced court proceedings in Brazil. The insurers were thereafter granted an injunction by the English High Court to restrain the insured companies from continuing with court proceedings in Brazil. The insured companies appealed against the injunction, arguing that under the law of Brazil, the arbitration clause could not be invoked against them without their consent. Whether the injunction should continue was thus dependant on whether the arbitration clause could be invoked against the insured companies, which was to be determined by the law governing the arbitration agreement. The English Court of Appeal found that it was governed by English law. Applying English law, it found, first, that the clause requiring parties to submit their dispute to mediation was not a binding obligation (at [36]), and second, either party could refer to arbitration any dispute arising out of or in connection with the policy (at [41]). Hence, the insurers validly referred the dispute to arbitration and the High Court was right to grant the injunction.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The starting point of Moore-Bick LJ’s analysis, with which Hallett LJ agreed, was that in the absence of any indication to the contrary, parties are assumed to have intended the whole of their relationship to be governed by the same system of law. This meant that in the absence of an express choice of law for the arbitration agreement, the “natural inference” was that the proper law of the main contract should also govern the arbitration agreement (at [11]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Moore-Bick LJ then drew a distinction between the following two scenarios (at [26]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If there was a “free-standing agreement to arbitrate” containing no express choice of law, it is unlikely that there would be sufficient basis for finding an implied choice of law and it would be necessary to identify the law with which the arbitration agreement had the closest and most real connection. The significance of the choice of seat, in such a case, would be “overwhelming” and the law of the seat would most likely be the governing law of the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If, however, the arbitration agreement formed part of a substantive contract, the express choice of proper law governing the substantive contract would be a “strong indication of the parties’ intentions in relation to the agreement to arbitrate”, with the result that the implied choice of law for the arbitration agreement was likely to be the same as the expressly chosen law of the substantive contract. This conclusion might be displaced by the terms of the arbitration agreement itself or the consequences for its effectiveness of choosing the proper law of the substantive contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The facts of <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span> fell within the second scenario. Moore-Bick LJ found that the starting point that Brazilian law was the implied choice of law of the arbitration agreement was displaced for two reasons. The first was that London was chosen as the seat of the arbitration, which tended to suggest that parties intended for English law to govern all aspects of the arbitration agreement (at [29]). The second was that the principle under Brazilian law that an arbitration agreement could only be invoked with the insured companies’ consent undermined the clear words of the agreement, which clearly allowed either party to refer any dispute to arbitration. This implied that the parties did not intend the arbitration agreement to be governed by Brazilian law (at [30]). Since it could not be said that the parties impliedly chose Brazilian law to govern the arbitration agreement, Moore-Bick LJ went on to the third step of the choice-of-law analysis and found that the arbitration agreement had the closest and most real connection with the law of the seat of the arbitration, which was English law (at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Moore-Bick LJ’s holding that the implied choice of law of the arbitration agreement would likely be the same as the expressly chosen law of the main contract was itself a departure from the view of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">C v D</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2008] 1 All ER (Comm) 1001 where Longmore LJ held at [26] that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">it</span><span class="font-italic"> would be rare for the law of the (separable) arbitration agreement to be different from the law of the seat of the arbitration</span>. The reason is that an agreement to arbitrate will normally have a closer and more real connection with the place where the parties have chosen to arbitrate than with the place of the law of the underlying contract in cases where the parties have deliberately chosen to arbitrate in one place disputes which have arisen under a contract governed by the law of another place.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span>, Lord Neuberger MR, who issued a separate concurring opinion, agreed that the governing law was English law but considered (at [59]) that it was unnecessary to choose between two seemingly inconsistent strands of authority, one favouring the view that it is rare for the law of the arbitration agreement to be other than the governing law of the contract, the other (represented mainly by <span class="font-italic">C v D</span>) saying it would be rare for the governing law not to be the law of the seat. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">FirstLink</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This brings me to <span class="font-italic">FirstL</span><span class="font-italic">ink</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>which is the principal authority relied on by the plaintiff. In that case, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants for breach of contract and the first defendant applied to stay the court proceedings under s 6 of the IAA based on the following arbitration agreement in the contract (at [4]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any claim will be adjudicated by Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

Both parties expressly agree not to bring the disputes to any other court jurisdictions, except as agreed here to the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The choice of law clause stated that the agreement as a whole was “governed by and interpreted under the laws of Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce” (at [9]). The plaintiff sought to resist the stay by arguing that the arbitration agreement was null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed – in other words, that it was invalid (at [5]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Assistant Registrar (“AR”) found that the governing law of the arbitration agreement was Swedish law and that, since the plaintiff had not submitted that the arbitration agreement was invalid under Swedish law, it failed to show that the arbitration agreement was invalid (at [17]). In arriving at this decision, the AR adopted the three-step test in <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span> but disagreed with the “<span class="font-italic">rebuttable</span> presumption that the express substantive law of the contract would be taken as the parties’ implied choice of the proper law governing the arbitration agreement” (at [11])(emphasis in original). The AR’s view (at [13]) was that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it cannot always be assumed that commercial parties want the same system of law to govern their relationship of performing the substantive obligations under the contract, and the quite separate (and often unhappy) relationship of resolving disputes when problems arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The AR then held (at [16]) that in the absence of indications to the contrary, the law should find that parties have impliedly chosen the law of the seat as the proper law to govern the arbitration agreement, in a situation of “direct competition between the chosen substantive law and the law of the chosen seat of arbitration”. In short, the AR found, contrary to Moore-Bick LJ’s view in <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span>, that in the absence of an express choice, the default position is that the law of the seat should be the governing law of the arbitration agreement. Applying this approach, the AR found that the parties had selected Sweden as the seat of arbitration, and therefore, that they had impliedly selected the law of Sweden as the governing law of the arbitration agreement (at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My view </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I agree with Moore-Bick LJ’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Sulaméric</span><span class="font-italic">a</span> that the implied choice of law for the arbitration agreement is likely to be the same as the expressly chosen law of the substantive contract. This presumption is supported by the weight of authority and is, in any event, preferable as a matter of principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As to the weight of authority, I disagree with the plaintiff that <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span> represents the law in Singapore. There are other decisions of the High Court where the governing law of the arbitration agreement was implied from that of the main contract. The defendant referred me to two such cases: <span class="font-italic">Piallo</span><span class="font-italic"> GmbH v Yafriro International Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 1028 (“<span class="font-italic">Piallo</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Cassa</span><span class="font-italic"> di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza SpA v Rals International Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 79 (“<span class="font-italic">Rals</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I should first say that in both these cases, the court did not specifically address the competing approaches in <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span>. There was no reason to do so since there was no divergence between the law of the main contract and the law of the seat of the arbitration. That does not mean, however, that they are not authorities for the applicability of the presumption; it only means that in those cases, there was no occasion to consider what factors, if any, might displace the law of the main contract as the implied choice of law for the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Piallo</span>, the governing law of the contract was Swiss law and the seat of the arbitration was Geneva. At issue was the scope of the arbitration agreement, which was to be decided in accordance with the applicable law of the arbitration agreement. Belinda Ang Saw Ean J found that, since the governing law of the main agreement was Swiss law, the scope of the arbitration agreement “[stood] properly to be decided under Swiss law” (at [20]). I note that <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span> was not cited in this judgment. I should add that the outcome would have been the same even if the law of the seat was the governing law of the arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span> was, however, cited in <span class="font-italic">Rals</span>. A supply agreement was expressly governed by Singapore law. The arbitration clause provided for Singapore as the seat of arbitration. The court had to decide whether a party was bound by the arbitration agreement. This could be a matter for the law of the supply agreement or the law of the arbitration agreement, although Vinodh Coomaraswamy J preferred the latter (at [88]). Since Singapore law governed both the supply agreement and the arbitration agreement, there was no competition between the two possible governing laws. As to the governing law of the arbitration agreement, however, Coomaraswamy J had observed at [76] that it was Singapore law because: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Singapore law governs the broader agreement … in which the arbitration agreement is found and there is, in this case, no reason to move beyond the starting assumption that the parties intended the same law to govern both agreements (<span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span><span class="font-italic"> Cia Nacional de Seguros SA v Enesa Engelharia SA</span> [2013] 1WLR 102 (“<span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span>”) at [11]–[14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my view, it was strictly unnecessary, on the facts of <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span>, for the AR to depart from <span class="font-italic">Sulaméric</span><span class="font-italic">a</span> in favour of a starting presumption in favour of the law of the seat. This issue would only arise for consideration in a situation where, in the AR’s words, there is a “direct competition” between the law of the main contract and the law of the seat. There was no such competition in <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span> because, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and the present case, neither the governing law of the main contract nor the seat of the arbitration was <span class="font-italic">explicitly</span> chosen to begin with. The choice of law clause did not specify a national system of law. Instead, it provided for the laws of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (“SCC”) to apply. Further, the arbitration clause (reproduced above at [47]) was imprecisely drafted and did not <span class="font-italic">explicitly</span> state that the seat of arbitration was Sweden. The AR found this to be the case from the reference to disputes being submitted to the SCC (at [17]). I agree with the Arbitrator that the mere reference to rules of the SCC did not necessarily point to Sweden as the seat of the arbitration. This is because under the SCC rules, it would have been for the board of the SCC to decide the seat in the absence of the parties’ express agreement.

I will mention just two such commentaries. Professor Adrian Briggs suggests that it would be “surprising” if the governing law of the main contract would not also govern the arbitration agreement since a choice of law expressed in customarily broad and general terms would ordinarily draw no distinction between the main contract and the arbitration agreement (see Adrian Briggs, <span class="font-italic">Private International Law in English Courts</span> (Oxford University Press, 2014) at para 14.39). By contrast, David Joseph QC suggests that if there is no express choice of governing law for the arbitration agreement, the courts “will require the presence of some further particular circumstance to apply a governing law other than the law of the seat” (see David Joseph QC, <span class="font-italic">Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2015) at para 6.36). <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span> is the only authority cited in support of this proposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The foregoing review demonstrates that more cases appear to favour the <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span> approach. Though none of them are binding precedents, in my view, the approach in <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span> is to be preferred. Where the arbitration agreement is a clause forming part of a main contract, it is reasonable to assume that the contracting parties intend their entire relationship to be governed by the same system of law. If the intention is otherwise, I do not think it is unreasonable to expect the parties to specifically provide for a different system of law to govern the arbitration agreement. In practice, parties rarely specify the law applicable to the arbitration agreement as distinct from the main contract (see Gary B Born, “The Law Governing International Arbitration Agreements: An International Perspective” (2014) 26 SAcLJ 814 at para 34). When a choice of law clause (such as the one here) stipulates that the “agreement” is to be governed by one country’s system of law, the natural inference should be that parties intend the express choice of law to “govern and determine the construction of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the clauses in the agreement which they signed <span class="font-italic">including the arbitration agreement</span>” (see <span class="font-italic">Arsanovia</span> at [22]) (emphasis added). To say that the word “agreement” contemplates all the clauses in the main contract save for the arbitration clause would in fact be inconsistent with its ordinary meaning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The suggestion that the arbitration agreement is a distinct agreement with a governing law distinct from that of the main contract is often justified by the doctrine of separability.

</div>
</div> However, the doctrine of separability serves to give effect to the parties’ expectation that their arbitration clause – embodying their chosen method of dispute resolution – remains effective even if the main contract is alleged or found to be invalid. It does not mean that the arbitration clause forms a distinct agreement from the time the main contract is formed. Resort need only be had to the doctrine of separability when the validity of the arbitration agreement itself is challenged. This is clear from Article 16 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration set out in the First Schedule of the IAA (“Model Law”): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Article 16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. <span class="font-italic">For that purpose</span>, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail <span class="font-italic">ipso jure</span> the invalidity of the arbitration clause.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Separability serves the narrow though vital purpose of ensuring that any challenge that the main contract is invalid does not, in itself, affect the validity of the arbitration agreement. This is necessary because the challenge to the validity of the arbitration agreement often takes the form of a challenge to the validity of the main contract. However, as Moore-Bick LJ noted in <span class="font-italic">Sulaméric</span><span class="font-italic">a</span>, separability does not “insulate the arbitration agreement from the substantive contract for all purposes” (at [26]). It is one thing to say that under the doctrine of separability, a party cannot avoid the obligation to submit a dispute to arbitration by merely denying the existence of the underlying contract; it is quite different to say that because of this doctrine, parties intended to enter into an arbitration agreement independent of the underlying contract. This does not reflect commercial reality. As the AR himself noted in <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span>, such arbitration clauses are “midnight clauses”: they are typically included (or finalised) at the last minute (see <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [1]). In any event, they are typically negotiated as part of the main contract and hence are unlikely to be negotiated independently from it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The AR’s preference for the law of the seat in <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was premised on two main reasons. With respect, neither leads inexorably to a presumption in favour of the law of the seat. The first was that when a dispute arises between commercial parties, the natural inference is that primacy is to be accorded to the neutral law selected by parties to govern the proceedings of dispute resolution (at [13]). That neutral law, the AR found, would be the law of the seat. The plaintiff argued that this accorded with commercial sensibility.

</div> That choice of law may in some cases have no apparent connection with any of the parties or the place of performance of their obligations. The present case provides a convenient illustration: New York is not the place of business of the plaintiff, the defendant, W, or Y; nor is it where the Shares are situated. Therefore, the presumed desire for neutrality is not necessarily a strong enough reason for favouring the law of the seat over the law of the main contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The AR’s second reason was that parties would not intend an arbitration agreement valid under the law of the main contract only for it to be declared invalid under the law of the seat, for that would run a serious risk of creating an unenforceable award (see <span class="font-italic">FirstLink</span> at [14]).

</div> He reasoned that “rational businessmen <span class="font-italic">must</span> commonly intend the awards to be binding and enforceable” and hence “would <span class="font-italic">primarily</span> be focused on the law of the seat” (emphasis in original). He relied on this reason in support of his view that the law of the seat should ordinarily be the governing law of the arbitration agreement. The AR referred to the fact that an arbitral award may be set aside, or refused to be enforced, if the arbitration agreement is invalid either under the law to which the parties have subjected it <span class="font-italic">or</span>, failing any indication thereon, the law of the seat (see Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) and Article 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law). However, validity under the law of the seat only arises for consideration if there is no indication of the law the parties have “subjected” the agreement to. The law that the parties have subjected the agreement to would include their implied choice.

</div> As Gary Born observes, Articles 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) and 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) aim at “giving effect to any express or implied choice-of-law by the parties and, failing such agreement, prescribing a default rule, selecting the law of the arbitral seat” (Gary B. Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration </span><span class="font-italic">Vol I</span> (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>”) at 526). Therefore, this argument only brings us back to the question of what the implied choice of law is and whether that should be the law of the main contract or the law of the seat. It does not necessarily support a presumption in favour of the law of the seat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Therefore, where the arbitration agreement is part of the main contract, I would hold, adopting <span class="font-italic">Sulamérica</span>, that the governing law of the main contract is a strong indicator of the governing law of the arbitration agreement unless there are indications to the contrary. The choice of a seat different from the law of the governing contract would not in itself be sufficient to displace that starting point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 How does this choice-of-law analysis apply to a freestanding arbitration agreement? It is first important to be clear what exactly the term “freestanding arbitration agreement” is intended to mean. Arbitration agreements are typically never concluded in a vacuum and are usually part of a substantive contract. Freestanding arbitration agreements may arise, though comparatively rarely, in limited situations. I can think of two such situations. In the case of “highly complex transactions”, for example, parties may execute a separate arbitration agreement providing for the arbitration of disputes relating to several contracts or to an overall project (see Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> at p 491). However, Born adds that this will rarely be done. Another example of a freestanding arbitration agreement is one concluded by parties after a dispute has arisen. In <span class="font-italic">Viscous Global Investments Ltd v Palladium Navigation Corporation </span><span class="font-italic">“Quest”</span> [2014] EWHC 2654, there were four bills of lading which each purported to incorporate the arbitration clause of a charterparty without identifying any particular charterparty. The plaintiff’s cargo was damaged and the defendant’s P&amp;I Club issued a letter of undertaking providing security for the plaintiff’s claims. The letter of undertaking contained an arbitration clause, which Males J found to be “perfectly capable of operating as a new and free standing agreement” (at [22]). In both these cases, the arbitration agreement is freestanding because it is not intended to be a term of any other contract. Therefore, there is no question of any express choice of governing law of a main contract to govern the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 If an arbitration agreement is freestanding in that sense, then I agree that when determining the proper law of this freestanding arbitration agreement, if there is no express choice of law, the law of the seat would most likely be the governing law of the arbitration agreement. This accords with the broader principle that if there is no express choice of law for any contract, the law of seat can be an indicator of the implied choice of its governing law (see <span class="font-italic">Habas</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [102]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to this case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Arbitrator found that there was a rebuttable presumption that the proper law of the arbitration agreement was New York law and that the choice of a Singapore seat did not, by itself, displace that presumption.

</div>
</div> Clearly, the defendant is relying on the SPA to support its submission that the governing law of the arbitration agreement and the SPA is one and the same. This suggests that it is not realistic to draw any fine distinction between the arbitration agreement found in the SPA and the SPA itself. In my view, this submission only serves to highlight the inherent difficulty in mounting an argument that the parties intended to enter into an arbitration agreement independent of and <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my judgment, the arbitration agreement here was clearly intended to be part of the SPA. It was at all times negotiated as part of the SPA. The question which I will address below is whether the parties agreed to be bound by the arbitration clause first, with agreement on the rest of the terms of the SPA to follow later when it was executed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Therefore, as a starting point, the presumption is that New York law governs the arbitration agreement. The plaintiff relied on two factors which, it claimed, pointed away from this. The first factor is the choice of Singapore as the seat. That would not be sufficient on its own to displace the presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The second factor is this: the plaintiff submitted that New York law provides for the doctrine of equitable estoppel, which would allow a non-party to rely on the arbitration agreement. This would contradict Article 9.11 of the Draft SPA which states expressly that the SPA was “not intended to benefit any third party or be enforceable by any third party”.

</div>
</div> This, in the plaintiff’s submission, meant that the presumption in favour of New York law was rebutted, with the result that the governing law of the arbitration agreement would be the system of law with which it had the closest connection. That would be Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I reject this argument for at least two reasons. First and more importantly, I think the governing law of the main contract should only be displaced if the consequences of choosing it as the governing law of the arbitration agreement would <span class="font-italic">negate</span> the arbitration agreement even though the parties have themselves evinced a clear intention to be bound to arbitrate their disputes. That was precisely what happened in <span class="font-italic">Sulaméric</span><span class="font-italic">a</span>: if Brazilian law were the proper law of the arbitration agreement, one party would not be bound to arbitrate unless it wished to. This would have completely undermined the clear intention evinced in the arbitration agreement that both parties would be bound to settle their disputes by arbitration. Only in such a situation would the consequences of using the governing law of the main contract as the proper law of the arbitration agreement be a decisive factor in displacing it in favour of the law of the seat of the arbitration. That is not the case here: the potential inconsistency of New York law under the SPA is not of a character that fundamentally undercuts the entire arbitration agreement altogether. That is not to say that the effect on the arbitration agreement of being governed by the law of the main contract will never be relevant. Anything which suggests the parties may not have intended to have their arbitration agreement governed by the same law as the main contract would still be a factor to consider.         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Second, although the plaintiff submitted that the availability of equitable estoppel under New York law would be inconsistent with Article 9.11, it could well be that Article 9.11 was included to exclude reliance on equitable estoppel in the first place. That was the effect of the Arbitrator’s finding. Equitable estoppel was invoked by Y, a non-party, to commence arbitration proceedings against the plaintiff. Notwithstanding the fact that the Arbitrator held that New York law was applicable and that, in principle, New York law permitted a non-signatory like Y to invoke arbitration proceedings against the plaintiff, he nevertheless found, on the facts, that Y was not a party to the arbitration. He relied on <span class="font-italic">Norcast</span><span class="font-italic"> S.AR.L. v Castle Harlan, Inc</span>, No 12 Civ 4973 (PAC) (SDNY 2014), the facts of which are very similar to the present case, in holding that Article 9.11 of the SPA would disentitle Y from relying on the doctrine to advance claims in the arbitration against the plaintiff. In other words, the very Article which the plaintiff is relying on to highlight the inconsistency between the laws of New York and Singapore was found, by the Arbitrator, to disentitle Y from pursuing the arbitration against the plaintiff. There is no challenge by any party on this ruling and hence for all practical purposes, the difference between New York law and Singapore law, if any, on this issue, is moot. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the circumstances, I conclude, as did the Arbitrator, that New York law, as the express choice of law governing the SPA, is also the governing law of the arbitration agreement.

</div> However, as I have explained above, the doctrine of separability is only relevant where an arbitration agreement forms part of a main contract – the doctrine prevents a party from impugning the arbitration agreement simply by alleging that the main agreement was invalid. In this case, Mr Jeremiah’s case is that the arbitration agreement was concluded before the conclusion of the SPA. There is no need to invoke the doctrine of separability. The court’s task, in deciding whether the Arbitrator had the jurisdiction to hear the dispute, is to consider the usual requirements for the formation of a contract under the applicable law. This was the way both parties agreed to address the jurisdictional issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Usually, where the arbitration agreement is intended to be part of an underlying contract, the validity and existence of the arbitration agreement and the underlying contract are resolved together.

For example, parties not infrequently exchange drafts of proposed contracts, including comments on both draft arbitration provisions and draft commercial terms; sometimes, parties reach agreement on the terms of an arbitration clause before doing so on commercial terms. If no agreement is ever reached on the commercial terms of the underlying contract, it is sometimes argued that the exchange of identical drafts of an arbitration clause, whose terms both parties accept, evidences an agreement on the arbitration provision (notwithstanding the lack of agreement on the underlying contract).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although dependent on the facts of individual cases, arguments of this sort are generally difficult to sustain. <span class="font-italic">The parties’ agreement on the terms of an arbitration clause does not typically amount to a mutual intention to be legally bound by that provision, absent conclusion of the underlying contract. Rather, such exchanges typically indicate agreement on the text of an arbitration clause, but an intention to be legally bound by that arbitration provision when, but only when, the underlying contract is also concluded</span>. That conclusion is often reinforced by inclusion of caveats on negotiating materials indicating that the drafts are “subject to contract,” “without prejudice,” or otherwise conditional upon final agreement and formal execution of the contracts in question.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Mr Jeremiah emphasised that, in this extract, the author accepted that it was at least conceivable that parties could negotiate and agree upon the terms of the arbitration clause without agreeing upon the terms of the underlying contract. He accepted, however, that the learned author did in a footnote cite two cases where arguments of this sort were made, but rejected. In both these cases a party who had commenced court proceedings successfully resisted a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration by showing that it was not bound by any arbitration agreement. In <span class="font-italic">Barnmore</span><span class="font-italic"> Demolition and Civil Engineering Ltd v Alandale Logistics Ltd and others</span> [2010] IEHC 544, the Irish High Court found that an arbitration clause in an “unexecuted draft contract” was not a binding arbitration agreement (at [10]). In <span class="font-italic">APC Logistics Pty Ltd v CJ </span><span class="font-italic">Nutracon Pty Ltd</span> [2007] FCA 136, the Federal Court of Australia (Queensland) found that despite an exchange of correspondence on a draft arbitration agreement, there was nothing “amounting to a confirmation or acceptance by the parties that they were in agreement on all terms and [considered] themselves to be bound to perform it”; it was also apparent from the correspondence that the parties envisaged a signed written agreement, which was not executed (at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Mr Jeremiah also drew my attention to an observation of Lord Hoffman in <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corporation and</span><span class="font-italic"> others v Privalov and others </span>[2007] 2 All ER (Comm) 1053. Lord Hoffman explained that, as a consequence of the doctrine of separability, an allegation that the main contract was not concluded does not impinge on the validity of the arbitration agreement that has already been agreed. He said, at [18]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Even if the allegation is that there was no concluded agreement (for example, that terms of the main agreement remained to be agreed) that is not necessarily an attack on the arbitration agreement. If the arbitration clause has been agreed, the parties will be presumed to have intended the question of whether there was a concluded main agreement to be decided by arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The challenge to the arbitration clause in that case took the form of a challenge to the validity of the main contract on the ground that it had been procured by bribery. Given that the arbitration clause was not impugned on the basis that the main contract was not concluded, this observation takes us no further than the question of what it means for an arbitration clause to be “agreed” – whether that means agreement to the wording of the clause, or agreement to be bound by it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The underlying principle, as I have found, is that agreeing to the wording of the arbitration clause does not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> equate to an intention to be contractually bound to arbitrate absent the conclusion of the contract under which the arbitration clause was negotiated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In any case, there is no objective evidence of the parties’ mutual intention to be bound by the arbitration clause.

</div> since the SPA was a tripartite agreement, the plaintiff could not have indicated its willingness to be bound by an arbitration clause with the defendant without W’s acceptance or assent. There is no evidence that W gave any such assent as at 18 July 2013. In fact, the objective evidence before me is to the contrary. As noted at [19] above, W’s reply to the 18 July email was that it was still “finalising the draft”. Even after W indicated that it was reviewing the draft, the plaintiff’s investment specialist sent W an email on 21 July 2013 asking for an update on the progress in their review of the SPA.

</div> In the alternative, it argues that even if the 30 April Letter made the arbitration clause “subject to contract” as well, that was no longer the case once the Offer Letter had lapsed on 31 May 2013.

The defendant is right that the offer in the 30 April Letter was only open until a certain time after which it was deemed to be automatically revoked.

I agree with the plaintiff that it is not unusual for an arbitration clause which is part of a contract to refer disputes concerning the existence of that main contract to arbitration.

</div> That is a consequence of its separability – its existence is not tied up with that of the main contract. It is for this same reason that both the Arbitrator and the plaintiff proposed that the jurisdiction phase should also deal with the issue whether and when the SPA was concluded. This was however rejected by the defendant. Even if the inclusion of the said words had been deliberate, it would not compel the conclusion that the arbitration clause was, in itself, a binding agreement. The inclusion of the words clarifies the scope of the arbitration agreement but does not go any way towards answering the question of whether it was meant to be contractually binding <span class="font-italic">absent</span> the conclusion of the SPA.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For these reasons, I find that, applying New York law as the governing law of the arbitration agreement, there was no binding arbitration agreement formed on 18 July 2013 <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the unexecuted SPA.
