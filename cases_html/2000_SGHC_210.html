<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Gounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. Registrar’s Appeal No 600224 of

2000 ("RA 600224/2000") is an appeal against the decision of an assistant

registrar dismissing the plaintiffs’ application for extension of time to file and

serve the reference to registrar for assessment of damages ("reference"). I

allowed the appeal on 11 July 2000. Registrar’s Appeal No 600197 of 2000 ("RA

600197/2000") is an appeal against the decision of another assistant registrar

ordering that the reference filed on 13 April 2000 be struck out and/or removed from the

court file and that the letter of guarantee dated 31 January 1992 issued by Mitsui Marine

&amp; Fire Insurance Co Ltd and the letter of undertaking dated 19 August 1995 issued by

Britannia Steamship Insurance Association Ltd be returned to the defendants’

solicitors. I heard this appeal immediately after RA 600224/2000 and allowed it. The

defendants have given notice of appeal in respect of both appeals and these are my written

grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. In this action commenced by writ issued

on 29 January 1992 the plaintiffs claim damages arising out of a collision between the

defendants’ vessel "Bonito" and the plaintiffs’ vessel "Ah Lam

II". On 12 September 1996 the defendants served on the plaintiffs an offer to settle

the plaintiffs’ claim fully and finally. On 27 November 1996 they confirmed that they

had no claim against the plaintiffs and on 4 December 1996 the plaintiffs gave notice of

acceptance of the offer. Under the terms of settlement the defendants would pay the

plaintiffs 50% of the plaintiffs’ claim in this action as proved or agreed together

with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from 28 January 1992 to the date of the

offer and unless the quantum of damages claimed was agreed there was to be a reference to

the registrar to assess damages.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. On 27 March 1997 there was a pre-trial

conference but no agreement had yet been reached by then. Counsel for the defendants

informed the court that liability had been settled and that the parties were likely to

agree on quantum once the documents were completed and counsel for the plaintiffs said

that prospects of settlement were good. Nevertheless it was ordered that the plaintiffs

file a notice of discontinuance by 12 July 1997 failing which they were to file a notice

of appointment for damages to be assessed by 19 July 1997 failing which the action was to

stand dismissed with costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. On 4 July 1997 the plaintiffs’

solicitors delivered to the defendants’ solicitors a statement containing a claim

under 32 heads of claim supported by 75 documents in 30 annexes or bundles. This was done

no doubt with a view to reaching agreement on quantum but not having heard further from

the defendants’ solicitors the plaintiffs applied for extension of time fixed by the

order of 27 March 1997. At the hearing on 18 July 1997 counsel for the defendants said the

documents were only received on 4 July 1997 and that the parties were actively working on

a settlement. An order was made extending to 30 August 1997 the time to file the notice of

appointment for damages to be assessed. The notice of appointment was the reference and to

avoid confusion I shall refer to it as the reference.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. On the same day that the order was made

extending time the defendants’ solicitors requested further information and documents

in respect of the plaintiffs’ claim. On 28 July 1997 the plaintiffs filed an

application to further extend time but the application was only fixed for hearing on 3

September 1997. Meanwhile on 19 August 1997 the plaintiffs’ solicitors provided

further information in respect of part of the claim and they also filed and served on the

defendants a list of documents and an affidavit verifying the list. On 27 August 1997 they

complied with the defendants’ request for further information and documents and also

provided further claim documents. The list of documents and the affidavit verifying the

list were presumably filed and served with a view to proceeding with the reference and in

anticipation of directions being given.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. When the plaintiffs’ application

came on for hearing on 3 September 1997 it was not opposed by the defendants and an order

was made extending the time to 30 November 1997 for the reference to be filed. On 9

September 1997 less than a week after time had been extended the defendants’

solicitors again requested further information and documents in respect of part of the

claim. Presumably the request was made with a view to "working on a settlement".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. There was no response to the

defendants’ last request for further information and documents and about one and a

half years later on 11 March 1999 the defendants’ solicitors informed the

plaintiffs’ solicitors that the action had been dismissed. They referred to the

orders of 27 March 1997, 18 July 1997 and 3 September 1997. The plaintiffs’

solicitors did not agree and there was an exchange of correspondence as to the effect of

the several orders made. Subsequently the plaintiffs changed solicitors but in reality

there was no change as it was a case of the solicitor personally having the conduct of the

matter retiring from one firm and being admitted to another and continuing to have

personal conduct of the matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. On 20 March 2000 the plaintiffs’

solicitors submitted a revised breakdown of the claim and the supporting documents and

requested the defendants’ response within 14 days. On 22 March 2000 the

defendants’ solicitors repeated their assertion that the action had been dismissed

and on 17 May 2000 the plaintiffs filed an application for further extension of time to

file and serve the reference. On 9 June 2000 the application was dismissed and the

plaintiffs now appeal to this court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. The plaintiffs’ case is that the

action had not been dismissed for failure to comply with an "unless order". Mr

Chua referred to the order of 27 March 1997 and the subsequent orders of 18 July 1997 and

3 September 1997. He said that while the first order was expressed as an "unless

order" the second and third orders were not. They merely extended time without any

default provision. He referred to <i>Hitachi Sales (UK) Ltd v Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd</i>

[1986] 2 Ll LR 574. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. In <i>Hitachi Sales</i> the order made

was in these terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Unless the Defendants do serve

  within 14 days the Further and Better Particulars of the Points of Defence … the

  Points of Defence be struck out, and the Plaintiffs be at liberty to enter judgment

  against the Defendants for damages to be assessed ...."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The order was made on 13 May 1985, drawn

up and date-stamped 16 May 1985 and served a few days later. The further and better

particulars were not served and on 29 May 1985 judgment was signed in default. O 42 r 2(1)

of the Rules of the Supreme Court then in force provided:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… a judgment or order which

  requires a person to do an act must specify the time after service of the judgment or

  order, or some other time, within which the act is to be done."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">O’Connor LJ said at p 579:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… the basis must be that the

  party against whom [the order] is made knows of its existence, the order must be

  unambiguous and specify the time limit from a starting time."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The order dated 16 May 1985 did not

specify a starting time for the 14 days and it was held that it did not comply with the

requirement and the defendants were entitled to an order setting aside the judgment <i>ex

debito justitiae</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. <i>Hitachi Sales</i> was not concerned

with a subsequent order extending time after an "unless order" that complied

with O 42 r 2(1) (in pari materia with the local O 42 r 6(1) ) had been made and it does

not directly assist the plaintiffs. I wholly accept though that an order to which O 42 r

6(1) applies must be unambiguous and it must be unambiguous not only in terms of the time

within which the act required to be done must be done but also in terms of the consequence

of any failure to do the act within the time fixed. The consequence contended for by the

defendants is the most serious and far reaching. The action is to stand dismissed even

though an offer to settle has been accepted.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. The order of 27 March 1997 was not

drawn up and entered. It ought to have been. See O 42 r 9(1). It was an "unless

order" and r 9(2) does not apply to such an order. See <i>Hitachi Sales </i>at p 576.

The assistant registrar’s minute of the order states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Plaintiffs to file and serve Notice

  of Discontinuance by 12 July 97, failing which Plaintiffs to file Notice of Appointment

  for Damages to be assessed by 19 July 97, failing which action stands dismissed with

  costs."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">As noted above counsel for the defendants

had said that the parties had agreed on liability and were likely to agree on damages and

counsel for the plaintiffs had said that prospects of settlement were good. The plaintiffs

were not in default. Under the terms of settlement a reference to the registrar to assess

damages would only arise if and when damages could not be agreed and that event had not

occurred yet. I think an "unless order" ought not to have been made at that

stage but it was made and it would be too late now to take exception to it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. The application that led to the order

of 18 July 1997 was for an order that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The time for the Plaintiffs to file

  and serve the Notice of appointment for assessment of damages be extended to 19 October

  1997." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The grounds of the application as stated

in the notice included this statement:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The parties have reached agreement

  on the apportionment of liability and are now actively engaged in negotiating the issue of

  quantum of their respective claims.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A short deferment of the date of filing

  the Notice of Appointment for Assessment of Damages would not only give the parties a

  better chance in coming to an amicable settlement but also avoid incurring further cost in

  subjecting the issue of the quantum of their respective claims before the Court for

  assessment."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">According to the assistant

registrar’s note of the proceedings counsel for the defendants said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"No objections ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Parties are actively working to

  settle."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The minute of the order made states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"OIT.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Extension granted and limited to a period

  of 6 weeks from 19 July 97." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Time was extended to 30 August 1997. This

order was not drawn up.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. O 42 r 9(2) provides:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"An order –</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) which –</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) extends the period within which a

      person is required or authorised by these Rules, or by any judgment, order or direction,

      to do any act; … and </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) which neither imposes any special

    terms nor includes any special directions other than a direction as to costs,</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">need not be drawn up unless the Court

  otherwise directs."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">This rule applies to the order of 18 July

1997 and there was no direction that it should be drawn up. There were no special terms or

special directions. It was quite properly not drawn up. This rule does not apply to an

"unless order" which imposes special terms.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. The application that led to the order

of 3 September 1997 was for an order to extend time to 30 November 1997 and the grounds

stated on the application included this statement:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The parties have been exchanging

  correspondence and are in the process of negotiating a settlement of the Plaintiffs’

  claim on documents provided by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants. The Plaintiffs are

  requesting for a short deferment of the date to file and serve the Reference to the

  Registrar for Assessment of Damages in order to give them an opportunity to fully address

  the various queries raised by the Defendants on the Plaintiffs’ earlier forwarded

  claim documents." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">As earlier noted the application was not

opposed by the defendants and the assistant registrar’s minute of the order only

recorded that an order in terms of the application was made. Again in accordance with O 42

r 9(2) this order was not drawn up. There were no special terms or special directions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. Having regard to the terms of the

orders made and the circumstances surrounding the making of the orders and the grounds of

the applications for extension of time it must be at least doubtful whether the order of 3

September 1997 extending time to 30 November 1997 read with the orders of 27 March 1997

and 18 July 1997 was an "unless order". I do not think that it was. I also do

not think that the "unless order" of 27 March 1997 can be read as if the date 30

November 1997 was substituted for the original date 19 July 1997. When the plaintiffs

applied on 9 June 2000 for a further extension of time the action had not been dismissed

pursuant to the order of 27 March 1997 or to any other order and the application ought to

have been heard on its merits. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. Mr Chua submitted that the application

for further extension of time ought to be allowed in view of the absence of prejudice

suffered by the defendants as a result of the delay. He referred to <i>The Tokai Maru </i><nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 105</nobr> where Tan Lee Meng J (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) said at

para 37:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The power to strike out an action

  for abuse of process is thus to be exercised only in cases of an exceptional nature. We

  are of the view that the delay in the instant case cannot be characterised as an abuse of

  process, as was contended by the respondents."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He also referred to <i>Costellow v

Somerset County Council </i>[1993] 1 All ER 952<i>.</i></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. In <i>The Tokai Maru</i> the

defendants (respondents in the appeal) and the third parties (appellants) were ordered to

file and exchange their affidavits for the purpose of the trial by 11 October 1996. The

appellants defaulted. They filed their affidavit and purportedly served it on the

respondents only several months later on 1 July 1997. The respondents refused to serve

their affidavits in exchange. The appellants applied for extension of time for filing and

exchanging affidavits. The respondents applied to strike out the appellants’ defence

in the third party proceedings. The learned judge in the High Court dismissed the

appellant’s application and allowed the respondents’ application. He struck out

the defence and made the usual orders for judgment and costs. In the Court of Appeal Tan

Lee Meng J said at para 21 that the principles applicable to the case were to be found in <i>Costellow</i>.

Continuing at para 23 he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… these principles are as

  follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) The rules of civil procedure guide the

  courts and litigants towards the just resolution of the case and should of course be

  adhered to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not be deprived of his opportunity to dispute

  the plaintiff’s claims and have a determination of the issues on the merits as a

  punishment for a breach of these rules unless the other party has been made to suffer

  prejudice which cannot be compensated for by an appropriate order as to costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Save in special cases or exceptional

  circumstances, it can rarely be appropriate then, on an overall assessment of what justice

  requires, to deny a defendant an extension of time where the denial would have the effect

  of depriving him of his defence because of a procedural default which, even if

  unjustified, has caused the plaintiff no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by

  an award of costs."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">I think that with appropriate changes

involving the substitution of "plaintiff" for "defendant" these

principles apply to the case before me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. If the plaintiffs are denied an

extension of time they will be deprived of their right to a reference to the registrar to

assess damages. An offer to settle fully and finally as regards liability has been made by

the defendants in accordance with the rules and the offer has been accepted and it would

be quite extraordinary that the defendants should have been bound to pay but will not have

to pay anything because the amount cannot be ascertained.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. The substantial part of the

plaintiffs’ claim is for loss of hire and the market value of the tug. Mr Seah said

that it would be more difficult to obtain the evidence now than if the orders had been

complied with. I am unable to agree. The evidence is not in relation to events as to which

specific witnesses would have to be called and their memory is likely to be affected by

passage of time. The evidence is in relation to rates of hire and the value of a tug

prevailing at the material time and I should have thought that a surveyor or any competent

person would be in no worse position to testify as to these matters if the assessment of

damages is proceeded with now rather than in November 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. Since July 1997 the plaintiffs have

been providing the defendants with information and documents relating to their claim. It

has not been suggested that the information or documents were inadequate although the

defendants have called for further information and documents and they did that each time

after time had been extended to file the reference. They were "actively working to

settle". I think they would have obtained or "worked at" obtaining the

necessary evidence and if they had not done so then they cannot be heard to complain that

they had lost the opportunity to do so or been otherwise prejudiced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. The defendants are the owners of the

"Bonito". They have provided an undertaking given by a P &amp; I club in

addition to a guarantee given by an insurer. These parties are I think the

"real" defendants. They are not unaccustomed to having to dispute claims before

the courts and before other tribunals. They were prepared to make some payment and only

desired to have the amount agreed or assessed by the court failing agreement. I asked Mr

Seah and he was unable to say that the delay was in some other way prejudicial to the

defendants or the "real defendants" than only as regards evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. Having regard to all the circumstances

I am satisfied that an extension of time as asked for by the plaintiffs will not cause any

prejudice to the defendants for which they cannot be compensated by an award of costs. An

extension of time in favour of one party in a sense causes an injustice to the other just

as the refusal to grant an extension of time causes an injustice to the party out of time

but here I think the balance of justice favours the making of an order to extend time. It

remains to consider whether this is a special case or if there are any exceptional

circumstances to refuse the extension of time asked for.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. Under the terms of settlement there

would only be a reference to the registrar to assess damages if the parties cannot reach

an agreement. The plaintiffs submitted a claim under 32 heads and they provided

information and documents in support of the claim. They later revised the claim under 34

heads but otherwise the revision did not result in a departure from the original claim.

The defendants called for further information and documents. Quite clearly both parties

were engaged in negotiations to reach an agreement as to damages. The defendants

themselves said so.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. After the order was last made for

extension of time the defendants called for more information and documents. It has not

been suggested that without these they were unable to consider the plaintiffs’ claim

but the plaintiffs could have provided the further information and documents last asked

for or applied for more time to do so or they could have treated the negotiations as at an

end and proceeded with the assessment of damages if they could not provide the information

or documents. They could have taken one of these steps before 30 November 1997 to which

day time was last extended or some time after that. To do so more than two years later is

hardly justifiable but I do not think that this is so special a case or that the

circumstances are so exceptional that it can be right to deny the plaintiffs an extension

of time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. In my judgment the plaintiffs ought to

have been granted an extension of time. I accordingly allowed the appeal save as regards

costs and extended the time for filing the reference to expire immediately after 13 April

2000 which was the day the reference was in fact filed. I further ordered the plaintiffs

to issue a summons for directions for the further conduct of the assessment of damages

within two weeks of the order and made an order for costs which I considered appropriate

in the circumstances. Having regard to my decision in RA 600224/2000 the parties agreed

that it would follow that the appeal in RA 600197/2000 should also be allowed. I agree. I

allowed the appeal save as regards costs. The effect was to dismiss the defendants’

application for the reference filed on 13 April 2000 to be struck out and for the

guarantee and undertaking to be returned.</font></p>
