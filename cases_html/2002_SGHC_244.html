<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">          This was an

appeal from the decision of district judge Jasvender Kaur who convicted the appellant on a

charge of criminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) by threatening to

kill one Belen C De Vera, one Mercedes J Padillo and one Anelita S Domingo. The appellant

was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. She appealed against both her conviction

and sentence. I dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal against

sentence. I now set out my reasons.</p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Background facts</p></i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The appellant, one

Salvacion Dalayon Woon ("Woon"), is a Singapore citizen but a Filipino by birth.

She is 38 years old and worked as an assistant manager with Signature Employment Agency.

("the agency"). The complainants specified in the charge – Belen C De Vera

("Belen"), Mercedes J Padillo ("Mercedes") and Anelita S Domingo

("Anelita") are all Filipinos who had been recruited to work here as domestic

maids by the agency. A fourth complainant, one Marilyn Ventura Ober ("Marilyn")

was also initially specified in the charge but her name was subsequently deleted on

application by the prosecution.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        The four maids were

required to pay the agency a sum of S$2,010 each as fees for arranging their employment

here. This was to be paid in instalments via deductions from their monthly pay. At the

time of the offence, each of them was still owing money to the agency in differing

amounts.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Prosecution case</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        The relevant events

happened on 8 August 2001. On the afternoon of that day, all four maids were at the

agency, in the kitchen. Sometime in the late afternoon, a couple and their son went to the

agency. They sat together with Woon and one Ruth Marie Low Chew Lo Teck

("Ruth"). Subsequently, an argument broke out between the couple and Woon. All

four maids came out from the kitchen to peep at the quarrel and returned to the kitchen

after it ended. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        After the quarrel, Woon

went to the kitchen and asked them if they were still willing to work in Singapore. All

four remained silent. Woon then returned to her office and called the four maids in. They

complied. In the office also at that time were Ruth and another Filipino maid called

MaryLou.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        Woon scolded the four maids

for not answering her earlier and called both Anelita’s aunt and Marilyn’s agent

in the Philippines. Woon told Anelita’s aunt to prepare 70,000 pesos to pay the

agency if Anelita wished to return to Philippines. Anelita was then told to speak with her

aunt. Similarly, she told Marilyn’s agent to prepare money. Marilyn and Belen (who

had the same agent) were told to speak with the agent.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        Woon then told the four

maids that they would have to pay 70,000 pesos to return home, or she would hire someone

to kill them in the Philippines and pay him 20,000 pesos to do so. The four maids

testified that Woon was very angry when she uttered the threat. All three of the maids in

court testified that they were very frightened and worried by the threat. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        Subsequently, Woon and Ruth

left the agency. The maids were left to spend the night there. After discussions, they

decided to escape from the agency. They sawed through the padlock on the gate and took a

taxi to the Philippine embassy. It was shortly after midnight and the embassy was closed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        Anelita then contacted one

Jocelyn Bayduan ("Jocelyn"), a Filipino domestic maid working here, for help.

Jocelyn and her employer met the four maids and took them to a police station.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        Jocelyn testified under

cross-examination that Anelita had told her that the agency had threatened them when she

met the four maids. At the police station, Anelita then told her about the details of the

threat, that "<i>the agency had asked them to pay a big sum of money, failing which

the agency would hire someone to kill them.</i>" </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Appellant’s Defence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        Woon made a statement P3

on 11 August 2001 to the Investigating Officer one M Saravanan ("Saravanan"). In

subsequent investigations, Woon refused to sign her s 122(6) statement taken by Saravanan

on 8 January 2002.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        Ruth was also called as a

defence witness. Ruth gave a statement P4 to Saravanan on 22 August 2001. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        In court, Woon testified

that on 8 August 2001, MaryLou had informed both her and Ruth that the maids were planning

to escape. They had not taken this seriously. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        After the quarrel with the

couple, she had asked Ruth to call the four maids from the kitchen. This was to tell them

to prepare themselves as Woon wished to bring them home so as to take them to the zoo the

next day. The maids remained silent and she asked Ruth to tell them to return to the

kitchen.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        At around 6.30 pm, Woon

asked Ruth to call Marilyn to the office to talk to her agent. Woon called the agent on

the telephone and asked Marilyn to speak with him. Marilyn remained silent. After that, at

about 7.29 pm, the appellant again asked Marilyn to speak to her agent. Once more, Marilyn

remained silent. At this time, only Woon, Ruth, Marilyn and MaryLou were present.

According to Woon, she then turned behind to Ruth and said <i>"Na </i>(meaning Ruth)<i>,

if</i> <i>Marilyn behaviour like this in Philippines can be killed."</i> Woon further

claimed that she was crying at this time. Ruth comforted her and sent the two maids into

the kitchen. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        Ruth’s version of

events given in court was substantially similar to Woon’s. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        The prosecution applied to

impeach Woon and Ruth based on the inconsistent statements that they had given previously.

Both were given the opportunity to explain the inconsistencies.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        Woon claimed that she was

confused due to problems with her children at the time of the statements and also that she

did not say what had been recorded. Similarly, Ruth claimed that she had been confused at

the time of making the statement.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        The district judge

rejected their explanations and found that both had had their credit impeached. She then

allowed the two statements into evidence pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap

97). She accepted the maids’ evidence that Woon had threatened them, that all of them

had been in the presence of Woon when the threat was made, and also as to the details of

the threat. She found further support for this finding from the testimony of Jocelyn.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal against conviction</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        The grounds of appeal

consisted of challenges to the findings of fact made below. It is trite law that the

appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of a lower court unless they are

clearly reached against the weight of evidence – <i>Lim Ah Poh v PP </i>[1992] 1 SLR 704. An appellate court must not merely entertain doubts about whether the decision is

right but must be convinced that it is wrong: <i>PP v Azman bin Abdullah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46369&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 704</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        Woon contended that as the

findings of the lower court arose primarily from inferences made from the content of a

witnesses’ evidence here, the appellate court was in as good a position to review the

evidence and come to its own conclusions. Counsel cited my judgement in <i>PP v Choo Thiam

Hock</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8624&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 3 SLR 248</a> as support. In my opinion, this arose from a misunderstanding of

what I said in that case. In both <i>Choo</i> and <i>PP v Tubbs Julia Elizabeth</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62033&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 4 SLR 75</a>, I had emphasised that it would only be in exceptional cases where "<i>logic

clearly militates against findings of fact made by the trial judge</i>" that the

appellate court would review the findings of the lower court, even when the demeanour of

the witness was not in issue in the determination of his/her credibility. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        It should be clarified

that <i>Choo </i>does not lower the bar for appellate intervention. The significance of a

finding based primarily on evidence for the appellate court would only be that it is

better equipped to conclude that the judge below was plainly wrong. The principles

enunciated in <i>Lim Ah Poh</i> and like cases must still be applied and kept foremost in

the mind of the appellate court.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">23        The grounds of appeal

could be broadly dealt with under the following headings:</p>
</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">(1)    Whether the judge below had been mistaken in

    her reliance on the portions of the appellant’s (P3) and Ruth’s (P4) statements

    by taking them out of context</p></b><i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">
</font></i>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">24        The material portions of

P3 and P4 are as set out:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<u><p align="justify">P3</p></u><i>
<p align="justify">"5.    On 8 August 2001, I had called

    ‘Marilyn’ and ‘Anelita’. I told them that there</p></i> <i>had still owed

    their respective agents money for coming to Singapore. As such, it was difficult to have

    them send back. They insisted and I blew my top. <b>I told them that I would have someone

    kill them</b>. During this conversation, ‘Mercedes’ and ‘Belen’ were

    also around the office and I believe that they could have heard the threat. I wish to say

    that I have no intention of carrying out the threat." </i>[emphasis added]

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<u><p align="justify">P4</p></u><i>
<p align="justify">"4.    On 8 August 2001, I was in the office

    together with </p></i>[the appellant],<i> Anelita and Marilyn. </i>[Woon] <i>had allowed

    Marilyn and Anelita to talk on the phone. Thereafter Susan and the 2 maids engaged

    themselves in a conversation. During the conversation, </i>[Woon]<i> got angry, as both

    were indecisive of wanting to work in Singapore. <b>She told them that she would kill them</b>.

    I then advised them about their well-being and to work properly for the next employer.

    They were laughing and went back to the kitchen area. During our conversation, Mercedes

    and Belen were in the kitchen. I went home at about 8.00pm." </i>[emphasis added]

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">25        Woon contended that, in

relying on the highlighted portions to find that she had made the threat to <i>all four</i>

maids, the judge below had erred as the context of the statements set out was that the

appellant had made a threat <i>only</i> to Anelita and Marilyn</p></font><font color="#ff0000" face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">. </font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">Thus, the district judge took the portions out of

context in her reliance on them to find that the threat had been made to the four maids.

<p align="justify">26        In support, I was quoted

the guidelines laid down in <i>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47209&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 1 SLR 25</a> at 58-59 on

the factors to consider in determining the weight of a statement admitted under s 147(3)

of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Specifically, I was referred to the following part of my

judgement:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">Fourth,

    regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (6) does not restrict

    consideration to only the making of the statement but requires consideration of all the

    circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus, the court must consider the context of the

    inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined<b>.

    Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is taken out of context</b>.

    [emphasis added]</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">27        I found this challenge to

be misconceived. The judge below did not rely on the statements in finding that the

accused had made a threat to the maids; her reliance on them in this respect was limited

to the <i>tenor of the words</i> which the accused uttered. This was evident in 71 of

her Grounds of Decision:</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The material portion of the accused’s statement that she had

    threatened the maids by stating that she would hire someone to kill them <b>was consistent

    with the threat which the maids had testified was made.</b> [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">28        It was clear here that the

judge below was concerned with the <i>details</i> of what Woon had said, not whom she had

said it to. There was clearly nothing wrong in relying on the statements in this way.

While relying on the highlighted portions to show that a threat was made to all the maids

might have infringed the principle from <i>Kelvin Chai</i>, the same could not be said of

reliance on it merely as evidence of what was said by the accused at the relevant time.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2)    Whether the judge below erred in her selective

reliance on P3 and P4</p></b>
<p align="justify">29        Woon’s challenge here

was that the judge below had rejected portions of the statements inconsistent with the

prosecution case without giving good reasons in coming to her findings. Specifically, they

pointed to her findings that all four maids were called to the office and threatened, that

Woon, Anelita, Marilyn and Belen had used the telephone in the incident and that the maids

had all been alarmed by the threat.</p>
<p align="justify">30        I found these contentions

without merit. All the inconsistencies raised had been dealt with fully by the judge

below. It was only in respect of the last issue that she had failed to give consideration

to Ruth’s statement (P4) that the two maids were "<i>laughing and went back to

the kitchen area"</i> after the threat. In my opinion, the judge below should have

given her reasons for rejecting this, since it related to the important issue of the

effect the threat had on the maids. However, in view of her finding that:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">i four maids had been involved in the incident, rather than two as the

    statement claimed; as well as the fact that</p>
<p align="justify">ii there was strong evidence that the maids were scared by the threat

    such as the circumstances of their escape and the evidence given by both Jocelyn and the

    police officer on duty, to whom the maids had made their police report to the effect that

    the maids had looked scared and worried;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">I found her lack of reasons to be of little consequence.</p>
</font><b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(3)    Whether the judge below was correct in rejecting

the Woon’s explanation for her inconsistent statements</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31        Woon had tried to explain

her inconsistent statement by claiming that she was confused at the time of its making.

This was due to the fact that she suspected her maid of having sexually abused her

daughter and also that her son had been injured. Woon contended that the effect of an

apprehended sexual assault on her daughter should have been considered by the judge below.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32        In my view, the judge

below was correct in rejecting this explanation. First, Woon had not been consistent in

her explanations to the court. When she was first cross-examined on the inconsistencies,

she claimed that she was unable to recall if she had indeed said the things recorded in

the statement. On later cross-examination, she clarified that she was <i>only </i>confused

about 5 (reproduced above) and 9 (not relevant to the charge) of the statement.

However, on re-examination, the appellant was suddenly able to list out in detail what she

had told to Saravanan in <i>every paragraph</i>, especially with regards 5. This was

also where she alleged that the statement recorded was <i>not</i> what she said. The

miraculous recovery of her recollection flies plainly in the face of her alleged

"confused" state.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33        This was further

reinforced by Woon claiming to have said the last sentence of 5, that she did not intend

to carry out the threat, yet concurrently deny that she had said the other parts of 5.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34        Secondly, Woon’s

statement was materially similar in content to Ruth’s statement. Although Ruth was

also apparently "confused" when she made the statement, it was certainly not for

the same serious reasons as Woon. As appropriately put by the judge below at 66 of her

Grounds of Decision, it was "…<i>incredible that </i>(Woon and Ruth)<i> were

confused and ended up making the same mistake." </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35        Finally, evidence given by

the defence showed that Woon had taken her daughter to a doctor on 5 August 2001, and the

results of the doctor’s examination had been that there was no evidence of sexual

abuse. In view of all the above, the judge below was clearly right to reject Woon’s

explanation.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(4)    Whether the judge below erred in accepting the

testimonies of the maids given the numerous discrepancies in their evidence</p></b><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">36        The appellant alleges that

the trial judge erred in accepting the evidence of the maids, given the numerous

discrepancies in their testimonies in court about the events of that day and in relation

to each other. These related to, <i>inter alia</i>, whether they all stayed in the agency

on 7 August 2001, the fact that they could not recall the argument between the appellant

and the couple and their conflicting testimonies as to who used the telephone at the time

of the offence.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37        After carefully

considering all the evidence, I was of the opinion that there was nothing wrong with the

findings of the judge below. In <i>Ng Kwee Leong v PP </i>[1998] 2 SLR 942, the court

stated clearly that immaterial discrepancies would not detract from the veracity of

witnesses on material issues. As the Chief Justice held in that case, </p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Adequate allowance must be given to human fallibility in the precise

    assessment of short spans of time.</p></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In addition, the maids’ accounts were corroborated to some extent

by the testimony of Jocelyn. </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">38        One point, however, stood

out. Counsel for Woon contended that the possibility of collusion by the maids should have

been considered by the judge below since their testimonies coincided on many material

aspects. While it is true that a trial judge should always be alive to the possibility of

prepared testimonies by witnesses, it is surely plausible that testimonies coincide

because the facts described within are true.</p>
<p align="justify">39        Numerous other grounds of

appeal were raised, but I found of them to be of little or no merit. Accordingly, I found

no reason to disturb the district judge’s findings and dismissed the appeal against

conviction. </p>
</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal against sentence</p></b></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">40        The offence of which Woon

had been convicted fell under the second limb of s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for

being a threat to cause death. The maximum punishment is a term of imprisonment up to

seven years or a fine or both. She had been sentenced to six month’s imprisonment,

which was the normal tariff for an offence of this nature. </p>
<p align="justify">41        Taking into account the

circumstances of the current case, I was of the view that the sentence meted out by the

judge below was manifestly excessive.</p>
<p align="justify">42        It bears remembering that

while an objective view is taken of the words uttered and their effect, for the purposes

of determining whether an offence under s 506 was made out and which limb it fell to be

punished under, the considerations for the court in passing sentence are very different.</p>
<p align="justify">43        In determining the

appropriate sentence to be passed in offences of this nature, the court has to consider

carefully the events and circumstances surrounding its commission. The question to be

determined is always this: to what extent can there be said to have been a serious threat

made? In determining this, both the intention of the maker of the threat as well as the

fear that the victim was put in<i> </i>due to the threat<i> </i>are of great relevance:

see <i>Lee Yoke Choong v PP </i>[1964] 1 MLJ 1964, <i>PP v Luan Yuanxin</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=63030&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 2 SLR 98</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">44        In the present case, I did

not think that there was any question that the threat was neither seriously intended to be

a threat to life, nor understood as such by the victims. First, it was undisputed that

Woon was extremely angry when she uttered the threat. Secondly, the threat took place in

the presence of two other people – Ruth and MaryLou. Thirdly, the victims were put in

no immediate fear for their lives. No weapons were used; neither did the context of the

threat itself lead to an apprehension<i> </i>of <i>immediate </i>hurt. </p>
<p align="justify">45        The trial judge had

herself found that "<i>there can be no doubt that the accused never intended to carry

out the threat.</i>" The actual effect of the threat of death on the victims was also

not severe. While they were frightened enough to escape, all of them testified that they

had wanted to return to the Philippines after the threat was made despite their fear. </p>
<p align="justify">46        In addition, none of them

were harmed. Woon had left them alone in the agency after the incident and, according to

the maids’ evidence, had even offered to take one of them to the zoo with her the

following day. The threat was also not prolonged; the maids were sent to the kitchen

immediately after Woon uttered the threat.</p>
<p align="justify">47        A perusal of past cases

shows that the present situation is distinguishable. In <i>Ramanathan Yogendran v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9318&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 SLR 563</a>, the accused solicitor had uttered the threat to kill over the telephone

after a quarrel with the victim the previous day. In reducing the sentence from a

year’s imprisonment to six months, I stated that "<i>a <b>threat to kill someone

which is made in all seriousness</b> is not something to be taken lightly" </i>[emphasis

added]. I found the present case, where the threat was uttered in anger and very obviously

on impulse, to be of even lesser gravity than in <i>Ramanathan</i>, where the phone call

was clearly pre-meditated.</p>
<p align="justify">48        In <i>PP v N</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49622&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 619</a>, where the accused had also threatened to kill his wife via telephone, a sentence

of one years’ imprisonment was imposed. There were many aggravating factors in this

case, not least the fact that it was in the context of a violent domestic relationship

where there was every likelihood of the threat being carried out, as well as the fact that

three other charges had been taken into consideration for sentencing. This was not the

situation here. It was the evidence of the maids that they had been well-treated by Woon

prior to the incident. </p>
<p align="justify">49        The other cases cited by

the DPP in support of the sentence passed were also distinguishable as they concerned

threats made using weapons, which were clearly aggravated. </p>
<p align="justify">50        The context of the threat

in the circumstances of the present case was unique. Woon was not a mafia boss or criminal

mastermind, she was only a manager in a maid agency. While it is undoubted that the maids

were put in fear by her threat to hire a killer, the amount of fear thus induced could not

have been as great as in the cases previously discussed. </p>
<p align="justify">51        I was also of the opinion

that part of their fear stemmed from the demand for payment Woon had made of them. This is

shown by the excerpt below from Mercedes’ testimony:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<i><p align="justify">"Q:    What was discussed?</p>
<p align="justify">A:    We did plan to escape <b>because of the money the

    Accused is asking us to pay</b> and the threat of killing us." </p></i>[emphasis added]

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In similar vein, Anelita also stated in her Examination in Chief:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><i><p align="justify">"Q.

        Why did you not stay at 329 Changi Road. Why did you have to get out?</p>
<p align="justify">A.    The reason why we did not stay and thought of

    escaping was<b> because we were told to pay the 70,000 pesos and we were so scared </b>and

    that is why we did not stay and because of the threat to us." </p></i>[emphasis added]</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52        Counsel for Woon argued

strenuously that the present case did not merit a custodial sentence. I disagreed. Threats

to cause death, no matter how casually said, are a serious matter and are so regarded by

the court. Offences under the second limb of s 506 are invariably punished with custodial

sentences because of the seriousness of these offences.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53        However, having taken the

factors discussed above into account, I was of the view that a sentence of three months

imprisonment would be more appropriate in this case. I therefore allowed the appeal

against sentence and varied it accordingly.</p>
