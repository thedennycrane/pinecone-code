<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this suit, the plaintiff, Cavenagh Investment
                    Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”), claims against the defendant, Dr Rajiv
                    Kaushik (“Dr Kaushik”), damages for trespass to land. These claims
                    include a sum amounting to $352,704, being what the Plaintiff says is the market
                    rent of the property for the period of 1 December 2008 to 6 October 2011 while
                    Dr Kaushik was alleged to have wrongfully occupied and trespassed on the
                    property, as well as a sum amounting to $12,000 for what it says is the cost of
                    reinstatement for damage to the property. On the second day of the trial before
                    me, counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Ernest Balasubramaniam (“Mr
                    Balasubramaniam”) said that it was no longer pursuing the second
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At issue before me is therefore, whether Dr
                    Kaushik had committed the tort of trespass to land, and, if so, whether and to
                    what extent he is liable to pay the Plaintiff damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The background to the present dispute is fairly
                    uncomplicated in so far as the undisputed facts are concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The characters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The main subject matter of the present suit, 132
                    Tanjong Rhu, #15-10, Pebble Bay, Singapore 436919 (“the Property”)
                    is owned by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff describes itself as an
                    “investment company” and is one of several companies which
                    together form what is loosely known as the Lee Tat group of companies. The
                    Plaintiff, like most of the other companies in the Lee Tat group, has as its
                    sole shareholder and director, Madam Ching Mun Fong (“Madam
                    Ching”). Also like most of the other companies, it has no employees. The
                    Plaintiff’s only assets are the Property and another unit also at the same
                    Pebble Bay condominium development (“Pebble Bay”). The properties
                    of the Plaintiff and the other property-holding companies in the Lee Tat group
                    are managed by Lee Tat Property Management Pte Ltd (“Lee Tat
                    Property”), a company run by Madam Ching and several
                employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Dr Kaushik is a New Zealand citizen and was at
                    the material time the President and a director of a company known as
                        I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net Pte Ltd
                        (“I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net”). Pursuant to the terms
                    of his employment with the company, I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net provided
                    him and his family with accommodation in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Another important character to background of the
                    present suit is a man known as Mohamed Razali bin Chichik
                    (“Razali”) who was an employee of Lee Tat Property at the material
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dr Kaushik’s occupation of the Property</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The circumstances leading to Dr Kaushik’s occupation of the
                Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In or around September 2008, Dr Kaushik and his
                    wife came across an advertisement in the Straits Times newspaper seeking
                    prospective tenants for the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> As Dr
                    Kaushik and his family were already staying in Pebble Bay under a lease in a
                    different unit with another landlord, the advertisement piqued his
                        interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> When he called the number listed on the
                    advertisement, Razali answered and proceeded to invite Dr Kaushik and his wife
                    to view the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Dr Kaushik’s wife
                    attended the first viewing. At the second viewing, Dr Kaushik went with his
                    wife. Dr Kaushik noticed that Razali had all the keys and access cards to the
                    Property, and he seemed to be known to all the security guards at Pebble
                        Bay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Some deliberation and negotiations with Razali
                    over the rent and rectifications to the fittings in the Property (which Razali
                    took care of) then took place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    As to these rectifications which involved changing the curtains and doors of the
                    Property, as well as repainting and cleaning, Dr Kaushik testified that Razali
                    tended to them satisfactorily.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Dr Kaushik
                    then informed Razali that his employer I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net
                    wanted to rent the Property for his family’s accommodation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    On 23 October 2008, I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net received a letter of
                    intent bearing a letter head which read “Cavenagh Investment Pte
                    Ltd” and which was signed by Razali.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Dr Kaushik
                    signed this letter on behalf of I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net. Razali
                    asked for payment of the monthly rental to him. Finding this unusual, Dr Kaushik
                    insisted on a letter of authority from the Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> On 31
                    October 2008, Razali produced a signed letter bearing the letter head of the
                    Plaintiff stating that Razali was authorised to receive the monthly
                        rental.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Subsequently on 3 November 2008, Dr
                    Kaushik asked his staff at I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net to do due
                    diligence, and found that the Property was owned by the Plaintiff, and that its
                    sole director and shareholder was Madam Ching.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> As a
                    result, Dr Kaushik requested Razali to obtain the signature of Madam Ching on
                    the tenancy agreement (“the Tenancy Agreement”) before
                        I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net would finalise the lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    On 1 December 2008, Razali attended at
                    I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net’s office with a copy of the Tenancy
                    Agreement bearing a stamp which read “Cavenagh Investment Pte
                    Ltd”. It was purportedly signed by Madam Ching.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    The signature on this Tenancy Agreement was the same as the one on the letter
                    authorising Razali to receive payment. The Tenancy Agreement was signed on
                    behalf of I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net by its accounts executive,
                    Eileen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net paid a
                    contractual deposit of $18,000 to Razali, and Dr Kaushik and his family moved
                    into the Property after the purported lease commenced on 1 December
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The lease extension</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In or around September 2010, when the first
                    term of the purported Tenancy Agreement was ending, Dr Kaushik indicated to
                    Razali that I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net wanted to extend the
                        lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Razali replied with a letter, again
                    bearing the letter head of the Plaintiff, extending the lease by 2 years from 1
                    December 2010 to 30 November 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     For the entire period from December 2008 to
                    March 2011, I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net paid the monthly rent of $9,000
                    to Razali. The total sum paid amounted to $270,000 ($252,000 being rent for 28
                    months and $18,000 being the 2 months’ security deposit).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Razali’s fraud unravels</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 8 March 2011, two employees of Lee Tat
                    Property, one Lim Mui Wah (“Annie”) and another known only as
                    Lynn, appeared at the Property and were surprised to find it
                        occupied.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>
                    According to them, the Property was supposed to be vacant. Lee Tat Property had
                    found out that Razali was operating a fraud when a tenant of a property owned by
                    another company of the group called up Lee Tat Property for clarification after
                    Razali had asked for future rentals to be paid to him directly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>
                    The alarm having been raised, Annie and Lynn were sent to inspect the properties
                    managed by Lee Tat Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As it turns out, Razali had been acting on his
                    own accord and without the authority of the Plaintiff or Lee Tat Property. At
                    trial, it emerged that the signatures on the Tenancy Agreement, the letter
                    renewing the lease, and the letter authorising Razali to receive payment were
                    not Madam Ching’s. The stamps on the Tenancy Agreement were also not the
                    stamps of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Negotiations between the parties and Dr Kaushik vacating the
                Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Letters were exchanged between the parties as
                    regards their legal position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>
                    Meanwhile, I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net continued to pay the monthly rent
                    for the period from April 2011 to September 2011 (amounting to $54,000), but
                    paid these monies to the Plaintiff instead. Dr Kaushik and his family moved out
                    of the Property on 3 October 2011, and handed the keys to the Plaintiff on 6
                    October 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present suit </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the present suit, the Plaintiff claims
                    against Dr Kaushik for damages for trespass to land. The Plaintiff claims the
                    sum of $352,704, being what it claims the Property would have fetched during Dr
                    Kaushik’s occupation of the Property. It further claims damages of $12,000
                    for the cost of reinstatement of the Property. As I have noted at the outset,
                    the Plaintiff decided not to pursue this latter claim on the second day of the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues to be decided </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The issues to be decided in this present suit
                    may be summarised into the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether there was a valid lease
                        binding on the Plaintiff such that Dr Kaushik’s occupation of the
                        Property was not a trespass to land;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether any of the defences raised by Dr Kaushik apply;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     if there
                        was trespass to land, whether and to what extent Dr Kaushik is liable in
                        damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was a valid lease binding on the Plaintiff as a result
                of Razali acting as its agent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Dr Kaushik’s defence is that there was a
                    valid lease binding on the Plaintiff. Consequently, there can be no trespass to
                    land committed as a result of his occupation of the Property. In advancing this
                    defence, Dr Kaushik makes four main arguments. First, Dr Kaushik relies on the
                    signed Tenancy Agreement. Second, he avers that Razali had the ostensible
                    authority to enter into a lease on behalf of the Plaintiff. Third, Dr Kaushik
                    relies on the principle in the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>First Energy (UK) Ltd v Hungarian International Bank Ltd</em>
                    [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 194 (“<em>First
                        Energy</em>”) to contend that Razali had the ostensible
                    authority to communicate and represent to him the Plaintiff’s approval of
                    the lease, thus binding the Plaintiff by doing so. Last, assuming all the above
                    arguments fail, Dr Kaushik then argues that the Plaintiff had ratified the
                    unauthorised acts of Razali, thus binding itself to the purported lease. I will
                    deal with these arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The signed Tenancy Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Relying on the signed Tenancy Agreement, Dr
                    Kaushik alleges that there was a valid lease. At the trial, it was not disputed
                    that the signatures on the Tenancy Agreement and the letter extending the lease
                    were forged. While they were purported as having been signed by Madam Ching, it
                    was in fact not so. Likewise, the stamp purporting to be the company stamp of
                    the Plaintiff was a forgery. To this, the Plaintiff referred me to the decision
                    of <em>Ruben and Another v Great Fingall Consolidated and
                        Others</em> [1906] 1 AC 439 at 443 for the proposition that a forged
                    document is a “pure nullity” which therefore cannot bind it. I
                    accept that this principle covers the present case. As further explained by
                    Brennan J (at [21] of his judgment) in the High Court of Australia in <em>Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General</em>
                    (1990) 170 CLR 146 in respect of cases such as the present, which he calls a
                    “forgery in the strict sense”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A company cannot give authority to fix a false seal and it is
                        difficult to envisage a case in which there would be ostensible authority to
                        write a false signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Plainly, because an agent cannot have
                    authority, actual or ostensible, to commit forgery, a principal cannot be liable
                    on the basis of such a document. Accordingly, the existence of the forged
                    Tenancy Agreement purportedly signed by Madam Ching does not help Dr
                    Kaushik.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Razali’s ostensible authority to enter into the lease on behalf
                of the Plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Notwithstanding the fact that the signature on
                    the Tenancy Agreement was forged, the Plaintiff may still be bound by the
                    purported lease if there is evidence that Razali had the ostensible authority to
                    bind it to such a lease. The doctrine of ostensible authority is founded on the
                    notion of a representation by a principal that an agent has authority to do
                    certain things on its behalf which in fact he does not. In the oft-cited case of
                        <em>Freeman &amp; Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park
                        Properties (Mangal) Ltd and Another</em> [1964] 2 QB 480
                        (“<em>Freeman Lockyer</em>”),
                    Diplock LJ explained (at 503–504):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An “apparent” or “ostensible” authority ... is
                        a legal relationship between the principal and the contractor created by a
                        representation, made by the principal to the contractor, intended to be and
                        in fact acted upon by the contractor, that the agent has authority to enter
                        on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind within the scope of the
                        “apparent” authority, so as to render the principal liable to
                        perform any obligations imposed upon him by such contract. To the
                        relationship so created the agent is a stranger. He need not be (although he
                        generally is) aware of the existence of the representation but he must not
                        purport to make the agreement as principal himself. The representation, when
                        acted upon by the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent,
                        operates as an estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is
                        not bound by the contract. It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual
                        authority to enter into the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The representation which creates “apparent” authority may
                        take a variety of forms of which the commonest is representation by conduct,
                        that is, by permitting the agent to act in some way in the conduct of the
                        principal's business with other persons. By so doing the principal
                        represents to anyone who becomes aware that the agent is so acting that the
                        agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into contracts with
                        other persons of the kind which an agent so acting in the conduct of his
                        principal’s business has usually “actual” authority to
                        enter into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     To this end, the submissions of Mr Ian Lim
                    (“Mr Lim”), counsel for Dr Kaushik, on the internal workings of
                    Lee Tat Property, such as, whether the company trusted Razali to do certain
                    things, the extent of Razali’s responsibility within the company, and the
                    distribution of duties amongst the employees,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> were irrelevant to the present enquiry. These
                    might well have been relevant if it was to prove that Razali had actual
                    authority to bind the Plaintiff to the lease. In other words, this would be
                    relevant if Dr Kaushik’s position was that the Plaintiff had legitimately
                    entered into the lease through Razali, and is now, for whatever reason, changing
                    its mind. However, whether there was actual authority, as noted in the above
                    quote of Diplock LJ, is irrelevant to the question of ostensible authority.
                    In any event, over the course of the trial, the parties became <em>ad idem</em> that Razali was a fraudster. This being so, any
                    suggestion that Razali had actual authority to enter into the lease on behalf of
                    the Plaintiff cannot stand. The pertinent question at hand for the purpose of
                    whether there was ostensible authority, is, whether there was any representation
                    (by conduct or otherwise) by the Plaintiff to Dr Kaushik that Razali had
                    authority to enter into the lease on its behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In support of Dr Kaushik’s case, Mr Lim
                    relies on two authorities in his submission that there was such ostensible
                    authority in the present case. First, he cites the decision in <em>Next of kin of Ramu Vanniyar Ravichandran v Fongsoon Enterprises
                        (Pte) Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 105 (“<em>Fongsoon Enterprises</em>”). The Singapore High Court
                    in <em>Fongsoon Enterprises</em> found that Meera, a
                    foreman of a site of a port terminal who was given free rein in the running of
                    operations at the site, had the ostensible authority to engage the services of
                    the deceased on the behalf of respondent who operated the site. In coming to
                    that conclusion, Choo Han Teck J cited the above quote from <em>Freeman Lockyer</em> and explained that (at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The respondent, by entrusting Meera with the daily operations and with
                        such great autonomy, can be said to have made a representation to others
                        that Meera had the authority to make decisions in regard to the running of
                        the respondent's works at the Terminal (including the hire of extra hands to
                        complete the works), “by permitting the agent to act in some way in
                        the conduct of the principal's business with other persons”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Second, Mr Lim cites the High Court of Australia decision of <em>Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas</em> (2004)
                    218 CLR 451 (“<em>Pacific
                    Carriers</em>”). The court there found that the defendant bank was
                    liable on two letters of indemnity signed by a bank officer, who was not
                    actually authorised to sign letters of indemnity. The decision was made on the
                    basis that the bank officer had the ostensible authority to do so. The court
                    there observed (at [38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A kind of representation that often arises in business dealings is one
                        which flows from equipping an officer of a company with a certain title,
                        status and facilities. ... The holding out might result from permitting a
                        person to act in a certain manner without taking proper safeguards against
                        misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Was there any representation in the present
                    case by the Plaintiff to Dr Kaushik? More importantly, was there a
                    representation to the effect that Razali was authorised to enter into the lease
                    on behalf of the Plaintiff? As I have stated, the internal workings of Lee Tat
                    Property are irrelevant – Dr Kaushik was never made aware of them until
                    this suit and so they are not representations to Dr Kaushik capable of
                    supporting the existence of ostensible authority. The only reasonable
                    representation by the Plaintiff to Dr Kaushik in the present case is the
                    equipping of Razali with the keys and access cards to the Property. Mr Lim
                    argued that by doing so, the Plaintiff was representing to the world at large
                    that Razali had the authority to enter into the lease on its
                behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I do not think such an argument succeeds in
                    the present case. Although in <em>Fongsoon Enterprises</em>
                    and <em>Pacific Carriers</em> it was held that the creation
                    by the principal of a certain state of affairs in respect of an agent amounted
                    to a representation that an agent had authority to do certain acts, thus
                    triggering the operation of the doctrine of ostensible authority, those cases
                    were decided on their facts. Whether or not a state of affairs created by
                    allowing an agent to act in a certain way amounts to a representation sufficient
                    to create ostensible authority is a question which must be decided and
                    determined on the specific facts of each case. I am of the view that equipping
                    an agent with the keys to a property does not amount to a representation that
                    the agent has authority to enter into leases on the landlord’s behalf.
                    Landlords in Singapore commonly hand property agents the keys to their
                    properties for the purpose of conducting viewings for prospective tenants and
                    for other ministerial acts. I do not think that in doing so, these agents are
                    therefore clothed with the ostensible authority to enter into leases with third
                    parties on behalf of the landlords. When all is said and done, a reasonable
                    prospective tenant would be satisfied only if the landlord himself gives
                    approval for a lease. Such was in fact the case here. Dr Kaushik was not
                    satisfied with Razali or anyone else signing the lease. He specifically insisted
                    that Madam Ching, whom he had identified as the director of the true landlord,
                    sign the Tenancy Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>
                    Dr Kaushik cannot now contend that the equipping of Razali with the keys and
                    access cards to the Property amounts to a representation by the Plaintiff of
                    Razali’s authority to enter into the lease on its behalf, as Dr Kaushik
                    himself did not at the relevant time read such a representation to be
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Razali’s ostensible authority to communicate and represent the
                Plaintiff’s approval of the lease</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     
          <em>First Energy</em> is
                    a decision which has drawn much criticism and comment. In particular, it is
                    widely suggested that it goes against the established principle (illustrated by
                    the House of Lords decision in <em>Armagas Ltd v Mundogas
                        SA</em> [1986] AC 717 (“<em>Armagas
                        Ltd</em>”)) that the law of agency does not recognise what may
                    be described as a “self-authorising” agent. Dr Kaushik relies on
                        <em>First Energy</em> for the proposition that even if
                    Razali did not have the actual or ostensible authority to enter into the lease
                    on behalf of the Plaintiff, he had the ostensible authority to convey and
                    represent the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease, and in doing so bind it.
                    When the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Skandinaviska Enskilda
                        Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd and another and another appeal</em> [2011] 3 SLR 540
                    examined and considered <em>First Energy</em>, it suggested
                    (at [58]–[59] and [61]) a possible reading of the case which would not be
                    inconsistent with what it considered the orthodoxy in <em>Armagas
                        Ltd</em>. The Court of Appeal suggested that in <em>First Energy</em>, there was a specific finding made by the court
                    that the agent had ostensible authority to make the <em>specific</em> representation that his principal has approved a
                    transaction. Such ostensible authority was distinguished from the authority to
                    make <em>general</em> representations about the
                    transaction. The court recognised that the effect of finding that there was
                    ostensible authority to make the <em>specific</em>
                    representation as to a principal’s approval is akin to saying that he has
                    authority to so bind the principal. For that reason, in considering whether the
                    principle in <em>First Energy</em> applies here, the
                    question is an extremely specific one, <em>viz</em> whether
                    Razali had the ostensible authority to make the <em>specific</em> representation as to the Plaintiff’s approval of
                    the lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For chiefly the same reasons why I am of the
                    view that Razali did not have the ostensible authority to enter into the lease
                    on behalf of the Plaintiff (see [24] above), I am also of the view that Razali
                    did not have the ostensible authority to specifically communicate and represent
                    the Plaintiff’s approval of the lease. This conclusion is again fortified
                    by the evidence that Dr Kaushik specially insisted that Madam Ching sign the
                    Tenancy Agreement, and that he would not have been satisfied simply because
                    Razali told him the Plaintiff had approved it. Dr Kaushik argues that there was
                    such ostensible authority in the present case because it would have been
                    “unreal” to have expected him to have checked directly with Madam
                        Ching.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Unreal or not, the fact of the
                    matter is that although Dr Kaushik did not check directly with Madam Ching, he
                    did in fact ask for her signature on the Tenancy Agreement (notwithstanding that
                    it ended up being forged). In the circumstances, I do not find that Razali had
                    the ostensible authority to communicate and represent the Plaintiff’s
                    approval of the lease nor do I find that Dr Kaushik had at that time thought or
                    believed that Razali would have any authority to communicate and represent the
                    Plaintiff’s approval of the lease. Neither did Dr Kaushik rely on such an
                    ostensible authority, even if the state of affairs then existing allowed its
                    creation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Plaintiff had ratified the lease</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the alternative to the argument that there
                    was a valid lease as a result of Razali’s ostensible authority, Dr Kaushik
                    argues that the Plaintiff by its conduct had ratified the unauthorised acts of
                    Razali, thus binding the Plaintiff to the lease. The effect of ratification by a
                    principal is to make an act of an agent, which would otherwise be invalid for
                    want of authority, valid and effectual as though the original unauthorised act
                    was done with authority. Ratification has thus been described as the
                    retrospective clothing of an agent with authority. A principal would therefore
                    be bound by the terms of any such transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In this suit before me, Dr Kaushik seeks to
                    rely on one event to argue that the Plaintiff had ratified the unauthorised acts
                    of Razali. He says that in January 2010, the refrigerator in the Property broke
                    down. He then contacted Razali, and told Razali that he would be buying his own
                    refrigerator and that Razali should remove the one that had broken down. Razali
                    did so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net
                    wrote a letter to inform the Plaintiff that the broken down refrigerator had
                    been collected by Razali and so should be removed from the inventory of items in
                    the Property. This letter, he says, was sent by post to the Plaintiff’s
                    registered address and faxed to the Plaintiff’s fax number.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    Relying on this letter, Dr Kaushik argues that the Plaintiff became aware of his
                    purported tenancy with the Plaintiff. By remaining silent and not acting on such
                    knowledge, he says, the Plaintiff acquiesced to it, thus ratifying
                    Razali’s act of letting out the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At issue at the trial was whether or not
                        I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net had sent the letter, and whether the
                    Plaintiff had received this letter. The Plaintiff disputed that this letter and
                    its fax were received because they could not be found in the files kept by the
                    Plaintiff concerning the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Even if the Plaintiff did receive the said
                    letter and a copy of it by fax, and then did not act on them, that in itself
                    still may not amount to a ratification of the unauthorised acts of Razali. I do
                    not doubt the proposition that in an appropriate case, silence or inactivity can
                    amount to ratification. In fact this proposition, found in the English High
                    Court decision of <em>Yona International Ltd and Heftsiba
                        Overseas Works Pte Ltd v La Réunion Française Société Anonyme d'Assurances
                        et de Réassurances</em> [1996] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 84
                        (“<em>Yona International</em>”) at 106,
                    was accepted by me in <em>Eng Gee Seng v Quek Choon Teck and
                        others</em> [2010] 1 SLR 241 at [35]. Mr Lim for Dr
                    Kaushik cites the following passage from <em>Yona
                        International</em> (at 106):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ratification can no doubt be inferred without difficulty from silence or
                        inactivity in cases where the principal, by failing to disown the
                        transaction, allows a state of affairs to come about which is inconsistent
                        with treating the transaction as unauthorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, Mr Lim fails to cite the next few lines in the
                    passage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That is probably no more than a form of ratification by conduct. Where
                        there is nothing of that kind, however, the position is more difficult since
                        silence or inaction may simply reflect an unwillingness or inability on the
                        part of the principal to commit himself. For that reason it will not usually
                        be sufficient to evidence ratification ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In considering whether silence or inactivity
                    can amount to ratification, one must keep in mind the juridical nature of
                    ratification. In essence, ratification is akin to an assent by the principal to
                    the transaction entered into by the unauthorised agent by adopting the
                    agent’s otherwise unauthorised acts. To this end, the principal’s
                    inaction must, when interpreted in the context and circumstances, be of a nature
                    which <em>unequivocally</em> signifies such an assent.
                    Here, even assuming the Plaintiff had received the letter and the fax, its
                    failure to act may well be attributable to other reasons, be it carelessness,
                    oversight, or otherwise. It would appear that Razali was the person put in
                    charge of handling inventory matters for the properties managed by Lee Tat
                    Property and therefore, that letter and a faxed copy of it, if received might
                    well have been directed to Razali to handle and accordingly, it never came to
                    the attention of Madam Ching herself, or for that matter, any other employee. In
                    any case, it is not required that I decide the reason for such inaction. All
                    that matters is that the silence or inaction in the case at hand is silence or
                    inaction that is of an equivocal nature as to whether there was any assent by
                    the Plaintiff. Accordingly, I do not agree that the Plaintiff could be said to
                    have ratified the unauthorised acts of Razali and consequently bound itself to
                    the terms of the purported lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In further support of Dr Kaushik’s case,
                    Mr Lim also cites the English Court of Appeal case of <em>Spiro v
                        Lintern and Others</em> [1973] WLR 1002 (“<em>Spiro</em>”). In <em>Spiro</em>,
                    the first defendant, Mr Lintern, asked his wife to find a purchaser for his
                    house, but gave her no authority to sell. The wife nevertheless purported to
                    agree to a sale of the house to the claimant. Mr Lintern knew about this and
                    after meeting the claimant, he permitted the claimant to proceed to get an
                    architect and a gardener to work on the building and the garden without telling
                    the claimant that his wife did not have authority to sell. The Court of Appeal
                    held that Mr Lintern could not deny that his wife had authority to sell the
                    house. Mr Lim’s reliance on <em>Spiro</em>
                    demonstrates how the concepts of ratification and estoppel can very often be
                    confused. <em>Spiro</em> does not stand for the proposition
                    that the silence of the first defendant amounted to a ratification of the
                    unauthorised act of his wife. Instead, the decision of the Court of Appeal was
                    made on the basis of an estoppel. Mr Lintern, in the circumstances, by his
                    silence and inaction, was found to have made a representation by conduct that
                    his wife had the requisite authority. The claimant having relied on the
                    representation thereon and suffering a detriment as a result, Mr Lintern was
                    estopped from denying the authority of his wife and the validity of the
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The more pertinent issue in this case
                    therefore is whether any estoppel has been raised against the Plaintiff denying
                    the existence of a valid lease. I do not think so. Even if the Plaintiff had
                    received the said letter and the fax and thereafter remained silent and did not
                    act, such that this could amount to a representation, I do not think that there
                    was any reliance thereon by Dr Kaushik. Dr Kaushik was content to carry on
                    living in the Property, because he was at all times under the impression (albeit
                    wrongly) that he had, from the outset, a valid lease with the Plaintiff. As a
                    result, the Plaintiff’s silence and inaction upon receipt of the letter
                    cannot be said to have ever played on Dr Kaushik’s mind at the relevant
                    time. In contrast, in <em>Spiro</em>, before the
                    representations by silence and inaction were made by Mr Lintern, the claimant
                    was labouring under a significant amount of doubt as to whether there was or was
                    not a binding contract for the sale of the house because he had found out that
                    it was Mr Lintern and not Mrs Lintern who owned the house. On those facts, Mr
                    Spiro could be said to have relied on those representations by silence and
                    inaction by Mr Lintern after the two finally met when he then instructed, to his
                    detriment, an architect and a gardener to do the works. An estoppel was thus
                    raised in <em>Spiro</em>, but none arises
                here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Plaintiff is bound by any lease</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Given all of the above, I find that there was
                    no valid lease between the Plaintiff and Dr Kaushik. As a result, I find that Dr
                    Kaushik has committed the tort of trespass to land in wrongfully occupying the
                    Property for the period between 1 December 2008 and 6 October
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defence of contributory negligence applies to the tort of
                trespass to land</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Amongst the various defences raised by Dr
                    Kaushik against the Plaintiff’s claim for damages for trespass to land was
                    the defence of contributory negligence as found in s 3(1) of the
                    Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev
                    Ed) (“the CNPIA”). To this end, Dr Kaushik contends that the
                    damages in respect of which the Plaintiff is claiming was caused wholly or at
                    least largely by its own negligence. During the conduct of the trial, Mr Lim
                    sought to show that the Plaintiff, Lee Tat Property, and its associated
                    companies were run and managed in an indifferent, lax and careless
                        manner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> These included, amongst other
                    things, the failure to keep track of or check on properties, the failure to
                    supervise Razali and the lack of proper control and supervision by Madam Ching
                    and the management of Lee Tat Property over the properties collectively held by
                    the group because of the large number of properties involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Mr Lim suggested that the defence of
                    contributory negligence was applicable to the tort of trespass to land because
                    the tort is an “unintentional” tort. Mr Lim has misrepresented the
                    tort, and has perhaps misapprehended the meaning of “intentional”
                    or “unintentional” when used in respect of characterising torts as
                    such. Nevertheless, whether or not the defence in s 3(1) of the CNPIA applies to
                    a particular tort does not depend on whether or not the tort can be
                    characterised as “intentional” or “unintentional”.
                    Very recently, the English Court of Appeal in <em>Pritchard v
                        Cooperative Group Ltd</em> [2012] QB 320 (“<em>Pritchard</em>”) was asked to determine whether the
                    defence in s 1(1) of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 (c 28)
                    (UK) (“the 1945 Act”), which is <em>in pari
                        materia</em> with our provision, applies to the torts of assault and
                    battery. The Court of Appeal explained (<em>per</em> Aikens
                    LJ at [61]–[62]) that the purpose of the 1945 Act was to provide relief to
                    claimants whose actions would have previously failed (because the common law
                    incarnation of the defence was a complete defence) by allowing the courts to
                    apportion damages. Its purpose was not to reduce damages which previously before
                    the enactment of the statute would have been awarded. Therefore, if the common
                    law defence did not apply to a tort pre-1945, the statutory defence would also
                    not apply. The Court of Appeal held that because it could find no case before
                    1945 which applied the defence to the intentional torts of assault and battery,
                    the statutory defence likewise did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Whether or not the statutory defence of
                    contributory negligence applies to the tort of trespass depends on whether or
                    not the common law defence applied to it before the enactment of the CNPIA.
                    Although Mr Lim has taken the wrong approach to determining whether the defence
                    applies, he cites in his submissions the Straits Settlements Supreme Court
                    decision of <em>Brown v Attorney-General</em> [1889] KY 4
                        (“<em>Brown</em>”) for the proposition
                    that the defence applies to the tort at hand. Unfortunately, Mr Lim’s
                    reading of <em>Brown</em> is mistaken. In fact, in
                        <em>Brown</em>, Wood J did not apply the defence of
                    contributory negligence, saying:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The exact application however of this principle which is embodied in the
                        known legal maxim <em>vigilantibus non dormentibus jura
                            subveniunt</em>, I cannot find to have been held to prevail in a
                        case quite like the present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Wood J instead held in favour of the defendant there on the basis of a
                    finding of fact that there was no act of trespass. Ultimately, whether or not
                    the defence applies will be a matter of legal archaeology. On the basis of the
                    decision in <em>Brown</em>, and the fact that I have not
                    been able to find any other case before the enactment of the CNPIA (or in fact,
                    the 1945 Act) applying the defence to the tort of trespass to land, I am of the
                    view that the defence is not applicable here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I would only add that Dr Kaushik’s
                    reliance on the defence of contributory negligence presupposes that the
                    Plaintiff owes him a duty of care, which I am generally doubtful of, given the
                    many common law pronouncements that property owners owe no general duty to look
                    after their own property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Plaintiff was vicariously liable for Razali’s
                acts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Another limb of Dr Kaushik’s defence
                    runs as follows.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Razali has committed the tort
                    of deceit against him. The Plaintiff is vicariously liable for the tort of
                    Razali. As a result, Dr Kaushik is entitled to raise a set-off against any
                    damages claimed by the Plaintiff by relying on the damages the Plaintiff is
                    liable to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Creative as such the argument is, the first
                    obstacle Dr Kaushik faces is the fact that Razali was in fact not an employee of
                    the Plaintiff. Instead, Razali was at all material times an employee of Lee Tat
                    Property. Dr Kaushik acknowledges this difficulty, and therefore goes on to
                    suggest that as between the Plaintiff and Lee Tat Property, the corporate veil
                    should be lifted, such that the Plaintiff can be held liable for Razali’s
                        acts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> In
                    furtherance of his submission that the corporate veil should be lifted, Dr
                    Kaushik cited the following facts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> First, the employees of Lee Tat Property, Annie
                    and Collin Tan were sometimes confused as to who their employers were –
                    Lee Tat Property or the Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Second, Razali was
                    at one instance wrongly identified by the Plaintiff’s solicitors as an
                    employee of the Plaintiff, even thought he was in fact an employee of Lee Tat
                        Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Third, during the trial,
                    Collin Tan continued to be confused in wrongly referring to Lee Tat Property
                    when she meant the Plaintiff and <em>vice
                        versa</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Fourth, apart from Lee Tat
                    Property, the rest of the companies in the Lee Tat group owned by Madam Ching
                    only owned properties and did not have any employees or their own offices.
                    Fifth, the other companies all shared the same office with Lee Tat Property.
                    Sixth, the administration of all the companies was handled by Lee Tat Property.
                    Seventh, all decisions for companies in the group were made by Madam Ching
                    alone. She is the director of all the companies in the group, some of which are
                    99% owned by her, others 100%. Last, the Plaintiff’s letterhead bore a
                    logo which showed the letters “L-T”, which stands for “Lee
                    Tat”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I am not convinced that these factors are
                    sufficient for the court to lift the corporate veil. Dr Kaushik submits that the
                    above factors show that the companies were “run as a functional whole
                    with unity of ownership and/or control”, such that the corporate veil
                    ought to be lifted. It was surely with specific intent that Madam Ching arranged
                    to have different companies hold different properties, and to have them all
                    managed by a different distinct company. The starting point is that each company
                    within what may be called a “group” remains a separate distinct
                    entity. In <em>Adams and Others v Cape Industries Plc and
                        Another</em> [1990] 1 Ch 433 (“<em>Adams</em>”) , the English Court of Appeal confirmed that it
                    is open for businessmen to structure their operations to insulate one part of a
                    business from another (at 544, <em>per</em> Slade

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the present case, Madam Ching was as a
                    matter of law, fully entitled to structure her companies the way they were and
                    have separate companies hold different properties. This was likely done so as to
                    deal with situations such as the present. If Razali was guilty of committing a
                    tort, and his employer Lee Tat Property had to be liable to a claimant, the
                    intention was that the other companies would be insulated from liability. As
                    clearly set out by Slade LJ in <em>Adams</em>, there is
                    nothing illegal about such an arrangement. In the absence of compelling reasons
                    such as the existence of fraud or serious abuse of the corporate form (as was
                    the case in <em>New Line Productions, Inc and another v Aglow
                        Video Pte Ltd and others and other suits</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 660,
                    cited by Dr Kaushik in his submissions), the courts will be slow to treat
                    companies in the same group as one legal entity merely because it would be
                    convenient for a claimant’s claim to do so. The Plaintiff is therefore not
                    vicariously liable for the alleged tort committed by Razali. Dr Kaushik’s
                    argument on this point fails.</p>

                    Tat Property under the doctrine of vicarious liability for the acts of Razali,
                    then its proper course is to bring an action against Lee Tat Property. Lee Tat
                    Property is not a party to the present suit, so I will say no more on the
                    issue.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Plaintiff’s claim in damages for
                    trespass to land amounts to a sum of $352,704, being what it says is the market
                    rent for the period Dr Kaushik was in occupation of the Property. Of course, the
                    Plaintiff has clarified through Mr Balasubramaniam that it will give Dr Kaushik
                    credit for the $54,000 already paid to it (see [14] above). The
                    Plaintiff’s claim is only for the wrongful occupation, as it had on the
                    second day of the trial dropped its other claim for reinstatement for physical
                    damage to the Property. In any case, the Plaintiff unhelpfully says no more than
                    simply asserting the claim for market rent. The nature of damages for trespass
                    to land must be unpacked to understand what exactly it
                constitutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The juridical nature of damages for trespass to land</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The right to sue for damages based on the
                    market rental value of a property wrongfully occupied is a principle well
                    established in the law, and one which has been described by Nicholls LJ in
                        <em>Stoke-on-Trent City Council v W &amp; J Wass
                        Ltd</em> [1988] 3 All ER 394 as the “user principle”. In
                    this regard, the English Court of Appeal case of <em>Swordheath
                        Properties Ltd v Tabet and Others</em> [1978] 1 WLR 285 is often cited
                    for the proposition that (at 288):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">when [the plaintiff] has established that the defendant has remained on as

                        absence of the trespassing defendant, to have as damages for the trespass
                        the value of the property as it would fairly be calculated; and, in the
                        absence of anything special in the particular case it would be the ordinary
                        letting value of the property that would determine the amount of damages.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The exact juridical nature of damages for
                    trespass to land lay largely unarticulated for a long time. Lord Denning MR
                    planted the seed for the recognition of the restitutionary analysis for damages
                    for trespass to land in <em>Penarth Dock Engineering Co Ltd v
                        Pounds</em> [1963] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 359 when he used (at 362) what
                    may be described as “restitutionary language” in a case involving
                    trespass to the claimant’s dock:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Penarth company would not seem to have suffered any damage so to speak
                        of. They have not had to pay any extra rent to the British Transport
                        Commission. The dock is of no use to them: they would not have made any
                        money out of it. But... in a case of this kind... the test of the measure of
                        damages is not what the plaintiffs have lost, but what <b><em>benefit </em></b><em>the defendant has
                            obtained</em> by having the use of the berth. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, it was only later in <em>Ministry of Defence v
                        Ashman</em> (1993) 66 P &amp; CR 195 (“<em>Ashman</em>”) that Hoffmann LJ decided to “call a spade
                    a spade”, and declared that a claim for <em>mesne</em> profit for trespass to land is a claim for restitution. In
                    doing so, Hoffmann LJ distinguished the compensatory and restitutionary bases of
                    damages for trespass to land (at 200–201):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A person entitled to possession of land can make a claim against a person
                        who has been in occupation without his consent on two alternative bases.
                            <em>The first is for the loss which he has suffered in
                            consequence of the defendant’s trespass.</em> This is the
                        normal measure of damages in the law of tort. <em>The second
                            is the value of the benefit which the occupier has received.</em>
                        This is a claim for restitution. The <em>two bases of claim
                            are mutually exclusive</em> and the plaintiff must elect before
                        judgment which of them he wishes to pursue. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Admittedly, the judicial opinion on the issue is not unanimous. In
                        <em>Ashman</em> itself, Lloyd LJ disagreed, taking the
                    view that the claim was simply compensatory. The defendant in <em>Ashman</em> was a wife of a Royal Air Force officer who had occupied
                    the claimant’s premises. Her husband subsequently moved out, leaving her
                    and the children. She refused to move out of the property, instead holding over.
                    The claimant thus claimed damages for trespass to land. The issue which fell for
                    the Court of Appeal to decide was whether these damages should be assessed by
                    reference to the market rent for such premises, or by the subsidised rent which
                    a serviceman would actually pay for the premises, or by some other measure. In
                    taking the view that the damages are restitutionary in nature, Hoffmann LJ held
                    that it was the market rent that was recoverable. In taking the view that the
                    damages were compensatory, Lloyd LJ held that it was the subsidised rent that
                    the claimant could recover. However, in <em>Inverugie Investments
                        Ltd v Hackett</em> [1995] 1 WLR 713 (“<em>Inverugie</em>”), an appeal from the Commonwealth of the
                    Bahamas heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Lord Lloyd of
                    Berwick (having been elevated to the position of Lord of Appeal in Ordinary
                    since the decision in <em>Ashman</em>), declared (at 718)
                    that the claim for <em>mesne</em> profits “need not
                    be characterised as exclusively compensatory, or exclusively restitutionary; it
                    combines elements of both”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Singapore High Court in <em>Yenty Lily (trading as Access International Services) v ACES System
                        Development Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 1 SLR 577 (“<em>Yenty Lily</em>”) recently took the opportunity to explore the
                    juridical basis of the user principle in the context of damages for the wrongful
                    detention of goods. After considering a number of authorities on the issue,
                    Judith Prakash J appears to have accepted (at [66]–[69]) the conclusion in
                        <em>Inverugie</em> that the user principle comprised of
                        <em>both</em> compensatory and restitutionary elements.
                    Prakash J’s reticence in adopting a pure restitutionary approach appears
                    (at [66]) to be because it is thought that by adopting such an analysis, a
                    defendant may argue that where he has not made any discernible use of the
                    detained or misappropriated property, he had not derived any benefit and
                    therefore cannot be made to pay the plaintiff the market rent as damages.
                    Prakash J thus preferred to characterise the user principle as being a mix of
                    both compensation and restitution. Accordingly, she held that the recognition
                    that the user principle may also contain elements of restitution does not lead
                    to the conclusion that a plaintiff cannot recover in a situation where the
                    defendant has not made any discernible use of the plaintiff’s detained or
                    misappropriated property unless actual damage is proved. What is important,
                    Prakash J opined, may be the fact that, by the detention or misappropriation,
                    the defendant gains the opportunity to use the property concerned whilst
                    simultaneously depriving the owner of such opportunity such that the
                    defendant’s failure to exploit such opportunity is
                irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Inverugie</em>,
                    the defendant had wrongly ejected the claimant from a hotel complex and excluded
                    them from it for a period of 15 years. Over this period, the occupancy of the
                    hotel was only about 35 to 40 percent. Facing a claim for trespass to land, the
                    defendant conceded that it was liable to pay the claimant reasonable rent. The
                    sole question for the Privy Council was how this should be assessed. The Privy
                    Council held that the defendant had to pay the claimant damages to be assessed
                    by reference to the reasonable rent of all the apartments, and not with
                    reference to only the 35 to 40 percent rate of occupancy. As noted by Professor
                    Graham Virgo (“Professor Virgo”) in Graham Virgo<em>, The Principles of the Law of Restitution</em> (Oxford University
                    Press, 2nd Ed, 2006) at p 468, the objection to calling the result reached in
                        <em>Inverugie</em> as consistent with a restitutionary
                    analysis is that the defendant was required to pay rent for the entire period
                    despite the finding that it had not derived a benefit from the apartments all of
                    the time. This appears to be the very same objection held by Prakash J in her
                    analysis in <em>Yenty Lily</em>. However, as Professor
                    Virgo goes on to explain in his text, the defendant’s use of the hotel
                    complex throughout the period should be regarded as it having obtained an
                    “objective benefit”, that is, the opportunity to obtain income
                    from the apartments. Whether or not in fact the hotel was fully occupied is a
                    matter which raises questions of subjective devaluation (the concept of which is
                    explained below at [54]–[56]), which, on the facts of that case, did not
                    apply. Likewise, in an action for wrongful detention of property, even if a
                    defendant has not made any discernible use of the detained or misappropriated
                    property, he has obtained an objective benefit, thus entitling the plaintiff to
                    recover damages measured by the market rent. Similar to the case in <em>Inverugie</em>, it is arguable that the defendant in
                        <em>Yenty Lily</em> should not be permitted to
                    subjectively devalue the benefit received (on the basis of the failure to make
                    discernible use of the goods). When the plaintiff sought to claim ownership over
                    the detained goods, the defendant’s response was to deny the same and to
                    refuse to return them. By refusing to return the property, the defendant must be
                    taken to have freely accepted that benefit and is therefore not entitled to
                    subjectively devalue that benefit by saying that it had not made discernible use
                    of the detained property. Seen from this perspective, a purely restitutionary
                    analysis may not be contrary to the user principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Why should a distinction be made between an
                    award for compensation and an award for restitution in claims such as the
                    present? Different principles and different possibilities will flow from the
                    different characterisations in different cases. The distinction is not purely
                    theoretical. As Professor James Edelman (who has since been appointed to the
                    bench of the Supreme Court of Western Australia) explained in James Edelman,
                        <em>Gain-based Damages</em> (Hart Publishing, 2002)
                        (“<em>Edelman</em>”) at p 66:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In cases [of wrongs] where the wrongful transfer involves money, the
                        transfer of value might sometimes be equivalent to the loss suffered. But
                        the restitutionary damages award is not concerned with financial loss and
                        opens other possibilities which will be seen below such as subjective
                        devaluation of the award. <em>Thus, even in cases where the
                            quantum of compensatory and restitutionary damages might be the same, it
                            has been recognised that it is important to keep the two awards
                            distinct</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I do not see any reason why we ought not to
                    recognise that where a distinction can be made between a compensation-based
                    claim and a restitution-based claim, a claim for <em>mesne</em> profit, market rent, under the “user
                    principle”, or however one may choose to call the claim, is a claim for a
                    restitutionary remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is the Plaintiff’s claim for compensation or
                restitution?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Although the Plaintiff repeatedly asserts, and
                    is not wrong, that a claimant in an action for trespass to land is entitled to
                    market rent during the period of wrongful occupation by the defendant, as
                    envisaged by the above statement in <em>Edelman</em> (see
                    [49] above), it is also necessary in the present case to consider whether the
                    present claim is for compensatory damages or restitutionary
                damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The evidence at trial showed that during the
                    period of Dr Kaushik’s wrongful occupation of the Property, the Plaintiff
                    was unable and unwilling to lease the Property to anyone else. The evidence was
                    that the Plaintiff (and its controlling mind Madam Ching) was unwilling to let
                    the Property out for anything less than $10,000 because it was
                    “selective” of its tenants, and during the period of Dr
                    Kaushik’s wrongful occupation, the Plaintiff did not receive a single
                    offer satisfying the $10,000 minimum.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Put simply, the
                    Plaintiff was at all material times very happy to leave the Property unoccupied.
                    There was no indication that because of Dr Kaushik’s occupation of the
                    Property, the Plaintiff was prevented from letting the Property to another
                    tenant and as a result had to forego rent it would otherwise have collected. Of
                    course, if this was the case, the Plaintiff would have to elect between the
                    compensatory measure and the restitutionary measure (such election would likely
                    be influenced by which is higher). Likewise, the Plaintiff’s claim for
                    reinstatement damages, which has since been dropped, would have been a claim for
                    compensatory damages. If the Plaintiff had had to pay extra taxes because of Dr
                    Kaushik’s occupation, that would have been a claim for compensation as
                    well. I would only note that in these latter two examples, because the
                    compensatory claim is not incompatible with the restitutionary claim, the
                    Plaintiff would not need to elect and will be entitled to recover both. However,
                    in the circumstances, I would not characterise the Plaintiff’s present
                    claim of $352,704 as a claim for compensatory damages; it is clearly claiming
                    restitutionary damages in the form of the gain Dr Kaushik enjoyed in occupying
                    the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Plaintiff’s restitutionary claim and the damages it is
                entitled</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Having characterised the Plaintiff’s
                    claim for damages for trespass to land as a claim for a restitutionary remedy,
                    what are the damages it is entitled? The measure of damages is the benefit
                    enjoyed by Dr Kaushik as a result of the wrongful occupation of the Property. In
                    its pleadings, the Plaintiff asserts that it is entitled to a sum of
                        $352,704.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> This, it claims, represents the
                    market rent of the Property for the duration of Dr Kaushik’s occupation.
                    It claims that this sum is arrived at by multiplying the strata area of the
                    Property by the rate of $4.07 per square foot, this figure being “as per
                    URA data during the last quarter of 2008”. Aside from this bare
                    assertion, the Plaintiff adduced no further evidence in support of its
                    contention that the sum it was claiming represented the market rent. I therefore
                    find that the Plaintiff has not shown on a balance of probabilities that the
                    market rent for the period of the wrongful occupation amounted to $352,704.
                    However, given that Dr Kaushik was happy to have paid or to have caused
                        I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net to pay the sum of $9,000 every month to
                    Razali as rent for the Property, I am satisfied that at the very least, the
                    amount of $9,000 can be taken to be the market rent of the Property during the
                    period of the wrongful occupation. Mr Lim does not deny this in the submissions
                    for Dr Kaushik.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, I would accept
                    that the market rent of the Property for the relevant period of 34 months and 5
                    days (from 1 December 2008 to 6 October 2011) would be $307,451.61 and not
                    $352,704 as claimed by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Can Dr Kaushik “subjectively devalue” the benefit he
                derived?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As I have alluded to above, the
                    characterisation of the present claim for trespass to land as restitutionary
                    leads to different possibilities flowing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Dr Kaushik submits that he is entitled to
                    “subjectively devalue” the benefit he derived from the wrongful
                    occupation of the property. The phrase “subjective devaluation”
                    was first used by Professor Peter Birks, and he explains the concept in Peter
                    Birks, <em>An Introduction to the Law of Restitution</em>
                    (Clarendon Press, 1985) at p 109 as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The critical distinction is between money and benefits in kind. Where the
                        defendant received money, it will be impossible on all ordinary facts for
                        him to argue that he was not enriched. For money is the very measure of
                        enrichment. By contrast benefits in kind are less unequivocally enriching
                        because they are susceptible to an argument which for convenience can be
                        called ‘subjective devaluation’. It is an argument based on the
                        presmiss [<em>sic</em>] that benefits in kind have a
                        value to a particular individual only so far as he chooses to give them
                        value. What matters is his choice. The fact that there is a market in the
                        good which is in question, or in other words that other people habitually
                        choose to have it and thus create a demand for it, is irrelevant to the case
                        of any one particular individual. He claims the right to dissent from that
                        demand. Market value is not his value. Suppose that without his knowledge
                        his car has been serviced or his roof mended. There is a market in car
                        servicing and roof mending. It is easy to find the market value of work of
                        that kind, what the going rate is between reasonable people. But he says
                        that he had decided to go in for do-it-yourself or to take the risk of
                        disaster by doing nothing. Indeed to make his point he does not even have to
                        say that he had actually decided, let alone prove that he had decided, to
                        dissociate himself from the particular demand. For his point is sufficiently
                        made by saying that he has a continuing liberty to choose how to apply his
                        particular store of value and that in the case of this car-servicing or
                        roof-mending he simply had not made his choice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">More recently, the concept was put in the following simple terms by
                    Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the House of Lords in the case of <em>Sempra Metals Ltd (formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd) v Inland
                        Revenue Commissioners and another</em> [2008] 1 AC 561 at
                    [119]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here, as elsewhere, the law of restitution is sufficiently flexible to
                        achieve a just result. To avoid what would otherwise be an unjust outcome
                        the court can, in an appropriate case, depart from the market value approach
                        when assessing the time value of money or, indeed, when assessing the value
                        of any other benefit gained by a defendant. What is ultimately important in
                        restitution is whether, and to what extent, the particular defendant has
                        been benefited: see <em>Burrows, The Law of
                            Restitution</em>, 2nd ed (2002), p 18. <em>A
                            benefit is not always worth its market value to a particular
                            defendant</em>. When it is not it may be unjust to treat the
                        defendant as having received a benefit possessing the value it has to
                        others. In Professor Birks’s language, a benefit received by a
                        defendant may sometimes be subject to “subjective
                        devaluation”: <em>An Introduction to the Law of
                            Restitution</em> (1985), p 413. An application of this approach is
                        to be found in the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Ministry
                            of Defence v Ashman</em> [1993] 2 EGLR 102. ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The concept of subjective devaluation was
                    applied by Hoffmann LJ in <em>Ashman</em>. There, after
                    finding that the claimant was ordinarily entitled to the market rent and not
                    merely the subsidised rent (see above at [46]), Hoffmann LJ went on to hold (at
                    201) that the defendant could subjectively devalue the benefit derived because
                    the benefit was in fact “worth less to [the particular]
                    defendant”. Hoffmann LJ found two circumstances which justified such a
                    conclusion. First, the defendant and her erstwhile husband had been occupying
                    the premises at the subsidised rate. Secondly, the defendant had no choice but
                    to stay in the premises until the local authority could re-house her. These
                    factors led Hoffmann LJ to conclude that the benefit derived by the defendant
                    was only worth the subsidised rate to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     On the basis of the above, Dr Kaushik thus
                    contends that by reason of him (or rather, his company
                        I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net) having paid the full rent of $9,000 to
                    Razali, he is entitled to rely on the concept of subjective devaluation, and
                    should be taken as valuing the benefit he received as nil.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> I do not think that Mr Lim fully grasps
                    the concept. Quite the contrary to his submission, the fact that Dr Kaushik had
                    paid (or caused his company I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net to pay) the sum
                    of $9,000 every month to Razali does not show that he valued the benefit any
                    less. What it in fact does show, is that he <em>did</em>
                    value the benefit at $9,000, because if that was not so, he would not have been
                    so willing to part with that sum.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicability of the change of position defence to a claim in
                trespass to land for restitutionary damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Another corollary flowing from the
                    characterisation of the present claim as restitutionary in nature is the
                    applicability of certain defences. Specifically, the facts of the present case
                    raise the possibility of the defence known as “change of position”
                    being applicable. The defence was formally recognised in the English common law
                    in the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in the seminal House of Lords decision
                    in <em>Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale Ltd</em> [1991]
                    2 AC 548 (“<em>Lipkin Gorman</em>”)
                    at 579E–F:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... where an innocent defendant’s position is so changed that he
                        will suffer an injustice if called upon to repay or to repay in full, the
                        injustice of requiring him so to repay outweighs the injustice of denying
                        the plaintiff restitution. If the plaintiff pays money to the defendant
                        under a mistake of fact, and the defendant then, acting in good faith, pays
                        the money or part of it to charity, it is unjust to require the defendant to
                        make restitution to the extent that he has so changed his position.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defence was accepted in Singapore in the case of <em>Seagate Technology Pte Ltd and another v Goh Han Kim</em>
                    [1994] 3 SLR(R) 836 (“<em>Seagate
                    Technology</em>”) and then confirmed in <em>MCST
                        Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 418 (“<em>De Beers</em>”)
                    at [35] as requiring that: (a) the person enriched had changed his position; (b)
                    the change was <em>bona fide</em>; and (c) it would be
                    inequitable to require the person enriched to make restitution or to make
                    restitution in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I would note that all of the cases cited above
                    are cases where the claim was founded on unjust enrichment. In the realm of
                    restitution for an unjust enrichment, one can today confidently say that the
                    change of position defence has been established as being a central and important
                    defence. In the present case however, the claim is not a claim founded on unjust
                    enrichment, but is a claim for trespass to land in which restitutionary damages
                    are sought, <em>ie</em> a case of restitution for a civil
                    wrong. This objection was raised by the Plaintiff in its submissions when it
                    attempted to distinguish <em>Seagate Technology</em> by
                    pointing out that the cause of action there was one for money had and
                        received.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Whether the
                    defence of change of position applies to a claim in restitution for a civil
                    wrong is an issue which has yet to be thoroughly considered by judicial
                    opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Objection to the application of the change of
                    position defence to restitution for wrongs often begins with reference to a
                    statement by Lord Goff in <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> (at 580C)
                    that “it is commonly accepted that the defence should not be open to a
                    wrongdoer”. From this pithy line spawned the view that the defence is not
                    available to claims for restitution for wrongs, because in such a case the
                    defendant is necessarily a “wrongdoer”. Judicial opinion on the
                    question of whether the defence applies to restitution for wrongs is sparse.
                        <em>Obiter dicta</em> by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in
                        <em>Kuwait Airways Corpn v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and
                        5)</em> [2002] 2 AC 883 at [79] suggests that the defence is
                    applicable to restitution for the tort of conversion, although the pronouncement
                    is far from definitive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Neither is there any unanimity in the academic
                    writings on the issue. On the one hand, the weight of the academic opinion is
                    that there should not be a blanket rule barring the application of the change of
                    position defence to cases of restitution for wrongs. Professor Andrew Burrows
                    (“Professor Burrows”) in Andrew Burrows, <em>The
                        Law of Restitution</em> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2011)
                        (“<em>Burrows</em>”) at p 699 suggests
                    that this is so, and lists the leading writers of the 7th<sup></sup>edition of <em>Goff and Jones on The Law of
                        Restitution</em>, and others such as Professors Richard Nolan, Virgo
                    and Andrew Tettenborn as holding the view that the defence applies to cases of
                    restitution for wrongs. In essence, the academic opinion on this view starts
                    from the premise that there are wrongs and then there are wrongs; not all wrongs
                    are of the same quality. Where, therefore, the wrong was committed innocently,
                    they do not see any objection to the application of the defence. The statement
                    by Lord Goff was likely intended at wrongdoers who display a certain degree of
                    moral turpitude and therefore are undeserving of the defence, although in such a
                    case the defence would not be available in any case because such a defendant
                    cannot be said to have behaved in good faith. As Professor Andrew Tettenborn
                    explains in Andrew Tettenborn, <em>The Law of Restitution in
                        England and Ireland</em> (Cavendish Publishing Limited, 2002) at
                    p 278:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect, [Lord Goff's statement] is a little difficult to understand;
                        and indeed, whether such a blanket exception is either necessary or
                        desirable is rather doubtful. <em>It is no doubt aimed at
                            such unsympathetic characters as the thief, or the agent who takes a
                            bribe, who later tries to avoid disgorging his ill-gotten gains by
                            saying he has spent them. But such people are unlikely to be able to
                            invoke the principle anyway, since however much they may have changed
                            their position, they can hardly claim to have done so in good
                            faith</em>. It is hard to see why he should not have the benefit
                        of the defence if the claimant chooses to waive the tort and sue for money
                        had and received. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On the other hand, Professor Burrows himself
                    disagrees, and holds the view that the defence should not apply to restitution
                    for wrongs (see <em>Burrows</em> at p 699–700).
                    Professor Burrows takes the view that the defence of change of position is
                    concerned with ensuring security for receipt. He thus says that this is a
                    consideration relevant to a claim for unjust enrichment, which is a claim for
                    the reversal of a transfer of value. In contrast, because in the case of a wrong
                    the purpose of the law’s response is to “remedy” it, the
                    change of position defence cannot operate to counter the response as the
                    rationale for the defence cannot outweigh the policies justifying restitution
                    for a wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I do not think that Professor Burrows’
                    strict position is entirely justified. The law should not be so inflexible as to
                    completely exclude the defence. It may be true that there may be certain kinds
                    of wrongs which are of such a nature that the defence ought not to apply even to
                    innocent wrongdoers. In such a case, the rationale of the defence simply cannot
                    outweigh the policy for remedying the wrong. However, this may not necessarily
                    be so for all kinds of wrongs. Professor Elise Bant (“Professor
                    Bant”) adopts such a view which can be described as more nuanced. In
                    Elise Bant, <em>The Change of Position Defence</em> (Hart
                    Publishing, 2009) at p 171, she starts by saying:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have seen in cases of defendant-instigated changes of position, the
                        change of position defence operates to protect a defendant from a claim in
                        restitution where he has irreversibly changed his position in reliance of
                        his receipt. It prevents the defendant from being put in a worse (including
                        entirely different) position than he occupied prior to his receipt. In this
                        way, the defence supports and reflects the restricted aims of restitution.
                        Restitution does not aim to impose loss on a defendant, to punish him or to
                        require him to disgorge profits. Its aim is limited to reversing transfers
                        of value so as to restore the parties to the status quo ante. In that
                        context, the defence operates to ensure that, in circumstances where a
                        defendant’s position has irreversibly changed, restitution does not
                        operate contrary to its underlying purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Then, applying the nuance Professor Burrows appears to have missed,
                    she says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Seen in this light, and <em>subject to any overriding
                            policy considerations</em>, there is no reason why the defence
                        should not apply to claims for restitution arising from a strict liability
                        wrong or, for that matter, a claim for restitution made to vindicate a
                        claimant’s continuing proprietary interest in a benefit transferred to
                        a defendant. [emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">What then are these policy considerations and when do they override?
                    As examples, Professor Bant suggests two areas of law (at 210):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For example, as we saw earlier, allowing the change of position defence in
                        cases where the claimant’s action is based on their vested proprietary
                        right to the benefit (such as claims of conversion, or claims to vindicate a
                        pre-existing property right) may be regarded as undermining the law’s
                        traditional protection of proprietary rights. Likewise, the overriding need
                        to deter breaches of fiduciary duty may preclude the application of the
                        defence, even where the breaching fiduciary acted with the best of
                        intentions and ignorant of their breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">She concludes accordingly:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the absence of clear evidence of a shift in judicial attitude to the
                        balance of policy interests in these cases, it would be premature to say
                        that the change of position defence should apply to these kinds of claims.
                            <em>This conclusion does not mean that the defence can
                            never apply in respect of claims for restitution for wrongs, merely that
                            each category of wrong must be individually examined to determine
                            whether permitting the defence would undermine or stultify the
                            law’s prohibition</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I agree. I do not take the view that there
                    should be a blanket ban on the defence of change of position applying to all
                    cases of restitution for wrongs. Where the wrong involves some moral turpitude,
                    the defence would ordinarily not apply in any case because such a defendant
                    cannot be said to have acted in good faith. Where there is no moral turpitude,
                    but the wrong involved is one which the law has prescribed the remedy for a
                    particular policy reason, then the defence also ought not to apply, but this is
                    a question to be determined when each particular case arises to be
                    decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the present case, I do not see why the
                    defence should not apply to a restitutionary claim for trespass to land. If the
                    case is one where the defendant displayed some moral turpitude, such as if he
                    committed the wrongful occupation with knowledge of and blatant disregard for
                    the rights of the proprietor of the land, the defence would ordinarily fail for
                    want of good faith. However, I do not think that there is any overriding policy
                    rationale requiring the remedying of the wrong of trespass to land with the
                    award of restitutionary damages that would be stultified by the application of
                    the defence of change of position to it. I am therefore of the view that the
                    defence of change of position is applicable to a claim in trespass to land where
                    the damages sought are of a restitutionary nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Does the defence of change of position apply in the present
                case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is not disputed between the parties that
                    during the period of December 2008 to March 2011,
                    I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net paid a monthly sum of $9,000 to Razali. This
                    sum amounted to a total of $252,000 being what it thought was rent for 28
                    months. In addition to this, I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net paid to Razali
                    a sum of $18,000 being what it thought constituted security deposit of 2
                    months’ rent. From Dr Kaushik’s point of view, he was entitled to
                    have his employer I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net pay for the lease of his
                    accommodation in Singapore, such entitlement being his right under his
                    employment contract. Does, therefore, the fact of the payment of these sums
                    amount to a change of position by Dr Kaushik such as to disentitle the Plaintiff
                    to the restitutionary damages it is trying to claim in respect of the wrongful
                    occupation? For convenience, the elements of the defence as set out in <em>De Beers</em> are set out as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     the person enriched had changed his
                        position;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        change was <em>bona fide</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a>(c)     it would be inequitable to require the
                        person enriched to make restitution or to make restitution in
                    full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Needless to say, there is a requirement of a
                    causative link between the receipt of the gain (or benefit in kind) in question
                    and the change of position. In <em>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken
                        AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and
                        another and another suit</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 788 at [329]
                    (upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeal), Belinda Ang J held that the causative
                    test is a “but for” test: the defendant needs to satisfy the court
                    that but for the receipt of the benefit, it would not have changed its position.
                    I am satisfied that the causative test is met in this case. The evidence is
                    clear that resulting from the receipt of the benefit in question, that is, the
                    benefit of living in the Property, Dr Kaushik directed his employer
                        I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net to pay a sum of $9,000 to Razali each
                    month. Paraphrased, while Dr Kaushik had benefitted from his occupation of
                    the Property, his position changed when his entitlement to having his
                    accommodation paid for by I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net was exhausted. By
                    directing I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net to pay the $9,000 monthly rent,
                    albeit to the fraudster Razali, Dr Kaushik can be said to be exhausting his
                    right under his employment contract. If not for the fact that he had enjoyed the
                    benefit of living in the Property, he would not have so directed the company.
                    The causative test is therefore plainly satisfied. In respect of the
                    Plaintiff’s claim for damages for trespass to land for Dr Kaushik’s
                    wrongful occupation of the Property for the period of December 2008 to March
                    2011, I find that Dr Kaushik had changed his position by causing his company to
                    pay the sum of $9,000 monthly to Razali.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Plaintiff denies that Dr Kaushik in
                    changing his position had done so in good faith. The Plaintiff pointed me to the
                        <em>Seagate Technology</em>, where the Court of Appeal
                    (at [32]–[34]), in considering the meaning of good faith in the context of
                    the present defence, first accepted that knowledge of the facts entitling the
                    plaintiff to restitution would bring the defendant’s <em>bona fides</em> into question, thus disentitling him from relying on
                    the defence. Then, the Court of Appeal drew reference from the different degrees
                    of knowledge a defendant may have, and adopted Millett J’s analysis in
                        <em>Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson</em>
                    [1990] Ch 265 (“<em>Agip
                    (Africa)</em>”), a case on accessory liability for breach of trust,
                    that “the true distinction is between honesty and dishonesty”. I
                    agree that dishonesty would be a state of mind which would disqualify a
                    defendant from relying on the change of position defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     However, the meaning of
                    “dishonesty” in the law of accessory liability for breach of
                    trust, or what is now known as dishonest assistance, was a matter of some
                    controversy and turbulence for some time. Following <em>Agip
                        (Africa)</em>, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decided
                        <em>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan</em> [1995]
                    2 AC 378 in which the meaning of dishonesty was explored.
                    Subsequently, in <em>Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley and
                        Others</em> [2002] 2 AC 164 (“<em>Twinsectra</em>”), the meaning of dishonesty was thrown into
                    further confusion, when Lord Hutton held (at 172) that test for dishonesty
                    was a “combined test” which has both an objective and a subjective
                    element, “and which requires that before there can be a finding of
                    dishonesty it must be established that the defendant’s conduct was
                        <em>dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and
                        honest people</em> and that <em>he himself realised
                        that by those standards his conduct was dishonest</em>”
                    [emphasis added]. Today, the authority for what constitutes bad faith for the
                    purposes of the change of position defence is widely considered to be found in
                    the first instance judgment of Moore-Bick J in <em>Niru
                        Battery Manufacturing Co v Milestone Trading Ltd (No 1)</em> [2002]
                    2 All ER (Comm) 705 (“<em>Niru
                        Battery</em>”) (upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Niru Battery Manufacturing Co v Milestone Trading
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 2 WLR 1415). In <em>Niru
                        Battery</em>, the claimants, Bank Sepah Iran and its customer Niru
                    Battery paid the defendant bank Credit Agricole Indosuez US$5.8m under a
                    documentary credit where a false bill of lading had been presented. Moore-Bick J
                    found that the defendant bank’s manager, one Mr Francis, must have at
                    least had strong suspicion that the there was a mistake in the money being paid
                    to it. Nevertheless, Mr Francis paid the money away without making any further
                    enquiries. The question thus arose whether the defendant bank had paid the money
                    away in good faith for the purposes of the change of position defence. Counsel
                    for the defendant bank in <em>Niru Battery</em> argued that
                    a lack of good faith meant the same as dishonesty, and so the <em>Twinsectra</em> test should apply. In other words, the defendant
                    should be entitled to the defence unless he has acted in a way which <em>he knows</em> ordinary people would regard as dishonest,
                        <em>ie</em> comprising a subjective element. Given the
                    subjective element in the test of dishonesty in <em>Twinsectra</em>, Moore-Bick J held that a lack of good faith for the
                    purposes of the change of position defence must encompass more than dishonesty
                    in the <em>Twinsectra</em> sense, and explained (at
                    [135]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of these observations, and having regard to the nature of the
                        principles underlying the right to restitution in the case of a mistaken
                        payment and the defence of change of position, I do not think that
                        dishonesty in the sense identified in <em>Twinsectra Ltd v
                            Yardley</em> is the sole criterion of the right to invoke the
                        defence of change of position. I do not think that it is desirable to
                        attempt to define the limits of good faith; it is a broad concept, the
                        definition of which, insofar as it is capable of definition at all, will
                        have to be worked out through the cases. <em>In my view it is
                            capable of embracing a failure to act in a commercially acceptable way
                            and sharp practice of a kind that falls short of outright dishonesty as
                            well as dishonesty itself.</em> ... Where he knows that the
                        payment he has received was made by mistake, the position is quite
                        straightforward: he must return it. ... Greater difficulty may arise,
                        however, in cases where the payee has grounds for believing that the payment
                        may have been made by mistake, but cannot be sure. In such cases good faith
                        may well dictate that an enquiry be made of the payer. The nature and extent
                        of the enquiry called for will, of course, depend on the circumstances of
                        the case, but <em>I do not think that a person who has, or
                            thinks he has, good reason to believe that the payment was made by
                            mistake will often be found to have acted in good faith if he pays the
                            money away without first making enquiries of the person from whom he
                            received it</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Since the decisions in <em>Twinsectra</em> and <em>Niru Battery</em>, the
                    meaning of dishonesty in the context of liability for dishonest assistance has
                    been clarified by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <em>Barlow Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) v Eurotrust
                        International Ltd</em> [2006] 1 All ER 333 (“<em>Barlow Clowes</em>”). In particular, Lord Hoffmann made clear
                    that the test was an objective one, and one which does not require the defendant
                    to have “reflections about what [the] normally acceptable standards
                    were”. This largely objective test has been accepted by the Singapore
                    Court of Appeal in <em>George Raymond Zage III and another v Ho
                        Chi Kwong and another</em> [2010] 2 SLR 589 (“<em>George Raymond Zage III</em>”) at [22], and the test
                    for dishonesty is simply that “for a defendant to be liable for knowing
                    assistance, he must have such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the
                    transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of
                    standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query
                    them”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In light of the clarification in <em>Barlow Clowes</em>, I am of the view that the meaning of lack
                    of good faith as elucidated by Moore-Bick J in <em>Niru
                        Battery</em> is in fact not inconsistent with the meaning of
                    dishonesty for the purposes of liability for dishonest assistance for breach of
                    trust. For that reason, I will adopt the <em>Barlow
                        Clowes</em> definition of dishonesty (as accepted in <em>George Raymond Zage III</em>) for the test of good faith for
                    the change of position defence. A defendant will be held to have had a lack of
                    good faith if he acts in a commercially unacceptable way, and such behaviour is
                    made out if he fails to query the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that
                    ordinary honest people would so query.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Plaintiff suggests that Dr Kaushik in
                    causing his company to pay the moneys to Razali had not acted in good faith
                    mainly, because, it says, being a “streetwise and experienced corporate
                    professional”, he ought to have done more checks into who Razali really
                    was. I do not accept that Dr Kaushik’s conduct in the present case
                    amounted to bad faith so as to disentitle him from relying on the defence. In
                    the present case, it was far from patently obvious that Razali was a fraudster,
                    therefore, Dr Kaushik’s failure to do further checks which perhaps would
                    have revealed Razali’s fraud cannot be said to fall short of the standards
                    of ordinary honest people. In fact, Dr Kaushik could be said to have met the
                    standards of honest and reasonable men when he performed searches on the
                    Property and insisted that the Tenancy Agreement be signed by Madam Ching
                    herself, notwithstanding that it turned out that Razali forged the signature.
                    Although it is possible to verify the signature by requesting for and checking
                    against documents filed with the Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority
                    where directors’ signatures would appear, I do not think that that the law
                    expects an honest and reasonable individual consumer such as Dr Kaushik to
                    undertake such an extensive inquiry. Dr Kaushik had also requested a letter of
                    authorisation from the landlord from Razali before agreeing to pay the monthly
                    rent to him. Dr Kaushik honestly believed that he had obtained a valid lease
                    from the Plaintiff. With hindsight, Dr Kaushik perhaps should have visited the
                    Plaintiff at its registered office and verified the letter of authorisation or
                    he should have called up the Plaintiff’s office number to check with
                    another person, who is not Razali, as to whether the lease was a valid lease
                    granted by the Plaintiff. At its highest, all that Dr Kaushik’s conduct
                    can be described as is a suggestion that he was negligent. Negligent or careless
                    conduct does not amount to dishonesty, even applying an objective test. I do not
                    think that Dr Kaushik’s conduct in the circumstances amounted to bad
                    faith. In any case, the authorities also confirm that a defendant’s
                    negligence is generally regarded as irrelevant to the availability of the change
                    of position defence: see <em>Dextra Bank &amp; Trust Co Ltd v
                        Bank of Jamaica</em> [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 193 at [45].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the result, I am satisfied that Dr Kaushik
                    had changed his position as a result of the benefit he received from occupying
                    the Property for the period of December 2008 to March 2011. He had done so when
                    he caused I<sup>2</sup>MS.Net to pay a monthly sum of $9,000 to
                    Razali, such payment being his entitlement under his employment contract with
                    the company. His position changed from being entitled to accommodation under his
                    employment contract to having exhausted that entitlement through the payment of
                    $9,000 for what he thought was a valid lease with the Plaintiff for the
                    Property. He had also done so in good faith. Dr Kaushik was as much a victim of
                    Razali’s fraud as the Plaintiff was. Given all the circumstances, I am of
                    the view that it would be inequitable to require Dr Kaushik make restitution to
                    the Plaintiff for the occupation of the Property for the said period.
                    Accordingly, although Dr Kaushik is liable in trespass to land for the wrongful
                    occupation of the Property from December 2008 to March 2011, the Plaintiff is
                    not entitled to any restitutionary damages for this period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As to Dr Kaushik’s occupation of the
                    Property from April to September 2011, he is not entitled to rely on the change
                    of position defence. For this period, any monies which were paid were in fact
                    paid to the Plaintiff. In any event, by this time, Dr Kaushik had become aware
                    of the fraud of Razali, and so having such knowledge, even if there was a change
                    of position, it cannot be considered to have been a <em>bona
                        fide</em> change of position. Neither can he rely on the $18,000 being
                    the 2 months’ deposit he had paid to Razali in December 2008. There was no
                    causative link between the payment of these deposit moneys to Razali in December
                    2008 and the benefit received in the period of April to September 2011. The
                    defence does not apply. The Plaintiff is entitled to the market rent for Dr
                    Kaushik’s wrongful occupation of the Property during this period of 6
                    months: such market rent amounts to $54,000. However, in respect of this
                    $54,000, Dr Kaushik has already paid this sum to the Plaintiff (see [14] above).
                    As confirmed by Mr Balasubramaniam, the Plaintiff will give Dr Kaushik credit
                    for this payment. Dr Kaushik consequently has already made restitution and does
                    not remain liable to the Plaintiff for anything.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     There also remains Dr Kaushik’s
                    occupation of the Property from 1 October 2011 to 6 October 2011 when he
                    returned the keys to the Plaintiff. For Dr Kaushik’s occupation of the
                    Property during this period, being a period of 5 days, he is also not entitled
                    to rely on the defence of change of position. Neither has he already paid any
                    money to the Plaintiff for this period of 5 days for which he should now be
                    given credit. To this extent, Dr Kaushik is liable to the Plaintiff in damages
                    amounting to the market rent (at $9,000 per month) for these 5 days. This
                    amounts to $1,451.61.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The tort of trespass to land is a tort which
                    is actionable <em>per se</em>; damage need not be proven
                    for the tort to be made out. Accordingly, I find that Dr Kaushik had committed
                    the tort of trespass to land during the entire relevant period. However, for the
                    reasons I have stated, I hold that he is only liable in damages to the Plaintiff
                    in the sum of $1,451.61 and interest thereon. I will hear parties on costs if
                    these cannot be agreed.</p>
