        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a claim by Sum Yue Holdings Pte Ltd
                    (“the plaintiff”) for conspiracy and breach of their duties as
                    directors and/or employees, against its two former directors Justin Foo
                    (“Justin” who is the first defendant) and Bob Lim
                    (“Bob” who is the sixth defendant) and its three former employees
                    Theresa Ang (“Theresa” who is the second defendant), Richard Lim
                    (“Richard” who is the fourth defendant and the son of Bob) and
                    Peter Lim (“Peter” who is the fifth defendant).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff also sued Latrade Automation Pte
                    Ltd (the “third defendant”) for participating in the conspiracy
                    and for concealing its receipt of payments amounting to $225,720 from Sam Hui
                    Engineering Works and Service for a project. It was the plaintiff’s case
                    that the third defendant was incorporated by Justin and Theresa with the
                    expectation that existing jobs which were being carried out by the plaintiff as
                    well as new jobs to be awarded, would be transferred to the third defendant. The
                    first to sixth defendants will be referred to collectively as “the
                    defendants” or “the six defendants” henceforth where
                    appropriate. Sam Hui Engineering Works and Service is the seventh defendant and
                    is a sole-proprietorship of one Chow Chee Meng (“Chow”).
                    Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants had conspired to cause
                    loss to the plaintiff by terminating an agreement that the plaintiff had with
                    Chow for the supply and installation of hot air ducting for a company in Jurong
                    called Techno Glass Singapore Pte Ltd (“the NH Glass project”) and
                    transferring that project to the third defendant. The plaintiff claimed against
                    Chow for damages for breach of contract and for dishonest assistance in the
                    breaches by Justin and Bob of their fiduciary duties and in conspiracy. The
                    plaintiff further sued the defendants for causing it to purchase $124,564.83
                    worth of materials when the materials were not meant for the plaintiff’s
                    use but which were used by the third defendant in the NH Glass
                project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the material time, the three shareholders of
                    the plaintiff were Justin, Lim Men See (“Lim”) and Sum Yue
                    Electrical Industries Pte Ltd (“SYEI”). Lim was at the material
                    time and is still, the managing-director of the plaintiff. The shareholders of
                    SYEI were Lim and Bob.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff’s claim essentially arose
                    from a purchase order no. 05-0001 (“the PO”) dated 4 January 2005
                    in the sum of $300,000 issued by Chow to the plaintiff for the NH Glass project.
                    The NH Glass project was essentially Justin’s
                responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According to Lim’s affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), on 7 January 2005, the plaintiff
                    rendered invoice SYH 2100 for $75,000 to Chow for 25% down payment on the NH
                    Glass project. Chow paid the invoice on 10 January 2005. Thereafter, the
                    plaintiff made preparations for carrying out the NH Glass project. On
                    13 January 2005, it placed an order with Sim Lee Seng for installation of
                    metal ducting and dismantling of an existing cooling tower for which it made a
                    down payment of $15,000. Between 24 January 2005 and 5 May 2005, the
                    plaintiff ordered materials from ESAB Asia Pacific Pte Ltd totalling
                    $124,564.83.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 31 March 2005, Chow wrote to the
                    plaintiff to say he had cancelled the PO (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above) (“the cancellation letter”) due to
                    “unsatisfactory work progress” and that he had appointed other
                    contractors to take over the NH Glass project. It was the plaintiff’s case
                    that the cancellation letter was not prepared by Chow but by Justin who then
                    brought it to Chow and procured Chow’s signature on the document. On the
                    same day, Justin wrote to Chow to confirm the third defendant would take over
                    the NH Glass project for $225,000. On the same day too, Justin resigned from the
                    plaintiff’s employment. Justin’s last day of work with the plaintiff
                    was 30 April 2005 but he remained a director and shareholder of the
                    plaintiff until July 2005 (according to Justin) while the plaintiff contended
                    that he was a director until 27 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It was also the plaintiff’s case that
                    notwithstanding the cancellation letter, the plaintiff continued to purchase
                    materials (with the approval of Justin and Bob) for and its employees continued
                    to work on, the NH Glass project even after 31 March 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff alleged that the third defendant
                    issued invoices to and received payments from Chow even before 31 March
                    2005. In particular, the third defendant issued an invoice no. 238801/05 for
                    $20,000 on 11 March 2005 to Chow who made payment to the plaintiff which
                    payment was received by Justin. The plaintiff claimed that it then paid Justin
                    $20,000 on 28 March 2005 supposedly to reimburse Justin for paying the said
                    sum on its behalf. Thus, the plaintiff alleged, Justin received double payment.
                    On 17 March 2005, the third defendant issued invoice no. 238802/05 to Chow
                    for 30% progress payment amounting to $90,000. Chow paid Justin who received it
                    not for the plaintiff but on the third defendant’s behalf for the third
                    defendant’s invoice no. 238802/05.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 13 April 2005, Justin and Chow attended
                    a meeting with representatives of NH Glass. At the meeting, Justin signed
                    minutes on behalf of the plaintiff, which minutes included an agreement that the
                    plaintiff and Chow would follow a schedule of works agreed that day, failing
                    which NH Glass could impose penalty charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff further alleged that the third
                    defendant was incorporated (on 23 February 2005) while its two shareholders
                    cum directors Justin and Theresa were still working for the plaintiff and while
                    Justin was still a director and shareholder of the plaintiff. Together with
                    Richard and Bob, Justin had joined the plaintiff in January 2004 while Theresa
                    and Peter joined in November 2004. (Bob ceased to be a director of the plaintiff
                    in December 2006).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff alleged that although the third
                    defendant’s registered address was at No. 10, Admiralty Street #03-74,
                    North Link Building, Singapore 757695, it conducted its business at the
                    plaintiff’s premises at No. 4 Soon Lee Road, Singapore 628071 (“the
                    plaintiff’s premises”). The third defendant only shifted out from
                    the plaintiff’s premises on 28 November 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff further alleged that Justin,
                    Theresa, Richard, Peter and Bob conducted their business since 28 July
                    2004using the computer systems and/or work stations of the plaintiff and had
                    communicated with the third defendant and the seventh defendant in relation to
                    the NH Glass project and/or with third parties and potential customers and
                    suppliers in order to cause harm, loss and damage to the plaintiff. Further, the
                    plaintiff claimed, the same five defendants used the plaintiff’s computer
                    facilities to promote and siphon off the plaintiff’s business to the third
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff claimed that after the departure
                    of Justin, Theresa, Richard, Peter and Bob from the plaintiff’s
                    employment, it discovered that the five defendants had removed the hard disks
                    from the computer systems and rendered the computers inoperable. Lim lodged a
                    police report over the incident on 9 December 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff/Lim suspected the five
                    defendants were involved in a conspiracy with Chow or had acted in breach of
                    their fiduciary duties and obligations in order to promote the business of the
                    third defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     To gather evidence of the misdeeds of the
                    defendants, the plaintiff engaged the services of a company called I-Analysis
                    Pte Ltd (“I-Analysis”) to conduct a digital forensic investigation
                    of the plaintiff’s computer hard disks in November 2006. I-Analysis
                    rendered a report after its investigations and its director Darren Cerasi
                    (“Cerasi”) testified for the plaintiff. I-Analysis was also tasked
                    by the plaintiff to verify the authenticity of two letters dated 26 April
                    2005 (“the April letter”) and 16 May 2005 (“the May
                    letter”) which Bob as its director, had written on behalf of the
                    plaintiff to Justin. In the April letter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, Bob had purportedly requested Justin to
                    stay on with the plaintiff until he completed its existing projects. In the May
                        letter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, Bob had said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further to our request for your extension of stay, we would like to
                        clearly specify that we have no objection to allow you to carry out your
                        businesses at our premises during the periods of extension of stay with
                        us</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Cerasi considered the two letters “questionable in the
                    content” and pointed to unusual features in the same. I shall return to
                    his comment when I consider Cerasi’s testimony later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Not surprisingly, the former employees and/or
                    directors and/or shareholders of the plaintiff had a different version from Lim
                    of the events that transpired before they left the plaintiff’s
                    employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Justin, the first defendant was the only
                    witness for his and the case of the third defendant. His testimony was also
                    adopted by the second to sixth defendants. Consequently, I turn now to look at
                    his testimony. In his AEIC, Justin pointed out that he was a minority
                    shareholder holding only 10 shares in the plaintiff. Prior to joining the
                    plaintiff, Justin (with Bob and Peter) was a shareholder/director of Sum Yue
                    Instrumentation Engineering Pte Ltd (“SY Instrumentation”) between
                    1999 and 2004. SY Instrumentation undertook projects that were similar to those
                    of the plaintiff. SY Instrumentation was wound up in 2006. SY
                    Instrumentation’s projects were transferred to the plaintiff in January
                    2004. Projects from Sum Yue Engineering Pte Ltd (“SY Engineering”)
                    a company owned by Bob and Peter, were transferred to SYEI some time in February
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Bob and Lim invited Justin to join the
                    plaintiff in 2003. Justin was in charge of the plaintiff’s mechanical
                    projects which included customers such as SIS 88 Pte Ltd (“SIS”)
                    and Chow. Justin was assisted by Richard in these projects. These customers were
                    his customers even before Justin joined the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In March 2004, Justin was tasked to take over
                    the administration of the plaintiff and SYEI. The request was minuted at a
                    meeting held on 27 March 2004 and announced by Bob. In June 2004, Justin
                    was asked to merge the administration of the two entities. Towards that end,
                    Justin called a general meeting on 13 August 2004 that was attended <em>inter alia</em> by Lim, Ronald Lee Lim Sim
                    (‘Ronald”), Bob, Peter and Theresa; Justin presented a flowchart
                    with his proposal to merge the administrative operations of the two companies.
                    Theresa was tasked with recording the minutes of meetings and did so for these
                    and other meetings. However, Lim refused to accept the accuracy of the minutes
                    as recorded by her which he did not sign.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Although customers were invoiced and paid for
                    the projects taken over from SY Instrumentation and SY Engineering, Justin and
                    the other defendants working for the plaintiff were told by Angie Ang
                    (“Angie”), an employee of SYEI, that SYEI and the plaintiff were
                    purportedly making losses on those projects. At the meeting on 13 August
                    2004, Justin had asked Angie for the accounts and financial statement of SYEI
                    and the plaintiff to enable him do the merger and to verify if indeed they were
                    making losses on the projects inherited from SY Instrumentation and SY
                    Engineering but she refused. He also wanted to verify what he discovered in the
                    course of running the plaintiff – the plaintiff handled projects and paid
                    for materials and labour on behalf of SYEI but it was SYEI that invoiced
                    customers and collected payments from them. When Justin raised his objections to
                    Lim on this practice, his objections were overruled as Lim was the majority
                    shareholder of both the plaintiff and SYEI. Lim felt it was unnecessary for the
                    plaintiff to invoice SYEI as it would incur more goods and services
                tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Ultimately, Justin’s proposal to merge
                    the administrative operations of the plaintiff and SYEI was rejected by Lim and
                    Ronald at a meeting held on 21 September 2004. Ronald said the proposal was
                    not workable as the staff of the two companies could not work together due to
                    disagreements. From then on until December 2004, Justin’s relationship
                    with Lim steadily deteriorated, exacerbated by Justin’s request for and
                    Lim’s refusal to provide, the accounts of SYEI and the plaintiff. Lim
                    began withholding payments to the plaintiff’s suppliers and contractors
                    for on-going projects under Justin’s charge by refusing to sign cheques
                    for payments approved by Justin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It would be appropriate at this juncture to
                    describe the role of Ronald in this dispute. It was the defendants’ case
                    (but denied by Lim and Ronald) that Ronald was a majority shareholder in the
                    plaintiff despite the fact that his name did not appear as such in the
                    shareholders’ register of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In his AEIC, Justin deposed that Ronald took
                    part in management decisions of the plaintiff and would attend most if not all,
                    meetings of the board of directors, shareholders and management. Important
                    correspondence would also be copied to him. Justin deposed that Ronald was (and
                    still is) the general manager of Singapore Epson Industrial Pte Ltd
                    (“Epson”) for about 20 years up to 2004, during which period he
                    awarded projects to SYEI. He pointed out that Ronald was at the
                    plaintiff’s premises everyday and even kept two dogs there. Indeed, Ronald
                    even had a ‘karaoke’ room at the plaintiff’s premises besides
                    a kennel for his dogs. I note that Lim himself testified that the plaintiff
                    purchased its premises from Epson (in June 2002 for $700,000) after being
                    approached by Ronald. Ronald who was a witness (PW3) for the plaintiff <em>inter alia</em> denied he was involved in the plaintiff and
                    that he attended any meetings of the plaintiff as recorded in minutes taken by
                    Theresa. I will refer to Ronald’s testimony later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     At a meeting held on 7 January 2005
                    attended by Justin, Richard, Bob, Peter and Theresa, Bob informed the attendees
                    that Lim wanted Justin to cease getting business for the plaintiff and that
                    Justin should set up his own company if he wanted to continue doing
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This cessation of business was subsequently
                    confirmed by Lim to Justin who was told that he should stop work on projects
                    under Justin’s charge including the NH Glass project. Justin conveyed
                    Lim’s message to Bob, Peter and Richard at a meeting held on
                    28 January 2005. According to Justin, this prompted his resignation on
                    31 March 2005. Although his last day with the plaintiff was on
                    30 April 2005, Bob and Peter requested Justin to remain with the plaintiff
                    until Justin had completed all the on-going projects under his charge. Justin
                    agreed on condition that he could rent a space at the plaintiff’s premises
                    to carry on his own business to which Bob and Peter agreed. This resulted in the
                    April and May letters (see above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>)
                    from Bob which authenticity as stated earlier, was questioned by the
                    plaintiff’s expert I-Analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There then followed another round of meetings
                    (again denied by Lim) between 3 and 27 June 2005 at which (according to the
                    defendants) the following matters were raised (and recorded in minutes prepared
                    by Theresa save for the minutes of a meeting on 3 June 2005 which the
                    defendants claimed were recorded by Angie):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim furnished information on the
                        plaintiff’s outstanding loans, overdrafts with banks and its
                        overheads;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim
                        and Ronald said that since the plaintiff had incurred too many liabilities,
                        it would cease business with effect from 30 June
                    2005;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        plaintiff’s building would be sold;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     the termination dates (with payment of salaries)
                        for the plaintiff’s employees Richard, Ah San and Zaw Tun would be
                        30 June, 31 August and 31 August 2005
                    respectively;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     Lim
                        said that if Justin or Peter decided to continue doing the same business as
                        the plaintiff, they should incorporate new companies to do so on condition
                        that the new companies’ registered address was not at the
                        plaintiff’s premises;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_f"></a>(f)     meanwhile, Justin and Peter could rent space from the
                        plaintiff within its building for their new companies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_g"></a>(g)     Justin proposed a buy-over of the
                        plaintiff’s existing welding sets at prices to be agreed with Lim;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_h"></a>(h)     Justin
                        indicated he would move out from the plaintiff’s premises by mid-July
                        2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Justin then received a note dated 4 July
                    2005 from Lim requesting him to make arrangements to redirect all correspondence
                    of the third defendant away from the plaintiff’s premises. On the same
                    day, Theresa received a separate letter from Lim requesting that the suppliers
                    bill the third defendant with effect from 1 July 2005. Angie also requested
                    for Theresa to transfer telephone and facsimile lines and servers from the
                    plaintiff’s to the third defendant’s name. Lim asked for
                    Peter’s proposal on renting space for the third defendant at the
                    plaintiff’s premises and he inquired whether the third defendant would
                    want to acquire the plaintiff’s two lorries. Finally, Lim requested that
                    termination letters be issued to the plaintiff’s staff to take effect on
                    30 June 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Peter responded to Lim’s inquiries by a
                    memorandum dated 5 July 2005 to say that the third defendant would purchase
                    one of the plaintiff’s lorries and that the company was agreeable to rent
                    space from the plaintiff at $4,000 per month. Peter requested an invoice for
                    $3,750 from the plaintiff for rent for the previous month. The third defendant
                    eventually did not pay any rent to the plaintiff as the plaintiff did not render
                    any invoice. Another reason for the third defendant’s non-payment of rent
                    to the plaintiff was the fact that the third defendant had rendered invoices
                    approximating $42,277.20 to the plaintiff for work done for projects of SYEI
                    between October 2005 and January 2006 which Lim refused to
                acknowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     There were on-going discussions between Lim
                    and the defendants on how to deal with the sending of invoices to and the
                    collection of payments from, customers. One issue revolved around the payment by
                    Chow to the plaintiff of the deposit of $75,000 for the NH Glass project.
                    Justin, Peter and Bob decided that the plaintiff would continue with and
                    complete the fabrication work for the NH Glass project up to the down payment
                    stage. Justin pointed out that a portion of the $124,564.83 allegedly spent by
                    the plaintiff on materials and subcontractors for the NH Glass project was used
                    for another project <em>viz</em> the SIS project. He
                    deposed that Richard and he had no choice but to use for the SIS project,
                    materials initially acquired for the NH Glass project as Lim refused to pay the
                    plaintiff’s suppliers and contractors causing difficulties for the third
                    defendant and resulting in complaints from both NH Glass and SIS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Without any prior warning, the defendants then
                    received Lim’s letter dated 18 July 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> requiring them to leave the
                    plaintiff’s premises immediately or else face action for trespass. The
                    defendants were required to hand all the plaintiff’s documents to Angie
                    and were reminded not to remove any documents from the plaintiff’s
                    premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On the following day, the plaintiff’s
                    workshop was secured by additional locks and chains. Save for Bob, the other
                    defendants were denied entry. Justin and Bob wrote to Lim immediately to explain
                    that such action would cause harm to the plaintiff and seriously disrupt its
                    on-going projects. They requested that the plaintiff’s operations be
                    allowed to continue until end July 2005 if its projects could not be completed
                    by 30 June 2005. Their request was ignored by Lim who did not reply to
                    their letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, shortly thereafter, Lim allowed
                    Peter, Bob and Theresa to return to the plaintiff’s premises to assist in
                    the on-going projects until some time in November 2005. As part of the
                    winding-down of the plaintiff’s operations, two projects <em>viz</em> Temptech Pte Ltd and Powder Coating Engineering Pte
                    Ltd were transferred to Peter on or about 28 July 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Although the third defendant was incorporated
                    on 23 February 2005, Justin said it only commenced operations on
                    1 April 2005. Initially, the third defendant’s registered address was
                    at No. 6 Bloxhome Drive Singapore 559702, before being changed to No. 10,
                    Admiralty Street #03-74, North Link Building, Singapore 757695. Contrary to the
                    plaintiff’s case and to Lim’s accusations, Justin contended that the
                    third defendant conducted its business openly and with the full knowledge of the
                    plaintiff/Lim. This was pursuant to the understanding that Justin, Bob and Peter
                    had reached with Lim and Ronald.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In support of his assertion. Justin pointed
                    out that between 1 April and 18 July 2005, the third defendant sent
                    out correspondence, invoices, quotations and delivery orders as well as received
                    such documents from third parties at the plaintiff’s premises. It also met
                    its customers at the plaintiff’s premises. Justin pointed out that save
                    for a few, the third defendant’s customers were different from the
                    plaintiff’s. The common customers were Justin’s even before he
                    joined the plaintiff. In fact, the plaintiff had only one customer (Epson) when
                    Justin joined the plaintiff. Its customers in 2004 and 2005 were either
                    Justin’s or Bob’s and Peter’s customers from SY
                    Engineering.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for the NH Glass project, Justin explained
                    that because of Lim’s obstructive behaviour in withholding payments for
                    projects under his charge, Justin experienced great difficulties with his
                    customers including Chow, from whom the plaintiff received a warning letter on
                    1 April 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. Chow
                    had also threatened to sue the plaintiff for delay in the NH Glass project and
                    to impose a penalty of 10% of the contract value or $30,000 for each day of
                    delay. Justin managed to persuade Chow to withhold legal action by his offer to
                    have the third defendant take over the project. This resulted in the issuance of
                    the cancellation letter (see above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>)
                    and the third defendant’s agreement to take over the project on the same
                    day (31 March 2005). Otherwise the plaintiff would have faced a huge claim
                    for damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Justin accused the plaintiff of bad faith. He
                    referred to the plaintiff’s financial report for 2007 which stated that
                    the plaintiff’s premises were sold for $1.8m. However, he and the other
                    defendants did not know what Lim had done with the sale proceeds. Justin pointed
                    out that the plaintiff’s premises were its main asset against which the
                    defendants would have recourse to for their costs. He revealed that the
                    plaintiff failed to pay the salaries of its employees for June 2005 when their
                    services were terminated. Although Lim had requested Peter to advance the sum on
                    the plaintiff’s behalf, promising to reimburse Peter from collections made
                    by the plaintiff, Lim did not honour his word. Peter in turn borrowed money from
                    the third defendant to make payment. The third defendant paid approximately
                    $46,000 to the plaintiff’s employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Justin further noted from the
                    plaintiff’s financial statements for 2007 that the company consistently
                    made losses for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. It was only in 2007 that the
                    company turned in a profit. It was clear from the said accounts that the
                    plaintiff disposed of all its property, plant and equipment before commencing
                    this action in January 2008. Justin believed this was done by Lim intentionally
                    in order to deprive the defendants of their costs should the plaintiff fail in
                    its action. (This fear has been allayed by an order for security for costs in
                    favour of the six defendants [see [47 below]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At the end of 2006, Lim removed Bob as a
                    director of both the plaintiff and SYEI, despite Bob’s objections. Lim
                    then appointed his wife Wong Jit Yan (“Lim’s wife”) and his
                    son Lim Daw Seng (“Lim’s son”) as directors of both
                    companies. Lim further changed the cheque signatories of the plaintiff so that
                    he alone could sign cheques for amounts in excess of $20,000 while Lim’s
                    wife and Lim’s son could sign cheques for lesser sums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Justin denied the plaintiff’s allegation
                    that the six defendants had removed the hard disks from the plaintiff’s
                    computer systems. He deposed that neither he nor Richard had access to the
                    plaintiff’s premises after 18 July 2005 so as to be able to tamper
                    with the computers. As the plaintiff’s premises were fitted with close
                    circuit surveillance cameras, any attempts to remove the hard disks by any of
                    the defendants would have been detected in any case. There was also no reason
                    for any of the defendants to remove the hard disks as they had used the
                    computers to create the invoices and other documents of the third defendant,
                    which was done with the plaintiff’s consent. In any case, not all the
                    computers belonged to the plaintiff - some belonged to and had been transferred
                    to the plaintiff from SY Instrumentation and SY Engineering.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The last piece of evidence for the six
                    defendants’ case came from Bob. In his AEIC, Bob deposed that in September
                    2006, Ronald approached him and inquired if Bob wanted to sell his shares in
                    SYEI to Lim. In view of the differences between Lim, Justin and Bob, Ronald
                    advised that it would be better for the parties to part ways. Bob was agreeable
                    to Ronald’s suggestion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 3 October 2006, Lim’s solicitors
                    wrote to Bob’s solicitors enclosing a draft sale and purchase agreement
                    (“the draft agreement”). However, the draft agreement contained in
                    cl 7 a provision that upon completion of the sale of Bob’s shares in SYEI,
                    Bob would not have any claims against Lim and/or SYEI and /or the plaintiff. Bob
                    did not agree to cl 7. Thereafter, negotiations between Bob and Lim through
                    their respective solicitors broke down. To-date, Bob remains a shareholder of
                    SYEI. The plaintiff subsequently commenced this suit on 7 January
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I turn now to the pleadings. The statement of
                    claim was prolix to the extreme numbering 84 pages as the plaintiff set out
                    (unnecessarily) almost verbatim, the report of I-Analysis. I will not repeat the
                    plaintiff’s various heads of claim as they have been set out in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> and <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As for the defence, the first to sixth
                    defendants filed a joint defence while Chow filed his own separate defence as
                    the seventh defendant. In their joint defence, the six defendants essentially
                    denied they had breached their fiduciary duties as directors and/or their
                    employment contracts and that they had engaged in a conspiracy to harm the
                    plaintiff and/or to siphon off its business. The defendants contended that the
                    third defendant only commenced operations on 1 April 2005 notwithstanding
                    its incorporation two months earlier. They denied that the third defendant
                    operated at the plaintiff’s premises without the latter’s knowledge
                    and consent. They asserted that the third defendant conducted its business
                    openly and with the plaintiff’s knowledge at the plaintiff’s
                    premises between 1 April 2005 and 18 July 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendants alleged that the plaintiff
                    failed to pay their salaries for the month of June 2005 and that Peter had paid
                    the employees their salaries on the plaintiff’s behalf. (This complaint
                    was not pursued at the trial). The defendants admitted that Chow only dealt with
                    Justin and Richard for the NH Glass project but denied that they had conspired
                    with Chow to cause harm and/or loss to the plaintiff. The defendants pleaded
                    that the third defendant was incorporated to take over the plaintiff’s
                    projects because Lim wanted to close down the plaintiff’s operations and
                    for that reason, the third defendant took over the NH Glass
                project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In his defence, Chow disclaimed knowledge of
                    the plaintiff’s capital structure and shareholdings and averred that he
                    only dealt with Justin as a director of the plaintiff, as Justin was in charge
                    of the plaintiff’s electrical engineering works. Chow asserted that he
                    dealt with Richard, Peter and Bob as employees of the plaintiff. Chow stated he
                    was unaware that Justin ceased employment with the plaintiff on 30 June
                    2005 or that Justin was a shareholder of the third defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Chow denied he had acted in concert with the
                    six defendants to defraud and harm the plaintiff as alleged in the statement of
                    claim. Chow averred that although he paid the plaintiff`$75,000 on
                    4 January 2005, progress was slow on the NH Glass project. Justin informed
                    him in February 2005 that the plaintiff was unable to complete the NH Glass
                    project on time whereas the third defendant could do so under Justin’s
                    supervision. Justin requested that Chow terminate the plaintiff’s contract
                    and award the same to the third defendant. Out of anxiety that the NH Glass
                    project would be delayed, Chow averred that he agreed to Justin’s request
                    and issued the cancellation letter (which Justin prepared) to the plaintiff. He
                    trusted Justin totally. Chow stated he paid all invoices issued to him by the
                    third defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I should point out that by an order of court
                    dated 9 March 2009, the plaintiff was ordered to provide security for costs
                    of $60,000 to the six defendants. By another order of this court on
                    22 September 2009 (after the first part hearing in July 2009), the
                    plaintiff was ordered to provide further security of $40,000 for the costs of
                    the defendants, making a total of $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Besides Lim (PW1), Cerasi (PW2) and Ronald
                    (PW3), the plaintiff’s other four witnesses were Lim’s wife (PW4),
                    Lim’s son (PW7) as well as the plaintiff’s auditor Sashi Kala Devi
                    (“Devi”) (PW5) and one of its labour supply subcontractors Joseph
                    Lim Swee King (PW6). Each defendant testified for his/her own case and in
                    Justin’s case, he testified for the third defendant as well. As for Chow,
                    he appeared in person as his previous solicitors had discharged themselves from
                    acting for him before the trial. Chow revealed to the court that he lacked the
                    funds to pay for legal representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Lim was the key witness for the plaintiff. His
                    AEIC was lengthy, his exhibits voluminous and his cross-examination extended to
                    almost three days. His testimony was heavily criticised in the defendants’
                    closing submissions as being neither credible nor truthful nor consistent with
                    documents that were before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The other witness of the plaintiff who came in
                    for equally strong criticism by the defendants was Cerasi who was accused of
                    disregarding his duties as an independent expert under Order 40A of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed (“the Rules”). I shall
                    consider the criticism against Cerasi when I look at his testimony later.
                    Meanwhile, I turn my attention to Lim’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Having reviewed his testimony, I am of the
                    view that the defendants’ criticism of Lim (PW1) was not unwarranted. He
                    repeatedly claimed he could not recall events (until he was admonished by the
                    court), he prevaricated and often contradicted himself in the course of
                    cross-examination. Despite his assertion that Ronald was neither a shareholder
                    nor involved in the plaintiff in any way, Lim could not satisfactorily explain
                    why Ronald went to the extent of filing an affidavit on the plaintiff’s
                    behalf (on 4 February 2009 in exhibit D2) to oppose the defendants’
                    application for security for costs. In fact, Lim claimed that he did not even
                    ask Ronald to file the affidavit nor did he instruct the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors to do so. It was only after considerable pressing by the court that
                    Lim admitted he had informed Ronald of the contents of Justin’s affidavit
                    filed in support of the application. His explanation as to how Ronald was so
                    well informed on the affairs of the plaintiff as to be able to oppose the
                    application was absurd – Lim claimed that Ronald frequently visited the
                    plaintiff’s premises to play with the dogs and have meals there with the
                    defendants who asked Ronald for his ideas. Ronald thereby became familiar with
                    the company’s financial affairs (see p 22 of the defendants’
                    submissions). Ronald’s explanation for his involvement in the application
                    was that he was pulled in by Lim because he was a good friend of Lim. I should
                    point out that this “good friend” of Lim’s went so far
                    (according to the defendants’ case) as to propose at the management
                    meeting held on 27 June 2005, that the plaintiff should cease operations
                    with effect from 30 June 2005 because it was heavily in debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Lim maintained his denial that Ronald attended
                    any management meetings of the plaintiff. He took the position that the minutes
                    of such meetings prepared by the second defendant reflecting Ronald and himself
                    (named as John Lim) as attendees were fabricated. These were for meetings that
                    took place between 27 March 2004 and 27 June 2005. Ronald was recorded
                    as having attended five out of eight meetings in question. The defendants
                    pointed out that Lim could not offer any reason why the defendants would include
                    Ronald in the meetings if indeed he (as well as Lim) was not present.
                    Ronald’s surmise that the defendants bore a grudge against him because he
                    did not want to give them his project<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> was only a guess as Ronald himself
                    admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The defendants pointed out that Lim’s
                    claim that he was unaware of and did not attend the management meeting on
                    27 June 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> was even less credible because he referred to
                    the same in his letter dated 29 June 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> terminating the employment of a staff
                    member Zulkarnain Bin Said where he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is most unfortunate that we have to inform you that decisions have been
                        made to close the Engineering department during the management meeting with
                        effect from 30<sup>th</sup> JUNE 2005. The reasons due to
                        slow down in business and the company have to trim down its overhead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We hereby, wish you best of luck for all your future ventures and hope
                        that you could acquire a suitable job within the shortest period of
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lim’s subsequent letters of termination addressed to the first
                    to fifth defendants (but not the third defendant) all dated 18 July
                        2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> also referred
                    to 30 June 2005 as the termination date. The defendants submitted that the
                    words “during the management meeting” in para 1 of the above
                    letter could only have referred to the meeting held on 27 June 2005, as
                    both the minutes and the aforesaid letters referred to the same date <em>viz</em> 30 June 2005 as being the last date of
                    operations for the plaintiff’s engineering department.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In their reply dated 18 July
                        2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> to Lim’s
                    termination notice, Justin and Bob had pointed out the disruption to the
                    plaintiff’s ongoing projects and its exposure to liability if the
                    plaintiff ceased operations on 30 June 2005. They reminded Lim that
                    “at the Board Meeting on 27 June 2005, the Board of Directors had
                    decided that the Company’s operations were to continue until the end of
                    July 2005 in order for the on-going projects to be completed”. Despite
                    the reference to the management meeting on 27 June 2005 in his own letters
                    as well as in Justin’s and Bob’s letters, Lim maintained his
                    ignorance of the meeting. Neither did he question Justin or Bob on their
                    reference to the board meeting of 27 June 2005 in their reply to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Lim also claimed he did not know of the
                    existence of the third defendant until he engaged the services of I-Analysis.
                    This denial was also challenged by the defendants who pointed to Lim’s
                    note dated 4 July 2005 (see above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> to
                    Justin (copied to Bob and Peter) where he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please make the necessary arrangements for any future letters concerning
                        your company NOT to be sent to No. 4 Soon Lee Road (S) 628071.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please redirect all your letters with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Confronted with the above document in cross-examination, Lim
                        claimed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> that
                    the word “company” referred to SY Instrumentation and not to the
                    third defendant. When he was reminded by counsel for the defendants that in his
                    own AEIC (at para 10), Lim had deposed that SY Instrumentation was a failed
                    business of Justin’s, Lim’s (unconvincing) explanation was that he
                    had received letters and correspondence addressed to SY Instrumentation which,
                    when requested by counsel, he was unable to produce claiming he had handed them
                    to Justin. Pressed further by the court, Lim changed tack and said Justin could
                    well have registered the third company without operating it, despite the clear
                    words that Lim used in the note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Lim however did agree that he refused to allow
                    Justin to have sight of the management accounts of either the plaintiff or SYEI
                    because “they were not yet prepared”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It is noteworthy that
                    according to the defendants, Justin had asked for the accounts at the management
                    meeting on 13 August 2004 (which Lim and Ronald denied attending). During
                        cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>,
                    Lim had three versions of when he was told of Justin’s request for
                    accounts. First, he said he knew it was at the meeting held on 13 August
                    2004 because Justin told him about the meeting although he did not attend.
                    Later, he said that he learnt of the meeting subsequently from his staff Angie.
                    His third version was that Angie told him of Justin’s request for the
                    accounts but without mentioning any meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendant submitted that the court should
                    draw an adverse inference against the plaintiff for not calling Angie to testify
                    not only on this aspect of the testimony, but also on the minutes of the meeting
                    dated 3 June 2005 which set<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Theresa testified was not recorded
                    by her<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> but
                    was given to her by Angie. Theresa’s version of the minutes of the meeting
                    was also exhibited by the defendants. The significance of the minutes dated
                    3 June 2005 (be it Angie’s or Theresa’s version) was that it
                    recorded Justin’s request to rent space from the plaintiff. Lim had
                    admitted there was such a discussion but he claimed it took place at a
                    coffee-shop and not at the plaintiff’s premises. Leaving aside the venue
                    of the discussion which is inconsequential, Lim’s own evidence meant that
                    the plaintiff was aware that Justin was setting up a company to carry out
                    mechanical engineering projects. I should point out that Lim initially claimed
                    that Angie had left the plaintiff’s employment but retracted his testimony
                    when counsel for the defendants confronted him with the plaintiff’s letter
                    dated 14 July 2005 wherein Justin, Theresa, Peter and Bob were directed to
                    hand over all the plaintiff’s documents to Angie.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Lim explained that he did not accept the April
                    and May letters (see above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) (which
                    he described as “suspicious” and “unauthentic’ in
                    para 47 of his AEIC) because Bob did not have his authorisation to issue
                    those letters although he agreed that Justin’s last day of employment was
                    30 June 2005. In this regard, the defendants pointed out that Lim
                    contradicted his own AEIC as Lim had there (in para 46) deposed that
                    Justin’s last day with the plaintiff was 30 April 2005 and he had not
                    agreed to an extension until 30 June 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It would not be necessary to refer to other
                    aspects of Lim’s testimony as the extracts that were referred to above
                    already cast grave doubts on his credibility as a whole. I turn instead to the
                    defendants’ case as well as the case of Chow who, as will become evident
                    later, was unwittingly sued merely for awarding the NH Glass project to the
                    plaintiff prior to issuing the cancellation letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Richard corroborated Justin’s evidence
                    that Bob had announced at a meeting on 7 January 2004 that Lim wanted Justin to
                    stop all jobs of the plaintiff concerning the NH Glass project and that Justin
                    should set up his own company. Their testimony that Lim stopped paying the
                    plaintiff’s suppliers and contractors and this caused delay in the
                    progress of the NH Glass project was supported by Chow, who said the delay
                    prompted him to issue the warning letter on 1 April 2005 (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>). Because of Lim’s
                    obstructive conduct, Justin requested for the issuance of the cancellation
                    letter with Chow’s concurrence and arranged for the third defendant to
                    continue work on the NH Glass project which was eventually completed in October
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In claiming the balance $225,000 for the NH
                    Glass project, the defendants submitted that the plaintiff was in effect
                    claiming for 75% of the work which it could not and did not do, due to its
                    financial constraints and Lim’s conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The defendants pointed out that the third
                    defendant not only assumed liability for the job when it took over the NH Glass
                    project but it also assumed the obligation to pay liquidated damages for delays
                    at 10% per diem of the contract price, under its agreement dated 2 April
                    2005 with the seventh defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As for the plaintiff’s claim for
                    purchase of materials totalling $124,564.83 (referred to at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), Justin explained that not all the
                    materials were used in the NH Glass project. Some were used in the SIS project.
                    However, as Richard who was in charge of the SIS project had handed over all the
                    plaintiff’s documents for the project, the defendants could not say which
                    proportion of the materials went into the two projects. Pointedly, neither did
                    the plaintiff produce any documents to support this claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim for
                    $20,000 which it alleged was wrongly paid to the third defendant by the seventh
                    defendant, the defendants contended that this claim was baseless. The sum had
                    nothing to do with the NH Glass project as it was reimbursement by the plaintiff
                    to Justin for payment made to SLS, a subcontractor of the plaintiff, for the SIS
                    project. SLS had supplied $40,000 worth of labour to the plaintiff for the SIS
                    project. The evidence showed that the plaintiff made partial payment of $20,000
                    for the labour supplied by a cheque in favour of SLS numbered 138896<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> drawn on United Overseas
                    Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It was Justin’s testimony<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> that he borrowed the balance
                    $20,000 due to SLS from Chow which sum the plaintiff reimbursed him on
                    28 March 2005. It was also Justin’s evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that the third defendant
                    issued an invoice dated 11 March 2005 for $20,000 to the seventh defendant
                    at Chow’s request and it was backdated. Justin’s evidence was
                    corroborated by Chow.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                    Extrinsic evidence supporting Justin’s testimony was to be found in a
                    payment voucher of the plaintiff dated 28 March 2005 and the
                    plaintiff’s note to SLS dated 9 March 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> which SLS
                    countersigned as acknowledgment of payment of $20,000. In the plaintiff’s
                    note, the word “GLASS” denoting NH Glass had been cancelled and
                    replaced with the word “SUGAR” denoting SIS, while the handwritten
                    number 10481 thereon was that of the SIS project. Lim agreed with the
                    defendants’ counsel that the corrections were made by Richard. I should
                    point out that the payment voucher contained the reference number 10521 which
                    was the job number for the NH Glass project. Further, when cross-examined, Lim
                    admitted that when SLS sued the plaintiff, the latter proved it had paid $20,000
                    to SLS by tendering the payment voucher as evidence. Consequently, the plaintiff
                    implicitly accepted the defendants’ position on the payment
                    voucher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The defendants accused Lim of bad faith
                    – Lim was well aware of the true position and yet he chose to fabricate
                    this frivolous claim. The defendants pointed out that Lim relied on the third
                    defendant’s invoice to the seventh defendant dated 11 March
                        2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> as well as the
                    plaintiff’s payment voucher dated 28 March 2005 but deliberately
                    failed to disclose the plaintiff’s note to SLS dated 9 March 2005
                    until the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I shall deal with the last item of the
                    plaintiff’s claim ($90,000) that was allegedly received by the third
                    defendant from Chow on 2 April 2005 vide OCBC cheque no. 655735 when I consider
                    the testimony of Chow (see below at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The final issue in the defendants’ case
                    related to the controversial minutes that Theresa prepared but which Lim and
                    Ronald both disavowed. Theresa performed administrative functions in the
                    plaintiff’s organisation and her duty <em>inter
                        alia</em> was to assist Justin, Bob and Peter with recording of
                    minutes of meetings, preparation of quotations and delivery orders. Like the
                    other individual defendants, Theresa’s employment was terminated by the
                    plaintiff on 30 June 2006. Although she had deposed in her AEIC that the
                    plaintiff failed to pay her salary for June 2006 as well as one month’s
                    salary in lieu of notice, Theresa informed the court that she was no longer
                    pursuing those claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Theresa testified that she had prepared all
                    the minutes (save one) which recorded the attendance of Lim and Ronald. These
                    were for the meetings in (a), (b),(c),(f), (g) and (h) below. Theresa also
                    prepared the minutes of other meetings. However, she did not attend the meeting
                    in (e) but prepared the minutes based on what Justin, who attended, reported to
                    her. Theresa also received from Angie a copy of the minutes the latter had
                    prepared of the same meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 24 March 2004, Bob announced
                        that Justin would run the plaintiff’s administration department with
                        immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     On 13 August 2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Justin requested for the
                        plaintiff’s accounts and for the balance sheet to be produced at the
                        end of each month; Angie said the accounts department faced a heavy workload
                        then. (This appeared to be the excuse why Justin did not receive the
                        accounts and balance sheet subsequently).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>(c)     On 21 September 2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Ronald suggested that due
                        to differences between the staff, it was decided (presumably by him and Lim)
                        that the plaintiff and SYEI should be managed separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_d"></a>(d)     On 7 January 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>, Bob reported that Lim
                        wanted him to inform Justin that the latter should stop getting new orders
                        from the plaintiff and that Justin should set up his own company. Justin
                        reported that no funds were coming from the finance department to pay the
                        plaintiff’s workers, contractors and suppliers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_e"></a>(e)     On 28 January 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>, Justin reported that Lim
                        had expressed his intention to stop all jobs relating to the NH Glass
                        project. As the plaintiff had collected a deposit, Justin felt the plaintiff
                        had no choice but to complete the fabrication works to cover the deposit. He
                        suggested that the seventh defendant take over the balance
                    job.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_f"></a>(f)     On 3 June
                            2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>, it
                        was reported that Justin had tendered his resignation on 31 March 2005
                        and his last day would be 30 April 2005. Bob reported he would retain
                        Justin and extend his stay until 30 June 2005 to complete projects.
                        Staff of Justin and Richard would have their services terminated once the
                        projects they worked on were completed. Justin would pay rent for the
                        plaintiff’s premises and would let the plaintiff know what rental he
                        would pay and the period of lease. Justin was not allowed to register his
                        company’s address at the plaintiff’s premises. His
                        company’s business dealings, his workers and subcontractors were not
                        related in any way with the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_g"></a>(g)     On 22 June 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, Lim reported on the loans and
                        overdraft owed by the plaintiff to its bankers and said that the company had
                        other creditors. He and Ronald suggested selling the plaintiff’s
                        premises. Lim suggested that Justin rent a place elsewhere as the
                        plaintiff’s premises may be sold off.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_h"></a>(h)     On 27 June 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Ronald reported that the
                        plaintiff’s debts were too heavy and it would cease operations on
                        30 June 2005. He proposed that the plaintiff’s premises be sold
                        to settle the bank’s loan. Lim and Ronald agreed that Peter could
                        continue doing the same business provided that a new company was set up and
                        it had no connection with the plaintiff. Lim and Ronald further agreed that
                        Peter could rent the plaintiff’s premises until the building was
                        sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In cross-examination, Theresa clarified that
                    she attended shareholders’ meetings but never prepared the minutes. She
                    further clarified that the minutes of shareholders’ meetings were not
                    recorded by her but by the company secretary of the plaintiff; she prepared
                    minutes of informal meetings or directors’ meetings. Theresa maintained
                    that the minutes she had recorded were a true and accurate reflection of what
                    took place at meetings that she attended. Counsel for the plaintiff did not
                    dispute that Therasa prepared the minutes. Indeed, in the plaintiff’s
                    closing submissions (at para 86), Theresa’s minutes were relied on
                    for the submission that they did not support the defendants’ case. I
                    believe Theresa’s minutes fairly represented what transpired at meetings,
                    notwithstanding the shortcomings in her grammar and language. As for the minutes
                    of the meeting held on 3 June 2005, the only person who could disprove
                    Theresa’s evidence that Angie prepared and handed her a copy of the
                    minutes would be the latter. However, the plaintiff chose not to call Angie to
                    testify, and did not offer any explanation that would preclude the court from
                    drawing an adverse inference by her absence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It would not be necessary to refer to the
                    testimony of the other defendants as Richard, Peter and Bob essentially repeated
                    and corroborated in parts, what Justin alleged in his AEIC; they were not
                    material witnesses. The additional piece of evidence from Bob’s AEIC has
                    already been set out earlier at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The seventh defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As stated earlier <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>, Chow decided to act in person on 5 July 2008 which
                    was just eight days before this trial commenced. His previous solicitors had not
                    filed his AEIC before their discharge from acting for him. For the same reason,
                    Chow did not file any closing submissions. In the interests of justice, Chow was
                    allowed to give oral testimony and his examination-in-chief was led by the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Chow (DW6) testified that he had never
                    communicated with Lim for the NH Glass project; he only dealt with Justin
                    exclusively from the outset. Chow added that his only interest was to finish the
                    NH Glass project within the three months’ deadline. Eventually, the
                    project was completed in four months, after an extension of one month was given
                    by his employer. Chow said he transferred the project to the third defendant at
                    Justin’s request because he was told by Justin (whom he trusted) that
                    technical problems had occurred in the plaintiff which would delay the project.
                    Chow signed the cancellation letter dated 31 March 2005 to cancel the
                    purchase order (see above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) which
                    Justin accepted on the plaintiff’s behalf on 1 April 2005. Chow then
                    immediately accepted the third defendant’s offer letter dated
                    31 March 2005 (signed by Justin) to take over the NH Glass project as he
                    had no other alternative contractor; he was also under pressure from his
                    employer coupled with the threat of being liable for a penalty amounting to 10%
                    of his contract’s value of $400,000 if he did not complete the work in
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     According to Chow, it made little difference
                    to him that the third defendant took over the NH Glass project as Justin
                    continued to supervise the project. Even the third defendant’s address (at
                    No. 4 Soon Lee Road) was the same as the plaintiff’s. Chow thought the
                    third defendant was a subsidiary of the plaintiff. He pointed out that had he
                    conspired with Justin as the plaintiff alleged, he would have deducted his share
                    of the alleged secret profit before he paid the third defendant the balance 75%
                    of the contract value. Chow added that he would never betray the plaintiff or
                    Lim. He agreed with counsel for the defendants that as at 31 March 2005,
                    the plaintiff had completed around 25% of the NH Glass project equivalent to
                    $75,000 in value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As for the $90,000 claim of the plaintiff,
                    Chow agreed that the third defendant had rendered invoice numbered 238802/05 in
                    that sum to the seventh defendant on 17 March 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> as 30% of the progress payment
                    for the NH Glass project. Chow confirmed Justin’s earlier

                    the sum was actually a loan Chow had extended to the third defendant at
                    Justin’s request on or about 2 April 2005. This was corroborated by the

                    $90,000 payment was also reflected in the third defendant’s invoice

<p class="Judg-1">Chow concluded his testimony with his request to the court that the
                    plaintiff’s claim against him should be dismissed as he had nothing to do
                    with the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The expert testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As observed earlier (at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>) the plaintiff’s expert’s
                    testimony came in for heavy criticism from the defendants in their closing
                    submissions. I turn my attention now to Cerasi’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Cerasi (PW2), a digital computer forensic
                    practitioner deposed in his AEIC that he was tasked with investigating the
                    activities of the defendants to ascertain if they had committed any wrongdoings
                    detrimental to the interests of the plaintiff, even though he agreed with
                    counsel for the defendants<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> that such issues were not within his
                    area of expertise. Notwithstanding his admission in court, Cerasi’s report
                    was replete with findings of wrongdoings on the part of the six defendants,
                    essentially adopting Lim’s/the plaintiff’s allegations, thereby
                    overstepping the boundaries of his mandate/duties as set out under O 40A r 2 of
                    the Rules; it states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) It is the duty of an expert to assist the Court on the matters within
                        his expertise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom he has
                        received instructions or by whom he is paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     An example of Cerasi’s shortcoming was
                    highlighted by the defendants. Cerasi claimed (at paras 9, 10, 11 and 12 of his
                    AEIC) that he was told that the defendants had contacted the plaintiff’s
                    customers (such as Hitachi Zosen) to say that the third defendant was a
                    subsidiary of the plaintiff and to incorrectly inform customers like Temptech
                    Pte Ltd) that the plaintiff’s engineering department had closed and was
                    operating as the third defendant. Cerasi stated he was told that the defendants
                    then transferred ownership of the plaintiff’s account with its internet
                    service provider as well as its telephone and fax lines to the third defendant.
                    Further, Cerasi said he was also told that the defendants accepted the
                    termination of the NH Glass project and sent the third defendant’s
                    quotations for the same project but used materials purchased by the plaintiff
                    for the same project. Such information could only have been furnished by Lim.
                    Cerasi accepted the allegations at face value and failed to verify whether they
                    were true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Based on what Lim told him, Cerasi in his
                    findings then set out all the allegedly wrongful activities/wrongdoings of each
                    and every individual defendant as well as of other former employees of the
                    plaintiff. For added measure, he went on (in para 17 of his AEIC) to depose
                    that these individuals diverted business away from their employer to a new
                    entity <em>viz</em> the third defendant to the detriment of
                    the plaintiff. He then concluded that the defendants had conspired to divert the
                    NH Glass project to the third defendant to the plaintiff’s detriment. He
                    further echoed Lim’s suspicions that the April and May letters signed by
                    Bob were questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Cerasi’s AEIC showed he obviously lacked
                    impartiality and that his findings went against the grain of O 40A r 2(2) of the
                    Rules. Consequently, I reject his testimony in toto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The only issue for determination by this court
                    is, did the defendants (other than the third defendant) breach their fiduciary
                    duties as directors and/or their duties as employees of the plaintiff when
                    Justin agreed with Chow to terminate the PO and offered to take over the NH
                    Glass project on the third defendant’s behalf?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I had previously (at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>) reviewed Lim’s testimony and concluded therefrom
                    that the defendants’ criticisms that he was an unreliable as well as an
                    untruthful witness were justified, in the light of Lim’s shifts in
                    position, the numerous inconsistencies in his oral testimony and his repeated
                    prevarications. Indeed, I disbelieve Lim’s testimony in its
                    entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Ronald fared no better than Lim as a witness.
                    I am not persuaded he spoke the truth when he claimed he had no interest in the
                    plaintiff or in its business. Ronald could not offer any plausible explanation
                    why his being a good friend of Lim but an outsider of the company warranted his
                    regular attendance at management and other meetings of the plaintiff and almost
                    daily visits to the plaintiff’s premises. I am satisfied from
                    Theresa’s testimony that she had accurately recorded the minutes of those
                    meetings that showed Lim’s and Ronald’s attendance, despite their
                    denials (which I reject). I need only to highlight three meetings, those held on
                    21 September 2004, 22 June 2005 and 27 June 2005. Why would an
                    outsider like Ronald actively participate at these meetings to say (on
                    21 September 2004) that the plaintiff and SYEI should be managed separately
                    and announce (at the June 2005 meetings) that the plaintiff’s premises
                    should be sold because the company’s debts were too heavy?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I find that the defendants’ suspicions
                    that Ronald was/is a major shareholder of the plaintiff were not unfounded. In
                    all likelihood, Ronald’s shares in the plaintiff were/are held on trust
                    for him by Lim who by all accounts was beholden to Ronald. It was Ronald who was
                    instrumental in introducing Epson’s property to the plaintiff to purchase.
                    That would explain why Ronald would not want to register himself as a
                    shareholder and appear in the records of the Accounting and Regulatory Authority
                    (“ACRA”). As an employee of Epson, even if he did not have an
                    employment or a service contract (which is unlikely), he would still be in
                    breach of his implied fidelity duties by having other business interests,
                    particularly if such interests conflicted with his duties and responsibilities
                    to Epson. First, Ronald had introduced Epson’s property to the plaintiff
                    to purchase at $700,000. Then, the plaintiff sold the property for $1.8m. If he
                    was/is a major shareholder of the plaintiff as Justin and the other defendants
                    alleged and which I suspect is very likely, Ronald would obtain a substantial
                    share of the profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I entertain no doubts on the veracity of the
                    defendants’ testimony and that of Justin in particular; their version of
                    events was corroborated by Chow, whom I found to be honest, forthright and a
                    refreshing change from Lim and Ronald.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Chow’s testimony (see above at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> and <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>)
                    in effect demolished the plaintiff’s claims for $20,000 and $90,000 as
                    they were loans that Chow extended to Justin to help Justin pay
                    subcontractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Before I address the plaintiff’s claims
                    for $225,000 and $225,720 that were paid to the third defendant for the NH Glass
                    project, I need first to deal with Lim’s professed claim that he was
                    unaware of the existence of the third defendant until he engaged the services of
                    I-Analysis. Earlier (at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>), I had alluded
                    to Lim’s note dated 4 June 2005 that strongly suggested that since he
                    was not only aware of the third defendant existence but also that it operated at
                    the plaintiff’s premises until the latter moved out, Lim’s
                    explanation that he meant SY Instrumentation when he referred to the
                    “company” is an untruth. My view is reinforced by his
                        note<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> dated 4 July 2005
                    to Theresa, copied to Bob and Peter that stated:</p>

                    sent Lim a memorandum on 5 July 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> where he wrote:</p>

                            Please bill him accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I make two observations on the above
                    documents. First, Lim’s note and Peter’s memorandum corroborated the
                    minutes taken by Theresa of the two meetings in June 2005 (see [69(g) and (h)])
                    which recorded that Lim and Ronald intended to cease the plaintiff’s
                    operations as of 30 June 2005. Otherwise, why would the plaintiff terminate
                    the services of all its staff and dispose of its vehicles one of which (YJ6711T)
                    was purchased by Peter? Evidence of Peter’s purchase of the said vehicle
                    for $20,000 is to be found in the plaintiff’s tax invoice SYH1244 dated
                    28 September 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> It is damning evidence
                    of Lim’s character that he did not disclose his note, Peter’s
                    memorandum or the tax invoice. Those documents either emanated from the
                    plaintiff or were in its possession. But it was the defendants who produced
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It is crystal clear from para 1 of
                    Lim’s note that he must have known that the defendants had a company that
                    would take over the plaintiff’s projects. Lim’s note also talked
                    about Peter’s and Justin’s intention to rent space from the
                    plaintiff. Such conduct on the part of the duo is not consistent with the
                    plaintiff’s allegation that Justin and Theresa (the other director of the
                    third defendant) incorporated the third defendant and carried out its operations
                    surreptitiously at the plaintiff’s premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I should add that the plaintiff had novated
                    its contract with SIS to Automation Control Engineering Pte Ltd on 14 September
                    2005 and transferred two projects to Peter on 28 July 2005 (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>). Such acts were consistent with
                    the defendants’ contention that Lim and Ronald wanted to close down the
                    plaintiff’s operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Contrary to the plaintiff’s closing
                    submissions, I do not find that any of the six defendants had breached their
                    fiduciary duties (in the case of Justin and Bob) and/or fidelity duties as
                    employees (in the case of Theresa, Richard and Peter) to the plaintiff. Neither
                    do I accept that Peter, despite not being a director of the plaintiff, behaved
                    as and was accepted as one and should similarly be held to owe fiduciary duties
                    to the plaintiff, which he breached. Further, I do not accept that the third or
                    seventh defendants had participated in any conspiracy with the other five
                    defendants to cause harm to the plaintiff or that the third or seventh
                    defendants had dishonestly assisted in any breach of fiduciary duties owed by
                    the other defendants to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiff’s submissions completely
                    ignored the damning evidence extracted from Lim in cross-examination and which
                    was corroborated either by his own correspondence or correspondence to him,
                    and/or minutes of meetings that clearly showed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim (and Ronald) intended to close
                        down the plaintiff’s operations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim indicated to them that Justin and/or Peter
                        could/should start their own company/companies to carry on the business of
                        the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     Justin and/or Peter could rent space at the plaintiff’s premises for
                        their new company/companies at rents to be agreed, provided the new
                        company/companies had a different registered address from the
                        plaintiff’s;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_d"></a>(d)     Peter indicated to Lim that the third defendant would move out from
                        the plaintiff’s premises after one and a half months’
                        occupation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_e"></a>(e)     letters, correspondence and invoices of or to the third defendant were
                        received at/sent out from the plaintiff’s
                premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In its closing submissions, the plaintiff (at
                    para 89) pointed out that the minutes of the meeting held on 7 January
                    2005 stated that Lim wanted Justin to stop getting new orders and to set up a
                    new company, not that Justin was permitted to set up a new company to take over
                    the NH Glass project. Further, the minutes of the meeting on 28 January
                    2005 showed that Justin himself reported that the seventh defendant, not the
                    third defendant, was to take over the balance of the NH Glass project. Finally
                    at the meeting on 3 June 2005, nothing was said specifically about the NH
                    Glass project. On the contrary, it was reported that Justin was to continue all
                    of his uncompleted projects (see above at [69(e)]. The plaintiff therefore
                    argued that there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff consented to the
                    third defendant’s taking over of the NH Glass project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The above submissions completely disregarded
                    the factual matrix of the case – as early as January 2005 (presumably
                    after the PO dated 4 January 2005 was issued). Lim (according to Bob)
                    wanted Justin to stop getting new orders. The NH Glass project was already in
                    delay by March 2005 and by Lim’s own evidence, he expected Justin to leave
                    the plaintiff’s services by 30 April 2005 since he had not authorised
                    Bob to extend Justin’s employment until 30 June 2005. Who then was to
                    take over the NH Glass project after 30 April 2005 if not Justin’s
                    new company, the third defendant? The NH Glass project had always been under the
                    charge of Justin with Richard’s assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I would add that the plaintiff’s
                    contention that the defendants’ pleadings had admitted to having breached
                    their duties as employees of the plaintiff is incorrect (see paras 32 and 172 of
                    its submissions). By para 18 of their common defence, the defendants
                    admitted to paras 2 and 4 of the statement of claim in relation to their
                    fiduciary duties as directors and their duties as employees respectively of the
                    plaintiff, not that they had breached those duties. It was the plaintiff’s
                    fault in pleading in one and the same sentence (in para 4 of the statement
                    of claim) that the defendants owed duties as employees of the plaintiff which
                    they had breached, that caused the defendants to make the inadvertent error of
                    admitting to their duties as employees and to the breach thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I turn next to the plaintiff’s claim for
                    $225,720. This comprised of $20,000 and $90,000 allegedly received by Justin on
                    the plaintiff’s behalf, $115,000 allegedly received by the third defendant
                    on the plaintiff’s behalf and $720 invoiced by the third defendant to Chow
                    on 15 April 2005 for glass supplied to the NH Glass project which invoice was
                    signed by Justin. Justin’s evidence (corroborated by Chow) was that he had
                    to borrow money from Chow ($110,000) to pay the plaintiff’s suppliers and
                    subcontractors because of Lim’s refusal to sign cheques to make payment.
                    It is noteworthy that Lim himself testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> that he stopped payments to the
                    plaintiff’s workers, subcontractors and suppliers. At the meeting on
                    27 June 2005 (see above at [69(h)]), Ronald had announced that the
                    plaintiff was heavily in debt. It was also in evidence that the plaintiff had
                    been operating at a loss for the years 2003 to 2005. Lim’s conduct had
                    caused delay to the NH Glass project. The plaintiff was at risk not only of
                    having its services terminated but also of having to pay damages for its delay
                    in completing the project. Justin who was in charge of the project took the
                    pragmatic approach – he persuaded Chow to terminate the plaintiff’s
                    contract because Lim did not want to continue with it and it was in delay;
                    Justin took over the project immediately in the name of the third defendant,
                    assuming the plaintiff’s liability, in order to complete the same, which
                    was done in October 2005, well after the plaintiff had ceased
                operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     On the evidence, the transfer of the NH Glass
                    to the third defendant was known to and/or authorised by or acquiesced to by
                    Lim. Yet he had the gall to turn around and sue Justin, the third defendant and
                    the other defendants for conspiracy and to claim the balance 75% value of the NH
                    Glass project totalling $225,000 ($300,000 x 75%). To allow the plaintiff to
                    recover $225,000 and/or $225,720 for work it did not and could not carry out on
                    the NH Glass project would be to unjustly enrich the plaintiff at the third
                    defendant’s expense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I disbelieve Lim’s claim that the
                    plaintiff had expended $124,564.83 in purchasing materials for the NH Glass
                    project. Rather, I accept Richard’s evidence that not all the materials
                    were used in the NH Glass project as part thereof went into the SIS project.
                    Richard also testified that he was unable to ascertain the proportion of
                    materials used in the two projects because he had handed all the documents over
                    to the plaintiff. As the plaintiff failed to produce documents to substantiate
                    its claim that all the materials went into the NH Glass project, I am dismissing
                    it without more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I would add that Lim’s allegation that
                    the five individual defendants removed the hard disks from the computer systems
                    in the plaintiff’s office is a complete fabrication.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In the light of the evidence adduced in
                    court, I have no hesitation in finding that the plaintiff’s various heads
                    of claim are completely unmeritorious. I agree with the defendants that the
                    plaintiff’s action was instituted in bad faith undoubtedly by Lim and/or
                    Ronald with the motive of denying the plaintiff’s other shareholders
                        <em>viz</em> Justin and Bob (through his shareholding
                    in SYEI which is the third shareholder of the plaintiff) of any share in the
                    sale proceeds of the plaintiff’s premises. To-date, in breach of his
                    director’s duties, Lim has failed to account for the sale proceeds. There
                    was no conspiracy between the defendants to cause harm to the plaintiff as
                    alleged or at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    For added measure, Lim and/or Ronald added
                    Chow as the seventh defendant to this suit when Chow was an innocent party whose
                    only fault was to award the NH Glass project to the plaintiff and subsequently
                    to the third defendant, because he knew that Justin was capable of doing the
                    work required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Consequently, the plaintiff’s action
                    is dismissed with costs to all seven defendants to be taxed on a standard basis
                    unless otherwise agreed.</p>
