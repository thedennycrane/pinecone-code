        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by Dr Eric Gan Keng Seng
                    (“Dr Gan”) against the decision of the Disciplinary Committee
                    (“the DC”) of the Singapore Medical Council (“SMC”)
                    dated 8 January 2010 finding him guilty of professional misconduct under
                    section 45(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Medical Registration Act
                    (Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) in relation to his
                    post-operative care of a patient, Mr Toh Hock Ken (“the
                    Patient”). After the DC hearing which took place in two tranches between
                    12 May 2009 and 15 May 2009 and 6 January 2010 and 8 January
                    2010, the DC acquitted Dr Gan on the first charge of performing pre-cut
                    sphincterotomy (“the Pre-cut Technique”) on the Patient when
                    Dr Gan knew or ought to have known that the procedure was beyond the scope
                    of his competence. However, Dr Gan was convicted on the second charge for
                    wilful neglect of his duties and gross mismanagement of the post-operative
                    treatment of the Patient. The DC imposed the following sanctions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     That Dr Gan be suspended from
                        practice for a period of 6 months;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     That Dr Gan be censured;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     That Dr Gan give a written undertaking to
                        the SMC that he would not engage in the conduct complained of or any similar
                        conduct; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     That Dr Gan pay 70% of the costs and expenses of and incidental to the
                        proceedings, including the costs of the solicitor to the SMC and the Legal
                        Assessor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The reasons for the decision of the DC may be
                    found in its written grounds dated 8 January 2010 (“the
                        GD”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Dr Gan, a medical practitioner of 19 years
                    standing, is a Consultant Surgeon at Mount Elizabeth Hospital and a Visiting
                    Consultant Surgeon at the National University Hospital and Alexandra Hospital
                    (“AH”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Dr Gan first saw the Patient on
                    13 November 2005 when the Patient was admitted to AH after an acute episode
                    of severe, colicky upper abdominal pain<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> . After some treatment, the Patient was
                    discharged from hospital on 15 November 2005. At a follow-up outpatient
                    appointment on 29 November 2005, Dr Gan found that there was a
                    possibility of stone(s) in the Patient’s common bile duct and advised the
                    Patient to undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram
                    (“ERCP”). After being advised by Dr Gan that the ERCP was a
                    very common procedure involving hardly any risk, the Patient agreed. On
                    6 December 2005, at around 3.00 pm, Dr Gan performed the ERCP on the
                    Patient at AH. The initial attempts at cannulation were unsuccessful and
                    Dr Gan attempted a further procedure, the Pre-cut Technique on the Patient.
                    However, Dr Gan still failed to gain access to the Patient’s bile
                    duct and accordingly had to halt the Pre-cut Technique to consider an
                    alternative treatment plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The sequence of events on that fateful day was
                    noted by the DC as follows (at [8] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                                procedure, which was not Dr Gan’s usual practice in
                                previous cases. Dr Gan ordered that the Patient be observed and
                                not be discharged.</span></p>

                                assessment was that of “?post [<em>sic</em>] ERCP complications”. Dr Gan
                                verbally instructed Dr Lim to order blood tests and an erect

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       From the above tabulation of events, it would be
                    noted that following the failed ERCP procedure (including the Pre-cut Technique)
                    and after instructing the medical team under him to keep the Patient under
                    observation, Dr Gan left AH for the day. At about 6 pm, on the same day,
                    the on-call registrar, Dr Eugene Lim Kee Wee (“Dr Lim”),
                    called Dr Gan to inform him that the Patient looked unwell and had an
                    episode of bilious vomiting and epigastric tenderness but that the
                    Patient’s vital signs were normal. Thereupon Dr Gan ordered several
                    tests to be done, including an erect chest X-ray and serum amylase blood test as
                    an initial investigation into the possible post-operative complications. The
                    tests showed that the Patient’s amylase was elevated to more than 5 times
                    the normal level at 593U/L<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and the erect chest X-ray did not
                    reveal any subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum or gas under the diaphragm.
                    At around 9.50 pm, on that same evening, Dr Lim conveyed the results of the
                    tests to Dr Gan over the telephone. Based on the working diagnosis of acute
                    pancreatitis, Dr Gan instituted treatment for pancreatitis and instructed
                    Dr Lim to keep the Patient fasted, start an IV drip, insert a nasogastric
                    tube into the Patient and administer pethidine. Dr Lim was also instructed
                    to place the Patient under close observation with his abdomen being reviewed
                    periodically.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The following morning, on 7 December 2005,
                    at around 8.50 am, Dr Gan visited the Patient at the ward. While the
                    Patient looked well and his vital signs continued to remain normal with no
                    fever, the Patient still complained of abdominal pains and had a slightly
                    distended abdomen with tenderness in the right hypochondrium. Dr Gan also
                    picked up a right pleural effusion and ordered a second chest X-ray to be done
                    on the Patient. The chest X-ray confirmed that the Patient had a right pleural
                        effusion<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At about 5.00 pm on 7 December 2005,
                    Dr Gan observed that the abdominal signs of the Patient had changed in that
                    the area of tenderness had spread down the Patient’s right flank and there
                    was guarding. He immediately ordered a CT scan of the Patient’s abdomen
                    and pelvis to ascertain whether there was a perforation of the duodenum. A CT
                    scan of the Patient was performed at around 10.00 pm that same evening. The CT
                    scan revealed the presence of a retroduodenal perforation. Dr Gan performed
                    an emergency exploratory laparotomy on the Patient in the early hours of
                    8 December 2005. This revealed large amounts of bile stained fluid within
                    the peritoneal cavity, together with some haemoserous fluid. Similar fluid
                    collections were also present in the retroperitoneal spaces<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Despite subsequent efforts, the Patient passed
                    away on 22 January 2006 from septicaemia due to intra-abdominal
                    sepsis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 12 April 2007, Mdm Neo Guat Dee
                    (“Mdm Neo”), the Patient’s wife, lodged a complaint against
                    Dr Gan with the SMC. The Complaints Committee, after considering the expert
                    evidence of Dr Cheng Jun (“Dr Cheng”), specialist in
                    Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre (who
                    later became the sole expert witness for the SMC in its case before the DC),
                    decided that it sufficed to only issue a letter of advice to Dr Gan,
                    advising him to review his practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Dissatisfied with the decision of the
                    Complaints Committee, the Patient’s wife wrote to the Minister of Health,
                    who invoked his powers under the Act to convene a Disciplinary Inquiry. Two
                    charges were proffered against Dr Gan and they were set out in the Notice
                    of Inquiry dated 12 August 2008. The first charge alleged that the Pre-cut
                    Technique which Dr Gan had performed on the Patient was beyond the scope of
                    his competence. However nothing in this charge should concern us here as
                    Dr Gan was acquitted by the DC of the first charge (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> of GD). Of greater importance is the second
                    charge (“the Charge”) in respect of which the DC had found
                    Dr Gan guilty. The Charge read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you [Dr Gan] a registered medical practitioner under the Medical
                        Registration Act (Cap 174), are charged that whilst practising at
                        Alexandra Hospital and the attending physician to [the Patient] for the
                        period 6 December 2005 to 8 December 2005, you were in wilful neglect
                        of your duties and had grossly mismanaged the post-operative treatment of
                        the Patient.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SMC’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On the mismanagement charge, the SMC’s
                    case (the prosecuting party before the DC), was that the perforation of the
                    duodenum was a known risk of ERCP and the Pre-cut Technique (collectively
                    “the Procedures”) and it was imperative for Dr Gan to rule
                    out such perforation, especially when Dr Gan was aware of the failed
                    Pre-cut Technique and that any delay in the detection of a perforated duodenum
                    could be fatal. The only conclusive way to determine whether there was
                    perforation of the duodenum was to carry out a CT scan to ascertain the presence
                    of free air in the retroperitoneal area. Given the medical history and clinical
                    symptoms exhibited by the Patient, Dr Gan should have ordered a CT scan
                    when the Patient’s symptoms of epigastric pain, bilious vomiting,
                    voluntary guarding and distension continued into 7 December 2005 and it was
                    clear that the Patient’s condition had deteriorated. Dr Gan had
                    failed to carry out a CT scan, a very critical investigative step, at any of the
                    material times from the time when the Patient exhibited symptoms on
                    6 December 2005 to around 5.00 to 7.00 pm on the evening of 7 December
                    2005, by which time it was too late<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. The SMC submitted that
                    Dr Gan’s failure to order the CT scan in a timely manner amounted to
                    professional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Dr Gan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Dr Gan’s case was that the SMC had
                    not proven that no reasonable doctor in Dr Gan’s position would have
                    ordered a chest X-ray instead of a CT scan at the material time. Dr Gan
                    argued that he had not grossly mismanaged the post-operative treatment of the
                    Patient as the issue was a matter of clinical judgment and equally competent
                    physicians could arrive at different, yet reasonable management decisions. It
                    was not unreasonable of Dr Gan to have ordered an erect chest X-ray instead
                    of a CT scan in the first instance. Dr Gan submitted that he was closely
                    and intimately involved in the immediate post-operative care and management of
                    the Patient and hence he was not in wilful neglect of his duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DC’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The DC found<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> that the Charge had been proven beyond
                    reasonable doubt. Two reasons were specifically highlighted by the DC to justify
                    the conviction of Dr Gan for professional misconduct under section
                        45(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Act<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The DC was of the opinion that Dr Gan
                    should have personally attended to the Patient and evaluated his condition on
                    6 December 2005 when he was notified that the Patient was unwell following
                    the Procedures carried out by him, and especially after the results of initial
                    tests were available<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.
                    It added that Dr Gan, by virtue of being the consultant in charge, was in
                    the best position to “holistically evaluate all available information and
                    adapt management decisions according to the clinical picture, especially as the
                    Patient’s condition evolved”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. It further stated that relying solely
                    on the assessment of junior doctors, including one still in speciality training,
                    was not in the best interest of the Patient. The DC found that had Dr Gan
                    seen the Patient on the night of 6 December, Dr Gan would have considered
                    ordering a CT scan earlier when the Patient’s condition did not improve
                    the following day on 7 December 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The DC also noted that the chest X-ray
                    conducted on 6 December 2005 did not reveal anything of consequence and the
                    CT scan was the appropriate diagnostic test to be carried out as it would have
                    revealed the perforation of the duodenum<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The DC further observed that instead of
                    ordering a CT scan, Dr Gan ordered another chest X-ray on the morning of
                    7 December 2005 and it was of the view that a more timely CT scan would
                    have been crucial in the management of the Patient<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Accordingly, the DC was of the opinion that
                    Dr Gan’s post-operative care of the Patient fell short of his
                    professional duty to the Patient. It reaffirmed that Dr Gan’s failure
                    to personally assess the patient on the night of 6 December 2005 and manage
                    the situation appropriately between the onset of symptoms and signs post-ERCP
                    and the diagnosis of perforation amounted to wilful neglect of
                    Dr Gan’s professional duties<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and found him guilty of professional

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The role of the High Court in an appeal of
                    this nature is set out in s 46(8) of the Act which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Orders of Disciplinary Committee</b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>46</b>. — (8) In any appeal to the High
                        Court against an order referred to in subsection (6), the High Court shall
                        accept as final and conclusive any finding of the Disciplinary Committee
                        relating to any issue of medical ethics or standards of professional conduct
                        unless such finding is in the opinion of the High Court unsafe, unreasonable
                        or contrary to the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The High Court in <em>Low Cze
                        Hong v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 612
                        (“<em>Low Cze Hong”)</em>, at [39], held
                    that in considering an appeal, a court would be slow to interfere with the
                    findings of the Disciplinary Committee unless the grounds in s 46(8) of the
                    Act are satisfied. However, the court also noted (at [42]) that it would not
                    give undue deference to the views of the Disciplinary Committee in a way which
                    would effectively render nugatory the appellate powers granted by s 46(7)
                    of the Act. Similarly, in the recent case of <em>Gobinathan
                        Devathasan v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2010] 2 SLR 926
                        (“<em>Gobinathan</em>”), at [28], the
                    High Court noted that it would ordinarily not be easy to displace a finding or
                    an order of a Disciplinary Committee and that the court will only interfere if
                    the Disciplinary Committee’s finding is “unsafe, unreasonable or
                    contrary to the evidence”. The High Court further added (at [29])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are mindful that the Disciplinary Committee has the benefit, which we
                        do not have, of hearing oral evidence on both sides; and it is a specialist
                        tribunal with its own professional expertise and understands what the
                        medical profession expects of its members. Nevertheless, decisions of
                        Disciplinary Committees must be reasonably reached in accordance with the
                        evidence presented. In other words, while we would accord an appropriate
                        degree of respect to a Disciplinary Committee’s decision, we will not
                        defer to that decision if it is not in accordance with law and/or the

                    address the issues raised in this appeal (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above). The first issue is whether the findings of the DC
                    went beyond the ambit of the Charge (set out above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>). The starting point is, and must be, that Dr Gan is
                    only required to respond to the charge and nothing more (see <em>Lim Teng Ee Joyce v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2005]

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>Gobinathan</em>,
                    the DC found Dr Devathasan guilty of one charge of professional misconduct
                    under s 45(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Act, and ordered that
                    he be, <em>inter alia</em>, fined $5,000. The charge
                    related to Dr Devathasan’s inappropriate administration of Ultrasound
                    Sonolysis or Therapeutic Ultrasound on a patient. One of the reasons why the
                    High Court found that the Disciplinary Committee had erred and allowed the
                    appeal was that the Disciplinary Committee went beyond the scope of the charge
                    in question by drifting beyond a consideration of the use of Therapeutic
                    Ultrasound on the patient specifically to Therapeutic Ultrasound as a modality
                        <em>per se</em> without any reference to the Patient.
                    The High Court held that it was not open to the Disciplinary Committee to
                    convict Dr Devathasan on the ground of safety (whether in respect of the
                    patient herself or all patients in general) because there was no reference
                    either in the charge or its particulars to any allegation that Therapeutic
                    Ultrasound was “unsafe” or might cause harm (at [40]). The High
                    Court further noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the SMC had intended to rely on safety considerations to justify the
                        allegation of misconduct, such a serious allegation ought to have <em>expressly</em> formed part of the charge and have been
                            <em>fully particularised</em>. …</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Low Cze Hong</em>,
                    Dr Low appealed against the decision of the Disciplinary Committee finding
                    him guilty of two charges of professional misconduct. One of his grounds of
                    appeal was that certain particulars had not been pleaded and did not fall within
                    the charges. In dismissing the appeal, the High Court, in relation to the
                    allegations of imperfections to the charges, was satisfied (at [50]) that
                    Dr Low was not in any way "misled or prejudiced by the allegedly faulty
                    charges".</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Law Society of Singapore
                        v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308
                        (“<em>Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad
                        Khalis</em>”), in the context of an application taken out by
                    the Law Society of Singapore, under s 98(5) of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) against the respondent, who was an advocate and
                    solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, to make absolute an order to show
                    cause, the respondent argued that the third charge in that case was vague and
                    unclear. The High Court disagreed (at [61]) and went on to hold (at [62]) that
                    even if the charge was not as precise as it could have been, the respondent was
                    able to put forward his case with clarity and much force. Drawing support from
                    the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Chew Seow Leng v
                        PP</em> [2005] SGCA 11, the High Court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis</em> held that there was no
                    question that the respondent was misled or prejudiced by the allegedly faulty
                    charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, Dr Gan argues that
                    the finding of the DC, that he was in breach of his duties because he did not
                    personally attend to the Patient on the night of 6 December 2005, is a
                    finding that does not fall within the scope of the Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This court is of the opinion that even though
                    Dr Gan’s failure to attend to the Patient on the night of
                    6 December 2005 was not specifically set out in the Charge, nor in the
                    particulars furnished, Dr Gan’s entire conduct in relation to the
                    care of the Patient was necessarily put in issue when he was charged with wilful
                    neglect of his duties and gross mismanagement in the post-operative treatment of
                    the Patient for the period 6 December 2005 to 8 December
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In considering this ground of objection, we
                    must not lose sight of the fact that the thrust of the charge is that
                    Dr Gan, as the consultant who carried out the Procedures which failed, had
                    grossly mismanaged the post operative care of the Patient. The critical
                    consequence thereof was his failure to timely instruct the carrying out of a CT
                    scan on the Patient’s abdomen and pelvis, bearing in mind the dire
                    consequences (which Dr Gan claimed he was aware) should there be any delay
                    in the discovery of a duodenal perforation. The Charge, as amplified by the
                    particulars, clearly required the DC to consider the entire conduct of
                    Dr Gan from the time the failed Procedures ceased until he performed the
                    operation in the wee hours of 8 December 2005 to mend the duodenal perforation
                    discovered through the CT scan which was eventually ordered. This would
                    necessarily require an examination of both Dr Gan’s acts, as well as
                    his omission. His failure to attend to the Patient in the evening of
                    6 December 2005 was certainly a circumstance which the DC was entitled to
                    take into account in its overall assessment as to whether there was gross
                    neglect or mismanagement on Dr Gan’s part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In this connection, we note that counsel for
                    Dr Gan at the inquiry before the DC sought to call an additional witness,
                    Dr Lim, to ask “some questions ... about how often Dr Gan had
                    come to see the [P]atient…”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>after the
                    Procedures failed. His counsel, in view of the SMC’s objections, explained
                    that he wanted Dr Lim to explain to the DC the standard procedure for
                    consultants in that sort of situation. This was allowed and Dr Lim gave
                    evidence of what he thought of the fact that Dr Gan did not come to the
                    hospital on the evening of 6 December 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.
                    Moreover, Dr Gan gave evidence that he knew one of the issues was the
                    post-operative care of the Patient on 6<sup></sup>and 7 December 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> and
                    Dr Gan’s closing submissions also dealt with Dr Gan’s care
                    of the Patient on 6 and 7 December 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In coming to its conclusion that Dr Gan
                    should have personally attended on the Patient in the evening of 6 December
                    2005, instead of relying wholly on the oral report of the on-call Registrar as
                    to the condition of the Patient, what the DC was effectively saying was that had
                    Dr Gan seen the Patient in the evening of 6 December 2005 he would
                    have had a better appreciation or perception of the condition of the Patient
                    and, in turn, would have considered ordering a CT scan of the Patient earlier.
                    Although Dr Lim is a doctor, the fact remains that unlike Dr Gan,
                    Dr Lim is not a specialist but a trainee specialist. In terms of skills or
                    competence, there would be a difference between a specialist and a trainee
                    specialist. It stands to reason that a clinical examination by a trainee cannot
                    be treated as the same as that done by a specialist. We do not think that
                    Dr Gan was in any way misled as to the case he had to meet <em>i.e</em>. a failure to order a CT scan earlier which led the
                    Patient to lose his life.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the DC’s findings are flawed and contrary to the
                evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We now turn to examine the next two related
                    arguments of Dr Gan (see [19] above) that the DC’s criticism of the
                    fact that Dr Gan did not personally attend to the Patient on the night of
                    6 December 2005 is unjustified (“the first argument”) and
                    that the DC’s finding that Dr Gan would have considered ordering a CT
                    scan earlier is flawed and not supported by evidence (“the second
                    argument”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In relation to the first argument, it is an
                    established fact that Dr Gan did not to attend to the Patient on the night
                    of 6 December 2005. Dr Mak, witness for Dr Gan, gave evidence
                    that they in fact encouraged reviews by procedurists themselves so that any
                    immediate complications or adverse outcomes can be picked up by the procedurist
                        himself<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Dr Trevor Leese, another witness
                    for Dr Gan, gave evidence that following an ERCP and the Pre-cut Technique,
                    he would review the patient himself to see if there were any signs of
                    complications. If complications arose after office hours, his evidence was that
                    it would be more difficult and it would depend on who was calling him and what
                    confidence he had in the medical report. He would go back to the hospital to see
                    the patient if he was concerned<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.
                    Dr Hoe, witness for Dr Gan, also gave evidence that he would assess
                    the patient when he was called and based on the medical report of the Patient at
                    9.50 pm on 6 December 2005, he was of the view that the Patient was having
                    ‘some significant symptoms’ and he would like to see the patient
                    himself in order to evaluate him and see how he was faring as compared to what
                    the Patient’s condition was, immediately after the Procedures<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Dr Gan admitted that the Pre-cut
                    Technique is a highly technical and complicated procedure<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. Dr Gan gave further evidence that a
                    floppy papilla (which the Patient had) makes the Pre-cut Technique “a
                    very high risk”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. There is evidence that Dr Gan had
                    an inkling that something was not right after the Procedures as he put the
                    Patient on nil-by-mouth, even though that was not Dr Gan’s normal
                    practice (as noted by the DC at [8] of the GD). In other cases involving the
                    Pre-cut Technique, including those where the procedure failed, Dr Gan
                    allowed the patients to have feeds<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As explained by Dr Cheng, the
                    identification of perforations begins with the doctor’s inkling at the
                    outset as to whether he had created a perforation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the very beginning certainly when the patient complains just of pain
                        and guarding and discomfort and vomiting, it’s hard to tell which is
                        which but it’s a high index of suspicion. Pancreatitis being more
                        common, certainly you will keep an eye, but I think if you are talking about
                        perforation, number one, you will -- at the time of procedure, you’ll
                        already have an inkling, you know, as to whether you have created a
                        perforation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first is when you did the cutting, you then proceed to cannulate on
                        the assumption that you have found the opening to the bile duct. During the
                        cannulation, you go in some space which is not the bile duct and you put
                        contrast in and you’ll see, oh, it’s not the bile duct so you
                        have already created a kind of perforation. And if the perforation was a
                        little bit more, if you put in more air, you can see air appearing on the
                        X-ray during ERCP. So that already can give you a clue whether there is any
                        perforation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Then subsequent to that, if you’re still looking for -- if you still
                        suspect if a patient has perforation, then clinically at the bedside, if
                        you’re not happy with the situation, you should -- you have to do a CT
                        scan to find out what’s happening.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Dr Gan must have had an inkling that
                    something was not right with the Patient to depart from his normal practice.
                    This can be gleaned from the following evidence of Dr Gan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Furthermore, one panel member of the DC noted that Dr Gan must
                    obviously have inflicted an injury that is more significant than a microscopic
                    tear in the duodenum to cause such a large amount of bile to be found in the
                    abdominal cavity<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Following on from Dr Gan’s inkling
                    that something was not right with the Patient, barely three hours after the
                    failed Procedures, the Patient suffered from bilious vomiting, epigastric
                    tenderness and was noted to be unwell. At around 6.00 pm on 6 December
                    2005, the Patient’s condition was serious enough to warrant Dr Lim
                    calling Dr Gan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is true that Guideline 4.1.1.4 of the SMC
                    Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (“SMC Ethical Code”) provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A doctor may delegate another doctor, nurse, medical student or other
                        health care worker to provide treatment or care on his behalf, but this
                        person must be competent to carry out the care or procedure required. A
                        doctor retains responsibility for the overall management of the patient when
                        he delegates care. If the person delegated to is not duly registered as a
                        practitioner, this must be in the context of a legitimate training programme
                        and the doctor must exercise effective supervision over this person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Other relevant guidelines include Guideline 4.1.1.5 of the SMC Ethical
                    Code which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A doctor shall provide competent, compassionate and appropriate care to
                        his patient. This includes making necessary and timely visits, arranging
                        appropriate and timely investigations and ensuring that results of tests are
                        communicated to the patient and the most appropriate management is
                        expeditiously provided ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, Guideline 4.1.1.1 of the SMC Ethical Code provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A doctor is expected to have a sense of responsibility for his patients
                        and to provide medical care only after an adequate assessment of a
                        patient’s condition through good history taking and appropriate
                        clinical examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If treatment is suggested or offered to a patient without such personal
                        evaluation, the doctor must satisfy himself that he has sufficient
                        information available and that the patient’s best interest is being
                        served. Such information could be transmitted by voice, electronic or other
                        means by a referring doctor. Only in exceptional or emergency circumstances
                        should diagnosis or treatment be offered without personal contact and
                        without the intermediation of a referring doctor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We recognise that under Guideline 4.1.1.4, the doctor in charge could
                    delegate to another doctor or nurse, the task of providing treatment or care to
                    a patient. However, here we are not concerned with the administering of
                    treatment or care to a patient but the clinical assessment of the condition of a
                    patient. In order to make the right assessment much would necessarily depend on
                    the skill and experience of the doctor. Indeed Guideline 4.1.1.5 is particularly
                    germane. The doctor should make necessary and timely visits. He should also make
                    timely investigations. While Guideline 4.1.1.1 permits a doctor to prescribe
                    treatment without personal attendance and evaluation, the doctor must consider
                    the situation carefully to see if it would be in the best interest of the
                    patient to so prescribe. Furthermore, it is only in exceptional or emergency
                    circumstances that diagnosis or treatment be offered without personal contact.
                    In a case such as the present, where one of two known complications from the
                    failed Procedures is duodenal perforation and it is also known that early
                    detection is of the essence where that complication is concerned, the doctor in
                    charge should act with utmost care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On the present facts, Dr Gan agreed that
                    he did not know whether Dr Lim, who was still under training, had seen a
                    post-retroduodenal perforation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. The DC did
                    not think that this was an appropriate case for Dr Gan to arrive at a
                    clinical assessment based merely on the input of the on-call Registrar. We
                    cannot agree more. We would reiterate what is stated in <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above that the level of experience, and in turn competence,
                    between the two is obviously different and this would surely have an impact on
                    the clinical assessment of the Patient. Prof Ho, Dr Gan’s expert
                    witness, gave evidence that the ability to make an appropriate diagnosis is
                    dependent on the experience of the person examining the patient<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, Prof Ho was of the opinion
                    that if the case was one of perforation, the doctor should see the
                        patient<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. Based on Dr Gan’s own
                    evidence that the Pre-cut Technique was a highly complicated
                        procedure<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, that Dr Gan had an inkling
                    that something might be wrong with the Patient immediately after the Procedures
                    and that he took abdominal pain post-ERCP seriously<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, we hold that the finding of the DC that
                    Dr Gan should have personally examined the Patient on the night of the
                    6 December 2005 is not unsafe, unreasonable or contrary to the
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The point was made by counsel for Dr Gan
                    that it would have made no difference even if Dr Gan had visited the
                    Patient on the night of 6 December 2005 because he did visit the Patient at
                    8.50 am the next morning and yet did not think it necessary to order a CT scan.
                    This argument is flawed. If Dr Gan had visited the Patient on the night of
                    6 December 2005, he would have had a better perception of the
                    Patient’s condition and it could have an important impact on his clinical
                    judgment when he saw the Patient the next morning particularly so since
                    Dr Gan emphasized that what he was looking for was progression in the
                    Patient’s symptoms<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. Obviously the DC felt that a doctor
                    must see and examine the Patient in a case such as this before he could make a
                    correct comparison or assessment to determine the next step to take. We fully
                    agree with that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Based on the evidence before it, the
                    DC’s opinion, that a reasonably responsible doctor who had performed a
                    procedure which was unsuccessful and which is associated with known risks of
                    significant complications, had the responsibility to see the Patient in a timely
                    fashion when the Patient had symptoms, signs, and tests consistent with such
                    complication is, in our view, not a finding which is “unsafe,
                    unreasonable or contrary to the evidence”. Indeed, this led naturally to
                    the DC’s finding (at [16] of the GD) that Dr Gan’s failure to
                    manage the situation appropriately between the onset of symptoms and signs
                    post-ERCP and the eventual diagnosis of perforation established the allegation
                    of wilful neglect of Dr Gan’s duties constituting professional
                    misconduct. We would reiterate that Dr Lim, the on-call doctor is, unlike
                    Dr Gan, not a specialist but a trainee specialist. In terms of skills or
                    competence, there would be a difference between a specialist and a trainee
                    specialist. It stands to reason that a clinical examination by a trainee cannot
                    be treated as the same as that done by a specialist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On the second argument, the DC stated (at [13]
                    of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We accept that the timing of certain tests can vary between specialist
                        doctors, but we are of the opinion that had Dr Gan, as a responsible,
                        competent consultant surgeon seen the Patient earlier, would have considered
                        ordering a CT scan earlier when the Patient’s condition did not
                        improve by the following day. After all, the chest x-ray did not reveal
                        anything of consequence. The CT scan was the appropriate diagnostic test to
                        be carried out as it would have revealed the perforation of the
                        duodenum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The DC’s point was that if Dr Gan
                    had visited the Patient on the night of 6 December 2005, he would have
                    ordered a more timely CT scan on the Patient. Dr Gan confirmed, based on
                    the symptoms of the Patient reported to him on the night of 6 December
                    2005, that all was not well with the Patient who could be suffering from either
                    pancreatitis or duodenal perforation, with pancreatitis at the top of his list
                    of differential diagnosis and the second diagnosis was perforation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There were also new developments in the
                    Patient’s condition between 6 December 2005 and 7 December 2005.
                    We agree that had Dr Gan examined the Patient on 6 December 2005, he
                    would have been in a better position to assess the Patient’s change in
                    condition between 6 and 7 December 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At around 5.30 am on 7 December 2005, a
                    urinary catheter was inserted into the Patient because he could not pass urine
                    and concentrate urine of 500 ml was thereby collected. At 12.00 pm on
                    7 December 2005, the Patient passed very concentrated urine. Prof
                    Ho’s evidence, when asked whether the white blood count of the Patient
                    being 25,000 post–ERCP combined with poor urine output told him anything,
                    was that it indicated that he was dealing with something severe but did not in
                    some way increase the specificity of a particular diagnosis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. Dr Hoe’s evidence was that the
                    Patient was having ‘some significant symptoms”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. Moreover, earlier on, at 10.20 am on
                    7 December 2005, the Patient was observed to be breathless and tachypnoeic
                    and complained of shortness of breath and pain in the abdomen. A short while
                    later at around 10.30 am, nearly 16 hours after the onset of symptoms,
                    Dr Gan physically examined the Patient and picked up a right pleural
                    effusion. Dr Cheng’s opinion in relation to the Patient’s
                    shortness of breath was that it was probably the diaphragm being pushed up. This
                    was the usual situation where there was a leak of air in the abdomen<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>. Dr Gan ordered a second chest X-ray which
                    he claimed was to confirm his diagnosis of a pleural effusion<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>. We would observe that the House Officer,
                    Dr Angela Yeo, noted in relation to the second chest X-ray that there was
                    no free gas. Dr Gan’s evidence was that he told the House Officer not
                    to write down those words otherwise it would look like he was trying to look for
                    a perforation with the second chest X-ray when that was not the case<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. However, the House Officer nevertheless went
                    ahead to write down those words. The significance of this bit of evidence cannot
                    be ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Based on the biochemistry lab data, the
                    Chairman of the DC noticed that on 7 December 2005 at 10.55 am the Patient
                    was developing an anion gap and was becoming acidotic. The Chairman further
                    noted that the lab data appeared to indicate that Patient was getting
                        sick<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. At around 4.30 pm on 7 December 2005,
                    Dr Gan physically examined the Patient and noticed a change in the abdomen
                    signs in that the area of tenderness was moving down from the epigastrium and
                    right hypochondrium to the right iliac fossa and he felt that there was
                    guarding. It was only then that he decided to organise an urgent CT scan on the
                        Patient<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The CT scan showed large amounts of
                    retroperitoneal air, some free intraperitoneal fluid and a large quantity of
                    edema along the right retroperitoneal area<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. This was
                    consistent with a perforation of the duodenum. An emergency laparotomy was
                    performed early on 8 December 2005 and in the hospital operating notes, the
                    diagnosis put down was mild pancreatitis and retroduodenal
                        perforation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. However the diagnosis of retroduodenal
                    perforation came too late and the Patient subsequently passed away on
                    22 January 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Dr Gan and Dr Cheng agreed that an
                    earlier diagnosis of perforation might have improved the Patient’s chances
                    of survival. Dr Cheng said that “the complication became much worse
                    as a result of the delay”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> and
                    Dr Gan agreed that “an earlier diagnosis may have improved [the
                    Patient’s] chances...clearly”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and a delayed
                    diagnosis of duodenal perforation “of more than 24 hours is associated
                    with higher mortality”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     While the DC did not fault Dr Gan for not
                    ordering a CT scan of the Patient from the very beginning when symptoms first
                    appeared, the DC thought that a more timely CT scan would have been crucial to
                    the management of the Patient and that Dr Gan would have considered
                    ordering a CT scan earlier if he had seen the Patient earlier. We reiterate our
                    views at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above that Dr Gan would
                    have been in a better position to assess the change in the Patient’s
                    condition between 6 and 7 December 2005 if he had examined the Patient on
                    the night of 6 December 2005. This would have had an important impact on
                    his clinical judgment and would have caused him to consider ordering a more
                    timely CT scan. One cannot overemphasise the fact that any delay in discovering
                    a duodenal perforation could be life threatening, as in fact was the case here.
                    In view of this grave consequence if a duodenal perforation is not attended to
                    with due despatch, a consequence which Dr Gan said he well knew, we do not
                    think it was wrong for the DC to have found Dr Gan guilty of gross neglect
                    or mismanagement in failing to see the Patient in a more timely fashion, ie the
                    evening of 6 December, which would have led to a more timely CT scan and the
                    discovery of the duodenal perforation in the Patient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Bearing in mind the role of this court as set
                    out in <em>Gobinathan</em> and noting that the Disciplinary
                    Committee has the benefit, which we do not have, of hearing oral evidence on
                    both sides and it is a specialist tribunal with its own professional expertise
                    and understands what the medical profession expects of its members, this court
                    is of the opinion that the finding of the DC that Dr Gan had grossly
                    mismanaged the Patient is not unsafe, unreasonable or contrary to the evidence.
                    Despite knowing the risks of duodenal perforations associated with the
                    Procedures and that the Patient had developed new symptoms on 7 December
                    2005, Dr Gan still failed to order a CT scan earlier than at the time he
                    did.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the result, we are of the opinion that the
                    DC’s finding that Dr Gan’s wilful neglect of his duties and
                    gross mismanagement of the Patient amounts to professional misconduct under
                        s 45(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Act is not unsafe,
                    unreasonable or contrary to the evidence. Given that the DC is a specialist
                    tribunal (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> above), we decline to
                    interfere with the decision of the DC and accordingly, the appeal against
                    conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the sentence is manifestly excessive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We now turn to the question of sentence.
                    Dr Gan relies on Case No 4 of the SMC’s sentencing precedents of
                    disciplinary inquiries conducted by the SMC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> (“Sentencing Precedents”) to
                    argue that the sentence ordered by the DC is manifestly excessive. In Case No 4,
                    the doctor faced two charges: first, for failure to adequately assess the
                    medical condition of the patient and to refer the patient to hospital for
                    further management of a serious medical condition being that of septicaemic
                    shock from perforation of the appendix and second, for failure to keep proper
                    medical records of the consultation with the patient. The doctor in that case
                    claimed trial to both charges. The doctor was convicted of both charges under
                        s 45(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Act. A fine of $10,000
                    was imposed, he was censured and ordered to provide a written undertaking to
                    take a full medical history of the patient and to keep adequate clinical records
                    of his findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On the other hand, the SMC relies on cases
                    such as Case No 1 and 7 of the Sentencing Precedents to argue that the sentence
                    of the DC is not manifestly excessive. In Case No 1 of the Sentencing
                    Precedents, the doctor pleaded guilty to two charges under
                        s 45(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Act, namely failure to
                    carry out appropriate clinical examination and/or tests and failure to properly
                    manage an infection which the patient developed during the course of his
                    treatment. The patient died as a result. The doctor was suspended for 3 months,
                    censured and ordered to provide a written undertaking to abstain from similar
                    conduct. In Case No 7 of the Sentencing Precedents, involving an inquiry for
                    infamous conduct in a professional respect, a doctor was charged with four
                    charges involving serious disregard of professional responsibilities and
                    dereliction in the management and care of the patient, viz, (i) in his failure
                    to admit the patient to hospital when her condition warranted it; (ii) in his
                    failure to promptly attend to and examine the patient when he knew her condition
                    was critical; (iii) in prescribing drugs over the telephone without personally
                    examining the patient; and (iv) in delaying performing a C-section on the
                    patient. The doctor was suspended for six months, censured and ordered to
                    provide a written undertaking to abstain from similar conduct. Although the
                    document stated that the doctor was found guilty of charge (ii), it did not
                    indicate what happened to the other charges. However, during oral argument
                    before this court, counsel for the SMC informed us that the other three charges
                    were not proceeded with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In our view, Case No 4 of the Sentencing
                    Precedents relied on by Dr Gan may be distinguished on the ground that
                    there is no evidence that the doctor in that case was a Consultant or that
                    he/she knew of possible complications but failed to carry out the appropriate
                    diagnostic tests. Furthermore, there is no evidence from Case No 4 that the
                    patient died as a result of the doctor’s failure to diagnose the patient
                    in a timely fashion. On the other hand Case No 1 seems to have some similarity
                    to the present case although it involved two charges and the doctor was only
                    suspended for three months. As regards Case No 7, which also concerned
                    mismanagement, and which is similar to this case, six months’ suspension
                    was imposed. This court had stated in <em>Ho Paul</em> (at
                    [15]) that “like cases should be treated alike unless there are good
                    reasons to depart from applicable precedents”. Based on Cases No 1 and 7,
                    we do not see how it could be argued that the suspension of six months imposed
                    on Dr Gan was out of line, far less manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the light of the inadequacies highlighted
                    in the two preceding paragraphs relating to the document setting out the
                    applicable precedents, we would like to make the following comments for future
                    reference. First, in setting out the facts of a precedent, such as Case No 7,
                    where only a single charge, or for that matter only a number of the original
                    charges were proceeded with, there is no need to list out the charges which were
                    not proceeded with; but if, for any reason, there is a need to do so, details
                    should be given, including a brief explanation as to why it was necessary to
                    list out those abandoned charges. Second, the consequence to the patient as a
                    result of the professional misconduct should be disclosed. This is a highly
                    material fact. Only where this information is furnished would that precedent be
                    of assistance to the Disciplinary Committee, and, in turn, the court, to
                    determine the appropriate sentence, or to determine if the sentence imposed by
                    the DC on an appeal to this court is manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the result, this appeal is dismissed with
                    costs.</p>
