In the Court of Appeal, Saridewi sought to admit by way of CM 15/2019 an expert medical report dated 13 July 2019 which was prepared by Dr Jacob Rajesh (“Dr Rajesh”), who is a Senior Consultant Psychiatrist in Promises (Winslow) Clinic and the Singapore Prison Service (“SPS”) and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Singapore. Two further reports were prepared by Dr Rajesh pursuant to queries raised by the Court of Appeal. The third report Dr Rajesh prepared was in direct response to the Court of Appeal’s questions for the purpose of the remitted hearing before me. In response to Dr Rajesh’s reports, the Prosecution adduced three expert medical reports by Dr Mohamed Zakir Karuvetil (“Dr Zakir”), a Consultant in the Department of Addiction Medicine at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”).

These details were not surfaced to Dr Rajesh before, despite her having had six opportunities to do so when he interviewed her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It should also be noted that psychomotor retardation and agitation are binary symptoms in the DSM-V, yet Saridewi claimed, quite incredibly, to have experienced both. The very first time she mentioned having experienced psychomotor retardation, which according to her was similar to being in “shut down mode”, was during the 14 October 2020 interview with Dr Rajesh, more than four years after her arrest on 17 June 2016.

</div> Pertinently, this was only after the Court of Appeal had raised its queries for the remitted hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In another key area of contention, Saridewi claimed to have experienced an increased appetite among her methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms. She claimed that this was supported by a purported weight gain of 5kg across the few days during the statement-taking period. It is self-evident that there must have been an error in the recording of her weight since such rapid weight gain within such a brief duration is inherently incredible, a view echoed by Dr Chan (at [42] above). The very first time she mentioned having had increased appetite was during the 10 October 2019 interview with Dr Rajesh, more than three years after her arrest.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In my view, it is highly likely that Saridewi strenuously sought to shore up her alleged withdrawal symptoms at the remitted hearing after Dr Rajesh had elicited her responses on the factors listed in the AWQ. Illustrations of such self-prompted additions include her mention of anxiety, increased appetite and psychomotor retardation, all of which were listed among the AWQ factors though not specifically in similar terms among the DSM-V criteria. She also maintained at the remitted hearing that she had felt agitated in spite of stating the exact opposite in response to the AWQ. By the time she testified during the remitted hearing, she would have seen Dr Rajesh’s three reports and the list of DSM-V criteria for methamphetamine withdrawal which were outlined in Dr Rajesh’s 2nd Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I am therefore of the view that the additional details of withdrawal symptoms furnished by Saridewi only emerged as afterthoughts. They were crafted in an attempt to bolster her allegations during the remitted hearing. They were plainly tailored to fit either the AWQ or the DSM-V criteria for methamphetamine withdrawal as outlined in Dr Rajesh’s reports as fully as possible. As such, I consider these to be material inconsistencies in her evidence as a whole which seriously affect her credibility.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The severity of Saridewi’s condition </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Dr Rajesh’s opinion </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Dr Rajesh opined that Saridewi had been suffering from “at least moderate withdrawal” during the statement-taking period,

</div> which affected the reliability of the statements that she gave (see [26] above). However, Dr Rajesh’s heavy reliance on Saridewi’s AWQ responses and her self-reported accounts poses several difficulties. To begin with, Dr Rajesh’s use of the AWQ itself is controversial. It is not disputed that usage of the AWQ is not an accepted protocol in local clinical practice.

</div>
</div> In my view, this calls into question the reliability of the AWQ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 More importantly, even if the AWQ is accepted to be a reliable diagnostic tool for methamphetamine withdrawal, such a questionnaire is meant to be administered to assess withdrawal symptoms experienced within the past 24 hours. This is clearly stated at the top of the AWQ itself. In the present case, by the time the AWQ was administered to Saridewi, four years had elapsed since her alleged withdrawal symptoms. The self-reported responses must surely be prone to recall errors at the very least, and recollection bias at worse. While Dr Rajesh testified that he had only administered the AWQ in response to the Court of Appeal’s queries on the extent of Saridewi’s condition while bearing in mind its limitations (see [25] above), these caveats do not adequately address the concerns I have concerning the reliability and utility of the AWQ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Where expert medical opinion is based almost entirely on an accused person’s self-reported symptoms, the court also has to consider “the cogency and limits of the medical evidence complemented by, where appropriate, an understanding of human experience and common sense” (see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span><span class="font-italic"> Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 67 at [95]). In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Heng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2022] SGCA 10 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Heng</span>”) at [39] also considered that an accused person’s self-reported symptoms should be considered in light of the additional information from people who would ordinarily interact with the accused person, as it is not uncommon for accused persons to exaggerate or malinger symptoms. In <span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Heng</span>, the Court of Appeal found that the appellant’s evidence on his alleged depressed mood had been externally and internally inconsistent, which lent credence to the finding that his self-reported symptoms were unreliable as a whole (at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Reverting to the present case, I find that Saridewi’s evidence was externally and internally inconsistent. Fundamentally, the further evidence of the physicians who examined Saridewi reinforced my principal findings at trial. They were consistent in affirming that they did not notice any signs or symptoms of drug withdrawal, and specifically of methamphetamine withdrawal. Saridewi was able to respond and communicate with them in a lucid and coherent fashion at all relevant times. She was alert and oriented, and did not raise any complaints to them of drug withdrawal. In a similar vein, the recording officer, Investigating Officer Peh Zhen Hao (“IO Peh”), had confirmed that she was in a proper condition to give her statements during the statement-taking period.

</div> This observation should however be understood in its proper context, namely that it was documented in the early morning when Saridewi had just been roused from her sleep. Moreover, there were no other similar observations recorded by the nurses or any of the doctors at any point in time. It is far more likely that this was an isolated instance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In my assessment, Saridewi’s accounts were taken largely at face value by Dr Rajesh and simply assumed to be truthful and accurate. There was little or no accounting for the fact that she had given different accounts previously in her statements and at her trial, long before Dr Rajesh first interviewed her. He was not even aware that Saridewi had previously told Dr Lee that she had not suffered any withdrawal symptoms at the relevant time.

</div> Notwithstanding the documented observations from the doctors and nurses who had previously interacted with her, Dr Rajesh was quick to dismiss these observations as being tenuous or inadequate while glossing over the fact that they were consistent and contemporaneous observations. He also glossed over the fact that she had given intentional, detailed and coherent statements containing information which only she could have furnished. Within these statements, she had deliberately woven in false exculpatory accounts. This strongly suggests that she was well-oriented and in a fit and proper condition to give her statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In my view, there are fundamental defects in Dr Rajesh’s reports which diminish the objectivity, credibility and reliability of his expert opinion. While I would not characterise Dr Rajesh as a partisan witness, his objectivity is questionable primarily because he had relied almost unquestioningly on Saridewi’s self-reported account. The upshot is that even if Dr Rajesh had correctly assessed Saridewi to have suffered withdrawal symptoms up to and during the statement-taking period, he had in all likelihood made an overly generous assessment of the severity of her condition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 To further illustrate Dr Rajesh’s lack of objectivity, he had plainly suggested in his 3rd Report that “a slow heart rate (bradycardia) is also a sign of amphetamine withdrawal”,

However, as the doctors explained at the remitted hearing, what was more crucial was that there had been no objectively observable or noticeable symptoms or signs of distress to begin with, and no subjective complaints from Saridewi herself. Although the structured drug withdrawal assessment form used by the SPS is generic, this does not in and of itself mean that the observations made by the doctors were unreliable or inaccurate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Further, the fact that the doctors and nurses who observed Saridewi had conducted what Dr Rajesh described as “cross-sectional” assessments, rather than a longitudinal assessment, did not materially detract from the cogency of their observations.

</div>
</div>
</div> These observations were consistent as a whole and were made separately and independently over the relevant time frame. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It was suggested that since at least one nurse, Ms Maria, had noted that Saridewi had slept the whole night and looked “lethargic” on 20 June 2016 (see [54] above), this would corroborate Saridewi’s account. However, this was neither here nor there as it was an isolated instance. It would also not be appropriate to equate this observation of lethargy with Saridewi being so disoriented as to be in “shut down mode”. There were no other consistent observations of a similar nature. Equally, while another nurse, Ms Zawiyah, had noted on 19 June 2016 that Saridewi was “resting most of the time” (see [53] above), this was a neutral observation given that Saridewi was undergoing remand in a prison environment and was not noted to be restless, agitated or aggressive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Saridewi’s IUT result provides a possible objective indicator that she likely suffered from methamphetamine withdrawal at least immediately upon arrest. Nevertheless, this would not necessarily compel the inference that she was unable to give accurate or reliable statements during the statement-taking period. The further evidence also shows that she did not exhibit clear or noticeable signs of such withdrawal up to the time of the statement-taking period. As mentioned above at [96], Saridewi also did not raise any complaints or issues to the doctors or nurses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 If Saridewi had indeed exhibited or experienced the plethora of symptoms as she alleged, I find that it is highly implausible that <span class="font-italic">all </span>the doctors who examined her would have failed to notice any of these symptoms. If she were capable of masking the symptoms, as she appeared to have suggested in respect of her interactions with Dr Lee in particular as she wanted to be bailed out and thus did not want to complain of having withdrawal symptoms (see [10] above), this would equally suggest that the symptoms (if any) were hardly as severe as she claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 For completeness, I should also add that I find no merit in the Defence’s suggestion that Dr Lee’s clinical notes ought to have been disclosed earlier during Saridewi’s trial. There was every opportunity for the Defence to have asked to peruse these notes, if deemed relevant, during the trial and I had expressly confirmed with Saridewi’s (then) counsel that he had no issues with Dr Lee making reference to his notes.

I agree with Dr Zakir’s assessment that her withdrawal symptoms were minimal and not noticeable, and she did not surface them, thus suggesting that they were not particularly debilitating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In my assessment, Saridewi embellished her account of alleged withdrawal symptoms at the remitted hearing for self-serving purposes. Her alleged symptoms went far beyond what (if any) had been observed contemporaneously by the doctors, nurses and the SPS officers. She did not mention additional details of these symptoms at her trial. She also did not raise any complaints to the doctors or the nurses, or to the recording officer during the statement-taking period. Some of her alleged symptoms were not even mentioned to Dr Rajesh despite the fact that he had interviewed her on six separate occasions between March 2019 to October 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I further find that Saridewi did not exhibit or suffer significant withdrawal symptoms at all material times. If Saridewi’s symptoms were indeed as serious as she claimed, it is implausible that <span class="font-italic">all </span>the doctors who examined her contemporaneously would not have noticed them, even if they did not adopt any specific methodology for detecting methamphetamine withdrawal. The nurses who observed her also generally did not notice clear symptoms which could be attributed solely to methamphetamine withdrawal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The totality of the further evidence does not affect my earlier rulings in relation to Saridewi’s statements. Notwithstanding my finding that she had been suffering from mild to moderate methamphetamine withdrawal, Saridewi was still capable of providing intentional, detailed and lucid accounts in her statements. She provided specific and contextualised particulars which were only within her personal knowledge (see [94] above). She was also deliberate and consistent in fabricating a defence to the IO in all her statements that she was not involved in drug trafficking. Her ability to give her statements was thus not impaired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Having regard to the further evidence at the remitted hearing, I am of the view that Saridewi has not raised any reasonable doubt as to her mental state and condition during the statement-taking period. I see no reason therefore to depart from my conclusion at the trial in relation to Saridewi’s guilt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I would add that even if the statements recorded from 21 to 23 June 2016 are excluded from consideration, there is still sufficient evidence to support the Prosecution’s case. As explained in my GD at [61] to [69] in particular, Saridewi had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the MDA that she was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and this remains so even without consideration of her statements.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I remit my findings on the further evidence accordingly to the Court of Appeal for its consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Marcus Foo and Lim Shin Hui (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Choon Guan Daniel (Eldan Law LLP), Chenthil Kumar Kumarasingam (Withers KhattarWong LLP) and Wong Hong Weng Stephen (Matthew Chiong Partnership) for the accused. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
