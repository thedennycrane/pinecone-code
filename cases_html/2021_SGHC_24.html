On 19 October 2017, FXS suspended Wong with full pay pending the outcome of the Audit Investigation.

Wong claimed that he stayed as he wanted to assist in the investigation, and that he gave a short discourse on his concerns on the Audit Investigation process. Wong averred that as Deloitte did not have any queries for him, he asked to leave as he felt unwell. FXS denied that Deloitte did not have any questions for Wong and claimed that before Deloitte could raise numerous irregularities that it had identified from its Audit Investigation for Wong to respond to, Wong said he felt unwell and asked to leave the meeting.

A media release in April 2014 stated that FXS would offer “one-stop financial solutions for businesses” and a “full suite of financial solutions including Hire Purchase/Leasing, Sales and Leaseback Scheme, Credit Control Outsourcing Services, Litigation Services and more”. In other articles and media releases, FXS and its Innovation Office in Singapore were described to be a “consultancy business”, “building analytics”, and expanding into “[w]earable technology, telepresence, artificial intelligence, and even a cloud-based audio tour guide service”.  Hence, Wong claimed, FXS or FX was not averse to exploring new markets, products, technologies and services, even if they were unrelated to Print Products. Until the Suit was commenced, FXAP and FX were fully aware and had not objected to FXS entering into Project Management transactions and had encouraged the expansion of its scope of business to new business areas.

If any specific knowledge was required, relevant parties such as the customer would be engaged to obtain the relevant information.

In addition, Wong’s terms of appointment as Managing Director (“MD”) and subsequently Senior MD required him to “devote [his] best efforts to promote, develop and extend the business of [FXS] in Singapore”.

FXS entered into the IC1 Contract after Wong had discussed with his staff and assessed that FXS was capable of providing Project Management for the BTS project. Under the IC1 Contract FXS would provide Project Management to facilitate the BTS project between I-Connect and Suppliers. FXS was essentially a coordinator between the Suppliers and I-Connect, to ensure that the system would be installed within I-Connect’s timelines and to its specifications. It did not have to carry out any construction, installation or commissioning works and was not required to have the requisite technical know-how or capability to perform those services. The TP Products that FXS procured for I-Connect were relatively simple network-based products which FXS had experience with, and the procurement of TP Products was part and parcel of Project Management which was its usual business.

Hence, even if the market that FXS entered was not its usual market, that in itself did not mean that it could not undertake such transactions, for the reasons set out at [18] to [20] above.

</div> I give Wong the benefit of doubt that the IC2 Contract was executed on 1 April 2012.

I find that this claim is not made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 First, there was no requirement for FXS to secure a PG for any transaction, hence the requirement to obtain the latest IR8A form of a potential PG (as per the Listed Documents) was not mandatory (see [24] above). Despite this, three PGs were obtained for each IC Contract, two of whom were directors and shareholders of I-Connect (including Raden). Second, I find that the PGs obtained by Wong were reasonable in the circumstances. The Defendants, who allege that the PGs obtained were inappropriate or unsatisfactory, did not show what would have amounted to a satisfactory baseline. Mr Lee, the Defendant’s counsel, agreed that it is common to obtain personal guarantees from directors of a company involved in the material transaction, as Wong had done.

</div> Clause D(5) of the 2013 Comm Matrix required the APO President’s concurrence to write off a debt of JPY 10 million or more, and the IC Debt exceeded this sum. Wong claims that he did not have sight of the 2013 Comm Matrix until 2016, and argues that the 2006 Comm Matrix applied, under which he did not need to seek any approvals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I accept that the 2013 Comm Matrix applied as the write-off of the IC Debt was in 2014 and thus the APO President’s concurrence had to be obtained for the write-off. I find that Wong was aware of the 2013 Comm Matrix at the material time and not only in 2016. At trial, the Defendants produced an email sent on 2 December 2013 to various persons including Wong, which attached and informed about the 2013 Comm Matrix. When given an opportunity to recall Wong to explain whether he had received the 2013 Comm Matrix at the material time, Mr Wendell Wong (Wong’s counsel) declined to do so.

Whilst it is unclear whether “bankruptcy” in the 2006 Comm Matrix applies to companies (rather than only to individuals) Wong conceded that a company can cease to operate for reasons other than bankruptcy. In any event, I-Connect had not been wound up even at the time of trial. There were also no legal proceedings pending against I-Connect when Wong approved the write-off.

</div> As such, the Exclusion Clause did not apply and even under the 2006 Comm Matrix, Wong had to obtain the APO President’s concurrence to write off the IC Debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Although Wong had not obtained the necessary approval at the time he wrote off the IC Debt, I accept that he had subsequently obtained the approval of Honda (the then APO President) for this. About two weeks before the AGM to approve FXS’ 2014 audited accounts, Wong had sent the accounts to Honda and the board of directors. The accounts reflected the IC Debt having been written off, and even highlighted the name of I-Connect, for them to take note that this was a change. At the AGM, Wong then highlighted the IC Debt to Honda who stated that he had no objections, and Honda signed off the audited accounts.

</div> Wong’s account is supported by Toh who attested that at the AGM, Wong had presented FXS’ 2014 audited accounts to its Board of Directors and shareholders and had specifically raised to Honda the IC Debt that had been written off. Toh testified that Honda and other senior officials of FXAP did not raise any objections to the writing-off of the IC Debt. There is a discrepancy about the year of the AGM as Wong referred to the AGM as being held in 2014, while Toh claimed it was in 2015. It is likely that Wong was simply mistaken as the 2014 audited accounts (which was for FXS’ financial year from April 2014 to March 2015) would have been presented in 2015, as attested to by Toh.

Wong’s failure to obtain approval before entering into the IC1 Contract involving business activities abroad and before writing off the IC Debt may amount to a breach of the duty of reasonable diligence to comply with the Comm Matrix, as a reasonable person in Wong’s position would have obtained approval before making these decisions. However, both decisions were subsequently approved and hence rectified. As such, according to Kizaki, there would no longer be a breach of the relevant Comm Matrix.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 That being the case, I do not find that the Defendants were justified in summarily dismissing Wong pursuant to cl 10(b), (h) or (i) of the Employment Contract in relation to the IC Contracts. These breaches did not amount to acting in a manner grossly incompatible with the due and faithful discharge of Wong’s duties, neither have they caused material damage to FXS (see [67] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Phosagro Asia Pte Ltd v Piattchanine, Iouri</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1052 (“<span class="font-italic">Phosagro</span>”) at [49], the court had to interpret a clause in an employment contract which allowed the employer to terminate the employee’s employment if he was guilty of “serious misconduct”. The Court of Appeal held that “serious misconduct” must be a breach “that is so serious that it would justify [the employer] in terminating [the employee’s] employment without more”, and that principles relating to discharge by a repudiatory breach as set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 would be relevant to determine the issue of “serious misconduct”. I find these principles equally applicable to determining what amounts to “gross default or misconduct” under cl 10 of the Employment Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As a starting point, cl 4 of the Employment Contract states that Wong must “strictly comply with” FXS’ work regulations, rules, orders and policy directions of FXS for performing work. But this in itself does not mean that all clauses in the Comm Matrix constitute “conditions” such that a breach of the Comm Matrix would entitle FXS to treat the contract as repudiated or allow FXS to summarily dismiss Wong. Clause 10(c) of the Employment Contract (which is not being relied on) suggests that a mere breach of the Comm Matrix does not invoke termination, unless it is a “serious case” or a previous warning had been given and the violation repeated within a year. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Hence, the nature and effect of the breach on the employer-employee relationship should be examined (<span class="font-italic">Phosagro</span> at [50] and [53]). The failure to obtain approval under the 2006 Comm Matrix before entering the IC1 Contract did not cause loss to FXS, and Yanagawa (then President of FXAP and APO President) had subsequently approved the transaction. Likewise, the failure to obtain approval before writing off the IC Debt did not cause loss to FXS as the audited accounts had yet to be signed and the write-off could have been reversed if Honda had not agreed to it. As such, there was no material damage caused by Wong to FXS and it cannot be said that he had acted in a manner grossly incompatible with the due and faithful discharge of his duties (under cl 10(b) or (i) of the Employment Contract). In addition, it is not reasonable for the APO President to now be of the opinion that Wong was guilty of gross default or misconduct (under cl 10(h) of the Employment Contract) if the APO President at the material times had approved the IC Contracts and IC Debt write-off.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">MOS transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I next deal with the transactions pertaining to MOS.

Second, Wong had caused FXS to be unreasonably and unnecessarily exposed to liability by entering the above three contracts (collectively the “MOS Contracts”) to supply products/services which fell outside the scope of FXS’ business and which it did not have the Relevant EEC for. In this regard, the requisite approval should have been obtained under the 2013 Comm Matrix before entering into the MOS Contracts. Third, FXS had entered into the MOS Contracts without securing appropriate PGs beforehand. Subsequently MOS defaulted on payments under the MOS Contracts, amounting to $2,322,464.28, which was a result of Wong’s breach of duties and FXS counterclaims that amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Wong pleads that all four contracts were instalment sale agreements, although he later stated that the MOS3 and MOS4 Contracts were rental agreements – a discrepancy which I will return to later.

</div> Wong explained that the initial proposal, reflected in the CE Report, was for a part-sale and part-financing of asset, but that this manner of contracting was revised as MOS wanted a higher financing amount. Hence, he suggested that FXS take over the financing and building of the diving equipment and increase the value of the proposed contract with MOS to $2 million. This was on the basis that FXS’ cost to procure the equipment from Suppliers would be $1,930,000 and FXS would add a mark-up of $70,000 to its contract with MOS. Hence, FXS entered into a sale transaction with MOS with a gross profit margin of $70,000 (3.5% of the contract price of $2 million).

However, the Abacus System had limitations in that the description for a particular transaction had to be chosen from a drop-down box and there was no description corresponding to an instalment sale agreement.

When it sold the goods to MOS, FXS had marked up that cost to earn a gross profit of around 2.7% (or $26,735), and added a further interest component onto the $991,735 (which comprised the $965,000 and $26,735) because MOS was paying by instalments, to bring the total contract sum to $1 million. I also accept Wong’s explanation for the MOS4 Contract, consistent with the Manual Costing Sheet, that the goods were sold to MOS at $992,606, comprising around 3.7% as gross profit/mark-up of $37,126 and around 96.3% being the cost price to FXS of $955,480. An interest of 1% per annum was added over and above the sale price, again to charge MOS for paying in instalments, bringing the total contract sum to $1,007,496 (an increment of close to 1.5% as the payment period was one and a half years).

The date the contract came to an end must be ascertained on the assumption that the employer would have exercised any power he may have had to bring the contract to an end in the way most beneficial to himself; that is to say, that he would have determined the contract at the earliest date at which he could properly do so …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Essentially, the minimum legal obligation rule seeks to limit the recovery of damages by assessing it in a manner which is the least costly or most beneficial to the employer. However, it is not enough that the employer <span class="font-italic">could</span> have done so in the least costly manner to him, but that it must also be shown that he <span class="font-italic">would</span> have done so in that manner (<span class="font-italic">Aldabe Fermin v Standard Chartered Bank</span> [2010] 3 SLR 722 at [78]–[79] and [81]). Regardless of who bears the burden of proving whether the employer <span class="font-italic">would</span> have chosen the most advantageous method of performing or terminating the employment contract, I find that FXS would have chosen to terminate the contract in that manner. This is in light of the findings of the Deloitte Report and SA Report which provided some basis for the Defendants to believe that there were irregularities pertaining to transactions in FXS and which Wong might have been involved in or appraised of, and as shown by the fact that FXS had indeed terminated Wong’s employment a few weeks after the SA Report was released. Wong himself also claim that the Defendants wanted to dismiss him even before the two Reports were released.

Wong submits that the “base salary” per month is to be calculated based on the annual base salary of $407,498 divided by 12 months (ie, $33,958.17).

Wong relied on a series of emails dated 1 November 2017 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Emails</span>”) to show that Fujifilm had decided to dismiss him even before the results of the Audit Investigation were released or any allegations of wrongdoing against him crystallised, and that the Deloitte Report and SA Report were merely facades which the Defendants had no genuine intention to rely on.

Whilst Wong had named seven key executives in various FX entities who had left their employ, there is no evidence that they were dismissed unlawfully and without basis. Instead, Ino had explained that some had retired when their contract ended, receiving retirement benefits; and others had been summarily dismissed following disciplinary proceedings brought against them. Additionally, Ino stated that a significant number of key executives in other FX entities had remained in their respective employ even long after audits had been done, which points against any allegation of an indiscriminate mass dismissal of FX executives.

</div> It is also unclear how the reliance on various documents such as IIC’s report or various announcements and presentation materials of Fujifilm showed that Fujifilm intended to show its stakeholders that it was cleaning up its act by terminating various key executives such as Wong without basis. The focus of the IIC’s report was on achieving a more robust framework for compliance systems and internal controls, and the announcements and presentation materials do not refer to nor contemplate the removal of Wong as Senior MD of FXS.

</div> The Emails were also not addressed to any person from the Defendants and there was no evidence that FXS’ board of directors or the APO President had at that time agreed with Yoshizawa’s view and proceeded to act on that basis. Wong was not issued the Termination Notice until 21 December 2017, after the Deloitte Report and SA Report were prepared and after Wong had met Deloitte’s representative at the 30 Nov 2017 Meeting. Kizaki attested that it was only after the SA Report was received on 10 December, that he spoke to Isamu Sekine (then President of FXAP and APO President) the next day and the latter requested him to prepare the Termination Notice to dismiss Wong.

</div>
</div> If the Defendants had already decided to dismiss Wong on 1 November 2017 pursuant to the Emails, Deloitte would not have attempted to arrange the meetings. Further, Wong did attend the 30 Nov 2017 Meeting and raised his concerns then (see [6] above). I disbelieve Wong’s claim that at the 30 Nov 2017 Meeting, Deloitte’s representative had no queries for him, given the numerous attempts to schedule a meeting with him previously. There is also no evidence that the SA Report was expedited to fulfil Yoshizawa’s instructions to dismiss Wong. Further, the GAD had already commenced its audit around 4 September 2017, two months prior to the Emails, and Mr Wendell Wong claimed that Yoshizawa did not act for and was not a key decision-maker in either FXS or FXAP. Mr Wendell Wong’s submission that the SA Report was a façade to mask the Defendants’ prior decision to dismiss Wong is also contradicted by the Report which stated that FX was “reviewing” with APO on imposing a heavier punishment on Wong, and thus shows that at that time the decision had not been taken yet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In the circumstances, it is unlikely that FX or the Defendants would have taken the trouble to commission investigations culminating in the Deloitte and SA Reports and for the auditors to attempt to schedule meetings with Wong to give him an opportunity to be heard, just to put up a façade to justify the Defendants’ alleged prior decision to terminate Wong’s employment. It bears noting that the audits were triggered by an anonymous whistle-blower letter which mentioned Wong, and which led to the audit investigations culminating in the Deloitte and SA Reports. These provided some basis for the Defendants or their parent entity to perceive or believe that there were irregularities or lapses pertaining to transactions in FXS, which Wong might have been involved in or appraised of and which led FXS to believe that it was justified in dismissing Wong. Even if the two Reports did not refer to certain of the Transactions or allegations as ultimately raised in the Suit, this did not necessarily lend to a conspiracy by the Defendants to dismiss Wong with the intention or predominant purpose to cause damage or injury to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 For the same reasons, I find that Wong’s claim that FXAP had induced FXS to summarily dismiss Wong in breach of the Employment Contract is not made out as there is no evidence to show inducement by FXAP on FXS which led FXS to breach the Employment Contract with Wong.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In conclusion, I allow Wong’s claim against FXS for unlawful dismissal and award Wong a total of $1,435,560.65 comprising: (a) $87,321 for three months’ salary in lieu of notice; (b) $1,287,014.64 as EOT Payment; (c) $33,013.61 for loss of variable bonus; and (d) $28,211.40 for loss of his unconsumed leave.
