They submitted that the court had effected a “backdoor joinder” in making this direction. The DJ had no jurisdiction to direct P to be examined by a non-party to the proceedings. Instead, the court should first decide whether the respondent should be joined to the Deputy Application. It was only if the respondent was made a party to the Deputy Application that he could then apply for a further medical examination of P. If the court had doubts regarding P’s capacity, it should “direct the necessary questions to P’s doctor(s) and/or appoint a Court expert to assess P’s mental capacity”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) His initial inclination had been to make a decision on the Joinder Application. However, Ms Sandhu had pointed out that joinder might lead to confidential information regarding P’s assets and family matters being disclosed to the respondent. Further, P might suffer prejudice in the Civil Suit if the respondent was able to access confidential or privileged information in the eLitigation case file for the Deputy Application, upon being joined as a defendant thereto. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The DJ thus considered whether there was another option, apart from joinder, that would enable the respondent to challenge P’s capacity, without affording the respondent access to confidential material. In the light of the “judge-led approach” prescribed under r 22 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014) (“the FJR”), the DJ initially decided to allow the respondent’s insurer’s doctor to examine P. He reasoned that if the doctor agreed with Dr Chan that P lacked capacity, the basis of the Joinder Application would fall away. On the other hand, if the doctor considered that P had capacity, there would be a triable issue and the court would have to consider how to address P’s concerns as to confidentiality and privileged information. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Having heard the further arguments, the DJ considered that he should still adopt the same broad approach, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to have P examined by another doctor before he decided on the Joinder Application (albeit this doctor would be appointed by the court, not by the respondent’s insurer). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The appellants appealed against the DJ’s decision in Registrar’s Appeal No 32 of 2016 (“RAS 32”). On 24 April 2017, Chua Lee Ming J heard the appeal and affirmed the DJ’s orders that P was to be examined by a court-appointed independent doctor, and that both of the PI Reports were to be made available to the doctor. But Chua J allowed the appeal to the extent that he ruled that the DJ should not have invited the respondent to submit names of doctors to the court, since he had not been joined as a party to the Deputy Application. Chua J also indicated that the DJ should decide the Joinder Application, so that the issue of whether the respondent was entitled to attend the hearings of the Deputy Application could be dealt with.

I return to this below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The DJ issued written grounds of decision for the Joinder Decision: see <span class="font-italic">TWD v TWE</span> [2018] SGFC 6 (“the GD”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 He began his analysis by stating that he arrived at the view, based on Dr Chan’s 1st Report, the PI Reports and the Form, that there were “serious questions about the extent of P’s lack of mental capacity” (see the GD at [10]). He detailed these three pieces of evidence and explained why, in his view, they raised questions as to the extent of P’s capacity (see the GD at [14]–[29]). He then recounted his previous decision to appoint an independent medical expert and his reasons for doing so, as well as the outcome of RAS 32 (see the GD at [30]–[35] and [40]–[43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The DJ proceeded to set out the parties’ submissions on the Joinder Application, his views on those submissions and other points he considered in arriving at the Joinder Decision. In summary, he reasoned as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was clear from r 178(2) of the FJR that the court had a broad discretion in deciding whether to order a person to be joined as a party to an application under the MCA. The issue was “not whether it could be done but whether it ought to be done” (see the GD at [69]–[70]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The principles regarding joinder laid down in other cases, which had dealt with joinder pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”), “would apply equally” to joinder under r 178(2) (see the GD at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) One aim of joinder provisions was “to prevent the same or substantially the same questions or issues being tried twice with possibly different results”: see <span class="font-italic">Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff (administrator of the </span><span class="font-italic">estates of Syed Mohamad bin Hashim bin Mohamad Alhabshi and others) and others v Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and others</span> [2017] 5 SLR 299 (“<span class="font-italic">Alsagoff</span>”) at [23] and <span class="font-italic">Abdul Gaffar bin Fathil v Chua Kwang Yong</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 99 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Gaffar</span>”) at [53(b)]. If the Deputy Application proceeded without the respondent being joined as a party, with the respondent left to contest P’s capacity only in the Civil Suit, this could lead to the same issue, P’s capacity, being tried twice with possibly different results (see the GD at [71]–[75]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Furthermore, a finding in the Deputy Application that P lacked capacity could potentially affect the respondent legally or financially, because the appellants could rely on this finding in the Civil Suit (see the GD at [48] and [77]). The DJ noted that the potential impact on a non-party’s interests was considered a salient factor in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Gaffar</span>. He also referred to the English case of <span class="font-italic">Gurtner v Circuit</span> [1968] 2 QB 587 (“<span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span>”), where the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (“the MIB”) was added as a defendant to a personal injury action brought by a pedestrian against an insured motorist on the basis that the determination of the action would directly affect the MIB’s rights, since the MIB was bound to pay the judgment sum to the plaintiff. The DJ considered that <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span> “bore a certain similarity to the position in this case” (see the GD at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The DJ also emphasised that it was the responsibility of the court hearing the Deputy Application to determine whether P lacked capacity and it would be wrong for the court to disregard evidence that might show that P did not lack capacity (see the GD at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The appellants make the following submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the DJ applied the wrong principles in making the Joinder Decision. The principles articulated in <span class="font-italic">Alsagoff</span> and <span class="font-italic">Abdul Gaffar</span>, which the DJ relied on (see [27(b)]–[27(d)] above), do not apply to joinder under r 178(2) of the FJR.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The respondent submits that the court should consider three main factors in deciding whether to join a non-party to a deputy application: the interest of the applicant for joinder, the extent to which the latter may contribute to the proceedings, and the potential prejudice to him or her if the application for joinder is refused. The respondent argues that applying these factors, the DJ did not err in ordering the joinder.

</div> Therefore, the narrow issue for me to determine is whether the Joinder Decision amounted to an erroneous exercise of the DJ’s discretion under r 178(2) of the FJR. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The standard of review</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I begin with the applicable standard of review. In <span class="font-italic">TDA v TCZ and others</span> [2016] 3 SLR 329 (“<span class="font-italic">TDA</span>”), which was also an appeal against the decision of a court hearing proceedings under the MCA (a “MCA court”) that involved the exercise of the court’s discretion, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) stated at [25] that “the standard for overturning a judge’s exercise of discretion is a high one”. Prakash J also observed at [22] that in the light of the “expanded role” of a MCA court in directing proceedings under the MCA, a MCA court “should be accorded a greater degree of discretion than a judge hearing an ordinary civil matter …”. I agree with and endorse these views.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In what circumstances should the appellate court interfere with the MCA court’s exercise of its discretion? In <span class="font-italic">TDA</span>, Prakash J indicated at [23] that “the general position on appellate interference with a first instance court’s exercise of discretion” would apply, citing the test stated in <span class="font-italic">Tay Beng Chuan v Official Receiver and Liquidator of Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd</span> [1987] SLR(R) 123 at [16], which is whether the decision “was wrong so as to defeat the rights of the parties altogether and would be an injustice to one or other of the parties”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I agree that the general principles governing appellate interference with a first instance court’s exercise of discretion apply in an appeal against the MCA court’s exercise of its discretion. In <span class="font-italic">Warner-Lambert Company LLC v Novartis (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 707, which was decided after <span class="font-italic">TDA</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal reaffirmed at [38] the test stated in <span class="font-italic">Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053 at [34], which is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is trite law that an appeal against the exercise of a judge’s discretion will not be entertained unless it be shown that he exercised his discretion under <span class="font-italic">a mistake of law, in disregard of principle, under a misapprehension as to the facts, or that he took account of irrelevant matter</span><span class="font-italic">s, or the decision reached was “outside the generous ambit within which a reasonable disagreement is possible</span>”.

Order 99 of the Rules of Court was introduced after the enactment of the first version of the MCA in 2008. Mr Chia submits, and I accept, that O 99 r 4(2) in turn derives from r 73(2) of the England and Wales Court of Protection Rules 2007 (SI 2007 No 1744) (UK) (“the COPR”). Rule 73(2), which is now reflected in r 9.13(2) of the England and Wales Court of Protection Rules 2017 (SI 2017 No 1035) (UK), stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The court may order a person to be joined as a party if it considers that it is <span class="font-italic">desirable to do so for the purpose of dealing with the application</span>. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I now discuss the English cases which have examined r 73(2). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The foreign authorities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The leading case is the decision of the Court of Protection in <span class="font-italic">Re SK</span>. The case concerned a mentally incapacitated adult (“SK”) who suffered serious injuries in an accident involving a bus. SK commenced a personal injury action against the bus company (“GA”) through his brother (“CK”), who acted as his litigation friend in those proceedings, and obtained interim judgment for 60% of the damages to be assessed. Separate proceedings were initiated in the Court of Protection where SK was represented by the Official Solicitor, and was found to lack capacity to make almost all decisions for himself. An issue then arose as to the type of home in which SK should be placed. CK contended that the home should be one with an intensive rehabilitation regime, and obtained an expert opinion in support of his position. SK’s wife took the same view. By contrast, the other parties in the Court of Protection proceedings, the joint expert therein, and GA’s expert considered that SK should be placed in a home with modest rehabilitation. Both CK and GA then applied to be joined as parties to the Court of Protection proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Bodey J allowed CK’s application and dismissed GA’s application. In reaching his decision, he analysed the two conditions laid down by the COPR for a person to be joined as a party to Court of Protection proceedings. First, under r 75(1) of the COPR, the applicant had to have “sufficient interest” in the proceedings. Bodey J opined at [41] that this required the applicant to have an interest “distinct from some commercial interest” in the proceedings, albeit that one would have a “sufficient interest” if one’s liability would “effectively be determined once and for all in the Court of Protection proceedings”. CK fulfilled the “sufficient interest” condition in his capacity as SK’s brother. By contrast, GA did not satisfy this condition. Notably, there does not seem to be a provision equivalent to r 75(1) of the COPR in the FJR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 More pertinently for present purposes, Bodey J then turned to consider the second requirement for joinder laid down by the COPR, namely, the test set out in r 73(2) of the COPR. He made the following remarks at [42]–[43]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 … the court may join a new party if it considers that it is “…desirable to do so for the purpose of dealing with the application.” The clear import of that wording is that the joinder of such an applicant would be <span class="font-italic">to enable the court better to deal with the substantive application</span> (for example, by its being able to take into account and test the views of a close relative who knew the incapacitated person and was familiar with his wishes, feelings and preferences before he became incapacitated). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 The word "desirable" <span class="font-italic">necessarily imports a judicial discretion as regards balancing the pros and cons of the particular joinder sought in the particular circumstances of the case</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In sum, Bodey J held that in determining whether joinder was desirable under r 73(2), the court was to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the joinder sought on the facts of the case before it. And since r 73(2) required the court to consider whether it was desirable to join the non-party “for the purpose of dealing with the [substantive] application”, the advantages and disadvantages which the court had to consider were those which joinder would bring to the court’s disposition of the substantive application at hand. I note here that under r 178(2) of the FJR, by contrast to r 73(2) of the COPR, there is no requirement that joinder must be desirable “for the purpose of dealing with the [substantive] application”. The test is simply that of whether joinder is desirable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Applying these principles, Bodey J decided that it was not desirable to join GA as a party for the purpose of dealing with the application before him. First, in terms of the advantages of joinder, joining GA would not substantially assist the court in deciding whether SK should undergo intensive or moderate rehabilitation, because “the two sides of the issue (intensive rehabilitation or modest rehabilitation) are well-evidenced anyway by the competing experts” and GA would “add nothing to the debate about SK’s best interests”, except in relation to an issue of funding (whether there was a realistic prospect of funding for the options the court was considering): see <span class="font-italic">Re SK</span> at [42]. Second, in terms of the disadvantages of joinder, joining GA would lead to greater cost and delay in the Court of Protection proceedings. Such cost and delay was unwarranted, especially because if GA was not a party to the Court of Protection proceedings, it would not be bound by any finding by the Court of Protection as to SK’s best interests in the personal injury action brought by SK: see <span class="font-italic">Re SK</span> at [37]–[39].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Re SK</span> were endorsed by Sir James Munby, the President of the Court of Protection, in <span class="font-italic">Re G (Adult)</span> [2014] EWCOP 1361 (“<span class="font-italic">Re G</span>”) at [50]. There, an issue had arisen in Court of Protection proceedings as to whether the incapacitated person (“G”) had the capacity to communicate with the media. The publishers of the Daily Mail applied to be joined as a party to the proceedings. Munby P dismissed the application. He reasoned that the applicant did not have a sufficient interest in the Court of Protection proceedings and in any event, joinder would not be “desirable”. In this regard, Munby P made the following pertinent observations at [51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it would be highly undesirable for [the applicant] to be joined, because as a party <span class="font-italic">it would be entitled to access to all the documents in the proceedings unless some good reason could be shown why it should not</span>, <span class="font-italic">an</span><span class="font-italic">d the grounds for restricting a party’s access to the documents are very narrowly circumscribed</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In other words, joinder would not be desirable because it would likely enable the publishers to access all the documents filed in the proceedings in their capacity as a party thereto. It seems that Munby J was concerned with protecting G’s privacy and the confidentiality of information disclosed in the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Another instructive case is the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Z</span> [2018] EWHC 1488 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Re Z</span>”). In that case, the wife of a person (“Z”) commenced Court of Protection proceedings for the court to determine, among other things, Z’s capacity to manage his property and affairs. Subsequently, the son of one of Z’s brothers applied to be joined as a party to the Court of Protection proceedings, claiming that as a member of Z’s family, he had spent much time with Z and that Z had, among other things, promised to pay a sum to him. The applicant also resisted any limitation on his participation in the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Having endorsed the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Re SK</span> (at [17]–[18]), Norris J refused the joinder application, but directed that the witness statements filed by the applicant in support of the application would stand as evidence in the Court of Protection proceedings. He gave the following reasons for this decision:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was of “utmost importance that the [Court of Protection proceedings] be resolved speedily” and anything that had the potential to delay or prolong the resolution of those proceedings had to be avoided. In <span class="font-italic">Re Z</span>, the applicant resisted any limits on his participation in the Court of Protection proceedings. Adding him as a party would therefore amount to “incurring an undesirable risk”: see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Z</span> at [21].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, although the applicant had a “sufficient interest” in the Court of Protection proceedings in his capacity as a family member, that did not give him a right to be joined as a party. While it was “important that all of the [applicant’s] relevant and helpful evidence [was] before the Court” and tested, it was not necessary for the applicant to become a party for that purpose: see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Z</span> at [22].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, adding the applicant as a party might give his commercial interest prominence in the Court of Protection proceedings. This would not help the resolution of issues in those proceedings: see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Z</span> at [23].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, there was a “complete unity of view” between one of Z’s brothers, who was a party to the Court of Protection proceedings, and the applicant. Hence, the court “[did] not see what of value [could] be added to the debate on the issues in the [Court of Protection proceedings] by [the] separately represented [applicant]”: see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Z</span> at [24]–[25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Apart from the aforementioned English authorities, I also drew guidance from <span class="font-italic">Re DNS</span> [2016] NSWCATGD 6 (“<span class="font-italic">Re DNS</span>”), a decision of the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal which Mr Chia drew to my attention. In that case, a guardianship order had been made over a woman who suffered from dementia (“DNS”). Subsequently, one of DNS’s sons applied to be joined as a party to the guardianship proceedings to advance his position that he should be granted access to his mother under the guardianship order. In support of his application, the applicant provided the Tribunal with two videos.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Tribunal first ruled that the videos were not relevant to the issues in the guardianship proceedings. The videos only showed an unidentified woman making two telephone calls in the presence of a male person who was filming her, and it was unclear what the caller was saying, what the recipient was saying, and who the recipients of the calls were. Thus, the Tribunal decided not to admit the videos as evidence: see <span class="font-italic">Re DNS</span> at [19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Tribunal then turned to consider the joinder application. It began by noting that the relevant legislative provision empowered the Tribunal to join a person as a party “if, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the person should be a party to the proceedings …”. The Tribunal noted that the general practice of the Tribunal was “to place a practical limit on the number of parties to any proceedings”, and explained at [27] that this was justified on three grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, guardianship proceedings often involved the production of private or confidential material, such as material pertaining to the mental health, cognitive ability and treatment of the subject person. Protecting the privacy of the subject person was a “significant factor”, because the applicable legislation required the Tribunal to give paramount weight to the welfare and interests of the subject person. In many cases, it would not be consistent with this for private and confidential information about the subject person to be distributed to the applicant for joinder. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the applicable legislation also required the Tribunal to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of proceedings. In many cases, this principle would lead the Tribunal to refuse a joinder request.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, there might not be any real advantages in joining a non-party to proceedings given that in certain circumstances, the Tribunal would grant non-parties certain rights enjoyed by parties to guardianship proceedings, such as the right to be present and heard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Having reviewed the relevant authorities, I now turn to the interpretation of r 178(2) of the FJR, and the more specific issue of whether the court hearing a deputy application concerning a person should permit the (alleged) tortfeasor claimed to be liable to the person to be joined as a party to the application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, under r 178(2) of the FJR, the court has a broad discretion to order that a person be joined as a party to proceedings under the MCA. This coheres with the judge-led approach to family disputes mandated by r 22 of the FJR, and the inquisitorial nature of proceedings under the MCA: see <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span> [2015] 4 SLR 81 at [214]. In exercising its discretion, the court should consider the advantages and disadvantages of joinder on the facts of the case at hand to determine whether joinder is “desirable”. Since r 178(2), unlike r 73(2) of the COPR, does not require joinder to be desirable “for the purpose of dealing with the [substantive] application” (see [46] above), it is not <span class="font-italic">strictly </span>necessary that joinder would aid the court in dealing with that application. The advantages of joinder must simply outweigh its disadvantages for joinder to be ordered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I now consider the factual matrix of this case in the light of these general principles. In my judgment, where a deputy application is made in respect of a person (“X”), and the person who is or is alleged to be liable in tort to X applies to be joined to the application to adduce evidence on X’s capacity, it would generally <span class="font-italic">not</span> be desirable for the (alleged) tortfeasor to be joined as a party to the deputy application. I have arrived at this view for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I begin with the disadvantages of joinder. First, joinder of the (alleged) tortfeasor would inevitably delay the disposition of the deputy application and increase the related costs. I note that the courts in <span class="font-italic">Re SK</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Z </span>emphasised this factor in dismissing the joinder applications in those cases (see [47] and [51(a)] above). As a party to the deputy application, the (alleged) tortfeasor would be entitled, at the very least, to introduce evidence and make submissions on X’s capacity. Satellite issues flowing from that issue such as those arising in this case, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether X should be examined by a doctor appointed by the (alleged) tortfeasor and/or a court-appointed expert, might also arise. All this would delay the resolution of deputy applications, which would also become more expensive. The delay and expense would only increase if the involvement of the (alleged) tortfeasor was not restricted to the issue of whether X lacked capacity, or if the (alleged) tortfeasor contested such a restriction. In this regard, I note that although the respondent’s right to be heard in the Deputy Application was ostensibly limited to the issue of whether P lacked capacity (see [21] above), the DJ also heard him on the terms of the deputyship (see [24] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In my judgment, such delay and expense would generally not be in X’s best interests and would therefore be undesirable. For example, the appellants submitted that the delay in the resolution of the Deputy Application had delayed the commencement of the Civil Suit (the appellants could only commence it on P’s behalf once they had been appointed as his deputies) (see [28(c)] above).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, a key concern with allowing the (alleged) tortfeasor to be joined as party to the deputy application is that joinder would probably afford the latter access to private and confidential information about X (and possibly X’s family, if X’s family members were applying to be appointed as X’s deputies). This point was noted in <span class="font-italic">Re G</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re DNS</span> (see [49] and [54(a)] above). The concern arises because, as Munby P noted in <span class="font-italic">Re G</span>, a party to proceedings is generally entitled to all of the documents filed in those proceedings. I note that this point led the DJ to initially defer his decision on the Joinder Application. The DJ was concerned that if the respondent became a party to the Deputy Application, he would be able to access the eLitigation case file for that application and thereby obtain confidential or privileged information (see [19(a)] above). In my view, the DJ was correct to recognise that joinder carried this drawback. It is difficult to see why the (alleged) tortfeasor should have access to private and potentially sensitive information about X in connection with a deputy application. It seems that he should only be entitled to access such information, if at all, through the discovery process in a civil suit commenced by X against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61  Third, allowing joinder of the (alleged) tortfeasor would likely make the proceedings more adversarial, because the latter would seek to protect his interests or at least be perceived to be doing so. The present case illustrates this. The parties disputed many issues, including the relatively minor one of whether the respondent should have been allowed to suggest names of doctors whom might be appointed as the court-appointed expert. In my judgment, it would not conduce to the just, expeditious and economical determination of deputy applications (the goal envisioned under r 22 of the FJR) for such proceedings to take on an adversarial tone. A similar view was taken in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Z,</span> where the court noted that giving prominence to the applicant’s commercial interest would not aid the resolution of Court of Protection proceedings (see [51(c)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I now turn to the advantages that joinder of the (alleged) tortfeasor may offer. In my view, the key advantage of joinder is that it may enable the (alleged) tortfeasor to place relevant evidence regarding X’s capacity before the court. Such evidence might not be introduced by the applicants in a deputy application, and might assist the court to determine the extent of X’s capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Nonetheless, in my judgment, this factor does not establish a compelling case for joinder. Critically, joinder is not the only means by which the (alleged) tortfeasor may place relevant evidence regarding X’s capacity before the court. Mr Chia submitted that, as an alternative to joinder, the court could call a non-party as a witness to give and/or adduce evidence under rr 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the FJR (see [31(b)] above). Rule 22(3) of the FJR states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The directions that the Court may give … <span class="font-italic">include</span> directions on one or more of the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) subject to any written law relating to the admissibility of evidence, that <span class="font-italic">a party or witness adduce any evidence relevant to the proceedings</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (g) <span class="font-italic">the calling of a witness to give evidence with a view to assisting in the resolution or disposal of a cause or matter, whether or not any party to the proceedings will be calling that witness to give evidence for that party</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I accept Mr Chia’s submission that rr 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the FJR provide a mechanism by which evidence on X’s capacity, which is not adduced by the applicants in a deputy application, may be introduced in that application. For example, since the DJ considered that the PI Reports raised questions regarding P’s capacity, he could have called the relevant AJAX representatives as witnesses in the Deputy Application under r 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>). He could then have directed the witnesses to adduce the PI Reports under r 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The PI Reports could thus have been introduced into the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In sum, the existence of a mechanism besides joinder, by which evidence on X’s capacity may be introduced, undercuts the case for joinder. Similar views were expressed in <span class="font-italic">Re Z</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re DNS</span> (see [51(b)] and [54(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 During the hearing, however, counsel for the respondent (“Mr Wee”) raised doubts about the efficacy of such a mechanism. Mr Wee pointed out that the court would only be able to make directions under rr 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the FJR if it was aware of the relevant evidence. I agree. Yet it is not necessary for the (alleged) tortfeasor to bring a joinder application to bring the evidence to the court’s attention. I will elaborate on the process that should apply below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I now consider whether joinder would bring any other advantages apart from allowing relevant evidence to be introduced into a deputy application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The respondent submits that joinder would afford the court the opportunity to hear submissions on X’s capacity by a party independent from the applicants bringing the deputy application, namely, the (alleged) tortfeasor. By contrast, a mere witness would not be entitled to make submissions. The respondent emphasised that submissions might be of considerable assistance to the court where the deputy application was uncontested, or where the evidence indicated that there was fraud or other forms of abuse.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I accept that the opportunity of hearing submissions from the (alleged) tortfeasor may be an advantage of joinder. Yet in my judgment, leaving aside perhaps cases of fraud or other forms of abuse, it would generally not outweigh the disadvantages noted above. This is because the court’s conclusion on the extent of X’s capacity, and the consequential orders in the deputy application, would, by and large, turn on the medical evidence and, in particular, the doctors’ opinions on the extent of X’s capacity. This point is illustrated by the DJ’s orders in this case, which tracked the views expressed by Dr Fones in his report (see [23]–[24] above). It is therefore unclear that the court would be greatly assisted in most cases by the submissions of the (alleged) tortfeasor. What is critical is that all relevant and material <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> regarding X’s mental incapacity is put before the court. Once that is achieved, it is not obvious that submissions by the (alleged) tortfeasor would generally add significant value. My views in this regard are consistent with the position taken by the respondent. At the hearing, Mr Wee submitted that the respondent’s participation “was no longer relevant” once the evidence his clients sought to introduce was admitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70  I now address the reasons given by the DJ for the Joinder Decision. The DJ did not expressly balance the advantages of joinder against its disadvantages. Instead, he applied the principles governing joinder under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court – I will return to this point below. Nonetheless, the DJ essentially considered that joinder would yield two main advantages (see [27(c)]–[27(d)] above). First, it would prevent the issue of P’s alleged lack of capacity being tried twice with possibly different results. Second, absent joinder, a finding that P lacked capacity could potentially affect the respondent legally or financially and joinder was desirable in those circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71  I start with the DJ’s second point. In making this point, the DJ relied on the English case of <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span> (see [27(d)] above). In <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span>, the plaintiff was injured by a motorcycle which the defendant was riding. The plaintiff sued the defendant in tort for negligence claiming damages for his personal injuries. However, by the time the writ was issued, the defendant had left England and his insurers could not be traced either. The plaintiff then obtained an order for substituted service of the writ on an insurance company which the MIB had asked to act on its behalf. The MIB applied to be added as a party to the action, on the basis that it would be liable to satisfy any damages awarded to the plaintiff in the action, pursuant to an agreement it had entered into with the Minister of Transport to satisfy unsatisfied judgments obtained by injured persons against motorists. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Court of Appeal allowed the MIB’s appeal against the decision of the court below, ordering that the MIB be joined as a party to the action. Lord Denning MR explained this at 595D–596E as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… when two parties are in dispute in an action at law, <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">the determination of that dispute will directly affect a third person in his legal rights or in his pocket, in that he will be bound to foot the bill, </span>then the court in its discretion may allow him to be added as a party on such terms as it thinks fit. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I would apply this proposition to the present case. If the [MIB] are not allowed to come in as defendants what will happen? The order for substituted service will go unchallenged. The service on the defendant Circuit will be good, even though he knows nothing of the proceedings. He will not enter an appearance. The plaintiff will sign judgment in default of appearance. The judgment will be for damages to be assessed. The master will assess the damages with no one to oppose. The judgment will be completed for the ascertained sum. The defendant will not pay it. Then the plaintiff will be able to come down on the [MIB] and call upon them to pay …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is thus apparent that the [MIB] are vitally concerned in the outcome of the action.<span class="font-italic"> They are directly affected, not only in their legal rights, but also in their pocket. They ought to be allowed to come in as defendants. It would be most unjust if they were bound to stand idly by watching the plaintiff get judgment against the defendant without saying a word when they are the people who have to foot the bill</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Diplock LJ made the following remarks at 602G–603E:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Clearly the rules of natural justice require that a person who is to be bound by a judgment in an action brought against another party and directly liable to the plaintiff upon the judgment should be entitled to be heard in the proceedings in which the judgment is sought to be obtained</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So long as [a judgment] is legally enforceable against [a] person … the court has jurisdiction to add that person as a party and ought normally to exercise its discretion by granting his application to be added. I think, therefore, that the [MIB] is entitled to be added as a party to the present action …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In short, in <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span>, joinder of the MIB was desirable because the MIB would have been <span class="font-italic">directly</span> affected by the result of the plaintiff’s action, in that it would have been liable to pay the damages awarded to the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">even if </span><span class="font-italic">it was not joined to the action</span>. In those circumstances, natural justice required that the MIB be joined to the action so that it would have an opportunity to be heard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On one view, the factual matrix at hand is similar to that in <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span>. The respondent argues that where a MCA court appoints a deputy to make decisions on a person’s behalf, this would be premised on a finding that the person lacks capacity as to certain matters, and this finding, which concerns the status of the person, would be a judgment <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>that binds the world.

</div> If this is correct, then as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span>, a non-party (here, the respondent) could be bound by findings made by a court in proceedings that it was not party to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 However, in my view, <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span> is distinguishable from the factual matrix under consideration. Even if a MCA court’s finding that a person lacks capacity binds the world, such that the (alleged) tortfeasor may not dispute X’s <span class="font-italic">status</span> as a person who lacks capacity, it would still be open to the (alleged) tortfeasor to dispute, at least, the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> to which X lacks capacity. I have arrived at this view, which the respondent accepts,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Respondent’s further submissions dated 28 September 2018 at para 13.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 A person’s capacity is a dynamic attribute. It may improve or deteriorate over time. A deputy application and a related tort action may be commenced at different points in time and, indeed, the former will often precede the latter because the decision to sue will often have to be made by the deputies. It follows from this that findings made by a MCA court in a deputy application as to X’s capacity may be overtaken by changes in X’s condition. By the time the related tort action is brought, the earlier findings may not reflect X’s true condition. In those circumstances, it is difficult to accept that the (alleged) tortfeasor would be precluded from adducing evidence of those changes in the related tort action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 If, as I have concluded, it is open to the (alleged) tortfeasor to dispute, at least, the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> to which X lacks capacity in the tort action, then the reasons of natural justice which called for joinder in <span class="font-italic">Gurtner</span> do not apply. The (alleged) tortfeasor’s legal rights and financial interest would not be substantially affected by findings he had no opportunity to be heard on, because<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">it is the substantive aspects in which X lacks capacity, rather than X’s bare status as a person who lacks capacity, that will determine the (alleged) tortfeasor’s liability (if any) to X, and the (alleged) tortfeasor will be entitled to be heard on those issues</span>. Thus, in my view, the second point made by the DJ in favour of joinder falls away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Further, it follows from the above analysis that the first benefit of joinder perceived by the DJ also falls away. The DJ seems to have reasoned that if the (alleged) tortfeasor <span class="font-italic">was</span> joined as a party to the deputy application, he would be bound by findings as to X’s capacity made therein and thus, joinder could prevent the issue of X’s capacity being tried twice. However, for the reasons given above, in my view, joinder would not prevent the issue of (the extent of) X’s capacity being considered afresh by the court hearing the tort action. It can then decide on the damages to be awarded based on its findings on the extent of X’s capacity. However, even if it finds that X has regained full mental capacity, X’s status will still remain until revised by the appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I conclude that the disadvantages of joining the (alleged) tortfeasor to a deputy application concerning X would generally outweigh the advantages of joinder. Therefore, joinder of the (alleged) tortfeasor would generally not be “desirable” and should generally not be permitted under r 178(2) of the FJR. It may be that in some exceptional cases, joinder of the (alleged) tortfeasor would be desirable. However, such cases would likely be few and far between. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I now return to the question of how the (alleged) tortfeasor might place evidence regarding X’s capacity before the court hearing the deputy application (see [66] above). In my judgment, the following procedure should apply:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The (alleged) tortfeasor should write to the court to inform the court of the evidence in his possession. The letter should set out details regarding the nature of the evidence, and explain its relevance to the deputy application. The letter should also generally enclose a copy of the evidence. A copy of the letter and its enclosures should be sent to the applicant who has brought the deputy application. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The applicant bringing the deputy application should then have the opportunity to respond to the (alleged) tortfeasor’s letter, by letter to the court. The applicant should state his position on the relevance of the evidence and whether he consents to the admission of the evidence. The applicant’s reply to the court should be copied to the (alleged) tortfeasor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The court should then consider whether the evidence is relevant to the issues to be determined in the deputy application. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) If the court is satisfied that the evidence is irrelevant, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Re DNS</span> (see [53] above), the court should inform the applicant and the (alleged) tortfeasor of this. The (alleged) tortfeasor may then seek to raise the evidence in the separate tort action (if any) brought by X against him. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) If the court is satisfied that the evidence may be relevant, then it may introduce the evidence into the deputy application of its own motion pursuant to rr 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the FJR as noted in [64] above. The court may then make consequential orders, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, directing a court-appointed medical expert or the parties’ medical experts to provide further medical reports which address the new evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I now turn to consider the outcome of this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The outcome of the appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The DJ proceeded on the basis that the principles regarding joinder laid down in cases relating to O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court “would apply equally” to joinder under r 178(2) of the FJR (see [27(b)] above). He therefore analysed the issue of joinder through the prism of those principles. In my view, this was an error of law and/or principle warranting appellate intervention with the DJ’s exercise of his discretion. I have set out the principles applicable to joinder under r 178(2) above, and they are not the same as those which apply to joinder under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Moreover, in my view, the Joinder Decision was “outside the generous ambit within which a reasonable disagreement is possible”. As I have explained, the disadvantages of joinder of the (alleged) tortfeasor to the deputy application would generally outweigh the advantages of joinder, and I am satisfied that this was the case here. Furthermore, there are no exceptional reasons arising from the facts of this case which support the Joinder Decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I conclude that the appeal should be allowed on these two grounds. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For the above reasons, I allow the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I record my appreciation to Mr Chia for his submissions which greatly assisted me in arriving at my decision in this matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I will hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon  <br/>Judicial Commissioner  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Viviene Kaur Sandhu and Gabriel Choo (Clifford Law LLP) for the appellants;<br/>Anthony Wee and Manoj Belani (United Legal Alliance LLC) for the respondent;<br/>Chia Huai Yuan (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) as</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"> young <span class="font-italic">amicus curiae</span>.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
