        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by Lim Lye Hiang (“the
                    appellant”) against the decision of a High Court Judge (“the
                    Judge”) in <em>Re Lim Lye Hiang, ex parte the Official
                        Assignee</em> [2011] 1 SLR 707 (“the
                    Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Upon a petition of Keppel Bank of Singapore
                    Limited, a bankruptcy order was made against the appellant on 9 January
                    1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Separately, the appellant’s sister, Lim
                    Lye Keow (“LLK”), had nominated the appellant pursuant to
                    s 25 of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, 2001 Rev Ed)
                    (“the CPFA”) to receive LLK’s Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) monies and SingTel discounted shares (collectively,
                    “the Monies”). LLK passed away on 14 March 2008, at which
                    point the appellant was still an undischarged bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 18 September 2008, the CPF Board
                    (“the Board”) sent a letter to the appellant informing her that
                    although she had been nominated by LLK to receive the Monies, the Monies would
                    instead be released to the Official Assignee (“the OA”) because
                    she was an undischarged bankrupt. Although this letter was copied to the OA, it
                    had no record of receiving the letter. As a result, no action was taken by the
                    OA to claim the Monies from the Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 26 June 2009, the Board sent an e-mail
                    to the OA. The Board referred to its earlier letter of 18 September 2008
                    and requested the OA’s instructions for the transfer of the Monies to it
                    if the appellant was an undischarged bankrupt. Again, the OA had no record of
                    receiving this e-mail and no action was taken on its part to claim the
                    Monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 16 October 2009, the OA filed a report
                    to the court (“the Discharge Report”) in support of its
                    application to discharge the appellant from bankruptcy. By this time, the OA had
                    admitted proofs of debt lodged by 13 creditors totalling $1,179,422.68, and
                    had published a notice that it intended to declare a first and final dividend.
                    The last day for receipt of proofs of debt had expired on 12 May 2008. The
                    Discharge Report stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The OA intended to declare a first
                        and final dividend of about 0.989% to the creditors (<em>ie</em>, of about $11,664).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant had no further realisable
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     A period of
                        more than 11 years had elapsed since the bankruptcy
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     The appellant
                        was 52 years old and was employed as a kitchen helper earning a net monthly
                        salary of about $800. The appellant had been making regular contributions of
                        between $50 to $150 per month to her estate in
                    bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     The OA
                        had completed the administration of the appellant’s
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 13 November 2009, the court granted an
                    order discharging the appellant from bankruptcy (“the Discharge
                    Order”) pursuant to s 124 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20,
                    2009 Rev Ed) (“the BA”), without any conditions
                    attached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 12 January 2010, the appellant attempted
                    to claim the Monies from the Board. The Board did not accede to her claim.
                    Instead, on 14 January 2010, the Board wrote to the OA again by e-mail. It
                    referred to its previous letter on 18 September 2008 and e-mail on
                    26 June 2009, and requested the OA to give instructions for the transfer of
                    the Monies to it if the appellant remained an undischarged
                bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The OA responded immediately. On the same day
                        (<em>ie</em>, 14 January 2010), the OA instructed
                    the Board to forward the Monies to the OA. The Board then requested confirmation
                    that the Monies were to be forwarded to the OA even though the appellant had
                    already been discharged from bankruptcy. The OA confirmed that the Monies were
                    to be forwarded to it for administration. Later that day, the Board informed the
                    appellant that it had been instructed to release the Monies to the
                OA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 24 February 2010, the Board wrote to
                    the OA informing the OA that the Monies, amounting to $102,614.84, had been
                    transferred to its bank account. The Board expressed its belief that the Monies
                    vested in the OA and that the appellant’s discharge did not alter that
                    position. This letter was copied to the appellant. On 2 March 2010, the
                    Monies were received in the OA’s bank account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 12 May 2010, the OA filed Summons
                    No 600059 of 2010 (“the Summons”) seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, an order that the Monies be divisible among the
                    appellant’s creditors and payable to them as dividends on the basis that
                    the Monies were property which had devolved on the appellant on 14 March
                    2008 (the date of LLK’s death), notwithstanding that the Monies were
                    received by the OA <em>after</em> the appellant’s
                    discharge from bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before we provide a summary of the
                    Judge’s decision and the issues raised in this appeal, it is convenient
                    that we first set out the relevant statutory provisions. The relevant provisions
                    in the CPFA at the time of LLK’s death on 14 March 2008 were as

                    amendments have altered the substance of the issues considered in this appeal or
                    our decision on those issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decisions below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At first instance, the Assistant Registrar
                    (“the AR”) granted the order sought by the OA (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). He explained that it was the
                        <em>entitlement</em> to the Monies (<em>ie</em>, a chose in action) which was in issue, and not the Monies
                        <em>per se</em>. He held that the appellant became
                    entitled to the Monies when LLK died, and that therefore the chose in action
                    vested in the OA due to the operation of s 78(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge dismissed the appeal from the
                    AR’s decision. The appellant’s first argument before the Judge was
                    that the Monies did not devolve upon her immediately upon LLK’s death.
                    According to s 20(1) of the CPFA, the Monies could only be withdrawn if
                    authorisation was granted by the Board. Such authorisation was not yet granted
                    when she was discharged from bankruptcy. Therefore, the Monies fell outside the
                    definition in s 78(1) of the BA of “property” which vested in
                    the OA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Judge rejected this argument (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> of the Judgment). He noted that the appellant’s focus
                    on the actual transfer of the Monies to the OA on 24 February 2010 was
                    misplaced because what was in issue was the <em>entitlement</em> to the Monies. The Judge found that this
                    entitlement, which arose at the point of LLK’s death, did fall within the
                    definition of “property” which vested in the OA.
                    Section 20(1) of the CPFA merely stipulates a procedural requirement of
                    authorisation from the Board before withdrawal could be effected. This
                    procedural requirement did not alter the nature of the appellant’s
                    entitlement to the Monies as a chose in action which fell within the ambit of
                        s 78(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA and therefore vested
                    in the OA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The appellant’s second argument was
                    based on s 24(4) of the CPFA, which provided that a CPF member’s
                    funds are not subject to his debts and will not vest in the OA upon his
                    bankruptcy. The Judge rejected this argument (at [28] of the Judgment), stating that the protection conferred by
                    s 24(4) was only intended to protect the savings <em>of a
                        member</em> for his retirement from his creditors. There was no reason
                    why Parliament would have intended the ambit of this protection to extend to
                        <em>nominees</em>. Nominated CPF monies were in
                    substance no different from other testamentary gifts. This argument was not
                    pressed on appeal to this Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The appellant’s final argument before
                    the Judge was that her discharge had the effect of revesting the rights to the
                    Monies in her. She relied on the case of <em>Chong Chee Keong v
                        Official Assignee</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 546
                        (“<em>Chong Chee Keong</em>”) as
                    authority for this proposition. The Judge rejected this argument (at [31]–[32] of the Judgment), holding that <em>Chong
                        Chee Keong</em> could be distinguished on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first issue to consider is whether the
                    entitlement to the Monies constituted “property” within the ambit
                    of s 78(1) of the BA and therefore vested in the OA at the point of
                    LLK’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     If the first issue is answered in the
                    affirmative (<em>ie</em>, if the entitlement to the Monies
                    vested in the OA at the point of death), the second issue which then arises is
                    whether the appellant’s <em>subsequent</em> discharge
                    from bankruptcy had the effect of <em>revesting</em> that
                    entitlement in the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue: Whether the entitlement vested in the OA</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the entitlement arose upon death</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Section 25 of the CPFA allows CPF members
                    to nominate beneficiaries to receive their CPF funds upon death. Upon the death
                    of a CPF member who had made such a nomination, s 15(5) provides that the
                    nominee “shall be entitled to withdraw” the amounts stipulated by
                    the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The appellant argues that a nominee’s
                    right to withdraw CPF funds that a member has nominated in his favour does not
                    arise immediately upon the member’s death. According to her, the Judge
                    failed to recognise that s 15(5) provides that a nominee is entitled to
                    withdraw CPF monies “after the death” of the member “in
                    accordance with s 25(1)”. Following on from that, she points out
                    that s 25(1) refers to monies that are payable “under
                    s 20(1)”. Her contention is that because monies can only be
                        <em>paid</em> to the nominee upon authorisation by the
                    Board under s 20(1), the <em>entitlement</em> to
                    withdraw the monies only arises upon such authorisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     This argument is misconceived. As the OA
                    rightly points out, the appellant has conflated, on the one hand, a
                    nominee’s <em>entitlement to withdraw</em> the monies
                    and, on the other hand, the process which has to be complied with by the nominee
                    in order to obtain <em>actual possession</em> of the
                    monies. We agree with the Judge (at [23]–[26] of the
                    Judgment) that s 20(1) was merely a procedural mechanism which was not
                    relevant to the question of whether and when the <em>entitlement</em> to the Monies had crystallised. Section 15(5)
                    of the CPFA is unambiguous: upon the death of LLK on 14 March 2008, the
                    appellant became “entitled to withdraw” the Monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This interpretation of ss 15(5), 20(1)
                    and 25 of the CPFA is supported by the decision of this Court in <em>Central Provident Fund Board v Lau Eng Mui</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 826, which concerned the interaction between a court order
                    pursuant to what is now s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) and a nomination
                    pursuant to s 25 of the CPFA. The court stated (at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>A nomination made under [s 25 of the CPFA]
                            </em>
<em>takes effect only on the death of the
                            member</em> and <em>on the happening of such an
                            event the provision of </em><em>s 15(5) comes
                            into operation</em>. Where an order has been made under
                        [s 112 of the Women’s Charter] giving to the spouse of the member
                        a portion of the moneys in the latter’s CPF account, the order takes
                        effect immediately, and the member’s balance to which he is entitled
                        is diminished or reduced by the portion to which the spouse is entitled.
                            <em>Hence, on his death his nominee can only take what
                            the member had immediately before his death and would be entitled to the
                            amount to which the member was then entitled</em> ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the time of death of the CPF member is the critical
                    time at which the nomination under s 25 takes effect such that the nominee
                    becomes <em>entitled</em> to receive the nominated CPF
                    monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the entitlement fell within s 78(1)(a) of the
                BA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The appellant’s alternative argument is
                    that even if the entitlement to withdraw the Monies pursuant to the CPFA arose
                    upon LLK’s death, that entitlement did not fall to be divided amongst her
                    creditors under s 78(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA. The
                    appellant again, in support of this argument, relied upon the fact that
                    s 20(1) of the CPFA required authorisation by the Board before a nominee
                    may obtain payment of the monies which he is entitled to receive. As a result,
                    the entitlement did not vest in the OA as part of the appellant’s estate
                    in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Section 78(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA provides that all “property” which is
                    vested in the bankrupt at the commencement of his bankruptcy or is
                    “acquired by or devolves on him” before his discharge forms part
                    of his estate in bankruptcy. We have already determined that the
                    appellant’s entitlement to the Monies arose at the time of LLK’s
                    death (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>-<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above). Therefore, the entitlement to the Monies was
                    acquired by or had devolved upon the appellant before her discharge from
                    bankruptcy. The only remaining question which has to be considered is whether
                    the statutory entitlement of a nominee to nominated CPF monies constitutes
                    “property” as understood in the BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Section 2(1) of the BA provides that
                    “property” includes choses in action. A chose in action is an
                    expression used to describe “all personal rights of property which can
                    only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical
                    possession”: see <em>Torkington v Magee</em> [1902]
                    2 KB 427 at 430. The statutory entitlement of a nominee to nominated
                    CPF monies falls squarely within this explanation of what constitutes a chose in
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is trite law that the existence of a chose
                    in action does not depend upon immediate enforceability. In <em>Kwok Chi Leung Karl v Commissioner of Estate Duty</em> [1988]
                    1 WLR 1035, the Privy Council (on an appeal from Hong Kong) was faced
                    with the issue of, <em>inter alia</em>, whether an
                    obligation to pay a sum of money on demand after sixty days constituted an
                    existing chose in action at the time when the obligation was entered into.
                    Lord Oliver of Aylmerton (delivering the judgment of the court) held that
                    the obligation was indeed an existing chose in action at the time when the
                    obligation was entered into. He stated (at 1040E–G):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A chose in action is no less a chose in action because it is not
                        immediately recoverable by action …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A debt which is payable in futuro is no less a debt ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This reasoning was adopted by Ferris J in the
                    case of <em>In re Landau (a bankrupt)</em>
                    [1998] Ch 223 (“<em>Re
                    Landau</em>”) which was cited by the OA. This case dealt with the
                    question of whether rights under a pension policy fell within a bankrupt’s
                    estate. At the age of 53, Mr Landau entered into an arrangement whereby he
                    was entitled to an annuity for the rest of his life starting from when he turned
                    65. He was made a bankrupt when he was 61. He was discharged from bankruptcy
                    when he was 64. When Mr Landau reached the age of 65 in 1994, he sought to
                    obtain the benefits under the policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Ferris J held that the trustee in
                    bankruptcy was entitled to receive all the sums payable under the policy,
                    despite the fact that the benefits were only payable at a time when
                    Mr Landau had already been discharged from bankruptcy, <em>ie</em>, in 1994 when Mr Landau turned 65. His reasoning was as
                    follows (at 232B–G):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a matter of classification, Mr. Landau’s bundle of
                        contractual rights under the policy constitutes a chose in action and it had
                        this character at the time of the bankruptcy order. On the face of it,
                        therefore, it fell within the definition of “property” [in
                        s 436 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (UK)]. Moreover the fact that, at the
                        commencement of the bankruptcy, nothing was immediately payable under the
                        policy does not alter this in any way. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… At the commencement of his bankruptcy he had a present right to
                        compel [the pensions provider] to make payments under the policy in the
                        future. This was an immediate chose in action … Mr. Landau had, in
                        relation to the policy, the same chose in action on the date of the
                        bankruptcy order as he had when he attained the age of 65 and … the
                        latter event did not result in anything being acquired by or devolving upon
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We agree that this is the correct approach to
                    view choses in action. The fact that there was no authorisation given by the
                    Board to the appellant at the time of LLK’s death (or at any point before
                    the appellant’s discharge) is therefore irrelevant. The appellant’s
                    reliance on s 20(1) of the CPFA conflates, on the one hand, the process by
                    which the chose in action is <em>realised</em>, and, on the
                    other hand, the conditions for the <em>existence</em> of
                    the chose in action. The fact that the Monies were only paid out after the
                    appellant was discharged from bankruptcy is also irrelevant, because such
                    payment merely represents the realisation of the chose in action. <em>What is crucial is that the entitlement came into existence upon
                        LLK’s death and that the appellant was still an undischarged bankrupt
                        at this time.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Apart from the argument based on the mere fact
                    that authorisation was required by s 20(1) of the CPFA for the withdrawal
                    of the Monies, the appellant advanced a distinct but related argument based on
                    the width of the <em>discretion</em> of the Board to
                    authorise withdrawals. She submits that the lack of substantive criteria in
                    s 20(1) indicates that the Board possesses a wide discretion as to whether
                    or not to authorise withdrawals, and that therefore the entitlement should not
                    constitute “property” within the BA. She also points out that
                    s 20(1) merely states that the Board “may” authorise
                    withdrawal by the nominee. We do not think that this argument assisted the
                    appellant in any way. Any discretion, however wide or narrow, has legal limits:
                    see <em>Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs and others and
                        other appeals</em> [1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 at [86]. Proceedings
                    by way of judicial review could be brought against the Board if it wrongfully
                    refused to authorise withdrawal of the monies. Furthermore, the word
                    “may” is not infrequently held to mean “shall”. In
                    the context of the architecture of the CPFA, we do not think that the Board has
                    the discretion to decline to effect payment to a person lawfully entitled to
                    receive the monies in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     To sum up, the appellant’s entitlement
                    to the Monies was a chose in action which came into existence at the point of
                    LLK’s death. Because the appellant was an undischarged bankrupt at that
                    point in time, that chose in action, by operation of s 78(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA, constituted part of the appellant’s
                    estate in bankruptcy. Consequently, it automatically vested in the OA by virtue
                    of s 76(1)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the requirements of ss 78(1)(a) and (b) are
                conjunctive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The appellant’s final argument on this
                    issue is that even if s 78(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BA
                    has been satisfied, it is necessary for both limbs of s 78(1) to be
                    satisfied on the basis that the terms “and”, and “shall
                    comprise” are used in the section. The appellant goes on to argue that
                        s 78(1)(<em>b</em>) is <em>not</em> satisfied because she is unable to withdraw the monies until
                    authorised by the Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This argument is entirely without merit.
                    First, as the OA points out, the word “and” may be used in a
                    disjunctive sense, for instance, where the various paragraphs which are joined
                    by the word merely set out a list of different objects or classes of objects,
                    related only by the fact that they qualify to be in that list.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Secondly, the English and Australian courts
                    have interpreted similar provisions in their respective bankruptcy statutes in a
                    disjunctive manner. In <em>Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL and
                        another</em> (1996) 185 CLR 124, the High Court of Australia
                    considered whether the right of appeal of a judgment debtor (the bankrupt)
                    against the judgment formed part of the bankrupt’s estate within the
                    meaning of s 116(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), which is <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with
                    s 78 of the BA. Brennan CJ, McHugh and Gaudron JJ held that
                        s 116(1)(<em>a</em>) was not satisfied because
                    neither the obligation to comply with the judgment nor the right of appeal
                    constituted “property”. They applied <em>In re
                        Rose; Trustee of the Property of E T Rose v Rose</em> [1904]
                    2 Ch 348 (“<em>Re Rose</em>”) and
                    held that s 116(1)(<em>b</em>) was intended to
                    encompass powers of appointment in relation to “property” which
                    could be exercised for the bankrupt’s benefit. As there was no
                    “property” over which the powers could be exercised, they held
                    that this limb was not satisfied (at 133).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The High Court of Australia did not treat both
                    limbs of s 116(1) as having a conjunctive relationship. If both limbs were
                    conjunctive, they need not, having held that s 116(1)(<em>a</em>) was not satisfied, have gone on to consider whether
                        s 116(1)(<em>b</em>) was satisfied. The same
                    approach has been taken by the English courts. In <em>Re
                        Rose</em> itself, Farwell J stated (at 351­–352):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question turns on the construction of the 44th section of the
                        Bankruptcy Act, 1883. ... [T]he 2nd sub-section enacts that [the property of
                        the bankrupt divisible amongst his creditors] shall comprise the following
                        particulars: (i.) all such property as may belong to or be vested in the
                        bankrupt at the commencement of his bankruptcy, or may be acquired by or
                        devolve on him before his discharge; and (ii.) the capacity to exercise and
                        take proceedings for exercising all such powers in or over or in respect of
                        property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit at
                        the commencement of his bankruptcy or before his discharge ... . These two
                        heads comprise all the beneficial interests of the bankrupt <em>which are either property properly so called or general
                            powers.</em> ... <em>I think the powers referred to
                            are those powers which are familiar to all conveyancers and are powers
                            properly so called</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The appellant’s argument that
                        s 78(1)(<em>b</em>) is not satisfied is actually
                    correct because there are no powers of appointment in the present case. But that
                    does not advance her case because s 78(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    has been satisfied, and that alone is sufficient for the entitlement to
                    constitute part of the appellant’s estate in bankruptcy which vests in the
                    OA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue: Whether the discharge revested the entitlement in
                the appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As we have explained (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>–<a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above), the entitlement to the Monies was a chose in action
                    which vested in the OA at the point of LLK’s death. The next issue is
                    whether that entitlement revested in the appellant when she was subsequently
                    discharged from bankruptcy. This issue requires the consideration of the
                    following questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Does a discharge <em>ipso facto</em> revest property in a discharged
                    bankrupt?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     If a
                        discharge does not <em>ipso facto</em> revest property,
                        is the position different if the discharge is granted after a final dividend
                        has been declared by the OA?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether a discharge ipso facto revests property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The appellant’s most promising argument
                    is based on the decision in <em>Chong Chee Keong</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above). The plaintiff was a
                    shareholder of a company which was wound up on 13 August 1999. The Official
                    Receiver (“the OR”) was appointed as the liquidator. On
                    10 December 1999, the plaintiff was made a bankrupt. The OA, <em>qua</em> trustee in bankruptcy of the plaintiff, filed a
                    proof of debt of $682,304 against the company on 21 April 2001. The
                    plaintiff was discharged from bankruptcy on 30 June 2003. On 5 July
                    2004, the OR declared a dividend of 16.33% in the liquidation of the company.
                    The plaintiff applied for a declaration that the money (about $111,420) should
                    be paid over to him personally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Choo Han Teck J granted the declaration.
                    He accepted the OA’s argument that the plaintiff’s right to claim
                    the dividend, <em>qua</em> chose in action, vested in the
                    OA. He stated (at [2]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Official Assignee disputed the claim on the ... basis that the whole
                        of the plaintiff’s property and assets had been vested in the Official
                        Assignee upon the bankruptcy of the plaintiff. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the Official Assignee submitted that the phrase,
                        “things in action” [in s 2(1) of the BA] meant
                        “chose-in-action”, and that denoted a right to claim property.
                            <em>These statements are accurate and correc</em>t,
                        but the issue was a narrower one and it was whether the Official Assignee
                        was <em>still</em> entitled to money <em>claimed during bankruptcy (when the chose-in-action vested with
                            him)</em>, but only due after the certificate of discharge had
                        been given…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, he went on to decide that the chose in action (which was
                    vested in the OA) <em>reverted</em> to the plaintiff after
                    his discharge. He stated (at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A preservation of [the right to any money that might be due after the
                        certificate of discharge was granted] is important because the certificate
                        of discharge is a statutory instrument that wipes the slate clean for the
                        bankrupt so that he might carry on with his life afresh, free of past debts
                        and liabilities. The certificate of discharge is a document that certifies
                        and declares to the world at large that no more debt is owed by the
                        discharged bankrupt. <em>Any residual rights must revert to
                            the discharged bankrupt</em>. <em>That being the
                            case, any money that comes subsequently into the Official
                            Assignee’s hands must be turned over to the discharged bankrupt
                            unless the Official Assignee had expressly reserved that money as a
                            condition to the discharge.</em> ... <em>Without
                            that reservation, the Official Assignee can retain the money only if the
                            certificate of discharge is set aside by the court.</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We had some difficulty with this particular
                    conclusion and therefore at the conclusion of the hearing on 13 April 2011
                    directed both parties to tender further submissions on (a) the effect (if
                    any) of a discharge from bankruptcy on property rights which are vested in the
                    OA, and (b) whether <em>Chong Chee Keong</em> was
                    correctly decided. In its further submissions, the OA argues that <em>Chong Chee Keong</em> is wrong and should be overruled for
                    the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     The concept of an express
                        reservation of rights by the OA is not contained in the BA and is
                        inconsistent with ss 127 and 128 thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     Choo J was correct to state that a
                        discharge releases a bankrupt from almost all of the debts which were
                        provable in his bankruptcy, and therefore wipes the slate clean for him so
                        that he may carry on with his life afresh free of past debts and
                        liabilities. However, it did not follow that “residual rights must
                        revert to the discharged bankrupt”. The concept of residual rights
                        which reverted to the discharged bankrupt is not contained in the BA and is
                        inconsistent with ss 127 and 128 thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Section 127(1) of the BA provides that a
                    discharge releases the bankrupt from <em>all</em> debts
                    provable in his bankruptcy. The proviso, <em>viz</em>,
                    “[s]ubject to this section and any condition imposed by the court under
                    section 124 or 126”, is a qualification to that broad proposition.
                    In other words, the discharged bankrupt is <em>not</em>
                    released from the following categories of provable debts: (a) debts
                    specified in s 127 itself; and (b) debts which are specified by the
                    court pursuant to its power under ss 124 or 126.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Section 127(1) goes on to state that the
                    fact that the bankrupt is released from most debts provable in his bankruptcy
                    does not have any effect on the functions of the OA (so far as they remain to be
                    carried out). The appellant notes that the Discharge Order was an
                    “absolute” order of discharge, <em>ie</em>,
                    one without any conditions specified therein. She argues that because the
                    Discharge Order was absolute in nature, there were no residual functions of the
                    OA to be discharged and that, therefore, the order had the effect of
                    automatically revesting the entitlement to the Monies in her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We do not accept this argument. The reference
                    to conditions imposed by the court under ss 124 or 126 merely qualifies the
                    general proposition that the bankrupt is discharged from all debts provable in
                    his bankruptcy. In other words, <em>if</em> the court had
                    specified that the appellant was not to be released from a particular debt or
                    particular category of debts, then this condition would be given effect by
                    virtue of the proviso to s 127(1). The <em>absence</em> of such a condition means that (if no debts specified in
                    s 127 are in issue) the bankrupt is released from <em>all</em> debts provable in his bankruptcy. This does not answer the
                    question of whether or not a discharge (whether absolute or conditional) has the
                        <em>additional</em> effect of revesting property, over
                    and above releasing the bankrupt from all debts provable in his bankruptcy. We
                    pause here to note that apart from releasing the discharged bankrupt from most
                    debts provable in his bankruptcy, a discharge also has the following beneficial
                    effects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     All property which is acquired by or
                        devolves on him <em>after</em> discharge will belong to
                        him: see ss 75(<em>b</em>), 78(1)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     He is freed from the legal and practical disabilities of
                        being an undischarged bankrupt: see ss 75(<em>b</em>), 130, 131.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We agree with the OA that a discharge in
                    itself does not have the effect of revesting property in the bankrupt and that
                    therefore <em>Chong Chee Keong</em> is wrong on this point.
                    First, the statutory provisions plainly contemplate that the administration of
                    the bankrupt’s estate may still continue after discharge. While
                    s 127(1) provides that the discharge has no effect on the functions of the
                    OA (so far as they remain to be carried out), s 128(1) clearly
                    contemplates, as the OA argues, that property remains vested in it because
                    s 128(1) provides that a discharged bankrupt shall provide assistance in
                    the realisation and distribution of “such of his property as is
                    vested” in it. Reading both sections together, it can be concluded that
                    certain functions of the OA may remain to be carried out in relation to the
                    realisation and distribution of the bankrupt’s estate even after the
                    bankrupt has been discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The other provisions of the BA also lend
                    support to the view that a discharge does not automatically revest property.
                    Although Parliament expressly provided in s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) that the property of the bankrupt <em>automatically </em><em>vests</em> in the OA at
                    the <em>onset</em> of bankruptcy, s 127(1) is
                    significantly <em>silent</em> as to any revesting of
                    property upon discharge which marks the <em>end</em> of
                    bankruptcy. By contrast, the provisions on annulment <em>expressly</em> provide that an annulment has the effect of revesting
                    property. An annulment may be granted (a) by a court order pursuant to
                    s 123 of the BA, or (b) by a certificate of the OA pursuant to either
                    ss 95A or 123A of the BA. All three sections provide that upon an annulment
                    the “property of the bankrupt” will generally “revert to
                    the bankrupt”: see, for instance, s 123(3). In <em>Tan Teck Guan v Mapletree Trustee Pte Ltd (trustee of Mapletree Industrial
                        Trust)</em> [2011] 3 SLR 1031 (“<em>Tan Teck Guan</em>”), Chan Seng Onn J held (at [14]), following English, Australian and
                    Malaysian authorities, that annulment “has the effect of wiping out the
                    bankruptcy altogether and putting the bankrupt in the same position as if there
                    had been no bankruptcy order made against him”. He added (at [15]) that this did not mean that annulment
                    had retrospective effect for all intents and purposes, such as where exceptions
                    to the general rule were created by the provisions of the BA. We agree with
                    Chan J’s analysis in <em>Tan Teck Guan</em>.
                    Given that Parliament expressly provided that property would in general revest
                    in the “bankrupt” upon an annulment, it is very unlikely that the
                        <em>same</em> effect would be achieved by means of a
                        <em>discharge</em> given that s 127 is silent on
                    this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Apart from the difference in wording of the
                    relevant provisions, the difference in the effect of an annulment as compared to
                    a discharge is also supported by the difference in the objectives of the two
                    regimes. A discharge, while acknowledging that the bankrupt was rightly made a
                    bankrupt, is intended to give him “a second chance in life”: see
                        <em>Re Siah </em><em>Ooi
                        </em><em>Choe, ex parte </em><em>Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 706
                    at [9]. By contrast, an annulment
                    “neither casts any aspersions nor provides any indication <em>vis-à-vis</em> the conduct of the person subject to the
                    bankruptcy order”: see <em>Tan Teck Guan</em> at
                        [27].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Furthermore, s 122, which provides that
                    the bankrupt “shall be entitled to any surplus remaining after payment in
                    full of his creditors” with interest and of the bankruptcy expenses,
                    contemplates that the bankrupt will obtain property from his estate only if
                    “his creditors” have been paid in full. This phrase, <em>viz</em>, “his creditors”, has been interpreted
                    in <em>In re Ward</em> [1942] 1 Ch 294
                        (“<em>Re Ward</em>”) at 297–298 by
                    Farwell J to refer to all creditors who have proved in the bankruptcy, and
                    not all creditors in general regardless of whether or not they have proved in
                    the bankruptcy. Although it is not necessary to decide this point in this
                    appeal, we think that Farwell J’s approach is a sensible interpretation of
                    s 122 which strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of the
                    creditors and the bankrupt. Nonetheless, the point which is material in this
                    appeal is that the revesting of property upon discharge will <em>in effect</em> circumvent s 122 because the discharged bankrupt
                    will be obtaining property which constituted part of his estate without having
                    paid off his creditors in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Secondly, the proposition that a discharge
                    does not automatically revest property is supported by the objectives of the
                    discharge regime. During the Second Reading of the Bankruptcy Bill, the then
                    Minister for Law, Professor S Jayakumar stated as follows (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (25 August 1994) vol 63 at cols 400–402):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me, Sir, highlight, first, <em>the main weaknesses of
                            the present legislation which the Bill seeks to address. Firstly, the
                            difficulty in obtaining a discharge from bankruptcy</em>. It is
                        now not possible for a bankrupt to be discharged unless he settles his debts
                        in full or proposes a scheme of arrangement or composition which is
                        acceptable to the creditors. Many creditors are also not prepared to accept
                        realistic proposals for settlements. In short, there is very little
                        incentive for the bankrupts to actively seek a discharge by disclosing their
                        assets and cooperate with the Official Assignee in the administration of
                        their estates.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The second main feature of this Bill is to encourage
                            entrepreneurship where bankrupts who have become so through misfortune
                            rather than malpractice will be subjected to a more practical and
                            pragmatic regime of bankruptcy. A major innovation is the provision for
                            a discharge by certificate of the Official Assignee</em>. Under
                        this scheme, where proven debts do not exceed $100,000, a debtor can be
                        discharged from bankruptcy after five years. However, unlike the position in
                        the United Kingdom and Australia, there will not be any automatic discharge.
                        In deciding whether to issue a certificate, the Official Assignee will be
                        guided by a number of factors, including the circumstances in which the debt
                        was incurred, the bankrupt's conduct and the extent of cooperation given to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To facilitate easier discharges by the court in other cases, for example,
                        beyond $100,000, the requirements for an application to the court have also
                        been simplified and subject to certain safeguards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The existing scheme and procedures for the settlement of debts through a
                        scheme of arrangement or composition offer have been rationalised and
                        improved. <em>Hence, it will result in creditors recovering
                            their moneys more quickly and will also expedite
                        discharges.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is not unlikely that although the OA may not have completed the
                    realisation and distribution of the estate in bankruptcy, he may yet be of the
                    opinion that, after taking into account all relevant circumstances, a bankrupt
                    is nonetheless deserving of discharge. Should a discharge have the effect of
                    automatically revesting property, this consideration will militate against a
                    decision to grant a discharge by the OA or the court. This would not be an
                    interpretation of the BA which accords with its purpose of facilitating
                    discharges where appropriate. It is no answer to this to say that the court can
                    always impose conditions to prevent the revesting of property. As we have
                    explained (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above), the reference in s 127 to
                    conditions imposed by the court under ss 124 or 126 is a qualification to
                    the general principle that the bankrupt is released from all debts provable in
                    his bankruptcy. These conditions are not relevant to the vesting of property,
                    which is a distinct issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Thirdly, the courts in England and Australia
                    have adopted the same interpretation of their respective bankruptcy statutes in
                    relation to the effect of a discharge, <em>ie</em>, that it
                    does not in itself have the effect of revesting property. These decisions are
                    highly persuasive in so far as the relevant provisions are <em>in
                        pari </em><em>materia</em> with those in the BA.
                    In <em>Pegler v Dale</em> (1975) 6 ALR 62, S and F had
                    an interest in a mortgaged property. The mortgagee paid the balance of the
                    monies from the sale of the property into court. S had been made a bankrupt on
                    23 April 1963 but was automatically discharged on 4 March 1971. S and
                    F argued that the automatic discharge had revested S’s share of the
                    balance in her (at 63):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first and second defendants submit that the effect of s 153 ...
                        after the automatic discharge of 1971, is to revest the property in the
                        former bankrupt. Subsection (1) of s 153 appears to give some support
                        to this contention, because it says that, subject to the section:
                        “Where a bankrupt is discharged from a bankruptcy, the discharge
                        operates to release him from all debts (including secured debts) provable in
                        the bankruptcy ...”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Needham J rejected this argument (at 63–64):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was attracted to this argument until counsel for the plaintiff directed
                        my attention to s 152(1) ... which reads as follows: “A
                        discharged bankrupt shall, notwithstanding his discharge, give such
                        assistance as the trustee reasonably requires in the realization and
                        distribution of such of his property as is vested in the trustee.”
                        The only way that I can see that property of the bankrupt is vested in the
                        trustee is by virtue of the sequestration order. <em>If
                            property so vested in the trustee continues to be vested in the trustee
                            after discharge, as </em><em>s 152(1)
                            indicates</em>, <em>then the operation of
                            </em><em>s 153 in discharging the bankrupt
                            from debts cannot have the effect of revesting</em> in the
                        bankrupt the property which was under the sequestration order vested in the
                        trustee. [emphasis added]</p>

                    was followed and applied by Barrett J in <em>Re Emilco Pty
                        Ltd</em> [2001] NSWSC 1035, who stated (at [38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Jaa Jaa’s discharge from bankruptcy did not cause the debt
                        to re-vest in him. This is made clear by the decision of the Court of Appeal

                        reason is that <em>nothing in the Bankruptcy Act effects any

                            property as is vested in the trustee”, makes it plain that that

<p class="Judg-1">Although the Australian Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provides for an
                    automatic discharge after a specified period of time, the BA does not. However,
                    the reasoning of the Australian courts does not turn on the fact that discharges
                    may occur automatically under their bankruptcy statute. Instead, their reasoning
                    hinges on s 152(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) which is <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with
                    s 128 of the BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The English courts have also adopted the same

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was held, in <em>In re Coulson</em> [[1934]
                        1 Ch 45], that the power under [s 25 of the Bankruptcy Act
                        1914 (UK) for the examination of a bankrupt] survived the discharge of the
                        debtor from his bankruptcy. <em>A duty still remains on the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Goff J agreed (at 801F–H):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, it is quite clear that the fact that the
                        bankrupt had obtained his discharge does not prevent an order being made
                        under section 25. In the first place, it was decided in <em>In re A Debtor</em> [[1939] 1 Ch 489] that <em>the discharge does not put an end to the bankruptcy for all
                            purposes</em>. There, Sir Wilfred Green M.R. said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The court had jurisdiction in bankruptcy under the Act; the
                            order of discharge did not take away the jurisdiction of the Court in
                            Bankruptcy, because admittedly the <em>discharge of the
                                bankrupt does not put an end to the bankruptcy </em><em>regarded as a series of judicial and administrative acts
                                and rights and powers</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In fact, an argument strikingly similar to
                    that of the appellant was advanced in <em>Ex parte Waters; In re
                        Waters</em> (1874) LR 18 Eq 701. In that case, a liquidation petition
                    was filed by two partners. A creditors’ meeting resolved that the partners
                    should be discharged in respect of their partnership liabilities. Subsequently,
                    the trustees in bankruptcy of the partnership discovered that one of the
                    partners (one Robert Waters) had, after the order of discharge was granted,
                    received about £188 on account of the partnership estate. The trustees
                    obtained an order of court that he should pay that sum to them. Mr Waters
                    failed to comply and an order of committal for contempt of court was made. He
                    appealed, arguing <em>inter alia</em> that the money was
                    received after the discharge was granted. Sir James Bacon CJ dismissed
                    the appeal on the basis of s 19 of the Bankruptcy Act 1869 (c 71)
                    (UK), which was as follows (at 702, footnote (2)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The bankrupt shall, to the utmost of his power, aid in the realization of
                        his property, and the distribution of the proceeds amongst his creditors
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sir James Bacon CJ stated as follows (at
                    702–703):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Between liquidation and bankruptcy there is for this purpose no
                        distinction. <em>Nor is there any distinction by reason of
                            the fact that the debtors’ discharge had been granted before this
                            money was misapplied</em>. The discharge only releases them from
                        the debts provable in the liquidation, and not from the obligation to
                        perform the duties prescribed by the statute during the liquidation. ...
                        That it was the plain duty of this debtor <em>to assist the
                            trustees to the utmost of his power in the realization and distribution
                            of the estate</em>, no one can doubt. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     
          <em>Re Landau</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>–<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above) also stands for the proposition that a discharge
                    does not in itself revest property in the bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For these reasons, we hold that a discharge
                    does not <em>ipso facto</em> revest property in the
                    discharged bankrupt. The bankrupt’s discharge releases “him”
                    from the debts and does not affect the <em>debts</em>
                    themselves. As Kala Anandarajah et al, <em>Law and Practice of
                        Bankruptcy in Singapore and Malaysia</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1999)
                    explains (at p 437):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Discharge only <em>releases</em> the bankrupt from
                        provable debts not expressly allowed to continue by statute or court order.
                        Discharge does not, however, destroy the debts altogether as if they had
                        never existed. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, those creditors whose debts are provable in the
                    bankruptcy and from which the bankrupt is released due to s 127 are left to
                    prove in the bankruptcy against the bankrupt’s estate, which is vested
                    (and remains vested) in the OA for this purpose. In <em>Law
                        Society v Shah</em> [2009] Ch 223, it was argued that the
                    effect of a discharge was to “extinguish” debts provable in the
                    bankruptcy. Floyd J rejected this argument (at 237A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is only the <em>remedy of enforcement as against the
                            bankrupt</em> which is extinguished, the creditor being left to
                        the collective enforcement procedure under the [Insolvency Act 1986 (UK)] to
                        secure satisfaction of the underlying cause of action <em>out
                            of the estate in the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy</em>,
                        perhaps only to the limited extent that he can. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discharge after final dividend has been declared</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     A possible argument that could have been
                    advanced by the appellant is that even if a discharge does not automatically
                    revest property, the discharge will have that effect <em>if</em> it is granted after a final dividend has been declared by the
                    OA. Although s 127(1) provides that a discharge does not have any effect on
                    the functions of the OA which remain to be carried out, no such functions remain
                    to be carried out if the OA has already declared a final dividend. Such a
                    declaration signifies the end of the administration of the bankrupt’s
                    estate, and therefore property should revest in the discharged bankrupt upon
                    discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On the facts of this appeal, the OA had given
                    notice to the creditors that it <em>intended</em> to
                    declare a first <em>and final</em> dividend, and the last
                    day for creditors to come in to prove their debts had already expired (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). It, however, appears that the
                    final dividend has not yet been declared: the Summons also contained a prayer to
                    amend the Discharge Report to state that the OA will be able to declare a
                    “first and final dividend of about 9.078%”. Nonetheless, we are of
                    the opinion that it would be desirable in the interest of legal certainty for
                    the wider community to consider the applicable principles in the event that the
                    final dividend <em>had</em> been declared by the
                OA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Section 119(1) of the BA states that the
                    OA shall declare a final dividend when it has realised all the bankrupt’s
                    estate or so much of it as can, in its opinion, be realised without needlessly
                    protracting the proceedings in bankruptcy. Section 119(2) states that the
                    notice given by the OA “shall require <em>claims</em> against the bankrupt’s estate <em>to
                        be established</em> by a date ... specified in the notice”
                    [emphasis added]. Section 119(4)(<em>b</em>) provides
                    that, after the final date, the OA shall declare and distribute the final
                    dividend “without regard to the claim of any person in respect of a debt
                    not already proved in the bankruptcy”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In <em>Re Ward</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above), Farwell J held (at
                    297–298) that where all the creditors who had proved in the bankruptcy had
                    been paid in full, the residue of the bankrupt’s estate constituted
                    “surplus” within the equivalent of s 122 of the BA. The fact
                    that there were other creditors who had not been paid was irrelevant because the
                    Act “contemplates that there shall be finality” (at 297). This
                    finding was made by Farwell J after having considered s 65 of the
                    Bankruptcy Act 1914 (UK), which provided that a creditor who proves his debt
                    after the declaration of a dividend is still entitled to be paid “any
                    dividend or dividends he may have failed to receive”. Section 65 is
                        <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em>
                    with s 118 of the BA. We agree with Farwell J’s analysis. It
                    follows that the operation of s 118 is limited to interim dividends,
                        <em>ie</em>, dividends which are not
                final.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Although the <em>ratio</em> of <em>Re Ward</em> is confined to a
                    situation where the creditors who had proved in the bankruptcy had been paid in
                    full, Farwell J’s reasoning, <em>viz</em>, that
                    there should be finality in terms of the identity of the creditors who are
                    entitled to a portion of the bankrupt’s estate, applies with equal force
                    even where creditors who have proved in the bankruptcy have <em>not</em> been paid in full. The presence or absence of a
                    “surplus” has no bearing on the question of whether a creditor has
                    submitted his proofs of debt by the final date. If a creditor fails to submit
                    his proofs of debt in time, such a creditor has only himself to blame. If there
                    is property which comes to light after the final dividend has been declared,
                    creditors who have not proved are <em>not</em> entitled
                    (a) to rely on s 118(2) to claim a share of that property in
                    satisfaction of the <em>past</em> dividends which they
                    failed to receive, or (b) to claim <em>future</em>
                    dividends which are declared from the realisation of that property. In other
                    words, the class of creditors who are entitled to dividends is crystallised on
                    the final date (or extended final date).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     This interpretation of the effect of a final
                    dividend is supported by a consideration of the legislative history of the BA
                    and its associated subsidiary legislation. Forms 113 and 114 of the Bankruptcy
                    Rules 1967 (S 64/1967) (“the 1967 Rules”) are as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Take notice that a final dividend is intended to be declared in the above

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Forms 113 and 114 are <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with Forms 123 and 124 of the Bankruptcy Rules
                    1886 (UK). Form 113 merely states that a failure to prove by the stipulated date
                    would exclude the creditor from “this dividend”. By contrast, Form
                    114 is worded in stronger language. The use of the phrase “your claim
                    will be expunged” is an indication that creditors who have not proven in
                    the bankruptcy by the final date will not be able to subsequently come in and
                    claim any dividends (whether past or future), because their claims against the
                    estate will be treated as being non-existent for the purpose of the
                    administration of the bankrupt’s estate. It is telling that while Form 114
                    refers to a “claim” being expunged, ss 27 and 29 of the
                    Second Schedule to the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 18, 1970 Rev Ed) refer only
                    to a “proof” being expunged:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27. If the official assignee thinks that a proof has been improperly
                        admitted the court may on his application, after notice to the creditor who
                        made the proof, expunge the proof or reduce its amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29. The court may also expunge or reduce a proof upon the application of a
                        creditor if the official assignee declines to interfere in the matter, or in
                        the case of a composition or scheme upon the application of the
                        debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This interpretation is supported by Ian F Fletcher,
                        <em>The Law of Insolvency</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2009, 4th Ed) at para 10-043:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where there is to be a final dividend, s.330(3) [of the Insolvency Act
                        1986 (UK) which is <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with s 119(3) of the BA] provides that the
                        court may, on the application of any person, postpone the final date by
                        which the trustee’s notice requires claims against the
                        bankrupt’s estate to be established, but in the absence of such a
                        postponement the insolvent administration enters its final phase, and the
                        trustee will, after the final date has passed, defray any outstanding
                        expenses of the bankruptcy (or liquidation) out of the funds remaining in
                        his hands, and thereafter duly declare and distribute the final dividend
                        among the proving creditors. <em>Thereafter, any creditor who
                            has failed to establish his claim by lodging proof in time will receive
                            nothing, although (in the case of bankruptcy) the debt, as one of the
                            bankruptcy debts, will be discharged through the process of
                            bankruptcy</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The present Form 37 in the Bankruptcy Rules
                    (Rg 1, 2006 Rev Ed) is as follows:</p>
<p align="center" class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>NOTICE TO CREDITORS OF INTENTION
                            TO DECLARE DIVIDEND</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Take notice that a [first] [second] [final] dividend is intended to be
                        declared in the above matter and that if you do not establish your claim to
                        my satisfaction on or before
                        the       day of 20 you will be excluded
                        from this dividend and I shall proceed to make the dividend without regard
                        to your claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is apparent that Form 37 is an amalgamation of the old forms,
                        <em>viz</em>, Forms 113 and 114 of the 1967 Rules,
                    without the phrase “your claim will be expunged”. The absence of
                    this phrase is not a sufficient indication of a legislative intention, over and
                    above an intention to simplify the bankruptcy procedures, to alter the
                    applicable legal principles governing the effect of a final dividend.
                    Furthermore, the phrase was retained in Form 50 of the Companies (Winding
                    Up) Rules (Rg 1, 2006 Rev Ed) which is <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with the old Form 114
                    of the 1967 Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Having considered the effect of a final
                    dividend in principle, we now turn to the question of whether a discharge
                    granted after a final dividend has been declared has the effect of revesting
                    property. Where the discharge is granted after the final dividend falls short of
                    satisfying the creditors who have proved in the bankruptcy before the final date
                    in full, a revesting of property would <em>in effect</em>
                    disrupt the statutory allocation of rights embodied in s 122 (see <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above). This is because the discharged
                    bankrupt would be obtaining property which formed part of his estate without
                    having satisfied the conditions stipulated by s 122. For this reason, a
                    discharge granted in such circumstances does not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> revest property in the discharged bankrupt. Therefore, if
                    any property which forms part of the estate in bankruptcy comes to light after
                    discharge, that property must <em>prima facie</em> be
                    realised by the OA in favour of the bankruptcy expenses and the creditors who
                    have proved in the bankruptcy before the final date in so far as they have not
                    yet been paid off in full. As for creditors who have not proved by the final
                    date, they are not entitled to claim any share of such property: see <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>–<a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Where the discharge is granted after a final
                    dividend of 100%, <em>ie</em>, where all the creditors who
                    had proved in the bankruptcy by the final date have been paid in full, the
                    requirements of s 122 have been met. Any property which subsequently comes
                    to light will be held by the OA on trust for the discharged bankrupt
                    beneficially: see <em>Bird v Philpott</em> [1900]
                    1 Ch 822 at 828. This is not because of the discharge <em>per se</em> but because the purpose for which the property is
                    held by the OA has been achieved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedure for revesting to occur</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We have held that a discharge does not revest
                    property (which is vested in the OA) in the discharged bankrupt, regardless of
                    whether the discharge occurs before or after the OA has declared the final
                    dividend (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>–<a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> above). If a discharged bankrupt desires that
                    a particular item of property in his estate, or his entire estate, should revest
                    in him for some reason, it would be prudent for him first to contact the OA to
                    state his reasons and/or proposals. If the OA agrees with him, then it is for
                    the OA to carry out the necessary steps for the transfer of title to the
                    discharged bankrupt. If the OA disagrees, or imposes conditions with which the
                    discharged bankrupt disagrees, then he should apply to the court pursuant to
                    s 31 of the BA for review of the OA’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Although the terms of s 31 of the BA
                    leave it open to the discharged bankrupt to apply directly to the court without
                    first contacting the OA, we think that it would be sensible for the course of
                    action outlined above to be adopted. If the OA agrees with the discharged
                    bankrupt’s representations, then the cost and time of the application and
                    hearing would be saved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For the above reasons, we dismiss the appeal.
                    No order is made as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     We observe that the letter of
                    18 September 2008 from the Board to the appellant (which appears to be the
                    first time she was contacted by either the Board or the OA in connection with
                    this matter) stated that the Monies would be released to the OA because she was
                    an undischarged bankrupt. There were no subsequent representations made to the
                    contrary to the appellant by the OA or the CPF Board. The fact that the Monies
                    were only paid to the OA after the appellant’s discharge from bankruptcy
                    was due to an oversight on the OA’s part. The appellant was not misled in
                    any way by the OA and the Board. It follows that she did not rely to her
                    detriment on any mistaken perception created by the OA or the Board that she was
                    entitled to the Monies. In fact, it was incumbent on the appellant to aid to the
                    utmost of her power in the realisation of her property and the distribution of
                    the proceeds among her creditors by the OA: see s 129(1)(<em>i</em>) of the BA. Given that she was told by the Board that the
                    Monies were due to the OA because she was an undischarged bankrupt at the time
                    of LLK’s death, she cannot then seek to take advantage of the OA’s
                    oversight by claiming ownership of the Monies.</p>
