text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 In a case where there was a series of physical assaults involving a number of perpetrators and a number of victims, but not all the perpetrators were involved in assaulting each victim, what is the evidence required before a finding can be made that there was a common object among the perpetrators to voluntarily cause hurt to <span class="font-italic">all</span> the victims? This was the key question I had to consider in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The five appellants met at a bar on the evening of 30 April 2017. The four victims were also at the same bar then. Following an evening of drinking, the five appellants and the four victims left the bar separately in the early hours of 1 May 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Subsequently, at an open carpark near the bar, three incidents of violence took place. None of these incidents involved an attack by <span class="font-italic">all</span> five appellants on <span class="font-italic">all </span>four victims. Rather, as I set out at [18]–[30] below, each victim was attacked at a different point of time and each victim was not attacked by all the appellants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Despite the above, the Prosecution preferred a charge under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”) against each appellant for being a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to all four victims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The appellants claimed trial to their corresponding charge under s 147 of the Penal Code in the court below. At the conclusion of the trial, the appellants were each found guilty and convicted of a charge under s 147 of the Penal Code. Thereafter, the District Judge (the “DJ”) sentenced the appellants to imprisonment terms ranging between 12 months and 18 months. The appellants filed appeals challenging their convictions and sentences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 While various arguments had been canvassed in the course of the appeal, one argument, in my view, was critical in deciding this appeal. Given the manner in which the Prosecution had framed the charge against the appellants, the Prosecution needed to show that the appellants possessed a <span class="font-italic">common object</span> to voluntarily cause hurt to all four victims. The appellants argued that the Prosecution had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden of proving such a common object beyond reasonable doubt. The Prosecution, on the other hand, submitted that sufficient evidence had been adduced in the court below to show that the three incidents of violence were closely linked and that the appellants had possessed a common object.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I allowed the appellants’ appeal against conviction in relation to each of their charges under s 147 of the Penal Code. The appellants’ convictions and sentences in relation to the charge under s 147 of the Penal Code were set aside, and the appellants were acquitted of their respective charge under s 147 of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I then invited the parties to submit on whether altered charges could be framed against the appellants based on the facts proven in the court below, as allowed for under s 390(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”). Having considered the parties’ submissions on this point, I framed altered charges under s 323 of the Penal Code and s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code against the appellants based on their respective involvement in the hurt caused to the four victims. The specific charges which I framed against each appellant can be found at [114]–[127] below. I then invited the parties to submit on the appropriate sentences to be imposed in relation to the altered charges. The appellants sought fines, while the Prosecution sought short custodial sentences. Ultimately, I decided that fines were appropriate given the minor nature of the injuries sustained by the victims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 For completeness, two of the appellants also appealed against the custodial sentences imposed on charges which they had pleaded guilty to in the court below. I dismissed these appeals as the sentences were not manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I set out the detailed grounds of my decision below, incorporating the oral remarks which I delivered at the hearings for this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The five appellants (collectively, the “Appellants”) were:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Mr Michael Marcus Liew (“Michael”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Mr Cheo Lye Choon (“Lye Choon”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Mr Tok Meng Chong (“Meng Chong”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Mr Ng Wan Seng (“Wan Seng”); and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Ms Chan Hui Yi Regina (“Regina”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Michael, Lye Choon, Meng Chong and Wan Seng were friends from school. Regina was Wan Seng’s girlfriend at the material time. The Appellants met at a bar at Tebing Lane, Frienzie Bar and Bistro (the “Bar”), for drinks on the evening of 30 April 2017.

While they were each able to describe the events that took place at the Carpark to varying degrees, this did not affect their credibility and the reliability of their testimonies as: (i) there were many persons at the Carpark at the material time and the Victims would not have been able to witness everything that took place; and (ii) the discrepancies in the Victims’ testimonies were minor and could be attributed to memory lapses due to the passage of time.

Wan Seng’s explanation of this inconsistency was that the statement recorder had failed to record what Wan Seng had said about four to five people surrounding Michael.

The DJ found that the incident had commenced with Michael kicking the Car. Thereafter, Michael kicked Daniel, which was the start of the riot. This was followed by Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong and Michael assaulting George in the vicinity of Lot 55. Regina then “joined in the group’s violence” by assaulting Maureen who was rushing towards George. Regina also assaulted Sreelatha who came to help Maureen. Therefore, the DJ found that the Appellants had participated in the unlawful assembly as a result of their individual actions of assaulting at least one of the Victims.

Briefly, after the events at the Carpark, police officers arrived in response to the call made by Maureen. Michael was instructed by the police officers to stay with his friends at one side of the Carpark. He defied the orders of the police officers and walked over to the Victims and shouted vulgarities at them. Michael ignored several warnings by the police officers to calm down and move away from the Victims. He then walked up to a police officer and shouted loudly in the police officer’s face, challenging his authority as a police officer, and refused to step back despite being asked to do so.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> For completeness, I briefly summarise the reasons which underpinned that decision: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Section 392 of the 2012 CPC allowed for fresh evidence to be adduced on appeal subject to the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> conditions being satisfied. However, in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat v Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [72], citing <span class="font-italic">Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 3 SLR 299 at [16]), the Court of Appeal endorsed a less restrictive approach to be adopted in criminal cases: <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, while the three <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> conditions of “non-availability”, “relevance” and “reliability” applied in criminal cases, the first condition of “non-availability” was less paramount than the other two conditions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It was clear that the condition of non-availability was not satisfied. The two psychiatric reports assessed the mental state of Michael and Lye Choon <span class="font-italic">at the time of the offences</span>, which necessarily meant that such evidence could have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial. Further, Michael and Lye Choon were advised and represented by counsel in the court below, albeit different from the counsel representing them at the appeal. I also noted that counsel in the court below had advanced an argument that Michael and Lye Choon had been intoxicated, though no expert evidence had been adduced to substantiate this argument. Notwithstanding that they had been represented at trial, I accepted that Michael and Lye Choon may not have appreciated the full significance of their mental state and the need to adduce evidence which would have substantiated their claims that they had been intoxicated.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The two psychiatric reports by Dr Tan were <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> relevant as they went towards establishing the defences of intoxication which were relevant to determining part of Michael’s and Lye Choon’s arguments on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In assessing whether the condition of reliability was satisfied, I was mindful of the Court of Appeal’s reminder in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>(at [74]) that, when assessing whether to grant leave to adduce additional evidence, the court needed to only assess the <span class="font-italic">reliability</span> of the psychiatric reports, and not the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of the psychiatric reports. In other words, I only had to consider whether the psychiatric reports were apparently credible. I took the view that the psychiatric reports were not completely devoid of credibility. However, I expressed significant reservations over the contents of the psychiatric reports for two reasons: (i) whether Michael and Lye Choon had been intoxicated to the extent that they would not have had the necessary <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> was an ultimate issue for the court to determine, and not an issue for Dr Tan to determine by way of the two psychiatric reports; and (ii) the psychiatric reports asserted that Michael and Lye Choon had blood alcohol concentration levels which were significantly higher than the levels determined by the HSA. While Dr Tan’s conclusion on the blood alcohol concentration levels were based on a backward extrapolation, there was no mention in the two psychiatric reports of the <span class="font-italic">specific</span> method used by Dr Tan to perform a backward extrapolation, and it appeared that Dr Tan based his conclusions only on the accounts provided by Michael and Lye Choon of the amount of alcohol they had consumed before the events at the Carpark.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Ultimately, however, given the Court of Appeal’s reminder in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>(at [74]), I granted the applications in CM 61 and CM 62. This was subject to the Prosecution being allowed to cross-examine Dr Tan on the two psychiatric reports. I also granted leave to the Prosecution to adduce a medical report from the Institute of Mental Health (the “IMH”) if they thought it necessary.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Since CM 76 was ancillary to CM 61, and I granted the application in CM 61 for Dr Tan’s Psychiatric Report for Michael to be adduced as fresh evidence, I similarly granted the application in CM 76 for the HSA Report for Michael to be adduced as fresh evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As a consequence of my decision, the case was remitted to the court below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The remittal hearing in the court below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 At the remittal hearing, Michael and Lye Choon relied on Dr Tan’s evidence.

This was evidenced by the fact that Michael remembered walking to his car alone and unassisted, despite the objective facts showing otherwise, and the fact that he remembered a “fat Malay lady” cursing that she was in pain. Further, Michael recalled being in a police lock-up for two to three nights despite contrary evidence. Finally, Michael recalled that a blood test had taken place but was unable to recall the reason for the blood test.

Examples of Michael’s conduct which demonstrated that he retained awareness included the fact that he could navigate to where he had parked his car in the Carpark and was able to draw a sketch plan when his statement was recorded, which marked out where his car was parked, as well as the buildings around him and where the commotion at the Carpark occurred.

This was evident from Michael’s ability to avoid exhibiting any violence towards the police officers when he had behaved in a disorderly manner (an offence which he pleaded guilty to – see [42(a)] above). Michael’s ability to refrain from committing violence when the police officers arrived also demonstrated that Michael understood the difference between right and wrong.

Therefore, it could not be said that Michael had no capacity at all to form the requisite criminal intent. In the case of Lye Choon, Dr Tan conceded during cross-examination that the objective evidence and findings of fact made at the end of trial pointed to a conclusion that Lye Choon should have had a certain level of awareness and intention when he had engaged in violence.

Rather, they took into account objective facts which had been proven and established at trial. In the case of Michael, Dr Mak considered other sources of evidence, including the DJ’s GD and the Statement of Facts for the Disorderly Behaviour Charge to which Michael had pleaded guilty. This was primarily because Michael’s account was that he could not recall in detail the events that had occurred. In the case of Lye Choon, Dr Guo adopted a similar approach, considering the findings of fact made by the DJ in the DJ’s GD, given that Lye Choon had stated that he could not remember the exact details of the events at the Carpark.

Similarly, Dr Guo’s view that Lye Choon had been conscious of what he had done and would have had clear intentions was supported by academic authority.

The evidence supported the DJ’s finding made following the trial that the Appellants had shared a common object to hurt the Victims, and each one of them had been an active participant in causing hurt to one or more of the Victims.

The DJ noted that this was not the defence advanced by Michael and Lye Choon at trial. This new defence was clearly an afterthought. The evidence adduced at trial also showed that Michael and Lye Choon had been aware of what had been happening at the Carpark at the time they had gotten involved.

In the alternative, they argued that there remained reasonable doubt over whether Michael and Lye Choon had been aware of the incident involving Regina, Maureen, and Sreelatha.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 However, the Prosecution failed to address a key aspect of the Appellants’ arguments on appeal in its written submissions – whether the DJ had applied his mind to the issue of whether there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims and, if so, whether the DJ had correctly found that the evidence supported the finding of a common object. In view of this, I directed the parties ahead of the hearing on 19 July 2023 to prepare oral submissions on this issue. At the hearing, the Prosecution made the following submissions in support of its position that there was a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The evidence showed that the Appellants had been aware of the incident between Michael and Daniel near Lot 42.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) While the Appellants took the position that the events which had occurred at the Carpark on 1 May 2017 were three separate incidents, this was not an accurate characterisation of what had occurred. According to the Prosecution, Michael <span class="font-italic">initiated</span> the violence by kicking the Car at Lot 42. This led to a <span class="font-italic">domino effect</span>: (i) first, Daniel alighted from the Car, told Michael to stop kicking the Car and was then assaulted by Michael and, later, various unknown persons; (ii) second, when George alighted from the Car to speak to Michael near Lot 55, he was assaulted by Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong and Michael; and (iii) third, when Maureen ran towards George as she saw him being assaulted, Regina assaulted Maureen and, subsequently, Sreelatha. Therefore, these were not three separate incidents. Rather, the evidence showed that the violence commenced with Michael’s kicking of the Car and progressed with the Appellants behaving aggressively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Appellants did not dissociate themselves from Michael’s violence towards Daniel at Lot 42. Rather, they actively participated in the violence. The reasonable inference from this was that they were aware that George was part of Daniel’s group and wanted to be associated with Michael’s violence towards Daniel. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The post-offence conduct of the Appellants showed that they had wanted to escape, further pointing to their guilt.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) For an offence under s 147 of the Penal Code, there was no requirement to find a <span class="font-italic">common intention</span> among the Appellants. All that was required was a <span class="font-italic">common object</span>. This meant that there was no requirement of a prior meeting of the minds before the formation of the assembly. An unlawful common object could have developed suddenly and on the spot, after the Appellants gathered at the incident location. Accordingly, an assembly which was lawful at its inception could still convert into an unlawful assembly as a result of the actions of its members. On the facts, there was enough evidence to support a finding that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Even if this Court disagreed with the Prosecution’s position that the incidents which had taken place near Lot 55 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the incident where hurt was caused to George by Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong and Michael) and Lots 57 and 58 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the incident where hurt was caused to Maureen and Sreelatha by Regina) were a continuation of the initial assault of Daniel by Michael near Lot 42, the Prosecution alternatively suggested that the Rioting Charge would still have been made out against the Appellants simply by focusing just on the incidents which took place near Lot 55 and Lot 57 and Lot 58. These two incidents occurred concurrently and involved all the Appellants causing hurt to three of the Victims. This would still have amounted to an unlawful assembly involving all the Appellants with a common object to cause hurt to three of the Victims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues which arose for determination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The following issues arose for determination in light of the Appellants’ cases on appeal:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Issue 1: Whether the DJ had erred in preferring the Victims’ evidence over the Appellants’ evidence. As part of my analysis, I considered the arguments by the Appellants in relation to specific findings of fact made by the DJ on the events which occurred at the Carpark.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Issue 2: Whether the DJ had erred in finding that the Appellants had been members of an unlawful assembly <span class="font-italic">whose common object </span><span class="font-italic">had been to voluntarily cause hurt to the Victims</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Issue 3: Whether the DJ had erred in his treatment of the expert evidence at the remittal hearing, and whether the DJ therefore erred in finding that Michael and Lye Choon had not been so intoxicated that they could not have formed the necessary criminal intent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Issue 4: In the event this Court agreed with the Appellants that the DJ had had erred in finding that the Rioting Charge had been made out against each Appellant, whether this Court should frame altered charges against the Appellants based on the facts proven in the court below and the appropriate sentences if altered charges are framed against the Appellants.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Issue 5: Whether the sentences imposed for the Disorderly Behaviour Charge and the Offensive Weapon Charge were manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: Whether the DJ had erred in preferring the Victims’ evidence over the Appellants’ evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I first considered whether the DJ had erred in preferring the Victims’ evidence over the Appellants’ evidence. A summary of the DJ’s reasons for finding that the evidence of the Victims was materially consistent and credible is set out at [39] above, while a summary of the DJ’s reasons for finding that the evidence of the Appellants was not credible is set out at [40] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 From the record, it was clear that the DJ had carefully analysed the evidence and the testimonies of the Victims as well as the Appellants and their witness, Benny. It was clear to me that the findings made by the DJ were not plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence so as to warrant appellate intervention: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [32]. Therefore, I saw no reason to disturb the findings of fact made by the DJ in relation to how the events had unfolded at the Carpark on 1 May 2017 and how the Appellants had been involved in the incidents of violence against the Victims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I make a few observations in response to some of the Appellants’ contentions which I rejected:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was clear to me that the Victims had been able to clearly identify each of the Appellants and their involvement in the events at the Carpark <span class="font-italic">to the extent that they had observed what had occurred</span>. Here, I emphasise that the Victims were candid in stating that they had not observed certain events at the Carpark. For example, George was unaware of who assaulted him near Lot 55 after he fell down as he felt giddy and was unable to get up.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I saw no merit in this argument. It was undisputed that Maureen was the main witness who identified Meng Chong as being involved in the assault on George near Lot 55. The Appellants pointed to the fact that George himself had been unable to identify who had assaulted him near Lot 55. The Appellants also pointed to the fact that Maureen had identified Meng Chong as the “taller guy” when, in fact, Lye Choon was taller than Meng Chong.

</div> This conveniently ignored the fact, however, that Maureen’s identification of Meng Chong was not based <span class="font-italic">solely</span> on his height. Rather, the record clearly showed that Maureen’s identification of the individuals who had assaulted George near Lot 55 was based on the tattoos which they had or did not have – Wan Seng had a tattoo on the left side of his neck, and Lye Choon had a tattoo on the right side of his neck.

</div> While Maureen’s evidence may not have been corroborated by the other Victims, her evidence was not inconsistent with theirs. George stated that there had been at least two people assaulting him. Sreelatha was aware that George was being assaulted but could not see <span class="font-italic">who</span> was assaulting him. Daniel only stated that that he did not notice if anyone was hitting George.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this was a mischaracterisation of George’s evidence. While George had indeed given evidence on Wan Seng’s conduct (of tapping the baton on his own hand), this evidence related to Wan Seng’s conduct when George had initially walked past Wan Seng while proceeding towards Lot 55. In relation to the assault near Lot 55, however, the record clearly showed that George was <span class="font-italic">unaware</span> of who had assaulted him. Therefore, George had given <span class="font-italic">no evidence </span>on whether the baton had been used to hit him. Rather, it was Maureen who gave clear, consistent evidence that Wan Seng had used the baton to hit George. While Wan Seng claimed that Maureen had embellished her evidence, in my view, he did not substantiate this claim in any way. Therefore, I rejected this contention by Wan Seng.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the DJ made no error in finding that the evidence of the Appellants lacked credibility:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In the case of Michael, his defence at the trial was simply a bare denial on the basis that he had been too drunk to remember the events at the Carpark. This was incredible, given that he was able to remember in specific detail what had occurred shortly before he had arrived at the Carpark, including that he had settled the bill and asked for his credit card to be returned. Further, his investigative statement recorded on the day of his arrest showed that he had remembered much more than he claimed to remember at trial. In the circumstances, the DJ did not err in rejecting Michael’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In the case of Lye Choon, his defence at the trial was also simply a bare denial on the basis that he had been too drunk to remember the events at the Carpark. This was similarly incredible, since the evidence of the other Appellants, including Wan Seng and Regina, showed that Lye Choon had been fully conscious and aware of what was going on shortly before the events at the Carpark. He was able to point to where he had parked his e-scooter and was able to ask Wan Seng to retrieve his e-scooter for him. He was also able to somehow remember events which had occurred after the events at the Carpark, including that he had walked to a police station and asked the police officers to allow him to leave so he could go to work the next day. Finally, the evidence of the co-Appellants showed that Lye Choon had proceeded towards the commotion at the Carpark. In the circumstances, the DJ did not err in rejecting Lye Choon’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) In the case of Meng Chong, his defence at trial was that he had not been involved in the violence at the Carpark as he, together with Benny, was taking care of Lye Choon. However, he was positively identified by Maureen as one of the individuals who had assaulted George near Lot 55. Further, as was pointed out by the Prosecution in its written submissions, Meng Chong’s defence was contradicted by his own and Benny’s investigative statements. In his investigative statement, Meng Chong stated that he and Benny had accompanied Lye Choon as Lye Choon walked towards the commotion. Benny also stated in his investigative statement that he and Meng Chong had tried to separate Wan Seng, Regina, and Michael. In the circumstances, the DJ did not err in rejecting Meng Chong’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) In the case of Wan Seng, his defence at trial was that he had held the baton for self-defence, and that he had not assaulted the Victims. Rather, he tried to stop the fight. However, his evidence at trial that four or five persons surrounded Michael was inconsistent with his investigative statement where he had stated that Michael had fought with just one individual. When confronted with this at trial, he alleged that the statement recorder had deliberately chosen not to write down about those four or five persons who had surrounded Michael. This was, however, contradicted by the evidence of the statement recorder who had no reason to lie. In the circumstances, the DJ did not err in rejecting Wan Seng’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) In the case of Regina, I was of the view that the DJ had not erred in rejecting Regina’s defence that she had acted in self-defence. Her testimony that Maureen had hit her first was contradicted by the testimony of the statement recorder. The statement recorder clearly stated that Regina had not informed him that she had sustained any injuries as a result of the events at the Carpark. Further, her account of her actions in self-defence shifted from touching or pushing Maureen to swinging her arm to block Maureen. This pointed to the conclusion that Regina’s defence was not truthful. In the circumstances, the DJ did not err in rejecting Regina’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Given the above, I saw no reason to disturb the findings of fact made by the DJ on the events at the Carpark on 1 May 2017 as well as how the Appellants had each been involved in the incidents of violence at the Carpark.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Whether the DJ had erred in finding that the Appellants had been members of an unlawful assembly whose common object</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">had been </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to voluntarily cause hurt to the Victims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I next considered whether the DJ had erred in finding that there had been a common object among the Appellants to voluntarily cause hurt to the Victims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on common object</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I first summarise the key principles relating to the finding of a common object.

Whether there was a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims was clearly <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span> to the Rioting Charge. Therefore, close attention should have been paid to this issue in assessing whether the Rioting Charge was made out against each Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 This was especially crucial given that this was not a case where the Appellants had collectively assaulted <span class="font-italic">one </span>victim. Rather, as I have set out at [21] to [30] above, the events which occurred at the Carpark on 1 May 2017 involved three incidents of violence at <span class="font-italic">different</span> areas of the Carpark, with each act of violence involving only a <span class="font-italic">few</span> of the Appellants and <span class="font-italic">just one or two</span> of the Victims. In other words: (a) all five of the Appellants did not collectively cause hurt to any one of the Victims; and (b) each Appellant did not cause hurt to <span class="font-italic">all four </span>of the Victims. Further, this was also not a case where the Victims had all been assaulted at once, with one of the Appellants commencing the assault and the co-Appellants participating in the assault thereafter. Rather, the assault on the Victims took place at <span class="font-italic">different points of time</span> in <span class="font-italic">different areas of the Carpark</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 However, because of the framing of each Rioting Charge, the Prosecution sought to hold each Appellant liable for the hurt caused to all four of the Victims. The reason for such framing was obvious – for there to be an unlawful assembly, there must have been <span class="font-italic">five</span> persons involved. However, for liability to be imputed to the Appellants for the hurt caused to all four Victims, it should have been plainly obvious that a finding must first have been made as to whether there was even a common object among <span class="font-italic">all </span>the Appellants to cause hurt to <span class="font-italic">all</span> the Victims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The evidence did not support a finding that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Having reviewed the record on appeal, I found that the evidence did not support a finding that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As summarised at [77] above, the Prosecution’s case was that the three incidents of violence at the Carpark ought to be viewed as a continuing series of violence which had been initiated by Michael’s kicking of the Car at Lot 42. Further, the Prosecution asserted that, because the Appellants had been aware of the incident involving Michael and Daniel at Lot 42, it could be inferred that they had a common object to cause hurt to the Victims. This was because they had <span class="font-italic">failed </span><span class="font-italic">to dissociate</span> from Michael’s act of violence at Lot 42 and, instead, had actively participated in the violence against the other Victims. This, to me, raised a number of issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Given the manner in which the Rioting Charge was framed, the Appellants must have had a common object to cause hurt to Daniel near Lot 42 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The first glaring issue arose from the fact I highlighted at [89] above that the Prosecution’s charge had been framed in a manner which required the Appellants to have had a common object to cause hurt to <span class="font-italic">all four</span> of the Victims. This necessarily meant that, when Daniel had been assaulted by Michael near Lot 42 soon after Michael kicked the Car, the Appellants must have had a common object for hurt to be caused to Daniel. This was crucial, given that Daniel had not been assaulted again by any of the co-Appellants after he had been assaulted by Michael near Lot 42.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In my view, the evidence did not in any way support a finding that the Appellants had a common object to cause hurt to Daniel near Lot 42 for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) According to the Prosecution’s own case, Michael’s act of kicking the Car at Lot 42 and his subsequent assault on Daniel was <span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">start of a domino effect</span> of violence at the Carpark (see [77(b)] above). Nowhere in the Prosecution’s case was there an assertion that <span class="font-italic">all five</span> of the Appellants had a common object to cause hurt to Daniel<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">before </span>Michael had commenced his assault on Daniel. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On the contrary, the evidence showed that the assault by Michael on Daniel had been spontaneous and had arisen in response to Daniel alighting from the Car after Michael had kicked the Car at Lot 42. In such a spontaneous situation which did not involve the co-Appellants, how could the Appellants have formed a common object to cause hurt to Daniel in the time between Michael kicking the Car and Michael assaulting Daniel? This was not addressed by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Further, an added complication in this case was that the assault on Daniel was limited only to the incident at Lot 42. Thereafter, none of the Appellants were involved in assaulting Daniel in any way. How, then, could the Appellants have formed a common object to cause hurt to Daniel? No direct or circumstantial evidence which addressed this issue was adduced in the court below. At the appeal, the Prosecution also failed to account for how such a finding could be made. While the Prosecution pointed to evidence which showed that the other Appellants had <span class="font-italic">subsequently</span> become aware of the assault by Michael on Daniel near Lot 42, this did not allow this Court to make an inference that they had a common object to cause hurt to Daniel <span class="font-italic">at the time Daniel </span><span class="font-italic">had been assaulted by Michael</span>. In my view, for liability to be imposed vicariously on the co-Appellants for the hurt caused by Michael to Daniel, the Prosecution needed to show that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to Daniel <span class="font-italic">at the time Daniel was assaulted by Michael</span>. This was not proven.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Even if the Prosecution’s alternative position was considered, the evidence still did not support a finding of a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to George, Maureen and Sreelatha</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 It appeared from the Prosecution’s oral submissions at the hearing on 19 July 2023 that the Prosecution recognised this difficulty in its case. This perhaps explained why the Prosecution presented an alternative position at the appeal: the Prosecution argued that the Rioting Charge would still be made out even if consideration of the hurt caused to Daniel near Lot 42 was omitted, and this Court only considered the following two incidents of violence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the incident which took place near Lot 55 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the incident where hurt was caused to George by Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong and Michael); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the incident which took place near Lot 57 and Lot 58 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the incident where hurt was caused to Maureen and Sreelatha by Regina).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Prosecution took the position that it could at least be inferred from these two incidents that the Appellants had a common object to cause hurt to three of the Victims, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, George, Maureen, and Sreelatha.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Putting aside that this was inconsistent with the Rioting Charge as originally framed by the Prosecution, this alternative position appeared attractive at first blush, since the events occurred <span class="font-italic">concurrently</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>Further, the DJ found in the court below that Regina had been aware of the incident occurring near Lot 55 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the incident where hurt was caused to George by Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong and Michael) when she had first assaulted Maureen.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 However, upon closer scrutiny, this alternative position ignored a second glaring issue. Regina may have been aware of the incident which took place near Lot 55 when she had commenced her assault on Maureen and Sreelatha. But what was the evidence which supported a finding that <span class="font-italic">Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Chong and Michael were aware of the incident near Lot 57 and Lot 58</span> involving Regina, Maureen and Sreelatha? In order to find a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to George, Maureen and Sreelatha, the Appellants must have at least been aware that hurt was being caused to each of the Victims. On the Prosecution’s own case, the two incidents occurred <span class="font-italic">concurrently</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [77(f)] above). No evidence was adduced to specifically address the question of whether Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong, and Michael had been aware of the incident near Lot 57 and Lot 58 involving Regina, Maureen and Sreelatha at the time of the assault. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I noted that, according to the expert evidence adduced during the remittal hearing, some suggestion was made that Michael and Lye Choon <span class="font-italic">could have been aware</span> of what was happening eight metres away from them (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the incident near Lot 57 and Lot 58 involving Regina, Maureen, and Sreelatha) despite their intoxication. This, however, did not amount to direct or circumstantial evidence that Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong, and Michael had, <span class="font-italic">in fact</span>, been aware of the incident. In the absence of such evidence, no inference could be made that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to George, Maureen, and Sreelatha.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Rioting Charge was therefore not made out against each Appellant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 What was patently clear to me from the glaring issues set out above was that the evidence did not support an inference being drawn of a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to <span class="font-italic">all four</span> of the Victims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Even if the alternative position of the Prosecution were accepted, there must have been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to <span class="font-italic">three</span> of the Victims, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, George, Maureen, and Sreelatha. Given the manner in which the assaults occurred, not all the Appellants were involved in or even aware of the assaults against each of the Victims. This, therefore, created a significant gap which prevented this Court from inferring that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims (whether it concerned all <span class="font-italic">four</span> of the Victims or just <span class="font-italic">three</span> of the Victims).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 For the reasons above, I could not accept the Prosecution’s position that the evidence supported a finding that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims. In my view, the evidence did not lead to an irresistible inference of such a common object.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Given the lack of a common object, I found that the DJ had erred in finding that the Rioting Charge had been made out against each Appellant.

Nonetheless, for completeness, I considered whether the DJ had made any errors in his treatment of the expert evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Having reviewed the DJ’s grounds of decision following the remittal hearing as well as the parties’ submissions, I disagreed with Michael and Lye Choon’s argument that the DJ had erred in his treatment of the expert evidence.

Instead, Dr Tan appeared to maintain that his assessment had been correctly based primarily on the accounts of Michael and Lye Choon, so as to present “another possibility” that ought to “have been taken into consideration”. In <span class="font-italic">Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor </span>[2022] 4 SLR 805, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated that less weight should be placed on an expert report which was entirely predicated on the truthfulness of the information provided by an accused person without relying on any independent information (at [21] and [24]). Therefore, the DJ made no error in finding that Dr Tan’s sole reliance on the self-reported accounts of Michael and Lye Choon affected the cogency of his evidence. Further, as the DJ found, if Dr Tan had considered the independent evidence, this would have allowed him to prepare a better report (see [67(a)(iii)] above). This much was conceded by Dr Tan during cross-examination at the remittal hearing as well.

</div> I ultimately rejected this contention. While both Dr Mak and Dr Guo may not have reviewed the <span class="font-italic">entire </span>Record of Proceedings, the evidence made clear that they had at least looked beyond the accounts of Michael and Lye Choon, and considered some independent evidence. The same could not be said of Dr Tan who had been unable to substantiate his bare assertion that he had <span class="font-italic">skimmed through</span> the Record of Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and more significantly, both Dr Mak and Dr Guo clearly set out the basis of their conclusions. In the case of Michael, Dr Mak assessed Michael’s mental state on the basis of three objective criteria – awareness, control and his understanding of the rightness and wrongness of his actions. In the case of Lye Choon, Dr Guo explained how his finding that Lye Choon’s alcohol-induced amnesia did not affect his consciousness and ability to form a criminal intention was supported by academic authority. As the Prosecution highlighted in its written submissions, Dr Tan had agreed, as a general principle, with Dr Guo’s conclusion that alcohol-induced amnesia did not necessarily mean that an offender would have been unable to form a criminal intention.

However, counsel for Michael submitted that it would be prejudicial if the altered charge made reference to Wan Seng’s use of the baton in the incident near Lot 55. This was because the other participants in the incident near Lot 55 had not been examined in the court below on whether they had been aware of Wan Seng’s baton or if they had shared a common intention for Wan Seng to use the baton during the incident.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Ultimately, I found that the appropriate altered charge to be framed against Wan Seng was a charge under s 323 of the Penal Code. However, notwithstanding that this was the outcome sought by Wan Seng, the reasons for my decision differed from the reasons provided by Wan Seng’s counsel. I set out counsel’s arguments on prejudice as well as my reasons for framing a charge under s 323 of the Penal Code below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Counsel for Wan Seng first pointed to the fact that Wan Seng had already pleaded guilty to the Offensive Weapon Charge, which was inextricably linked to Wan Seng’s use of the baton to hit George’s back. Further, the evidence showed that Wan Seng’s use of the baton to hit George’s back had occurred soon after the Offensive Weapon Charge. Therefore, it was submitted that framing an altered charge under s 324 of the Penal Code against Wan Seng would have been prejudicial, since the use of the baton would have already been a key element of the charge under s 324 of the Penal Code and there would have been “double-counting” of the same fact.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I disagreed with this argument. In my view, it was clear that, when Wan Seng had used the baton in a public place to hit George’s back, two distinct offences had been committed – an offence of being armed with the baton, and an offence of using the baton to cause hurt to George. Under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MOA, an offence was committed simply when an offender (in the present case, Wan Seng) was armed with any dangerous or offensive instrument without lawful authority or a lawful purpose. Therefore, the Offensive Weapon Charge only captured one of the two distinct offences which had been committed by Wan Seng, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his possession of the baton. On its own, the Offensive Weapon Charge did not address the further offence committed by Wan Seng when he used the baton to hit George’s back. There would have not been any “double-counting” if a charge under s 324 of the Penal Code were preferred. Further, if there was a concern at all that Wan Seng was being punished twice for the same set of facts of being armed with a baton which he had then used to hit George’s back, this would have been a concern to be addressed at the sentencing stage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Counsel also argued that there would have been prejudice caused to Wan Seng because of the stage of proceedings<span class="font-italic"> </span>at which the charge under s 324 of the Penal Code had been preferred. According to Wan Seng’s counsel, had a charge under s 324 of the Penal Code and the Offensive Weapon Charge been preferred against Wan Seng at the outset, Wan Seng would have had the opportunity to explore various legal options. These could have included arriving at a plea bargain with the Prosecution to either have the charge under s 324 of the Penal Code reduced to s 323 of the Penal Code on condition of a guilty plea, or to have the Offensive Weapon Charge taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing if he pleaded guilty to the charge under s 324 of the Penal Code. Those options were no longer available to Wan Seng.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, however, prejudice would not have been caused to Wan Seng simply because various options relating to plea bargaining were no longer available to him. As was made clear by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">GDC v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 5 SLR 1130 (at [29]), the key question was whether the proceedings below would have taken the same course and the evidence led would have been the same had the altered charge been presented at the trial. In this regard, it was important to remember that Wan Seng’s defence in the court below had been a bare denial. Even at the appeal stage, Wan Seng maintained that he had not used the baton to hit George, and had also not kicked or punched George.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-a2fcaadd-3350-4eca-b75b-7893d01ef27d" data-toggle="modal" type="button">152</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, Wan Seng’s argument that he could have considered engaging in plea bargaining could not be squared with the reality that his defence, from his first statement recorded on 1 May 2017 until the appeal, was that he had not hit anyone. I therefore disagreed with counsel’s arguments relating to prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In my view, however, there was a different reason why it was inappropriate to frame an altered charge under s 324 of the Penal Code against Wan Seng. For a charge to be made out under s 324 of the Penal Code, there must have been a finding of fact that the baton used by Wan Seng <span class="font-italic">was an instrument which, </span><span class="font-italic">when used as a weapon of offence, was likely to cause death</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Hoe Leong v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 337, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) suggested that this was a question of fact for the court to decide (at [26]). Based on the records of the present case, there was no such finding of fact that, or indeed consideration at all as to whether, the baton, when used as a weapon of offence, was one which was likely to cause death. Further, the Offensive Weapon Charge under the MOA to which Wan Seng pleaded guilty only required that the baton be an offensive instrument. In the absence of a finding of fact that the baton was likely to cause death when used as a weapon of offence, I found it inappropriate to frame an altered charge under s 324 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Therefore, I exercised power under s 390(4) of the CPC to frame the following charge against Wan Seng in relation to his use of the baton to hit George near Lot 55: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You, <span class="font-weight-bold">NG WAN SENG</span>,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">are charged that you, on 1 May 2017, at or around 2.16 am, in the vicinity of 10 Tebing Lane, Singapore, did cause hurt to G K Karunan George, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by using a 60 cm black baton to hit his back, intending to cause him hurt, and thereby causing him tenderness on his left posterior lower ribs, and you have committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">It was appropriate to frame two altered charges against Regina</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I next considered whether it was appropriate to frame altered charges against Regina.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Assault on Maureen near Lot 57 and Lot 58</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In relation to the assault on Maureen near Lot 57 and Lot 58, the Prosecution and counsel for Regina were broadly in agreement that there was sufficient evidence based on the records to constitute a case against Regina.

Accordingly, I exercised my power under s 390(4) of the CPC to frame the following charge against Regina:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You, <span class="font-weight-bold">CHAN HUI YI REGINA</span>, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">are charged that you, on 1 May 2017, at or about 2.16 am, in the vicinity of 10 Tebing Lane, Singapore, did cause hurt to Sreelatha Thankamaniamma, <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by hitting her right eye and lip, intending to cause her hurt, and thereby causing her an injury to her eye, and a cut on her lip, and you have committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Appellants declined to offer defences to the altered charges and were, therefore, convicted of the altered charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Following my decision to frame altered charges against the Appellants, I invited the Appellants to state whether they intended to offer defences to the altered charges framed against each of them as required under s 390(6) of the CPC. The Appellants indicated that they did not intend to offer defences to the altered charges framed against each of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence based on the records before this Court to convict the Appellants of the altered charges, and I exercised my power under s 390(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC to the convict the Appellants of the altered charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sentences which were imposed in relation to the altered charges framed against the Appellants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The parties were then invited to submit on the appropriate sentences for the altered charges which the Appellants were convicted of. The Appellants relied on the sentencing framework in <span class="font-italic">Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 5 SLR 526 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Song Chye</span>”) for offences under s 323 of the Penal Code. The Appellants submitted that their offences as encapsulated in the altered charges fell within Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Low Song Chye </span>sentencing framework. Given the minor nature of the injuries caused to the Victims, the Appellants submitted that fines were appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In contrast, the Prosecution submitted that short custodial sentences ought to be imposed for each of the altered charges which the Appellants were convicted of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In arriving at the appropriate sentences for the altered charges which the Appellants were convicted of, I considered the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, I considered that the injuries sustained by the Victims were minor in nature: (i) Daniel had suffered pain in his lower abdominal; (ii) George had suffered pain on the left side of his head and tenderness on his left posterior lower ribs; (iii) Maureen had suffered a hematoma over her left temporal occipital and a superficial bruise over her right hand; and (iv) Sreelatha had suffered a minor injury to her eye and a cut on her lip. None of these injuries were significant. Based on the Victims’ injuries alone, the Appellants’ offences under s 323 of the Penal Code fell within the lower end of Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Low Song Chye </span>sentencing framework which covered minor injuries (<span class="font-italic">Low Song Chye</span> at [80]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there were several factors which enhanced the culpability of the Appellants:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The Appellants' voluntary intoxication was undeniably an aggravating factor: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Satesh s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Navarlan</span> [2019] SGHC 119 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Chung Wan v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 5 SLR 858 at [57]; <span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 115 at [44] and [49]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon</span> [2018] 4 SLR 1294 at [56].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The incident involving the assault on George by Michael, Lye Choon and Meng Chong near Lot 55 was a group attack. Aedit Abdullah J stated in <span class="font-italic">Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 5 SLR 881 (at [14]) that an assault by a group as against that by an individual generally entails a greater degree of culpability as “the victim is outnumbered, and generally overwhelmed”. In my view, however, this had to be balanced against the fact that the injuries actually sustained by George were minor despite the group attack.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Further, Wan Seng’s use of the baton to assault George was undeniably an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Finally, Michael and Regina each assaulted <span class="font-italic">two</span> of the Victims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Having considered the aggravating factors alongside the minor nature of the injuries sustained by the Victims, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence for each of the altered charges which the Appellants were convicted of was a high fine.

</div>
</div> the principle of deterrence was clearly engaged given that the Disorderly Behaviour Charge involved Michael challenging the authority of a police officer and refusing to step back despite being asked to. More significantly, the facts showed that Michael had not just challenged the authority of the police officers but had acted in <span class="font-italic">gross defiance</span> of the directions of the police officers. Michael walked towards the Victims and shouted vulgarities at them despite being told to stay with the rest of the Appellants at one side of the Carpark.

</div> In my view, there was a clear need to deter such conduct.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, I found that the reported precedents were not particularly helpful. This was because the offenders in both cases had faced <span class="font-italic">multiple</span> charges for their conduct against the police officers:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In <span class="font-italic">Gao </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengkun</span>, aside from the charge of behaving in a disorderly manner, the offender was also convicted of a charge under s 353 of the Penal Code for using criminal force on a police officer and a charge under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) for his use of insulting words against the police officer. In particular, all three charges covered the offender’s conduct against a police officer and arose in the course of a single incident. It therefore made sense for the individual sentences for the less serious charges to be calibrated downwards to account for the deterrent sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment imposed for the charge under s 353 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In <span class="font-italic">Loy Xue Song</span>, aside from the charge of behaving in a disorderly manner, the offender faced a second charge of using criminal force against a police officer under s 353 of the Penal Code. Again, both charges covered the offender’s conduct against a police officer and arose in the course of a single incident. It therefore made sense for the individual sentence for the less serious charge, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the charge of behaving in a disorderly manner, to be calibrated downward to account for the deterrent sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment imposed for the charge under s 353 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) In contrast, Michael’s conduct in the Disorderly Behaviour Charge was completely distinct from his earlier instance of violence towards some of the Victims. The sentence imposed for the Disorderly Behaviour Charge had to adequately reflect the principle of deterrence which was engaged. A custodial sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment could not, therefore, be said to be manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I also considered whether the total sentence imposed on Michael for the Disorderly Behaviour Charge and the two altered charges under s 323 of the Penal Code and s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code accorded with the totality principle.

</div>
</div> It is trite that unreported decisions lack sufficient particulars to paint the entire factual landscape required to appreciate the reasons for the sentences imposed: <span class="font-italic">Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Hanib v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2022] SGHC 101 at [173]. The reason for placing little, if any, weight on an unreported precedent is that it is unreasoned, and it is therefore not possible to discern what weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge: <span class="font-italic">Janardana </span><span class="font-italic">Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1288 at [13(b)]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, what was crucial was that neither the Prosecution nor counsel who represented Wan Seng in the court below had cited <span class="font-italic">any</span> reported precedents. This much was clear from the record. All that was placed before the DJ for consideration were the unreported precedents cited by the Prosecution. In the circumstances, the DJ considered that sentences in the range of three to six months’ imprisonment were <span class="font-italic">typically</span> imposed for offences under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MOA. The DJ then agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was appropriate on account of the following factors: (i) the length of the baton used by Wan Seng was about 60cm, which was rather long; (ii) Wan Seng had carried the baton around in his van, as opposed to an offender who spontaneously picked up a weapon which he innocuously came across; and (iii) the baton had been used to cause hurt to George. I failed to see how the DJ could be faulted in his approach given the parties’ submissions in the court below on the Offensive Weapon Charge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even at the appeal, counsel for Wan Seng did not cite any reported precedents to show that the appropriate sentence was an imprisonment term not exceeding one month. In contrast, the Prosecution pointed to several reported precedents which showed that sentences in the range of three to six months’ imprisonment had previously been imposed for offences under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MOA.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) While I noted that the offensive weapon in question was a baton as opposed to a more dangerous weapon, such as a knife, I did not find that the sentence of three months’ imprisonment imposed by the DJ was manifestly excessive in view of the aggravating factors highlighted above. While I allowed Wan Seng’s appeal against conviction in relation to the Rioting Charge, that was on the basis that there was no evidence of a <span class="font-italic">common object</span> among the Appellants. However, I did not disturb the findings of fact made by the DJ on the events which had unfolded at the Carpark. Therefore, the fact remained that Wan Seng had <span class="font-italic">used</span> the baton to cause hurt to George which formed an altered charge which he was convicted of. In the circumstances, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was wholly justified and was not manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I also considered whether the total sentence imposed on Wan Seng for the Offensive Weapon Charge and the altered charge under s 323 of the Penal Code accorded with the totality principle.

The DJ had carefully analysed the evidence and the testimonies of the witnesses. It was clear that the DJ’s findings on the events at the Carpark and how the Appellants were each involved were not plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. Appellate intervention was not warranted.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, I found that the DJ had erred in finding that the Appellants had been members of an unlawful assembly who had a common object to voluntarily cause hurt to the Victims. Given the lack of evidence which supported that there had been a common object among the Appellants to cause hurt to the Victims, the DJ ought not to have convicted each Appellant of the Rioting Charge. In the circumstances, I allowed the Appellants’ appeals against conviction in relation to their respective Rioting Charge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, given my finding above, it was not strictly necessary to determine whether the DJ had erred in his treatment of the expert evidence at the remittal hearing. However, having reviewed the parties’ submissions and the DJ’s grounds of decision following the remittal hearing, I disagreed with the submissions by Michael and Lye Choon. The DJ made no error in finding that the Dr Tan’s evidence was not cogent. The DJ correctly found that the evidence of Dr Mak and Dr Guo were cogent and based on objective evidence apart from the self-reported accounts of Michael and Lye Choon. Given this, the DJ rightly found that Michael and Lye Choon had not been so intoxicated that they could not form the necessary criminal intent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, I found that there was sufficient evidence based on the records to constitute a case against each Appellant for their respective involvement in assaulting the Victims. There was also no prejudice caused to the Appellants if altered charges were framed against them. Accordingly, I framed altered charges against the Appellants. The Appellants did not offer defences to the altered charges and were, therefore, convicted of the charges. I set out below a summary of the altered charges which they were convicted of and the sentences which were imposed on each of them:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In the case of Michael, he was convicted of an altered charge under s 323 of the Penal Code for his assault on Daniel at Lot 42, and a charge under s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code for his involvement in the assault on George near Lot 55 together with Lye Choon and Meng Chong. A fine of $3,000 (with a default sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment) was imposed on Michael for the charge relating to his assault on Daniel at Lot 42. A fine of $4,000 (with a default sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment) was imposed on Michael for the charge relating to the assault on George near Lot 55 by Michael, Lye Choon and Meng Chong.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In the case of Lye Choon, he was convicted of an altered charge under s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code for his involvement in the assault on George near Lot 55 together with Michael and Meng Chong. A fine of $4,000 (with a default sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment) was imposed on Lye Choon.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) In the case of Meng Chong, he was convicted of an altered charge under s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code for his involvement in the assault on George near Lot 55 together with Michael and Lye Choon. A fine of $4,000 (with a default sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment) was imposed on Meng Chong.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) In the case of Wan Seng, he was convicted of an altered charge under s 323 of the Penal Code for his use of the baton to assault George near Lot 55. A fine of $5,000 (with a default sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment) was imposed on Wan Seng.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) In the case of Regina, she was convicted of two altered charges under s 323 of the Penal Code for her assault on Maureen and Sreelatha near Lot 57 and Lot 58. A fine of $3,000 (with a default sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment) was imposed for each of the two altered charges which Regina was convicted of. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, I found that the sentences imposed for the Disorderly Behaviour Charge and the Offensive Weapon Charge were not manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In view of the above, I allowed the Appellants’ appeals against conviction in relation to their respective Rioting Charges. The Appellants were therefore acquitted of their respective Rioting Charges, with each of their convictions and sentences for the charge set aside and altered charges framed against each of them. They were convicted of the altered charges, and fines were imposed for each of the altered charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 With respect to the Michael’s Disorderly Behaviour Charge, I dismissed his appeal against the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment as the sentence was not manifestly excessive.
