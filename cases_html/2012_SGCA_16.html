<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Orchard
                        Capital I Limited v Ravindra Kumar Jhunjhunwala</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 185 (“the GD”). The Respondent had applied
                    to stay the action brought by the Appellant against the Respondent. The
                    application was dismissed by an Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) and
                    the Respondent appealed. The Judge allowed the appeal and stayed the action
                        <em>sine die</em> with liberty to restore. The
                    Appellant brought the present appeal against that decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This is a deceptive case – simple in terms
                    of issue but hugely complex in terms of legal principles. Pared down to its
                    essence, we have on the one hand a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause that points
                    to Hong Kong and, on the other, the fact that the defendant (who has applied for
                    a stay of the Singapore action) is resident in Singapore. In such circumstances,
                    ought – and this is the central issue before this court – the
                    Singapore action to be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>? To add an ironic twist, perhaps, the applicable legal
                    principles in relation to <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                    have hitherto been considered to be one of the more well-established areas of
                    Singapore law in general and the conflict of laws in particular. Whence, then,
                    does the legal complexity just alluded to originate from?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Put simply, the legal complexity lies in
                    ascertaining the legal effect of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses in general
                    and the specific clause in relation to the present appeal in particular. Much of
                    the learning in the local context (and, dare we say, in the Commonwealth context
                    as well) may be found in the comprehensive article by one of our leading local
                    legal scholars in the field (see Yeo Tiong Min, “The Contractual Basis of
                    the Enforcement of Exclusive and Non-Exclusive Choice of Court
                    Agreements” (2005) 17 SAcLJ 306 (“<em>Yeo</em>”)). However, despite the excellent breadth as well as
                    depth of analysis in this article, many questions remain unanswered. Sadly, some
                    will continue to remain unanswered as there was no reference by either party
                    either to this article or (and more specifically) to one central strand of
                    issues. As we shall see, however, there has – fortuitously, perhaps
                    – been no detrimental effect in the context of the present appeal based on
                    the facts before us. In particular, the parties’ arguments were not
                    affected and that part of the article which could have been (but was not) raised
                    in argument before us did not (in any event, as we shall see below (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>)) affect the result of the present appeal.
                    But, henceforth, lawyers would do well to pay close attention to this article
                    should an issue relating to jurisdiction clauses, both exclusive and
                    non-exclusive, arise before the Singapore courts in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       With these preliminary observations in mind, let
                    us turn briefly to the background leading to the present appeal. As already
                    alluded to above, it is in fact very straightforward.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant is an exempt limited liability
                    company registered in the Cayman Islands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Appellant is a special
                    purpose vehicle set up to effect financial investments, specifically in a
                    company known as Orind Global Holdings Ltd (“OGHL”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    The Respondent is a Singaporean Permanent Resident of Indian
                        nationality.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Respondent carried on
                    the business of manufacturing and trading in refractories.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    The Appellant and the Respondent entered into three contracts in February 2007
                    (collectively, “the Three Contracts”), comprising a note purchase
                    agreement, an investment deed, and a 3.5% redeemable exchangeable convertible
                    promissory note, respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       According to the Appellant, the Respondent
                    failed to meet his obligations pursuant to the Three Contracts. In an attempt to
                    resolve matters amicably, the Appellant and the Respondent entered into a
                    Settlement Agreement (“the Agreement”) on 28 May 2010. The
                    relevant provisions of the Agreement are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As is evident from clause 8(i)(a) of the
                    Agreement above, the Respondent was to pay the sum of US$2,500,000 to the
                    Appellant by 28 November 2010. The Respondent allegedly failed to make such
                    payment and so the Appellant commenced Suit No 8 of 2011
                    (“S 8/2011”) on 7 January 2011 to enforce its claim
                    under clause 8(iv) of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 7 March 2011, the Respondent applied to
                    stay S 8/2011 on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>. The crucial clause (<em>viz</em>, the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause), in respect of the
                    Respondent’s application as well as the present appeal, is to be found in
                    clause 23 of the Agreement (“the Clause”) and reads as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Respondent’s application was heard by
                    the AR on 21 April 2011. He refused to grant a stay of
                        proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Against this decision, the
                    Respondent appealed to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision in the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Respondent’s appeal was allowed by
                    the Judge on 3 August 2011. The Judge’s decision, in granting a stay
                    of proceedings, is encapsulated within the following paragraphs of the GD (at
                        [3]–[5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Both parties cited <em>Spiliada
                                Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em>
                            [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”) in support. It seems clear that the
                                <em>Spiliada</em> requires a court, in an
                            application for a stay of proceedings application on the ground of
                                <em>forum non conveniens</em>, to determine on
                            the balance of all competing factors, which forum would be the more
                            clearly appropriate one. Given that the action to be stayed was
                            commenced here, the allegation that this was not the appropriate forum
                            meant that the burden lies with the applicant to show which was the more
                            appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    In this case, the only material factors facing off
                            were the fact that the parties had chosen Hong Kong as the appropriate
                            forum, and the fact that the appellant and his family are resident here,
                            and he appears to have business in Singapore although the respondent had
                            acknowledged that the original contracts were made to further the
                            appellant’s business in “India, China and USA”. The
                            respondent’s counsel conceded that witness testimony in this case
                            was not material as the claim would be essentially a construction of the
                            contract. The original contracts specified Hong Kong to be the exclusive
                            jurisdiction whereas the settlement agreement specified Hong Kong as the
                            non-exclusive jurisdiction. Performance under the settlement agreement
                            was to be made by payment into a Citibank account in
                        America.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    Generally, when the court is of the view that the
                            factors are evenly balanced, it would conclude that the defendant had
                            failed to discharge its burden of proving that there was another more
                            appropriate forum. However, in the simple and straightforward contest
                            between the two factors here, I am of the view that the selection of
                            Hong Kong as the jurisdiction of choice was sufficient discharge of the
                            appellant’s burden, there being no evidence of any unforeseen
                            circumstances outside the parties’ contemplation at the time the
                            settlement agreement was concluded, that renders that choice
                            inappropriate or unjust. It was clear to the parties that the
                            appellant’s business could have taken him to China, India, USA or
                            here. Further, there is no reason to believe that the respondent would
                            have any difficulty enforcing a Hong Kong judgment against the appellant
                            in Singapore. Thus, for the reasons above, the appeal is allowed and the
                            action herein be stayed <em>sine die</em> with
                            liberty to restore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The resultant issue is, as set out at the
                    outset of this judgment, a simple one: ought the action begun by the Appellant
                    to be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non
                    conveniens</em>? The real question, however, hinges on the legal effect of
                    the Clause (bearing in mind that it is a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause)
                    – for much will flow from our finding in this particular
                regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Appellant contended that the key issue for
                    determination is whether the Respondent had discharged his burden of proving
                    that Hong Kong is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore.
                    This contention was founded on the well-established test expounded in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em>
                    [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”). The principles laid down in <em>Spiliada</em> are an established part of the Singapore legal
                    landscape. As observed by this court in <em>JIO Minerals FZC and
                        others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (at
                    [38]-[39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    The general
                            principles to be applied in the context of the present appeal are
                            well-established and may be traced back to the seminal House of Lords
                            decision of <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex
                                Ltd</em> (“<em>Spiliada</em>”). Indeed, the principles set out in
                                <em>Spiliada</em> have been approved and
                            applied a great many times by the Singapore courts. The applicable
                            principles were recently summarised in the decision of this court in
                                <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em>
                                (“<em>CIMB Bank</em>”), as
                            follows (at [25]-[26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">25    The <em>locus
                                    classicus</em> on the question of when a stay would be
                                granted on the basis of <em>forum non
                                    conveniens</em> is <em>Spiliada Maritime
                                    Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC 460
                                    (‘<em>Spiliada</em>’), a
                                decision of the House of Lords where Lord Goff of Chieveley, in
                                delivering the leading judgment, laid down certain guiding
                                principles (at 476-478) for determining the question of
                                    <em>forum non conveniens</em> (‘the
                                    <em>Spiliada</em> test’). Those
                                principles have been adopted by this court in several cases such as
                                    <em>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT
                                    Airfast Services Indonesia</em> [1992]

                                    Hern</em>, <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue
                                    Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd</em> [2001]

                                    Investments</em>’).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">26    The gist of these principles is that, under the
                                doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, a
                                stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is
                                some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the
                                action. The burden of establishing this rests on the defendant and
                                it is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or
                                appropriate forum. The defendant must also establish that there is
                                another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more
                                appropriate than Singapore. The natural forum is one with which the
                                action has the most real and substantial connection. In this regard,
                                the factors which the court will take into consideration include not
                                only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the
                                availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law
                                governing the transaction and the places where the parties
                                respectively reside or carry on business. If the court concludes, at
                                this stage of the inquiry (‘stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test’), that there is no
                                other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the
                                trial of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this
                                stage, it concludes that there is some other available forum which
                                    <em>prima facie</em> is clearly more
                                appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a
                                stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice
                                requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. In this
                                connection, the court will consider all the circumstances of the
                                case. For this second stage inquiry (‘stage two of the
                                    <em>Spiliada</em> test’), the legal
                                burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of those
                                special circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    We will, in fact, proceed to analyse the facts of
                            the present appeal in accordance with the two stages enunciated in
                                <em>Spiliada</em> and, consistent with the
                            terminology adopted in <em>CIMB Bank</em>, will
                            refer to each stage as “stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test” and “stage two of the
                                <em>Spiliada</em> test”,
                            respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The thrust of the Appellant’s case was
                    that the Clause, in and of itself, did not suffice in discharging the
                    Respondent’s burden of proving that Hong Kong is a distinctly more
                    appropriate forum. As a corollary to this argument, the Appellant contended that
                    the Judge had erred in concluding that the parties had selected Hong Kong as
                        <em>the</em> appropriate forum. In advancing this
                    contention, the Appellant focused on the purported nature of the Clause which
                    was non-exclusive. The Appellant contended that the Clause only demonstrates
                    that Hong Kong is <em>an</em> appropriate forum while
                    parties are at liberty to commence proceedings in other forums. Towards this
                    end, the Appellant relied upon both local and foreign case law, as well as
                    academic literature. The main authorities and literature cited by the Appellant,
                    as well as the Appellant’s arguments founded upon them, are summarised
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Appellant first cited the Singapore High
                    Court decision of <em>OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua
                        Choon</em> [2010] 4 SLR 904 (“<em>OCBC
                        Capital</em>”) where the parties entered into an agreement
                    containing a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause (clause 9.5) which read as
                    follows (see <em>OCBC Capital</em> at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    This Agreement and the rights and duties of the
                            parties hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in
                            accordance with, the laws of Malaysia and in relation to any legal
                            action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this
                            Agreement (‘Proceedings’), the parties irrevocably submits
                                [<em>sic</em>] to the non-exclusive
                            jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia, and waive any objections to
                            Proceedings in any court on the grounds that the Proceedings have been
                            brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Such submission shall however not affect the right
                            of OCIA to take Proceedings in any other jurisdiction nor shall the
                            taking of Proceedings in any jurisdiction preclude OCIA from taking
                            Proceedings in any other jurisdiction and OCIA shall be at liberty to
                            initiate and take actions or Proceedings or otherwise against [the
                            defendant] in Malaysia and/or elsewhere as OCIA may deem
                        fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In response to proceedings brought under this agreement, the
                    defendant in that case applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground of
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em>. One of the issues that
                    the court had to consider was the effect of the non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause (<em>ie</em>, clause 9.5). The court held that,
                    on a plain reading of clause 9.5(b) above, the plaintiff (<em>ie</em>, OCIA) could commence proceedings in any other
                    jurisdiction (see <em>OCBC Capital</em> at [16]). In relation to clause 9.5(a), the
                    court interpreted the portion of the clause concerning a waiver of any
                    objections to proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> as applying to only proceedings in Malaysia (see
                        <em>OCBC Capital</em> at [21]). Accordingly, the usual principles governing applications
                    for a stay of proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>) were applicable. In the course of applying the principles in
                        <em>Spiliada</em>, the court had to consider the role
                    of the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. The court cited several decisions
                    which took the view that the effect of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause was
                    that the parties could not argue that the selected non-exclusive forum was
                    inappropriate (see <em>OCBC Capital</em> at
                    [41]–[43]). In the court’s view, therefore, the legal consequence of
                    the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause was that the selected forum was <em>an</em> appropriate forum. In the final analysis, however,
                    the court considered that the defendant had not discharged his burden of proving
                    that another forum was clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore
                    (see <em>OCBC </em><em>Capital</em>
                    at [49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant next relied upon the treatise by
                    Prof Adrian Briggs, <em>Agreements on Jurisdiction and
                        Choice of Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 2008) (“<em>Briggs</em>”), in which the learned author summarised
                    the various interpretations of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, as follows
                    (at para 4.20):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suppose for example, that the parties agree that the courts of Ruritania
                        are to have non-exclusive jurisdiction, and say no more about it than that.
                        There are, in fact, several ways to interpret their agreement. They may have
                        agreed (1) that either side may seise the nominated court, but that the
                        freedom of the other to seise any other court or courts is unrestricted; or
                        (2) that either side may seise the nominated court, and once this is done,
                        making it the first court to be seised, the jurisdiction of that court
                        becomes exclusive; or (3) that either side may institute proceedings, in any
                        court, but if either party then seises the nominated court, any proceedings
                        in the first court will be discontinued and the defendant will appear and
                        defend in the nominated court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant, not surprisingly, contended that only the first
                    interpretation stated above was applicable on the facts of this case as neither
                    party had instituted proceedings in Hong Kong, the nominated forum. Hence, it
                    was argued that the Clause did not limit the Appellant’s right to commence
                    proceedings in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Appellant also relied on the Hong Kong
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Noble Power Investments Ltd v
                        Nissei Stomach Tokyo Co Ltd</em> [2008] 5 HKLRD 632
                        (“<em>Noble</em>”), the salient facts of
                    which are as follows. The first plaintiff in <em>Noble</em>
                    was a company registered in the British Virgin Islands whilst the second
                    plaintiff and the defendant were entities registered in Japan. The parties
                    entered into an agreement known as a “Cooperation Agreement”.
                    Disputes subsequently arose when the defendant informed the second plaintiff
                    that it was repudiating its obligations under the “Cooperation
                    Agreement”. The plaintiffs accepted the repudiation and claimed damages
                    from the defendant by commencing action via a writ. However, leave of court was
                    required to serve the writ upon the defendant as it was a Japanese company. The
                    defendant objected to the grant of such leave on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In the course of adjudication, the court
                    had to consider the effect of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause contained
                    within the “Cooperation Agreement” which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.1  This Agreement shall be construed and governed in
                            accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and the parties hereto submit to
                            the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.4  Nothing contained in this Clause shall limit the
                            right of any party to take any suit, action or proceedings arising under
                            this Agreement against the other parties in any other court of competent
                            jurisdiction, nor shall the taking of any suit, action or proceedings
                            arising under this Agreement in any one or more jurisdictions preclude
                            the taking of any suit, action or proceedings arising under this
                            Agreement in any other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not, to the
                            extent permitted by the law of that jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court in <em>Noble</em> considered the
                    effect of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses at some length, as follows
                        (at [31]–[33]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    In considering the
                            effect of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, it is critical to
                            recognize that there are differences in approach depending upon where
                            proceedings have been instituted. Where proceedings are instituted in
                            the named forum (to which the parties have agreed to submit), the party
                            who seeks a stay or otherwise to contest the jurisdiction or
                            appropriateness of that forum, has a very heavy burden to discharge,
                            since that party has by definition agreed contractually to submit to the
                            jurisdiction. In other words, he is seeking to avoid a forum to which he
                            has, by contract, agreed to submit. The extent of this burden is
                            discussed below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    Where,
                            however, proceedings are instituted in a forum <em>other than</em> the identified one, an altogether
                            different approach may be required. Here, much depends on the precise
                            wording of the clause in question. If the other forum is one to which
                            the parties have also agreed to <em>submit</em> in the event of their being sued, it may be
                            that there is little difference between the two situations. Where,
                            however (as is more common) the other forum is merely one in which
                            proceedings can be instituted without any obligation on the party sued
                            actually to submit to that forum, the approach is different. The party
                            who then seeks to contest the jurisdiction or appropriateness of that
                            forum is in a better position so to do (compared with the situation
                            articulated in the previous paragraph) simply because he would not be
                            seeking to avoid a forum to which he has contractually agreed to
                            submit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    Some simple
                            illustrations to summarize the foregoing propositions might
                            assist:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(1)    A sues B in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is named as a
                                non-exclusive jurisdiction to which the parties have agreed to
                                submit in the event of their being sued. The burden on B, if he
                                contests the appropriateness of the Hong Kong courts, is a heavy
                                one.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    A sues B in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is on this
                                occasion not named as a jurisdiction but the courts of, say, Japan
                                are named as the non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, on a true
                                construction of the relevant clause, the parties have nevertheless
                                agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of any other
                                forum (which would include Hong Kong) in the event of their being
                                sued there. Again, in view of the agreement actually to submit, the
                                burden on B is also a heavy one.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(3)    A sues B in Hong Kong. Again, Hong Kong is not
                                named as the non-exclusive jurisdiction but the courts of Japan are.
                                However, this time the parties have not agreed to submit to any
                                jurisdiction other than the Japanese courts. In other words, while
                                the parties have agreed to submit to Japanese jurisdiction in the
                                event that they are sued there, and while they have also agreed that
                                they are at liberty to institute proceedings in a jurisdiction other
                                than Japan, no positive obligation exists for a party to submit to
                                any jurisdiction other than Japan. Here, the burden on B is less
                                heavy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As alluded to earlier in this paragraph, the
                    procedural context in <em>Noble</em> (an application to set
                    aside the leave that had been granted to the plaintiffs for the service of a
                    writ out of jurisdiction) is different from the context of the present appeal
                    (an application for a stay of proceedings). Hence, while the outcome in
                        <em>Noble</em> might not be relevant, the court’s
                    comments at [31]–[33], as reproduced above, are relevant
                    insofar as they explain the general effect of non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At the hearing before this court, the
                    Appellant repeated, in substance, its arguments made in the court below,
                        <em>viz</em>, that the Clause does not preclude
                    commencement of proceedings in Singapore and that the Respondent bears the
                    burden of proving that Hong Kong is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate
                    forum, based upon the illustration stated at [33(3)] of <em>Noble</em> (as reproduced in the preceding paragraph).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Respondent, not surprisingly, supported
                    the Judge’s views (above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>) and
                    took the position that, by virtue of the Clause, the parties had submitted to
                    the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong. This factor, it was
                    submitted, tilted the balance in favour of the Respondent in the application of
                    the <em>Spiliada</em> test (see above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Respondent also attempted to argue that
                    the court should also take cognisance of the fact that parties had agreed,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, to waive all rights to a trial by
                    jury (above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>). As such, the parties had
                    – by implication – agreed to resolve all matters in a jurisdiction
                    which allows trial by jury. This issue is addressed shortly below (at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In addition to contending that the Clause
                    operated in favour of the Respondent, the Respondent also submitted that there
                    were a myriad of factors which indicated that Singapore was not an appropriate
                    forum for the matter to be heard. First of all, the Respondent pointed out that
                    the only factor connecting this case with Singapore is the fact that the
                    Respondent resides in Singapore. Secondly, there is no evidence to suggest that
                    he has any assets or properties locally. Thirdly, the Respondent highlighted
                    that the Three Contracts, as well as the Agreement, were neither executed nor
                    performed in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We will begin by considering, as a preliminary
                    matter, the legal effect of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. We will then
                    apply the <em>Spiliada</em> principles to the facts before
                    us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What is the legal effect of a non-exclusive jurisdiction
                clause?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As already mentioned, the first port of call
                    is the article by Prof Yeo (cited above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>). However, it discusses a great many issues, not all of
                    which are germane to the present appeal. In so far as the issues discussed
                    (including those relevant to the present appeal) are concerned, the analysis is
                    complex – in the main because the issues themselves are complex (many of
                    which have not been the subject of direct legal precedent as well). We hope that
                    we will not be doing a disservice to the article by distilling what is relevant
                    in the context of the present appeal. One reason for doing so is because, as we
                    shall elaborate upon in a moment, one of the central strands, whilst posing many
                    hitherto unresolved legal questions (and even conundrums), can (as alluded to at
                    the outset of this judgment) be addressed relatively easily on the facts of the
                    present appeal; hence, there is no need to canvass the various issues arising
                    from this particular strand in the detail that we might otherwise have had
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At the risk of oversimplifying the erudite
                    analysis by Prof Yeo, it appears to us that – at least in so far as
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses are concerned – there are two central
                    strands of analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The <em>first</em>
                    central strand is <em>contractual</em> in nature. Put
                    simply, <em>depending on the intention of the parties concerned,
                        a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause could (taken at its highest) be
                        given the effect of an exclusive jurisdiction clause –</em> in
                    which case strong cause would be required to be demonstrated by the party
                    seeking to sue in a jurisdiction other than that stated in the relevant clause
                    itself (in this case, the Appellant). Such effect may, for instance, be given
                    where it would be a breach of the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause to object to
                    the exercise of jurisdiction by the selected forum, given the wording of the
                    clause and the circumstances. However, a possible critique of such an approach
                    is that, on occasion at least, the distinction between non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction clauses and exclusive jurisdiction clauses will be blurred, if not
                    effaced. Prof Yeo frankly admits this (see <em>Yeo</em> at 359, where Prof Yeo explains that the
                    consequence of this contractual analysis is that there is no <em>theoretical</em> distinction between these two types of clauses).
                    Such a result runs, of course, counter to the Appellant’s view (as briefly
                    noted above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>) and, perhaps, is also
                    not entirely consistent with the approach taken by the courts in <em>OCBC Capital</em> and <em>Noble</em>. On
                    the other hand, as Prof Yeo argues, such an approach is a principled one.
                    One can appreciate the persuasiveness of such an argument, especially if one has
                    regard to the substance – as opposed to the mere form – of the
                        <em>contractual</em> arrangement entered into by the
                    parties. Further, as just noted, the result is by no means a forgone one
                        <em>if strong cause</em> can in fact be demonstrated by
                    the party seeking to act in breach of the clause itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The <em>second</em>
                    central strand is <em>general</em> in nature. Put simply, a
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause is <em>a factor – in all
                        cases – in ascertaining whether or not the action concerned ought to
                        be stayed</em> (pursuant to the principles first laid down in the
                    seminal House of Lords decision of <em>Spiliada</em>
                        (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)), although
                    (according to Prof Yeo) its qualitative strength as a factor will differ,
                    depending on the precise circumstances before the court. We will, in fact,
                    return to these principles later (see below, especially at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>). As Prof Yeo correctly emphasises, this
                    second central strand is <em>separate and distinct</em>
                    from the first inasmuch as it is <em>not</em> premised on
                    the contractual intention of the parties as such (see <em>Yeo</em> at 350 and 351).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The parties’ arguments centred, in
                    substance, on the <em>second</em> central strand although
                    it was possible, in our view, for the parties (in particular, the Respondent) to
                    have canvassed arguments centring on the first as well. However, as we have
                    already observed, the various arguments in this last mentioned regard (<em>ie</em>, with respect to the <em>first</em> central strand which is <em>contractual</em> in nature) are by no means clear and are clearly
                    complex, at least for the most part (see generally <em>Yeo</em> at 336-353). When, for example, can there be an
                    agreement (in the context of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause) to <em>waive</em> objection to jurisdiction (see, for example,
                    clause 9.5(a) in <em>OCBC Capital</em> (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>)) and, if so, ought a narrow or a
                    broad approach to such waiver be adopted (see <em>Yeo</em>
                    at 341-344)? To take another issue, can it be implied, from the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause concerned, that there has been an undertaking
                    by the parties that the jurisdiction mentioned in that clause is the <em>most appropriate</em> forum so that it would be a breach of
                    contract for one of the parties to argue that any other court other than the
                    chosen court should adjudicate on the substantive issues between the parties
                    (see <em>Yeo</em> at 345-347)? These are just a couple
                    of a number of issues that could arise for consideration by the court but which
                    did not arise for decision in the context of the present appeal. In the
                    circumstances, definitive answers to the various issues raised by Prof Yeo
                    in his article, as interesting as they may be, must await another occasion when
                    one or more of these issues arise squarely for decision by this court. We should
                    caution, however, that we are by no means wholeheartedly accepting the
                    contractual approach that is the subject of the first central strand of
                    Prof Yeo’s article. The contractual approach is not without its
                    difficulties. For instance, it may well be argued that it is impractical to
                    apply the contractual approach at an interlocutory stage when all that the court
                    has is affidavit evidence. Another difficulty, which Prof Yeo recognises,
                    is that a contractual approach may lead to uncertainty (see <em>Yeo</em> at 352). This is not to say that these difficulties are
                    intractable. For example, as Prof Yeo suggests, a potential solution to the
                    problem of uncertainty could be through the use of <em>presumptions</em>, though as Prof Yeo immediately adds,
                    presumptions may themselves present difficulties (see <em>Yeo
                        at 3</em>52).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Fortunately, however, as it turns out,
                        <em>even if</em> arguments in relation to the <em>first</em> central (<em>ie</em>,
                    contractual) strand had been raised before this court in order to maintain, for
                    example, the proposition that the Clause ought to be accorded the effect of an
                        <em>exclusive</em> jurisdiction clause, they would, in
                    our view, have failed. As Prof Yeo himself argues, much would – in a
                    contractual context – depend on the precise intention of the parties
                    themselves which is to be gathered from the language utilised by the parties as
                    well as the surrounding factual matrix (to the extent that the governing law of
                    the contract requires such an approach (in the context of Singapore law, a
                    contextual approach is required (see generally the decision of this court in
                    Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction
                    Pte Ltd [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029, especially at [132]-[133])); it should
                    be noted, however, that in practical terms, the <em>lex
                        fori</em> would apply to questions of interpretation by default in
                    most cases because of the presumption of similarity (see <em>Yeo</em> at 315)). In this regard, it seems to us that, having
                    regard to the context in which, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    Clause was entered into, the parties had <em>not</em>
                    intended that the Clause have a significant effect. In particular, a perusal of
                    the terms of the Agreement will reveal that the Agreement itself is, in the
                    main, intended to ensure that <em>the Respondent</em> (as
                    well as related parties) discharge their obligations as stated therein (the only
                    clauses that appear clearly neutral (and which can be found as <em>general</em> clauses in many similar agreements) include
                    those (towards the end of the Agreement) relating to the amendment of the
                    Agreement as well as waiver or modification of its terms (clause 16), the
                    remedy of injunction and specific performance (clause 19), the entire
                    agreement clause (clause 20), third party rights (clause 21),
                    severability in the event of invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
                    (clause 22), and execution of the Agreement in counterparts
                    (clause 25)). If so, then the Clause ought to be construed as being drafted
                    in a manner consistent with such an approach (<em>viz</em>,
                    to benefit <em>the Appellant</em>). This interpretation
                    appears to be buttressed by the fact that <em>each</em> of
                    the original agreements (which were allegedly breached and which were the
                    subject of the claim which was, in turn, sought to be settled pursuant to the
                    Agreement) contained an <em>exclusive</em> jurisdiction
                    clause (also relating to Hong Kong). It would appear – coupled with, as
                    just pointed out, the main purpose of the Agreement as embodied in its principal
                    terms – that the inclusion, <em>instead</em>, of a
                        <em>non-</em>exclusive jurisdiction clause in the
                    Agreement suggests that <em>the Appellant</em> desired
                        <em>more flexibility</em> in <em>enforcing</em> the terms of the Agreement in the event of a breach of
                    it by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, <em>even
                        assuming</em> that this is <em>not</em> the case
                    (and, hence, taking the Respondent’s case at its highest), it is clear, in
                    our view, that there is simply <em>no evidence
                        whatsoever</em> that demonstrates that the Clause was intended by the
                    parties to have a significant effect. In the circumstances, it is very clear, in
                    our view, that the <em>substance</em> of the parties’
                    intention was <em>not</em>, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to accord to the Clause the effect of an <em>exclusive</em> jurisdiction clause. Neither is there, as just stated,
                    any evidence to suggest that the parties had intended the Clause to have –
                    from a contractual perspective – a significant legal effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In this regard, we should address an argument
                    that the Respondent has made by relying on the reference in the Clause to the
                    parties waiving their right to a jury trial (see above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>). In our view, this particular aspect of the
                    Clause is, at best, neutral. It would only suggest that the parties intended to
                    exclusively select Hong Kong if Hong Kong was the only jurisdiction in the world
                    with a jury system. This is most certainly not the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     That having been said, it does <em>not</em> follow that the Clause has <em>no</em> legal effect whatsoever. This is where the <em>second</em> central strand is relevant. In this regard, the following
                    observations by Prof Yeo might be usefully noted (see <em>Yeo</em> at 348-349):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    It is not in doubt that, whatever may be inferred
                            or implied about the parties’ intentions as to the scope of the
                            agreement embodied in the jurisdiction agreement, the fact that a court
                            has been chosen by the parties, albeit non-exclusively, is relevant in
                            the application of the principles of the natural forum. The fact that
                            the parties thought that the chosen forum was at least an appropriate
                            forum to determine their disputes must surely carry some weight in the
                            court’s determination. What weight this factor will carry must
                            depend on all the circumstances of the case. In a number of Singapore
                            cases, no particular weight was given to the existence of a
                            non-exclusive forum or foreign jurisdiction agreement, but this could be
                            because the point had not been seriously pressed by
                        counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88    It goes too far, perhaps, to say that a
                            non-exclusive jurisdiction agreement will never be accorded any more
                            weight than any other connections in the case under consideration. On
                            the other hand, it may also go too far to say that a non-exclusive
                            jurisdiction agreement will <em>always</em> be a
                            strong indicator of the appropriate forum to hear the case. <b><em>The weight to be attributed to it ought to depend on the
                                circumstances.</em></b> It may make a difference whether the
                            jurisdiction clause formed part of a closely negotiated contract or is a
                            standard term in a contract of adhesion. Where the parties have clearly
                            put their minds to the consideration of the clause, that will
                            understandably be a very strong factor. On the other hand, if the
                            parties have indicated a list of possible countries for the disputes to
                            be tried, then the choices may not mean very much in terms of
                            comparative appropriateness, and the court may even be justified in not
                            giving any particular weight to the clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     There is, understandably, no magic formula as
                    such. As Prof Yeo aptly put it, much would depend on the precise facts and
                    circumstances concerned. An interesting question that arises (but not in the
                    context of the present appeal) is whether or not, in relation to the
                    observations made by Prof Yeo as quoted in the preceding paragraph, the
                    line between the contractual approach embodied in the first central theme and
                    the more general approach embodied in the second central theme may become
                    blurred or even effaced to the extent that it is accepted that the latter
                    approach may “elevate”, so to speak, the relative importance of a
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause beyond that of just a factor to be considered
                    pursuant to the general principles laid down in <em>Spiliada</em> – to which principles (and application thereof)
                    our attention now turns. Before proceeding to do so, however, it is acknowledged
                    that Prof Yeo has in fact pointed out the distinction between both
                    approaches (see <em>Yeo</em> at 350 and 351 as well as
                    above at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>). However, to the extent that
                    the more general approach embodied in the second central theme nevertheless
                    entails a consideration of the circumstances surrounding the making of the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, there is – on a practical level –
                    at least some possible blurring of the lines.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the principles in Spiliada</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Applying the principles set out at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above to the facts of the present appeal, it
                    is clear that the Respondent first bears the burden of proof pursuant to stage
                    one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test referred to in that
                    paragraph. More importantly, as this court observed in <em>CIMB
                        Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543
                        (“<em>CIMB Bank</em>”) (at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>, also quoted above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or
                        appropriate forum. The defendant [the Respondent in the present appeal] must
                        also establish that there is another available forum which is <em>clearly or distinctly more appropriate than
                            Singapore</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Counsel for the Respondent, Mr Patrick
                    Chin, sought to argue against the requirement referred to in the preceding
                    paragraph that the defendant (the Respondent in this appeal) “must also
                    establish that there is another available forum [Hong Kong in the present
                    appeal] which is <em>clearly or distinctly</em> more
                    appropriate than Singapore” (see <em>CIMB Bank</em>
                    at [26]) [emphasis added]. The phrase
                    “clearly or distinctly” is too well-established a criterion to be
                    departed from – and, in our view, rightly so as it is consistent with the
                    entire spirit as well as rationale of the doctrine of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em> in general and the principles thereof embodied in
                        <em>Spiliada</em> (see also Yeo Tiong Min, <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 6(2)
                    (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 75.088). Indeed, the Judge himself also adopted
                    this approach (see above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Hence, the question that arises in the context
                    of the present appeal is this: Has the Respondent discharged the burden under
                    the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test in
                    demonstrating that Hong Kong is a <em>clearly or
                        distinctly</em> more appropriate forum for the hearing of the dispute
                    between it and the Appellant than Singapore? To this end, the only positive
                    factor which the Respondent can invoke – if at all – is embodied in
                    the Clause. This is so, because the remaining arguments advanced by the
                    Respondent (at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>–<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>) above) only attempt to show that the dispute
                    involves connecting factors which are interspersed across various jurisdictions
                    other than Singapore. In <em>Siemens AG v Holdrich Investment
                        Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1007, this court held that such a
                    submission will not suffice in justifying a stay of proceedings on the basis of
                        <em>forum non conveninens</em> (at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of the <em>forum conveniens</em> analysis
                        is to identify the most appropriate forum in which to try the substantive
                        dispute. It is wrong to say that Singapore is <em>forum non
                            conveniens</em> simply because the connecting factors which point
                        to Singapore are outweighed by all the connecting factors which point away
                        from Singapore. The connecting factors which point away from Singapore must
                        point to a more appropriate forum than Singapore, and they might not do so
                        if those connections are dispersed amongst several jurisdictions. Quite
                        simply, Singapore is <em>forum non conveniens</em> only
                        if there is a more appropriate forum than Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     What, then, is the legal status of the Clause?
                    In particular, does it only have the same weight as any other connecting factor
                        <em>or</em> is it a strong indicator that Hong Kong is
                    a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum to hear the case? In our view, it
                    is clear that the Clause is <em>not</em> a strong indicator
                    that Hong Kong is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum to hear the
                    case. As noted above (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>), it would
                    appear that the Agreement itself was intended to ensure, <em>inter alia</em>, that <em>the Respondent</em>
                    discharges his obligations pursuant to the relevant terms of the Agreement. It
                    was also noted (see above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>) that,
                    even if this was not the case, there was <em>simply no
                        evidence</em> that the Clause was intended by the parties to be a
                    strong indicator that Hong Kong is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate
                    forum to hear the case. Again, it was also noted (see above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>) that the part of the Clause which refers to
                    a waiver of the parties’ right to jury trial is neutral. At best, the
                    Clause is merely <em>a</em> factor that this court ought to
                    consider in deciding whether or not the Appellant’s action should be
                    stayed. We note that a similar view was taken in relation to the effect of a
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in <em>OCBC Capital</em>
                    (see <em>OCBC Capital</em> at [44], cited above at
                        <a href="#p1_14">[1s4]</a>), although we should add that the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in that case <em>explicitly</em> provided that the submission to the non-exclusive
                    forum was not to affect the plaintiff’s right to sue elsewhere (see
                    clause 9.5(b) in <em>OCBC Capital</em> (reproduced
                    above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>)). Returning to the present
                    appeal, against this factor (<em>ie</em>, the presence of
                    the Clause in the Agreement) is the fact that the Respondent is resident in
                    Singapore. We should also note that, in the context at least of the
                    Appellant’s claim against the Respondent pursuant to the alleged breach by
                    the latter of the terms of the Agreement, the general principles in both
                    Singapore and Hong Kong are broadly similar (reference may also be made to the
                    decision of this court in <em>Good Earth Agricultural Co Ltd v
                        Novus International Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 711 at
                        [27]). Taking all these
                    circumstances into account, it <em>cannot</em>, in our
                    view, be said that the Respondent has demonstrated that Hong Kong is a <em>clearly or distinctly</em> more appropriate forum for the
                    hearing of the dispute between it and the Appellant than Singapore. Hence, the
                    action brought by the Appellant against the Respondent in Singapore ought
                        <em>not</em> to be stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We should also note that we agree with counsel
                    for the Appellant’s, Mr Lai Yew Fei’s, characterisation of the
                    Judge’s reasoning (set out above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>) to the effect that the Judge had, in substance at least,
                    characterised the Clause as an <em>exclusive</em>
                    jurisdiction clause (which it clearly was <em>not</em>).
                    Neither, for the reasons set out above, can the Clause have the <em>effect</em> of an <em>exclusive</em>
                    jurisdiction clause or, indeed, any significant effect for that
                matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For the reasons set out above, we allow the
