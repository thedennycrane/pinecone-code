<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13     One of the issues in the dispute was whether a notice in writing had been given on 9 November 2006. On that day, there was a meeting between Loh Tien Ngee (“Loh”), a Group Corporate Finance Manager of the plaintiff at that time, and Yu Limin (“Yu”), the defendant’s wife. The meeting took place at the plaintiff’s office. The plaintiff’s case was that a letter dated 8 November 2006, addressed to the defendant and signed by Richard Quek, a director of the plaintiff, was handed to Yu. Yu signed on a copy of the letter to acknowledge receipt of the letter and her identity card number and the date were also recorded on the copy.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15     How did Loh and Yu come to have the meeting? It was not a chance or casual meeting. Loh had telephoned the defendant’s office in October 2006 and asked to speak to him regarding arrears in payment under the Deed, but he was ill and not at the office. Loh ended up speaking with Yu instead.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16     Yu’s evidence was initially that:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17     In her evidence in court, Yu confirmed that she suggested the meeting to discuss the defendant’s arrears in payments and she informed the defendant of the meeting.</font><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 5]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18     With regard to the meeting itself, Yu deposed in her first affidavit that Loh showed her a letter and told her that certain monthly instalments were in arrears, and instructed her to sign on the letter to acknowledge that she was so informed.</font><a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 6]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In other words, it was to confirm that she was informed of the arrears in payment.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22     Loh’s account of the meeting, particularly with regard to the letter, was different from Yu’s. She deposed that:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24     When counsel for the defendant put to her Yu’s evidence that Yu did not receive a copy of the letter after signing on it, Loh disagreed and repeated that:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I gave her a copy [of the letter] and asked her to acknowledge receipt.</font><a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 14]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">25     Was a copy of the letter given to Yu? Yu’s evidence was that it was not, but her account of the meeting was marred by inconsistencies that I have referred to. There were other indications that Yu’s recall of events could be unreliable. She explained that she went to the meeting on behalf of the defendant because he was very ill. In her first affidavit, she recounted that the defendant was gravely ill and was hospitalised between 25 November 2006 and 29 November 2006. <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 15]</span></span></a></span> In her second affidavit, she corrected herself and said that the defendant was hospitalised between 30 October 2006 and 3 November 2006 and not between 25 November 2006 and 29 November 2006.</font><a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 16]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">26     In court, when she was asked:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Q      … You knew your husband was in arrears; you were asked to attend that Sembawang Capital on the 9th of November; you were handed a letter on Sembawang Capital’s letterhead, asked to sign and put your IC number, but you don’t think it’s important?</font><a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 17]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">She replied:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">A       It’s very common for a letter from a company comes with its letterhead. As for acknowledging, I think it’s usual practice. I’ve seen a lot of letters whereby people acknowledge receipt.</font><a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 18]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">This answer raises other questions. If she thought that it is the usual practice to sign to acknowledge receipt of a letter, why did she sign when, according to her, the letter was not given to her? Why did she not ask for the letter?</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">27     Compared to Yu’s evidence, Loh’s evidence was clear and consistent. Her evidence was that Yu had asked for a meeting, and the plaintiff had prepared the letter addressed to the defendant which was signed and dated 8 November 2006 and intended to be handed over to Yu. When they met, she had ensured that Yu acknowledged receipt of the letter by signing on a copy of the letter, and she recorded her name and identity card number, and the date as well.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28     There was no reason for Loh to deceive Yu into signing the acknowledgment of receipt. The plaintiff had issued another copy of the letter addressed to the defendant and sent it to the office of the auditors of HSC, which was probably the registered address of HSC. That letter</font><a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 19]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">was received and acknowledged by the auditors, but was not forwarded to the defendant. Nevertheless, the sending of the letter showed that the plaintiff took steps to deliver the letter to the defendant, and refuted any suggestion that it did not want the defendant to have the letter.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">29     On the balance of probabilities, I accept Loh’s evidence that she delivered a copy of the letter to Yu on 9 November 2006.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">30     What is the effect of the handing of the letter to Yu? To answer this question, it is necessary to consider the circumstances under which the letter was delivered to her. The plaintiff had no dealings with her. Its dealings were with the defendant, her husband. The meeting of 9 November 2006 was convened at the request of Yu expressly to discuss the defendant’s liabilities under the Deed and Yu informed the defendant of the meeting in advance, and briefed him on it afterwards. By Yu’s own evidence, she and Loh were talking about the defendant’s liabilities under the Deed with a view to seeking a resolution of the defendant’s liabilities. In the circumstances, I find that the letter was handed to and received by Yu as an agent of the defendant.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31     Counsel for the defendant argued firstly, that the letter was not handed to Yu, and secondly, that even if it was, that did not amount to service under Cl 7. He cited two cases. The first was <i>Holwell Securities Ltd v Hughes</i> [1974] 1 W.L.R. 155, where the English Court of Appeal held, in a case of an exercise of an option to purchase a property, that the acceptance must be conveyed to the owner, and that an acceptance effected by posting a letter which went astray and never reached the owner was not a proper acceptance because “acceptance of an offer must be communicated to the offeror” (per Russell LJ at 157).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32     The second case counsel cited, <i>Ho Miaw Ling v Singapore Island Country Club</i> <nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 892</nobr> (“<i>Ho Miaw Ling”</i>) dealt with the issuance of a notice under the rules of the defendant club. In this case, Chao Hick Tin J held at [20]:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The ordinary meaning of a ‘notice’ is an intimation or a warning. A notice is a means of making something known. To give notice must necessarily mean to bring the matter to a person’s knowledge or attention. There must be actual communication.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33     In that case, rule 47(e) of the defendant club specifies that:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If any member fails to place his account in credit within seven days after notice from the Secretary or the Honorary Treasurer, the Secretary or Honorary Treasurer shall give him a notice stating that unless his account be placed in credit within a further period of seven days, his name will be posted on the Club’s Notice Boards as a Defaulter.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34     The club had sent a notice by AR registered mail to the plaintiff, but the letter was returned undelivered. Chao J held that the notice was not served.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35     I do not think that there can be any complaint against that conclusion. The notice did not reach the plaintiff and there was no provision that postage <i>per se</i> constitutes effective service.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">36     In the present proceedings, the evidence was that the contents of the letter were not explained to Yu when she was asked to append her signature on it. This leads to another issue – was the plaintiff under the duty to <i>serve</i> as well as to <i>explain</i> the notice? What do “be communicated” and “actual communication” encompass?</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">37     It may be argued that communication implies explanation. This was not part of Chao J’s findings in <i>Ho Miaw Ling</i>, and he made it clear that there was no requirement for explanation. He found at [34] that proof of the posting of a notice, <i>ipso facto</i>, cannot be accepted as proof of notice, but service by AR registered post would be proof of receipt if the AR card had been produced. That meant that the need to “bring the matter to a person’s knowledge or attention” and the requirement for “actual communication” is satisfied by receipt of the notice <i>per se</i>. Defence counsel showed that he understood that when he referred to the “need to be actually communicated (i.e. physically received) by the Defendant”.</font><a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 20]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Communication therefore means receipt, with no need for explanation.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">38     In this case, was the delivery of the notice to Yu as the defendant’s agent delivery to the defendant? To use the AR registered post analogy, a notice would be deemed to be delivered if the AR card was signed by the addressee’s wife. In another scenario, if someone had gone to A’s residence, and handed to A’s wife a notice addressed to A, and she accepts it knowing that it was for A, that would surely be sufficient delivery of the notice to A.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">39     Thus, when Yu went to the meeting as his agent, and was handed the letter addressed to him, that constituted delivery of the notice to him.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Whether there should be relief against forfeiture</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40     The defendant argued that if the Deed was validly terminated, there should be relief against forfeiture.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">41     At the outset, the forfeiture that the defendant seeks relief from must be considered. It is not his right to redeem the mortgage on his house – the plaintiff had made it clear that if the defendant wanted to repay his debt and discharge the mortgage, it would not stand in his way. What the defendant wants is to preserve his right to remain in possession of his house by paying the monthly $1800 payments and to prevent the plaintiff from selling the house.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42     Are these interests to which relief against forfeiture applies? Counsel for the defendant argued they are, but he did not produce any authority to support that. Courts grant this equitable relief flexibly. Lord Wilberforce had noted in a leading judgment on this area of the law, <i>Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding</i> [1973] AC 691 at 722, that “[t]he jurisdiction has not been confined to any particular type of case.”</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">43     The scope of the equitable relief is not closed. It is well settled that it is available against the forfeiture of deposit and instalment payments made towards the purchase of land, as well as the contractual right to buy land, see <i>Pacific Rim Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 1</nobr> (“<i>Pacific Rim</i>”<i>)</i> and the cases discussed therein. In the present case, the interests involved are the right to continued possession of the mortgaged property and the continued legal ownership of the property. These interests are more substantial (or at any rate not less substantial) than payments of deposit and instalment payments, and the right to complete a purchase of land. As the relief applies to the latter interests, it must be available to the former interests.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">44     The Court of Appeal in <i>Pacific Rim</i>, a case in which relief was sought against the forfeiture of payments made for the purchase of land and for an order of specific performance, ruled (at p 23) after undertaking a review of the authorities, that:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">such jurisdiction would only be exercised in exceptional circumstances since the courts would not ordinarily countenance a departure from contractual rights and obligations. Hence, in order to invoke successfully the courts’ jurisdiction, the circumstances of the case must reveal elements of unconscionability and injustice.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">This is indeed a common and essential requirement for all forms of relief against forfeiture.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">45     It is therefore necessary to look at the facts of this case. Firstly, the terms of settlement were favourable to the defendant. He was indebted to the plaintiff for a total sum in excess of $4m, and was given time to repay by monthly instalments of $1800 without interest. While he had to mortgage his house to secure his repayment of his debt, he remained in possession of the house free of rent.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">46     The plaintiff had shown forbearance in the enforcement of its rights. Although Cl 7 of the Deed entitled it to terminate the settlement upon the failure to make any monthly payment, it did not seek to exercise this right until after the defendant had defaulted on three consecutive payments. Even at that stage, it was prepared to listen to what Loh described as Yu’s ‘sob story’, but Yu did not make any payment or acceptable proposal for a settlement.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">47     In these circumstances, the necessary elements of unconscionability and injustice are absent. The fact that the defendant was in poor health when he defaulted, and that he has paid the arrears and will continue the monthly payments, do not render the plaintiff’s exercise of its rights unconscionable or unjust. It was unfortunate that the defendant may have to lose his house because of his inability to pay the monthly instalments for a few months, but his misfortune was not of the plaintiff’s doing. Neither the plaintiff’s exercise of its right as mortgagee, nor the defendant’s loss of the benefits under the Deed is, to my mind, unconscionable or unjust.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">48     I allow the plaintiff’s application and make the following orders:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)     that the defendant is to deliver to the plaintiff vacant possession of the mortgaged property in three months from the date hereof;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)    that the defendant is to pay to the plaintiff the outstanding amount of the debt three months from the date hereof while continuing to pay the monthly instalments of $1800 in the meantime;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)   that the plaintiff is at liberty to enforce the mortgage by way of public sale, sale by tender, or private treaty on such terms and conditions and generally as the plaintiff may think fit;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iv)   that the defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs in these proceedings on an indemnity basis, to be taxed if not agreed; and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(v)    there be liberty to apply.</font></span></p>
