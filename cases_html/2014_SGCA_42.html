        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the
    court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Falmac Limited (“the Plaintiff”) filed
     Originating Summons No 1125 of 2013 (“OS 1125”) on 19 November
     2013 for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal against the decision of the High Court
     judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Falmac Limited v Cheng Ji Lai
      Charlie</em> [2013] SGHC 113 (“the HC Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Although the law in this area is well-settled, the
     grounds relied upon by the Plaintiff for the late application – which came close to six
     months after the HC Judgment had been delivered or close to five months after the deadline for
     filing the Notice of Appeal had lapsed – were unusual, particularly in the context of the
     procedural history and background of the dispute. Essentially, the Plaintiff wanted to rely on
     two favourable foreign judgments issued some five months after the HC Judgment was issued. It
     claimed that the two foreign judgments supported its action in the High Court and would
     therefore support its position on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       We dismissed, after hearing oral arguments, OS 1125
     as well as Summons No 1410 of 2014 (“SUM 1410”), which was a related
     summons to adjourn the hearing for OS 1125 before this court pending the result of an
     appeal against the two foreign judgments in the foreign court. We now set out the detailed
     grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Cheng Ji Lai Charlie (“the Defendant”) was
     a former director and Chief Executive Officer of the Plaintiff. The main action in the High
     Court was essentially a claim by the Plaintiff against the Defendant for numerous breaches of
     fiduciary duties by the Defendant. The proceedings initially involved four other defendants but
     the actions against them were discontinued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       One of the alleged breaches was in relation to the
     Defendant’s involvement in the Plaintiff’s disposal of two of its subsidiaries in
     Tianjin, People’s Republic of China (“the PRC”) to a company known as Sino
     Vision (HK) Ltd (“Sino Vision”): Falmac Machinery (Tianjin) Ltd
     (“FM”) and Falmac Textile (Tianjin) Co Ltd (“FT”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The trial was heard over three tranches. The first was in
     July 2011, the second was in September 2012, and the last was a day in November 2012. The HC
     Judgment dismissing the Plaintiff’s claim and awarding the Defendant about $1.33m in his
     counterclaim was given on 23 May 2013. No appeal was filed within the one-month window
     period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 19 November 2013, the Plaintiff filed
     OS 1125 and its articulated reason for an extension of time to file an appeal nearly six
     months after the HC Judgment was delivered was that it now had two favourable judgments
     (“the Tianjin judgments”) issued by the Higher People’s Court of Tianjin
     (“the Tianjin court”) on 17 October 2013, some five months after the HC
     Judgment was delivered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       A little more background should be given of the
     proceedings in Tianjin. On 26 June 2012, which was after the end of the first tranche but
     prior to the start of the second tranche of the High Court trial, the Plaintiff commenced two
     proceedings in the Tianjin court against Sino Vision. The two proceedings were essentially for
     the same reliefs, albeit in respect of each subsidiary, <em>ie</em>, FM
     and FT. The reliefs sought by the Plaintiff were for the share transfer agreement which had
     vested ownership of FM and FT in Sino Vision to be held null and void, restitution to the
     Plaintiff of the shares transferred to Sino Vision, compensation, and costs. The Defendant was
     not a party to the two Tianjin proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Plaintiff claimed that the Tianjin judgments held
     that the Defendant had acted dishonestly and that the transfer of FM and FT to Sino Vision had
     been procured by fraud. On that basis, the Plaintiff believed that it had a strong chance of
     succeeding if it was permitted to file an appeal against the HC Judgment. Its secondary reason
     as to why its request for an extension of time ought to be allowed was that evidence of the
     dishonest conduct of the Defendant, which was an integral aspect of the Plaintiff’s claim
     for breach of fiduciary duties, had not been brought to the High Court’s
     attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As the Tianjin judgments were the subject of an appeal
     that was scheduled to be heard by the Supreme People’s Court of the PRC on 28 April
     2014, the Plaintiff also filed SUM 1410 on 18 March 2014, seeking an adjournment of
     OS 1125 until after the appeals against the Tianjin judgments had been heard by the
     Supreme People’s Court of the PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The only issue before us was whether the
     Plaintiff’s conduct warranted this court’s indulgence. The law in that regard, to
     which we shall turn momentarily, is well-settled. The determination of SUM 1410 largely
     hinged on our decision on OS 1125.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable legal principles on extension of time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Whether or not this court will extend the time for the
     filing of a Notice of Appeal depends on the application of four factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the length of delay;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     the reasons for the delay;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for
      appealing were extended; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
      prejudice caused to the would-be defendant if an extension of time was in fact
     granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     This court in <em>Lai Swee Lin Linda v
      AG</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 565 (“<em>Lai Swee Lin
      Linda</em>”) explained the four factors (at [45]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The applicable principles governing the jurisdiction of the court to extend the time for
      filing and/or serving a Notice of Appeal were laid down, most notably perhaps, by the decision
      of this court in <em>Pearson Judith Rosemary v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</em>
       (“<em>Pearson</em>”) [1991] 2 SLR(R) 260. The court
      there held (at [20]) that “the application ... for an extension of time ... should be
      on grounds sufficient to persuade the court to show sympathy to him”. In this regard,
      four factors have been utilised by the courts to ascertain whether or not the court should be
      so persuaded. These include the length of delay; the reasons for the delay; the chances of the
      appeal succeeding if time for appealing were extended; and the prejudice caused to the
      would-be Defendant if an extension of time was in fact granted: see <em>Pearson</em> at [15]; <em>Hau Khee Wee v Chua Kian Tong</em>
      [1985-1986] SLR(R) 1075 at [14]; <em>Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd
       v Vithya Sri Sumathis</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 927 at [24]; <em>Tan
       Chiang Brother’s Marble (S) Pte Ltd v Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd</em>
      [2002] 1 SLR(R) 633 at [27]; <em>AD v AE</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R)
      505 at [10]; as well as <em>Ong Cheng Aik v Dayco Products Singapore Pte
       Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 561 at [8] and [11]. When applying these factors, the
      overriding consideration is that the Rules of Court must <em>prima
       facie</em> be obeyed, with reasonable diligence being exercised: see the Privy Council
      decision of <em>Thamboo Ratnam v Thamboo Cumarasamy and Cumarasamy
       Ariamany d/o Kumarasa</em> [1965] 1 WLR 8 (“<em>Ratnam v Cumarasamy</em>”) at 12 and the Singapore High Court decision of
       <em>Tan Chai Heng v Yeo Seng Choon</em> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 658 at
      [5]. This court has also pointed out, in <em>The Melati</em> [2004]
      4 SLR(R) 7 at [37] that the “paramount consideration” is the need for
      finality. It should be borne in mind, in this regard, that the would-be appellant has already
      “had a trial and lost”: see <em>Ratnam v Cumarasamy</em>,
       <em>supra</em> at 12. Hence, if no appeal is filed and served within the
      prescribed period (here, of one month), the successful party is justly entitled to assume that
      the judgment concerned is final: see <em>Ong Cheng Aik v Dayco Products
       Singapore Pte Ltd</em>, <em>supra</em> at [8].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The principles set out above were endorsed by this
     court in <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another
      suit</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 757 (“<em>Lee Hsien
      Loong</em>”) at [18]. We also noted in that case (at [19]) that the emphasis
      <em>in the first instance</em> is invariably on the first two
     factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The four factors set out above were first enunciated by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he
      then was) in the seminal High Court decision of <em>Hau Khee Wee v Chua Kian
       Tong</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 1075 (“<em>Hau Khee
      Wee</em>”). <em>In our view, it is significant that of the four
       factors</em>,<b><em> the emphasis, in the first instance at least, is
       invariably on the first two</em></b>, <em>viz</em>, <b><em>the length of delay and the reasons for the delay. This is not surprising because
       the third factor </em></b><em>(viz, the chances of the appeal succeeding if
       time for appealing were extended)</em>, <b><em>whilst of equal importance
       relative to the other three factors, is set at a very low threshold in fairness to the
       Plaintiff – namely, whether the appeal is “hopeless”</em></b> (see the
      decision of this court in <em>Nomura Regionalisation Venture Fund Ltd v Ethical
       Investments Ltd</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 926 (“<em>Nomura</em>”) at [32]). [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In so far as the <em>fourth</em>
     factor was concerned, that is, whether the prejudice caused to the would-be defendant if an
     extension of time was in fact granted, this court observed thus (see <em>Lee
      Hsien Loong</em> at [24]–[27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    The fourth factor … would also depend very much on the
       precise facts before the court. However, we view it as being of some significance. As Woo Bih
       Li J put it in the decision of this court in <em>Wee Soon Kim Anthony v
        UBS AG</em> [2005] SGCA 3 (“<em>Wee Soon Kim
       Anthony</em>”) at [53]–[54]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would say at the outset that the prejudice referred to in the four factors is the
      prejudice to the would-be respondent if an extension of time were granted and not the
      prejudice to the would-be appellant if the extension were not granted. This is clear from
       [<em>Hau Khee Wee</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 1075] and [<em>Pearson Judith Rosemary v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</em> 1991] 2 SLR(R) 260]. After
      all, the application for an extension of time arises out of the would-be appellant’s
      default and not the default of the would-be respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, the prejudice cannot possibly refer to the fact that the would-be appellant
      would be deprived of his right of appeal if the extension were not granted. Otherwise, it
      would mean that in every case where an extension of time is sought by a would-be appellant,
      there would inevitably be prejudice to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    However, as is the case with the second factor, the prejudice
       alleged must be tangibly proven. As this court observed in <em>Aberdeen Asset
        Management Asia Ltd v Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 355] at
       [44]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The ‘prejudice’ cannot possibly refer to the fact that the
       appeal would thereby be continued, if the extension is granted. Otherwise, it would mean that
       in every case where the court considers the question of an extension of time to file notice
       of appeal, there is prejudice</em>. We endorse the views expressed in this regard by
      Woo Bih Li JC in <em>S3 Building Services Pte Ltd v Sky Technology Pte
       Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 87. <em>The ‘prejudice’ here must refer
       to some other factors, eg change of position on the part of the Defendant pursuant to
       judgment</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">See also <em>Wee Soon Kim Anthony</em> ([24] <em>supra</em>) at [55].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    Nor can the respondent argue that there has been prejudice by
       virtue of the fact that it would be unable to obtain the benefits of the judgment until the
       disposal of the appeal. As has been observed by this court in <em>Ong Cheng
        Aik v Dayco Products Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 561
        (“<em>Ong Cheng Aik</em>”) at [19], “[i]n any
       event, post-judgment interest should take care of that”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    Further, in the High Court decision of <em>S3
        Building Services Pte Ltd v Sky Technology Pte Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 87 (affirmed by
       the Court of Appeal in <em>S3 Building Services Pte Ltd v Sky Technology Pte
        Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 213, but without any specific comment on this particular
       point), Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) observed at [69] that “the prejudice must
       be one that cannot be compensated by an appropriate order as to costs”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Bearing in mind that the precise facts and
     circumstances of each case are all-important, the assessment of the four factors is, in the
     final analysis, guided by the need for <em>an integrated and holistic</em>
     approach (see <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is precisely because every case is different that
     the law also takes a calibrated approach in promoting the value of <em>finality</em>. Thus, there exists in the law a distinction drawn between an application
     for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal out of time (as here) and an application
     for an extension of time with respect to other situations (such as the filing of affidavits of
     evidence-in-chief out of time with regard to a pending action). We need only refer to our
     following observations in <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> (at
     [33]–[35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    It is clear, therefore, from the [case law], that the courts will
       adopt a far stricter approach towards applications for extension of time for the filing
       and/or serving of a notice of appeal relative to other situations. This is not without good
       reason. The overriding concern in the context of <em>appeals</em> is
       that there be <em>finality</em>. Indeed, the one-month deadline for the
       filing of a notice of appeal is not an arbitrary one. Underlying the concern with finality is
       the fundamental rationale of <em>justice and fairness</em>. The decision
       concerned has, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, gone against the losing party
        (<em>ie</em>, the would-be appellant), and the onus is therefore on it
       to file an appeal if it feels that the decision is wrong. Correspondingly, the other party
       (the would-be respondent), having had the decision handed down in its favour, should not be
       kept waiting – at least, not indefinitely – on tenterhooks to receive the fruits
       of its judgment. For better or for worse, the applicant must decide whether or not it wishes
       to appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The present system is eminently just and fair. Indeed, if the
       losing party is unsure whether or not to appeal against the decision, it can always file its
       notice of appeal first. Such notice can later be withdrawn if it is so desired.
       Alternatively, the appeal can be allowed to lapse. This being the case, it is clear that if
       the losing party drags its heels or is otherwise lackadaisical about its right to appeal,
       then it cannot legitimately ask the court for an extension of time to appeal. This is
       logical, commonsensical as well as (above all) just and fair. In the oft-cited words of
       Lord Guest in [<em>Ratnam v Cumarasamy</em> [1965] MLJ 228] at
       229:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Rules of Court must <em>prima facie</em> be obeyed, and in order
      to justify a court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be
      taken there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its discretion. <b><em>If the law were otherwise, a party in breach would have an unqualified right to an
       extension of time which would defeat the purpose of the rules which is to provide a
       [timetable] for the conduct of litigation</em></b>. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OS 1125</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The length of delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The delay involved in the present proceedings –
     the time between the last day for filing the Notice of Appeal and the commencement of
     OS 1125 – was close to <em>five months</em>. Whilst five months
     is a slightly shorter period compared to the delay in <em>Lee Hsien
      Loong</em> which was almost seven months and which was described (at [52]) as
     “[appearing] to be unprecedented in local case law” and (at [53]) as being
      “<em>nothing short of extraordinary</em>” [emphasis in
     original], the delay here can hardly be considered ordinary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On its own, this factor militated against the
     Plaintiff’s application, but, needless to say, it was not conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The reasons for the delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Given the long delay, the Plaintiff needed to furnish
     very good reasons to persuade us that the indulgence of this court was merited. However, the
     articulated reason was woefully unconvincing. Its main thrust was that the contents of the
     Tianjin judgments were only known when the judgments were released on 17 October 2013. It
     was only at that point that the merits of the Plaintiff’s case strengthened considerably.
     In consequence, OS 1125 was taken out relatively shortly thereafter, on 19 November
     2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We had no hesitation in giving little credit to the
     Plaintiff’s reason. As we shall explain below, at best, the Plaintiff had only itself to
     blame for its predicament; at worst, it was a cynical but ultimately unavailing attempt by the
     Plaintiff to manipulate the court process to its advantage. Either way, these were not
     situations that warranted our intervention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We start with an observation on the timing of the
     Tianjin proceedings. These were commenced on 26 June 2012, which was after the end of the
     first main tranche but before the second main tranche of the proceedings in the High Court
     here. The claims made in the Tianjin court were based on allegations of <em>fraud</em> (which were inherently factual issues) in relation to the transfer of FM and
     FT to Sino Vision. This specific allegation of fraud was not found in the Plaintiff’s
     pleadings in the High Court, a fact which we found somewhat surprising given the nature of the
     Plaintiff’s claim in the High Court, which was for a breach of fiduciary duties by the
     Defendant. The Judge evidently considered that fraud was not part of the Plaintiff’s case
     against the Defendant (see the HC Judgment at [14], [94]–[96] and [131]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In these circumstances, one would have expected the
     Plaintiff to amend its pleadings to introduce the same or corresponding allegation of fraud,
     and simultaneously to apply for a stay of the High Court proceedings to avoid parallel
     proceedings which would have introduced the risk of inconsistent judgments on a related
     issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Plaintiff took neither step. Even if the Plaintiff
     had good reasons for not seeking to amend its pleadings in the High Court to include the
     allegation of fraud by the Defendant, it could – and in our view, should – have
     applied to the Judge to stay the High Court proceedings, given what were apparently new
     developments. Given that the second main tranche had not yet begun, it was possible that the
     High Court might have permitted a stay pending a final resolution of the Tianjin
     proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In any case, it was irrelevant whether the High Court
     would have allowed the stay application because the point was that an application to stay the
     High Court proceedings could have been, but was not, taken out. The Plaintiff’s conduct
     thus suggested to us that it had made a conscious decision to conduct parallel proceedings.
     Although the Defendant was not a party to the Tianjin proceedings, we did not that think the
     Plaintiff could complain that the Tianjin proceedings and Singapore proceedings were not
     parallel proceedings for that reason. The fact that the Plaintiff sought to use the Tianjin
     judgments in an abortive appeal in Singapore demonstrates that the issues in both proceedings
     were intertwined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our judgment, therefore, the irresistible inference
     to be drawn from the Plaintiff’s inaction was that the Plaintiff intended and desired
     that the High Court proceedings and the Tianjin proceedings take place simultaneously. The
     reason for that, as it appeared to us, was effectively a case of the Plaintiff hedging its
     bets. The Plaintiff wanted as many procedural advantages as possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     If the High Court proceedings were decided in its
     favour, the Tianjin proceedings (to the extent that it related to the Defendant) would become
     academic in so far as the Plaintiff was concerned because a judgment of the High Court could be
     entered against the Defendant. If, however, the High Court proceedings went against it, the
     Plaintiff could still wait for the Tianjin court to decide on the issue of fraud and, if the
     Tianjin court ruled in its favour, the Plaintiff could then use the Tianjin judgments as the
     launch pad for its appeal against the High Court’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The risk in the Plaintiff’s strategy lay in the
     relevant timelines which were not fully in its control: if the High Court proceedings were
     concluded much earlier than the Tianjin proceedings, the Plaintiff’s ability to rely on
     favourable Tianjin judgments would be undermined. As it turned out, this was exactly what
     happened. The Tianjin judgments were issued some five months after the HC Judgment was
     issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     But why, then, did the Plaintiff not file a Notice of
     Appeal pending the decision of the Tianjin court, and then seek a stay of the appeal timelines?
     We could not be sure. The best and most charitable construction we could place on the
     Plaintiff’s conduct was that it was unaccountably tardy. If that was truly the case, then
     it had only itself to blame for the consequences of its inaction. Tardiness alone is a poor
     reason that would rarely justify the granting of extension of time particularly in the light of
     the long delay. We cautioned in <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> at [35] that if
     the losing party “drags its heels or is otherwise lackadaisical about its right to
     appeal, then it cannot legitimately ask the court for an extension of time to
     appeal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     An alternative view, which was less charitable but
     consistent with the inference that it was all a hedging exercise, was that the Plaintiff did
     not want to run the risk that the appeal against the HC Judgment would be heard before the
     Tianjin judgments were released. Had it filed a Notice of Appeal within the one-month deadline,
      <em>ie</em> before 23 June 2013, but was subsequently unable to
     obtain a stay of the appeal deadlines, the appeal could very well have been heard – and
     therefore decided – before the end of that year, particularly since the HC Judgment had
     already been issued. It was not clear on the evidence when the Plaintiff expected to receive
     the Tianjin judgments, but given that they were issued only on 17 October 2013, there was
     a real possibility that the Plaintiff would have, at the very least, had to prepare its case
     for the appeal without the benefit of the Tianjin judgments, and, further, that the appeal
     might have been heard and decided even before the Tianjin judgments were
    released.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Plaintiff obviously thought very little of its
     chances of succeeding without the Tianjin judgments: implicit in its articulated reason for the
     delay (see above at [20]) was an admission that an appeal mounted without the benefit of the
     Tianjin judgments would probably have failed. If that was the case, then the Plaintiff’s
     deliberate withholding of the filing of a Notice of Appeal until such time that it could muster
     sufficient ammunition in the form of favourable judgments from the Tianjin court to sustain a
     creditable appeal could only be characterised as a calculated risk, one designed to give it
     maximum benefits with minimum effort. We could not countenance, much less reward, such action
     on the part of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The gist of the Plaintiff’s litigation strategy
     can be summed up as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Plaintiff took out related
      proceedings in Tianjin in the middle of the Singapore proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, despite knowing that the Tianjin
      proceedings were related to the Singapore proceedings, the Plaintiff was happy to allow the
      Singapore proceedings to continue without so much as informing the High Court that the
      parallel proceedings in Tianjin might have an impact on the Singapore
     proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, when the
      Singapore proceedings finally culminated in the HC Judgment, the Plaintiff elected not to file
      a Notice of Appeal within the prescribed one-month window.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, even after the outcome of the Tianjin proceedings
      became known to it, the Plaintiff took no immediate steps to seek leave to file a Notice of
      Appeal, though the Plaintiff explained that this was because the Tianjin judgments were only
      enforceable after a 30-day period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_e"></a>(e)     Finally, the Plaintiff took out OS 1125 only in November 2013, a month after
      receiving the Tianjin judgments, and, even then, waited to March 2014 to take out
      SUM 1410 to seek an adjournment of OS 1125 until after the Supreme People’s
      Court of the PRC had heard the appeals arising from the Tianjin
    judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In our view, the lack of merits in the
     Plaintiff’s case was self-evident in the above chronology of Plaintiff’s litigation
     strategy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Before us, the Plaintiff kept emphasising that the
     proceedings in the PRC had an important bearing on the outcome of the matters before this
     court, and that it was in the Plaintiff’s best interests for the first instance
     proceedings, and then the appeal before the Supreme People’s Court of the PRC, to be
     decided first so that the outcome there could be considered in the Singapore proceedings. That
     to us was precisely why OS 1125 had to be dismissed. The Plaintiff was essentially saying
     (whether it realised it or not) that our trial process, the appeal process, timelines for
     filing appeals as well as all other associated rules were subordinate to the foreign
     proceedings. We did not think that the Plaintiff’s blithe disregard for our processes was
     at all acceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We have said that if a losing party drags its heels in
     asserting its right to appeal, it cannot legitimately seek an extension of time to appeal (see
     above at [29]). This principle applies with greater force where the plaintiff, as was the case
     here, had authored or even engineered a litigation strategy that evinced such scant regard for
     our court process. To allow the Plaintiff’s request for an extension of time to file a
     Notice of Appeal would have been to encourage such wholly unacceptable conduct in future cases
     by other litigants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     There is one more observation that we wish to make. On
     5 November 2013 in a separate hearing concerning winding up proceedings initiated by the
     Defendant against the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff’s counsel – a colleague of
     Mr Alfred Dodwell (“Mr Dodwell”), the Plaintiff’s counsel in
     OS 1125 and the hearing before us – informed the court that there was no instruction
     “to apply to appeal against [the HC Judgment] in spite of what Mr Dodwell told the
     Court on 11 October 2013”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, just two weeks later on 19 November 2013,
     the Plaintiff filed the present OS 1125. Therefore, when the parties returned for the next
     hearing in the winding up proceedings on 21 November 2013, the Defendant’s counsel
     voiced his displeasure, calling the Plaintiff’s apparent change of position an abuse of
     process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We thought that the Plaintiff’s counsel’s
     statement to the court on 5 November 2013 may be read in a number of ways, and not
     necessarily as a firm commitment that no appeal would be filed. It appears from the record that
     Mr Dodwell had in an earlier hearing in the winding up proceedings on 11 October 2013
     told the court that it was open to the Plaintiff to ask for an extension of time to file an
     appeal against the HC Judgment after the Tianjin judgments were released, assuming the outcome
     there was in the Plaintiff’s favour. His colleague’s statement on 5 November
     2013 could therefore be interpreted as clarifying that <em>although</em>
     Mr Dodwell had highlighted this tentative possibility, the Plaintiff had not yet, as of
     5 November 2013, despite having the benefit of the Tianjin judgments by that time and
     having received legal advice, given any instructions on whether it wanted to appeal against the
     HC Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Whilst the Plaintiff could and probably should have
     stated its stance more clearly over the course of the various hearings in the winding up
     proceedings, we did not consider that the lack of clarity amounted to an abuse of process as
     complained of by the Defendant’s counsel in the hearing on 21 November 2013.
     Notwithstanding this, we take this opportunity to state categorically that a plaintiff who
     takes the position in related proceedings that it would not appeal should not be permitted to
     resile from its original intent subsequently without demonstrating strong cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The principle underlying this is that of finality. The
     public as well as the parties concerned – in particular the winning party – expect
     a point at which proceedings must end (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of
      <em>Tan Sia Boo v Ong Chiang Kwong</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 298 at [4]
     and the excerpt from <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> cited above at [17]). The
     winning party is entitled to know its position, and to order its affairs in reliance not just
     on timelines set by the court but also on the opposing party’s communications to the
     court. Hence, even if no prejudice would be caused to the winning party, we thought that a dim
     view ought to be taken of the reasons given by a losing party for making a 180-degree turn
     after having taken steps to throw the other party off the legal scent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s reasons for the
     delay were manifestly unconvincing. The sequence of events that took place was, in our view,
     akin to an abuse of the court’s process which, under ordinary circumstances, would garner
     no sympathy from the court. If this was the sole consideration under the framework for
     determining whether leave to file a Notice of Appeal out of time should be given, we would have
     had no hesitation in dismissing the Plaintiff’s application without more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However, as we have stated above at [16], the reason
     for delay is but one of four factors which the law assesses in the round as part of an
     integrated and holistic approach. The Plaintiff’s unsatisfactory conduct of its
     proceedings therefore had to be balanced against the rest of the factors. But we should add
     here that there may be exceptional cases in which the conduct of the plaintiff is so deplorable
     that the court simply cannot countenance granting an application for an extension of time to
     file an appeal. For such exceptional cases, a consideration of the other factors, including the
     merits of an appeal, might be academic, precisely because a <em>holistic</em> approach demands the strictest of responses to the most egregious
     instances of an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Having said that, it was not necessary for us to decide
     whether the present case falls into that exceptional category for, as we shall explain below,
     the third factor, that is, whether the appeal was hopeless, was, in any event, not in the
     Plaintiff’s favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the appeal was hopeless</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Plaintiff appeared to take the view that it would
     be able to succeed in the appeal and was therefore entitled to an extension of time
     because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     The findings and decision in the Tianjin
      judgments supported the Plaintiff’s case as they showed that the Defendant had acted
      dishonestly in respect of the transaction involving FM and FT. This shall be referred to as
      “the Contents Argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was evidence that the signatures on a board resolution dated 9 July 2009
      (“the Board Resolution”) purporting to transfer the shares in FM and FT to Sino
      Vision had been forged by the Defendant. The evidence included an affidavit by one of the
      directors that he had not signed the resolution. This shall be referred to as “the New
      Evidence Argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
      consequence of the Tianjin judgments was that the Plaintiff would be restored as the owner of
      FM and FT. Once that happened, the Plaintiff would have access to the accounts and other
      management books of the two subsidiaries, and would be able to uncover further evidence of the
      Defendant’s breaches of his duties to the Plaintiff. This shall be referred to as
      “the Consequences Argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On the whole, for the reasons which are set out below,
     we thought that any appeal would have been hopeless.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Contents Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     While the tenor of the Plaintiff’s case was that
     the contents of the Tianjin judgments <em>generally</em> supported its
     case of dishonest conduct by the Defendant, the Plaintiff specifically referred to one finding
     of the Tianjin court, namely, the finding that the Board Resolution was forged by the
     Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It was common ground that this issue was never pleaded
     in the action in the High Court. In fact, it was expressly noted by the Judge (at [56] of the
     HC Judgment) that the Plaintiff was “not challenging this [Board Resolution]. Its case
     is simply that shareholders’ approval must be sought, and no such approval was
     obtained.” Even leaving that aside, if the Plaintiff was seeking to rely on this finding
     in the Tianjin judgment that the Board Resolution was forged by way of an issue estoppel, then
     in our view the Plaintiff had no legal basis to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The first difficulty for the Plaintiff was an
     evidential one. This was whether the Tianjin judgments in fact said what the Plaintiff claimed
     they did (in this regard, see, for example, the approach taken by the Singapore High Court in
      <em>Giant Light Metal Technology (Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte
      Ltd</em> [2014] 2 SLR 545 at [65]–[71]). While the Plaintiff adduced an
     affidavit filed by one Wu Chun Xi (“Mr Wu”), a lawyer called to the bar in
     the PRC, which briefly set out certain conclusions of the Tianjin judgments, the affidavit did
     not expressly mention that the Tianjin judgments found that the Board Resolution was
     forged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The other (and more important) reason why the
     Plaintiff’s reliance on the Tianjin judgments was misplaced was that the Defendant was
     never a party to the Tianjin proceedings. The proceedings in the Tianjin court were between the
     Plaintiff on the one side, and FM, FT and Sino Vision on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     A foreign judgment can only be raised and relied upon
     to found an issue estoppel if certain conditions are fulfilled. One such condition is that the
     parties in the local proceedings in which the contents of the foreign judgment which is sought
     to be recognised must be the same parties (or be privy to the parties) in the foreign
     proceedings (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Conflict of
      Laws</em> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2013 Reissue) at [75.199]). On the face of the
     Tianjin judgments, the Defendant was neither a party nor privy to the parties in the Tianjin
     proceedings. In fact, Mr Wu acknowledged that the Defendant was not made a party because
     the Tianjin proceedings were “actions to recover shares and assets transferred to Sino
     Vision” and “recover all assets of the Defendants [<em>ie</em>, FM and FT] as a result of this illegal transfer of
    shares”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Accordingly, the findings in the Tianjin judgments
     could not be relied on by the Plaintiff to raise an issue estoppel against the Defendant in the
     Singapore proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The New Evidence Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Plaintiff submitted that there were three pieces of
     evidence which would bolster its case but that were not brought to the High Court’s
     attention during the trial. They were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     The signature on the Board Resolution of one
      Cheng Ji Jiang (“Mr Cheng”), a former director of the Plaintiff, appeared
      to be pictorially different from his signature on his letter of resignation dated 29 July
      2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     One Fei Xue Jun
      (“Mr Fei”), a former director of the Plaintiff, swore an affidavit dated
      16 August 2010 that he had not signed the Board Resolution and had not participated in
      any board meetings discussing any resolution to sell the shares in FM and
     FT.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     One David Lu Hai Ge
      (“Mr Lu”), another former director of the Plaintiff, had already resigned
      as director on 19 January 2009 and therefore could not have signed the Board Resolution
      which was dated 9 July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     To persuade this court that these three pieces of
     evidence should be considered by this court now as part of the record, the Plaintiff needed to
     satisfy us, at the very least under the first limb of the test in <em>Ladd v
      Marshall</em> [1954] 1 WLR 1489 (“<em>Ladd v
      Marshall</em>”), that this fresh evidence could not have been discovered at the
     time of trial with reasonable diligence. This was where the Plaintiff had, in our view,
     considerable difficulty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The first difficulty was an issue of pleading. Again,
     we return to the point that this issue of the allegedly forged Board Resolution could have been
     but was not raised in the action before the High Court. The allegations of fraud were contained
     in a document known as the Evidence Explanatory Notes, which was filed at an early stage of the
     Tianjin proceedings. Thus, while the Plaintiff had pointed to the Board Resolution in its
     attempt to unwind the disposal of FM and FT before the Tianjin court, it had decided at the
     same time (for reasons best known to itself) not to raise the alleged fraudulent procurement of
     the Board Resolution as an issue in the proceedings in the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Dodwell confirmed in the course of oral
     arguments before this court that this issue had not been pressed in the proceedings below.
     Mr Dodwell also candidly acknowledged that procedurally, in these circumstances, the
     Plaintiff had no “leg to stand on”. We could not agree with many of
     Mr Dodwell’s submissions but this was one point that we were in full agreement with.
     To be fair to Mr Dodwell, we should make clear that he was not the counsel on record for
     the Plaintiff in the High Court proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Secondly, the three pieces of evidence referred to
     above were all in existence or at least appeared to have been discoverable at the time of the
     commencement of the action, and certainly at the time of the trial in the High Court. There was
     no evidence from the Plaintiff (or even an allegation in its supporting affidavits) that the
     Board Resolution, the resignation letter of Mr Cheng, the affidavit by Mr Fei and the
     fact that Mr Lu had allegedly already resigned by the time the Board Resolution was
     signed, were all unavailable or unknown to the Plaintiff throughout the course of the High
     Court proceedings. On the contrary, at least in relation to the Board Resolution, the
     Plaintiff’s position in its affidavit was that the Board Resolution was tendered in the
     court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In addition, the fact that the allegation pertaining to
     the Board Resolution was raised to the Tianjin court at an early stage (even though the exact
     date is unknown) suggested to us that the Plaintiff was probably in possession of all the
     relevant evidence, or at least had access to those pieces of evidence, even before the
     conclusion of the High Court trial. The evidence was therefore not <em>fresh</em> evidence which could now pass muster under the <em>Ladd v
      Marshall</em> principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Although it is frequently said that fraud vitiates all,
     the law does not say that evidence of fraud which existed at the time of trial but was withheld
     and only adduced after judgment is released can still be used to unravel that judgment. The law
     recognises a balance between abuse in the form of fraudulent conduct and abuse in the form of
     tactical litigation. Once parties have had their day in court and have decided either not to
     mount certain arguments or to withhold the presentation of certain evidence that is beneficial
     for their case, they should not be permitted, because of an adverse judgment, to subsequently
     introduce those new arguments and evidence to undermine that judgment, especially in an
     application to appeal five months after the time for appealing had expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The Consequences Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The submission here was that once the Plaintiff
     acquired control over FM and FT’s operations including physical possession of the
     factories in consequence of the Tianjin judgments, it would have access to an abundant source
     of information which was likely to demonstrate that the Defendant had breached his duties to
     the Plaintiff. That might very well be the case, but at this point in time that was all pure
     speculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Further, the pending appeal before the Supreme
     People’s Court of the PRC was scheduled to be heard on 28 April 2014, three weeks
     after the hearing of OS 1125 before us, and the evidence from Mr Wu was that there
     were no limits as to how long the Supreme People’s Court could take to render a decision.
     Even assuming that the appeal would be dismissed, it would take time before the transfer of
     ownership of FM and FT was effected. Even more time would be required to unearth the
     Defendant’s alleged wrongdoings. It was therefore entirely too speculative, on the basis
     of the evidence before us, to conclude that there was even any evidence in the present
     possession of FM and FT that would support the Plaintiff’s case, let alone that such
     evidence could be procured within any reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In conclusion, as was the case with the second factor,
     we were not convinced that the third factor was in the Plaintiff’s favour. Consistent
     with our decision in <em>Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd v
      Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 355 at [43], it should also
     be apparent that we came to this conclusion without having to undertake a full-scale
     examination of the merits of the underlying dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     We come now to the fourth and final factor, that is,
     whether prejudice would be caused to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether prejudice would be caused to the Defendant if an extension of time was
    granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant would not
     suffer any material prejudice as he had not yet received payment of the judgment sum. Any other
     prejudice, it was submitted, could be compensated for by way of an appropriate costs order. The
     Defendant submitted that he had already incurred substantial costs in his attempts to enforce
     the HC Judgment, and further delay in the winding up of the Plaintiff might result in the loss
     of documents and information which could have gone towards proving the assets of the
     Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We agreed with the Plaintiff’s submission that
     there was no material prejudice to the Defendant that could not be compensated by an
     appropriate costs order. The Defendant’s submissions also conceded as much. This was not
     a case where the judgment sum had been paid and expended by the Defendant. The Defendant was
     not any worse off now than at the time of the release of the HC Judgment, save for sums
     incurred to enforce the judgment debt. Those could be recovered as costs in the respective
     applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">An integrated and holistic approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Although the last factor was in the Plaintiff’s
     favour, looking at all the factors in relation to the relevant facts and circumstances and
     taking an integrated and holistic approach (see above at [16]), it was plain beyond question
     that OS 1125 had no merit and ought therefore to be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     A constant feature in the Plaintiff’s submissions
     and affidavits was that the Defendant had to be brought to justice. There are many aspects to
     justice and one of them is finality in proceedings (see above at [17]). However, it was clear
     to us that our decision here was by no means the end of the legal road for the Plaintiff.
     Should the appeal before the Supreme People’s Court of the PRC be dismissed, the
     Plaintiff would have a very strong remedy against the Defendant. It would have a judgment from
     the Supreme People’s Court of the PRC affirming the Tianjin judgments, and upon which it
     could take the necessary steps available to pursue the Defendant, particularly in the PRC. This
     was a point made by the Plaintiff’s PRC counsel, Mr Wu, whose affidavit suggested
     that there was already an ongoing action against the Defendant in the PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Mr Dodwell mentioned that there were pending
     winding up proceedings taken out against the Plaintiff in Singapore (which were alluded to
     above at [37]) and that, if the Plaintiff was wound up, it would be too late to utilise any
     funds that might be recovered from the Defendant in the proceedings in the PRC to pay the
     creditors in the winding up proceedings. That was a legitimate concern but, as we pointed out
     during the course of the oral arguments, there was nothing preventing the Plaintiff from
     applying for a stay of the winding up proceedings here pending the outcome of the appeal before
     the Supreme People’s Court of the PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It transpired that after we gave our decision on
     8 April 2014, the High Court heard the winding up application on 15 May 2014 and
     thereupon ordered the Plaintiff to be wound up (though the order was extracted only extracted
     on 3 June 2014). However, as the liquidator may “bring … any action or other
     legal proceeding in the name and on behalf of the company” (see s 272(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)), the Plaintiff may yet
     recover control of FT and FM and continue to prosecute its action in the PRC against the
     Defendant. What fruits of litigation may be reaped by the Plaintiff from any litigation in the
     PRC depends on how the proceedings there in relation to both the appeal to be decided by the
     Supreme People’s Court of the PRC and the action against the Defendant unfold but these
     were obviously issues beyond the remit of this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SUM 1410</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Given our decision with regard to OS 1125, it
     followed that SUM 1410 ought to be dismissed as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For the reasons set out above, we dismissed both
     OS 1125 as well as SUM 1410, with costs fixed at $10,000 (including disbursements) to
     the Defendant. The usual consequential orders followed.</p>
