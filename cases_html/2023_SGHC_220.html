and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Winson sold the same quantity of gasoil back to Hin Leong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The banks, however, contend that no cargo of gasoil was shipped for the Subject Transactions (in particular, the Winson – Hin Leong sale, which was financed by the banks’ LCs), and that the copy non-negotiable bills of lading (“BLs”) which purportedly showed such shipments were forgeries. Winson had relied on those copy BLs in preparing the letters of indemnity (“LOIs”) that it presented to the banks for payment under the LCs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The banks rely on the Fraud Exception to resist Winson’s claim for payment under the LCs, asserting that Winson had fraudulently made false statements in its presentations for payment under the LCs. The banks contend that the Winson – Hin Leong sale was a sham, and in any event that no cargoes had been shipped for that sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The banks also rely on the Nullity Exception, contending that because no cargoes had been shipped for the Winson – Hin Leong sale, the LOIs that Winson had presented for payment were nullities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 SCB raises three further grounds to resist payment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that Winson’s presentation was not a complying presentation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) unconscionability; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Winson allegedly having suffered no loss, because Winson had assigned certain rights to Winson Oil Bunkering Pte Ltd (“Winson Oil Bunkering”) pursuant to which Winson Oil Bunkering had paid Winson the same amount (US$60,852,855.49) that Winson is claiming from the banks in these suits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I address the following in turn:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Fraud Exception;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Nullity Exception;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) non-compliance;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) unconscionability; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether Winson’s claim fails because it suffered no loss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Fraud Exception</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Fraud Exception was articulated by Lord Diplock in the seminal English decision of <span class="font-italic">United City Merchants (</span><span class="font-italic">Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada</span> [1983] 1 AC 168 (<span class="font-italic">“U</span><span class="font-italic">nited City Merchants”</span>) at 183, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If, on their face, the documents presented to the confirming bank by the seller conform with the requirements of the credit as notified to him by the confirming bank, that bank is under a contractual obligation to the seller to honour the credit, notwithstanding that the bank has knowledge that the seller at the time of presentation of the conforming documents is alleged by the buyer to have, and in fact has already, committed a breach of his contract with the buyer for the sale of the goods to which the documents appear on their face to relate, that would have entitled the buyer to treat the contract of sale as rescinded and to reject the goods and refuse to pay the seller the purchase price. The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with control of the goods that does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To this general statement of principle as to the contractual obligations of the confirming bank to the seller, there is one established exception: that is, where the seller, for the purpose of drawing on the credit, fraudulently presents to the confirming bank documents that contain, expressly or by implication, material representations of fact that to his knowledge are untrue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Fraud Exception has been accepted as the law in Singapore: <span class="font-italic">Brody, White and Co Inc v </span><span class="font-italic">Chemet Handel Trading (S) Pte Ltd</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 146 (<span class="font-italic">“Brody”</span>) at [20]–[21], where the Court of Appeal cited <span class="font-italic">United City Merchants</span> and quoted the above extract from the judgment in that case. The Court of Appeal also stated at [21] of <span class="font-italic">Brody</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It appeared to us that the kind of fraud sufficient to constitute an exception to the autonomy of an irrevocable credit is fraud in the presentation of the required documents to the bank, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> where the beneficiary, for the purpose of drawing on the credit, fraudulently presents to the bank documents that contain material representations of fact that to his knowledge are untrue: <span class="font-italic">United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada</span> ([20] supra). It would seem that fraud as perpetrated by the seller on the buyer in respect of the underlying contract of sale between them would not affect the contract of documentary credit between the seller and the issuing/confirming bank. This can be seen from the seminal judgment of Lord Diplock in the <span class="font-italic">United City Merchants</span> case. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Fraud Exception involves the beneficiary of an LC <span class="font-italic">fraudulently</span> making <span class="font-italic">false</span> statements to the bank. As stated in <span class="font-italic">United City Merchants</span> and <span class="font-italic">Brody</span>, a beneficiary acts <span class="font-italic">fraudulently</span> if he presents to the bank documents that contain material representations of fact that <span class="font-weight-bold">to his knowledge are untrue</span>. It is, however, common ground between the parties in the present case that a beneficiary is also fraudulent if he makes a false representation “without belief in its truth”. That was, moreover, accepted by the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) in <span class="font-italic">Credit Agricole Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Singapore Branch v PPT Energy Trading Co Ltd and another suit</span> [2022] 4 SLR 1 (<span class="font-italic">“CACIB v PPT”</span>). The SICC put it thus at [20]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… fraud [in the presentation of documents] can only, by definition, encompass a beneficiary who acts dishonestly, in presenting otherwise facially compliant documents either <span class="font-italic">with the knowledge that what is contained there is false, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span><span class="font-italic"> without belief that what is contained therein is true</span>. [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The parties, however, dispute whether a beneficiary would also be fraudulent if he made a false representation recklessly, without caring whether it be true or false. The SICC in <span class="font-italic">CACIB v PPT</span> held that in that instance, the beneficiary would not have acted fraudulently: <span class="font-italic">CACIB v PPT </span>at [21].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the leading case on the tort of deceit, <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span> (1889) 14 App Cas 337 (“<span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span>”), Lord Herschell stated at 374:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Although the parties here disagree over whether the third category in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span> (“recklessly, careless whether it be true or false”) would satisfy the Fraud Exception in the case of LCs, Lord Herschell had explained that the third category was but an instance of the second category (“without belief in its truth”) for a person who makes a false statement recklessly, careless whether it be true or false “can have no real belief in the truth of what he states”. I respectfully agree with that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 That the second category in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span> encompasses the third category is also supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Panatron”</span>). The court at [13] cited with approval Lord Herschell’s three categories in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span> (1889) 14 App Cas 337 the tort was further developed. It was held that in an action of deceit the plaintiff must prove actual fraud. This fraud is proved only when it is shown that a false representation has been made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly, without caring whether it be true or false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The court in <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span> then went on to state at [14] that one of the elements of the tort of deceit was: “the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or <span class="font-italic">at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true</span>.” [emphasis added] The court thereby subsumed the third category (“recklessly, without caring whether it be true or false”) in the second category (“without belief in its truth”), which was also Lord Herschell’s view of those categories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As the second category in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span> (which the parties agree would amount to fraud) encompasses the third category (which the parties are in dispute over), the dispute over the third category is moot.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 For completeness, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Arab Banking</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp (B.S.C.) v Boustead Singapore Ltd</span> [2016] 3 SLR 557 (<span class="font-italic">“Arab Banking”</span>) accepted that in cases concerning calls on “on demand” performance guarantees/bonds, the Fraud Exception would include cases in the third category of <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span>. At [63] the court said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it would be fraudulent for a person to make a false representation, if he was recklessly indifferent to the truth or falsity of that which he was asserting at the time he made the statement. In our judgment, in a similar vein, a beneficiary that presents an invalid demand under a demand guarantee <span class="font-italic">recklessly, that is to say indifferent to whether it is or is not a valid demand, would also be acting fraudulently</span>. [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Although <span class="font-italic">Arab Banking</span> concerned demand guarantees rather than LCs, the court stated at [65] that “there should be no distinction in the operation of the fraud exception in the context either of letters of credit or of demand guarantees”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">CACIB v PPT</span>, in deciding that the third category in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span> would not suffice for the Fraud Exception, the court at [21] cited <span class="font-italic">DBS</span><span class="font-italic"> Bank Ltd v Carrier Singapore (Pte) Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 261 (<span class="font-italic">“DBS v Carrier”</span>) where the court observed that negligence on the part of the beneficiary had not been accepted as a justification for a bank to refuse payment on an LC (<span class="font-italic">DBS v Carrier</span> at [95]). From that, the court in <span class="font-italic">CACIB v PPT</span> reasoned that “a failure, even a reckless failure to ascertain the truth of representations, which are made in the honest belief that they are true, will not amount to fraud for the purposes of non-payment under a letter of credit”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I make two points about that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Fraud Exception (and indeed, the tort of deceit) is not premised on the existence of a duty of care (unlike a claim in the tort of negligence). Fraud on the beneficiary’s part is a basis on which the bank can deny payment, and that fraudulent beneficiary cannot improve his position by contending that he did not owe a duty of care to the bank.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In declining to accept that recklessness can amount to fraud, the recklessness which the court had in mind in <span class="font-italic">CACIB v PPT</span> was not incompatible with the beneficiary still having “the honest belief that [his representations] are true”, whereas the recklessness in the third category of <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span>, is such that the representor “can have no real belief in the truth of what he states” (per Lord Herschell in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 For the Fraud Exception, recklessness is not merely a more serious type of negligence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a more serious failure to take care; there is recklessness for the Fraud Exception where, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Arab Banking</span> at [62]–[63], the representor is “recklessly indifferent to the truth or falsity of that which he was asserting”. The Court of Appeal cited <span class="font-italic">Angus v Clifford</span> [1891] 2 Ch 449 for this explanation of recklessness: “did he make [the statement] without knowing whether it was false, and without caring? Not caring, in that context, did not mean not taking care, it meant indifference to the truth, the moral obliquity which consists in a wilful disregard of the importance of truth”. That is what Lord Herschell meant in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span> when he used the phrase,<span class="font-italic"> </span>“recklessly, careless whether it be true or false” – “careless” there means “not caring”, being indifferent to the truth; rather than “failing to take care” in the negligence sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 For the reasons given above, I would respectfully decline to follow <span class="font-italic">CACIB v PPT</span> on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Fraud Exception is thus satisfied if in presenting documents for payment, a beneficiary makes a false representation of material fact knowingly, or without belief in its truth (which <span class="font-italic">includes</span> the beneficiary being reckless, in the sense of being indifferent to the truth).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did Winson make false representations of material fact to the banks?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The banks say that the LOIs which Winson presented to them contain various representations of material fact, which are false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The LOIs

The issue before me is simply whether the cargo for the Subject Transactions was shipped, pursuant to valid BLs, as described in Winson’s LOIs.

The invoices and LOIs for the second presentation are all dated 15 April 2020, and the issue is essentially whether Winson believed in the truth of the representations when those documents were prepared on or around 15 April 2020, and still believed in their truth when the presentations were made to OCBC on 16 April 2020 and to SCB on 21 April 2020 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Winson’s LOIs were based on copy non-negotiable BLs (front page only) that it had received.

The banks contend that the Subject Transactions were pre-structured as part of their argument that the Winson – Hin Leong sale was a sham, and I have not found it necessary to decide the issue of sham. Nevertheless, whether the Subject Transactions were pre-structured may be relevant to Winson’s state of mind when it presented documents for payment under the LCs, even if the Winson – Hin Leong sale were not a sham.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I find that the Subject Transactions were pre-structured, for three main reasons. First, having put forged BLs into circulation, Hin Leong would have wanted them back by way of pre-structured transactions, with Trafigura and Winson performing their obligations as downstream sellers using only the vessels and cargo chosen by Hin Leong as original supplier. If Trafigura or Winson were to choose another source for their respective supplies (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from<span class="font-italic"> </span>Trafigura to Winson, or from Winson to Hin Leong), the forged BLs would then have caused trouble for Hin Leong when they were relied upon to collect cargo, and were found to be ineffective. This points to the Hin Leong – Trafigura – Winson – Hin Leong circular trade being for vessels and cargo chosen by Hin Leong, rather than for fungible quantities of gasoil.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Second, Winson made its first presentation to OCBC on 7 April 2020 based on an invoice and LOI both dated 6 April 2020, representing that goods had been shipped on board the Ocean Voyager, when the nomination of the Ocean Voyager (and that of the Ocean Taipan) had yet to be confirmed – the correspondence confirming nomination only took place on 7 April 2020, and moreover on the terms of the Trafigura – Winson contract the nominated vessels could still be substituted. Winson argues that the Subject Transactions were not circular until a nomination was made, accepted, and no substitution option remained available.

</div> On the terms of the Trafigura – Winson and Winson – Hin Leong contracts, substitution would still be possible until ETA at disport. If that were the case, Winson could not honestly have made its first presentations on 6 and 9 April 2020, for substitution was still possible and Winson could not honestly have represented that it had received title to cargo onboard the Ocean Voyager and the Ocean Taipan. The conclusion I draw is that the Subject Transactions were pre-structured on the basis that Hin Leong (which was both original supplier and ultimate buyer) would decide on the vessels and cargo, with Trafigura and Winson remaining passive in that regard. Trafigura and Winson never had any real nomination or substitution rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Third, the worsening market conditions in the afternoon of 27 March 2020

</div> were such that it made no commercial sense for Hin Leong to repurchase the goods from Winson, unless the Subject Transactions were pre-structured. At 2.54pm on 27 March 2020, Hin Leong sold Trafigura 2 x 780,000 barrels of gasoil at a price of Mean of Platts Singapore (“MOPS”) for gasoil 10ppm, plus a premium of US$2.30 per barrel. At 3.19pm that day, Trafigura sold Winson the same quantity of gasoil at MOPS plus US$2.35 per barrel. At 5.10pm, Winson sold Hin Leong the same quantity of gasoil at MOPS plus US$2.35 per barrel. In terms of price, Hin Leong made a loss of US$0.05 per barrel, Trafigura made a profit of US$0.05 per barrel, and Winson broke even. Winson emphasises that in terms of price it made commercial sense for it to have bought gasoil from Trafigura at the price it did (expecting to make a profit), and to have sold it at the same price to Hin Leong (as the market had worsened, and Winson might make a loss if it held onto the gasoil). On a parity of reasoning, though, it made no commercial sense (in terms of price) for <span class="font-italic">Hin Leong</span> to have bought back the same quantity of gasoil from Winson at a <span class="font-italic">higher</span> price (than what Hin Leong had sold it for to Trafigura), when the market for gasoil had become <span class="font-italic">worse</span>. The transacted prices, and the market conditions on the day, suggest that the Subject Transactions were pre-structured, with all parties knowing in advance how they would emerge on a net basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) No loading documents</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Winson never received any loading documents for the shipments on the Ocean Voyager and the Ocean Taipan.

The evidence of other trades done by Winson involving cargo shipped to Europe shows that in less time than that, loading documents were always received by Winson (and Winson’s buyers). Loading documents were typically made available some two to three days from shipment date, and when that was done as late as eight days after shipment, Winson apologised. That contrasts with Winson not asking Hin Leong again for the loading documents, after its initial request on 6 April 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Winson contends that it always believed that cargo had been loaded as shown on the copy BLs, because of the copy BLs, the contracts it had entered into, and the fact that it had obtained the copy BLs from reputable parties (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Trafigura and Hin Leong).

Ms Ng’s evidence is that they were references to whether Winson had obtained clean title from Trafigura and in turn passed clean title on to Hin Leong. Winson, on the other hand, contends that they were just references to whether Hin Leong may have resold the cargo to some other party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I accept Ms Ng’s evidence on this point. The messages of 1.41pm and 1.54pm of 15 April 2020 are of particular importance here. Ms Ng said she would need the BL to act, and asked if Ms Tung’s side had it; Mr Tung said Winson’s supplier had not received it, and that supplier needed to repay their financing bank before the BL could be released to Winson. Ms Tung then said, “We’re checking if [there] are other ways we can ensure clean title.” By “other ways” to ensure clean title, Ms Tung could only have meant ways other than obtaining the BL, which she and Ms Ng had just been discussing. The BL was a document of title to the Ocean Voyager cargo, and obtaining it would have assuaged OCBC’s concern that Winson and (through Winson) Hin Leong had not obtained title to that cargo. This interpretation is reinforced by what Ms Ng then said: she asked whether title should have been transferred to Winson for Winson to present the LOI to OCBC; Ms Tung responded to agree with that, but added that Winson did not have the BL yet, which was why it used an LOI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In contrast, there was no express discussion about checking whether Hin Leong had resold the cargo (which is what Ms Tung says the references to “clean title” were all about). Ms Tung says her reference to “other ways we can ensure clean title” meant ways other than OCBC checking with Hin Leong whether the cargo had been resold.

</div> I do not accept that.  Ms Tung’s reference to “other ways” came right after she and Ms Ng were discussing obtaining the BL, and obviously referred to that. Furthermore, if the BL were obtained, it would not show whether Hin Leong may have resold the cargo. Any endorsements in respect of such a sale would not have taken place until after the endorsements and delivery of the BL pursuant to the Trafigura – Winson and Winson – Hin Leong contracts. Therefore, Ms Tung’s reference to “other ways” to ensure clean title (meaning, ways other than obtaining the BL) could only have been a reference to checking whether Winson had obtained good title from Trafigura (its upstream supplier), rather than to checking whether Hin Leong (its downstream buyer) may have resold the cargo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The picture which emerges is:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Winson was unwilling to repurchase the cargo, although one might expect a trader who had sold a cargo to be open to repurchasing it if the price was right; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Winson was willing to help find a buyer for the cargo, but repeatedly emphasised the need to check if title to the cargo was clean, which in the context meant whether Trafigura had passed clean title to Winson, and Winson in turn to Hin Leong. A new buyer would then be able to get clean title to the cargo. Ms Tung recognised that title should have been transferred to Winson for Winson to present its LOI to OCBC, but nevertheless was expressing concern about whether that title transfer had in fact taken place, hence the emphasis on the need to check that title was clean before getting any other party to buy the cargo (with Winson itself being unwilling to do so). While this by itself might not show that Winson already did not believe it had good title to the cargo, it shows that Winson at least had doubts – doubts it should have sought to clear, but which it did not, when OCBC then rejected its first presentation, as I discuss in the next section.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(F) OCBC’s rejection of Winson’s first presentation for the Ocean Voyager</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 If Winson still needed a wake-up call, it received that when OCBC rejected Winson’s first presentation for the Ocean Voyager.

Indeed, Ms Tung did receive an internal email at 11.17pm on 15 April 2020 forwarding her the shipment details and copy BLs received from Hin Leong on 6 April 2020, identifying OCBC as the LC-issuing bank for the Ocean Taipan cargo, and SCB as the LC-issuing bank for the Ocean Voyager cargo.

Winson did not engage with OCBC to understand OCBC’s rejection better, and it did not conduct checks to confirm if the Ocean Voyager cargo (or the Ocean Taipan cargo) had in fact been shipped as represented in its LOIs, as I elaborate in the next section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Before leaving the matter of the second presentations, I add the observation that Winson was not honest with OCBC about the reason for its second presentation to OCBC.

Mr Cai did not ask about loading, or for evidence of loading, and according to him the furthest Trafigura went was to say, “[t]he cargoes have already given you”, which would be to the effect that the cargo had already been sold by Trafigura to Winson. Added to this is the fact that Trafigura was in no better position than Winson itself to know whether the Ocean Voyager had been loaded as described in the copy BL. Hin Leong was the original supplier, Hin Leong chose the vessels to use, and Hin Leong provided the copy BLs; moreover, I have found that Winson knew from the start that the Subject Transactions pre-structured as a circular trade, in particular that it was for Hin Leong (as the original supplier and ultimate buyer) to decide which vessels to use for the sale of specific cargoes (rather than fungible quantities of gasoil).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Next, the checks which Ms Tung says Mr Dong did on the draft of the vessels, on 16 April 2020, were not mentioned by Mr Dong in his AEIC or oral testimony, and Ms Tung had no personal knowledge of what checks Mr Dong did or did not do.

Yet, instead of looking further into this discrepancy, Winson chose to press OCBC for payment (the due date for which was 18 May 2020). Mr Dong sought on the stand to explain away his contemporaneous reference to Tanjung Pelepas by saying the checks showed the vessel in the area “around Singapore/Malaysia” and “Around the region of Singapore, Tanjung Pelepas”.

</div> This is obviously rationalisation after the fact, but the point remains that Mr Dong had contemporaneously reported to Ms Tung his conclusion as being that the Ocean Taipan had loaded at Tanjung Pelepas, which contradicted the details in the copy BL, but Winson evidently did not care about that discrepancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Besides these four checks which Winson did (or claims to have done), certain other aspects of Winson’s conduct at the time are noteworthy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 First, Winson never checked with OTPL, which had purportedly issued the copy BLs that Winson had relied upon for its LOIs, and for its supposed belief that cargo had been shipped as described in the copy BLs. Given OCBC’s rejection of the first presentation on the basis that there was “no cargo shipped”, Winson could have sought confirmation from OTPL, but Winson never did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Second, Mr Cai says in his AEIC at para 57 that after hearing that OCBC had rejected the first presentation, he spoke with Mr OK Lim to ask if Hin Leong would directly pay Winson for the Winson – Hin Leong sale; unsurprisingly, Mr OK Lim declined to do so. By then, Hin Leong’s financial difficulties were known in the market, and to Winson. Moreover, the Subject Transactions were pre-structured, such that Hin Leong made a loss but obtained financing. In those circumstances one would not expect Hin Leong to agree to pay Winson directly. What is even more odd, is that although OCBC’s rejection of Winson’s first presentation was the reason for Mr Cai speaking with Mr OK Lim, Mr Cai did not ask Mr OK Lim whether cargo had been shipped as stated in the copy BLs, although Hin Leong was the original supplier and had provided those copy BLs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Instead of asking OTPL, or Hin Leong, Mr Cai asked Mr Dong for loading documents, but Mr Dong had none; Mr Cai then asked Mr Dong to get them from Trafigura.

</div> He said, “Aside from BLs, kindly also send us the ship documents (such as surveyor CQ, COQ, SOF, ullage report)”. Trafigura belatedly replied on 11 May 2020 to say, “We have requested the same from supplier, and shall revert once received.” This response would not have surprised Winson: the original supplier was Hin Leong, not Trafigura, and it was Hin Leong that Winson had initially (on 6 April 2020) requested loading documents from.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I do not view this correspondence as a genuine attempt to get loading documents. There was no urgency in Winson’s request – 16 April 2020 was the first occasion when Winson requested these documents from Trafigura. Winson had requested loading documents from Hin Leong earlier – on 6 April 2020 – but did not follow up when none was provided. Winson knew that Trafigura was in no better position that it was, in relation to loading documents – those would come from Hin Leong, if at all, who had not provided them to Winson despite Winson’s request. Compounding this is the fact that Winson had not received any loading documents in the seven previous circular trades between it and Hin Leong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 In this regard, there is also a curious internal email of Mr Dong’s dated 6 April 2020, which was then forwarded to Ms Tung on 15 April 2020.

</div> In that email, Mr Dong said to his colleagues: “Pls find the loading docs of MT OCEAN VOYAGE [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] &amp; OCEAN TAIPAN”. But he had no loading documents – he simply sent his colleagues the shipment details and copy BLs he had received from Hin Leong on 6 April 2020.

I reach this conclusion given the unreasonableness of the belief Winson claims to have held, in the circumstances at the time, and the unreasonableness of Winson’s conduct in responding (or not responding) to those circumstances.

</div> That correspondence was in even stronger terms. Winson asserted that the LOI contained various misrepresentations. Winson referred to the IJMs’ letter of 8 May 2020 and said that by then – when Trafigura received the IJM letter – Trafigura knew of certain facts which were contrary to representations in the LOI, yet Trafigura proceeded to present the LOI on 22 May 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 On 23 July 2020, Trafigura wrote to Winson,

</div> Winson backed down from the position it had taken earlier. Winson did not maintain that Trafigura had not passed good title to it; instead Winson said, “As pointed out by the IJMs of HL and [OTPL], it is now not entirely clear which parties are entitled to the Cargoes. Accordingly, we are not in a position to opine whether you have passed good title of the Cargoes to us.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Winson was in an uncomfortable position: OCBC and SCB were not paying it, while Trafigura had presented LOIs for payment on the LCs that Winson had procured. Winson took the position that Trafigura had fraudulently made false representations – at least in respect of Trafigura’s LOI for the Ocean Voyager – but Winson did not seek to stop Trafigura from receiving payment. In the present proceedings Winson then contended that the equivalent representations in its own LOIs were not false, and in any event were not made fraudulently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I have found that Winson did make false representations in its LOIs. By May 2020, Winson evidently believed that false representations had been made, as is evident from its correspondence with Natixis and Mashreqbank. Of course, it does not follow that because Winson was alleging in May 2020 (with the benefit of letters from the IJMs of Hin Leong) that Trafigura was fraudulent, that Winson was also fraudulent in April 2020 when it made its second presentations – I accept that Winson did not then have all the facts revealed in the IJMs’ letters in May 2020. However, based on what Winson did know at the time of its second presentations, what checks Winson did, and what checks Winson did not do, my conclusion remains that Winson was fraudulent, at least in the sense that it did not believe in the truth of the representations in its LOIs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Accordingly, I conclude that the banks have established the Fraud Exception in relation to Winson’s second presentations (which are the operative ones). It follows that Winson’s claim for payment on the LCs fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Nullity Exception</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 As I find the Fraud Exception to have been established, it is unnecessary for me to make a finding on whether the banks can rely on the Nullity Exception to resist payment, and I leave that point open.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I simply observe that the banks’ contentions in relation to the Nullity Exception appear to extend the exception beyond its scope as recognised in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Beam Technology (</span><span class="font-italic">Mfg) Pte ltd v Standard Chartered Bank </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Beam</span>”) [2003] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [36], that the “negotiating/confirming bank is not obliged to pay if it has established within the seven-day period that a material document required under the credit is forged and null and void and notice of it is given within that period.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 <span class="font-italic">Beam</span> involved an air waybill that was a forgery, purportedly issued by a company that did not exist. In the present case, Winson’s invoices and LOIs were themselves not forgeries, but the banks contend that the Nullity Exception extends to documents, not themselves forged, which are based on forged documents like the BLs in the present case (or incorrect information such as details of cargo that had not been shipped as described). It should be considered in a future case whether the Nullity Exception goes that far.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Further, the formulation of the Nullity Exception in <span class="font-italic">Beam</span> has the bank establishing forgery before the deadline for raising objections to compliance under the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (“UCP”), and giving notice accordingly. In the present case, neither bank gave notice under the UCP 600 (the version of the UCP used in the present LCs), but the banks contend that the Nullity Exception may be raised even after the UCP 600 deadline for giving notice. Again, it should be considered whether the Nullity Exception goes that far.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Non-compliance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I agree with Winson that SCB cannot rely on any alleged non-compliance of the operative presentation, to resist payment. SCB’s LC was subject to the UCP 600, which stipulates that the bank has a maximum of five banking days to determine if a presentation is complying, and if it refuses to honour the presentations, in that time it must give a rejection notice, stating the discrepancy in respect of which the bank is refusing payment.

I leave those points open.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 I simply observe that, as contended for by SCB, unconscionability would extend to a case where the demand was not unconscionable when it was made, but (so SCB contends) it would be unconscionable to now allow the beneficiary to be paid, because of issues with the underlying transaction – here, the fact that there were no valid BLs, and no goods shipped as described in the LOIs. It should be considered whether recognising such an unconscionability defence would undermine the principle of autonomy in relation to LCs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Winson’s claim fails because it suffered no loss.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 SCB contends that, in any event, Winson’s claim against it cannot succeed because of a deed of assignment between Winson and Winson Oil Bunkering pursuant to which Winson received from Winson Oil Bunkering the full sum that it is claiming from the banks in this suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I agree with Winson that this contention of SCB’s fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Damage is not an element of Winson’s cause of action, which is to enforce <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> payment obligations under LCs. Moreover, Winson’s claim is for sums due under LCs, not for damages it has suffered from not being paid. Winson is not seeking any consequential loss, but only the amounts of the LCs and interest thereon. The issue of the loss and damage Winson suffered from not being paid, does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Further, Winson did not assign Winson Oil Bunkering the right to sue the banks; indeed, the deed obliges Winson to sue the banks to recover payment under the LCs. In the event that payment is not recovered from the banks, Winson Oil Bunkering may elect to terminate the deed and recover the full sum that it had paid to Winson. Winson has not impaired its rights against the banks by entering into the deed of assignment and obtaining payment from Winson Oil Bunkering on the terms of the deed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 For the above reasons, I dismiss Winson’s claim against the banks because the Fraud Exception is established.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The banks are entitled to their costs, to be assessed if not fixed or agreed.
