We indicated at [312] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> that nine adjustments needed to be made to the interim valuation of DyStar that we determined. In this Judgment, we address the nine adjustments. Where appropriate, we adopt the abbreviations and terms defined in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, as well as in our judgment in <span class="font-italic">DyStar</span><span class="font-italic"> Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others and another suit</span> [2018] 5 SLR 1 (the “<span class="font-italic">Main Judgment</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The facts have been set out extensively in the <span class="font-italic">Main Judgment</span> delivered on 3 July 2018. We held that Senda International Capital Ltd (“Senda”) had engaged in instances of oppressive conduct against Kiri Industries Ltd (“Kiri”). Senda was ordered to purchase Kiri’s shares in DyStar. The valuation date was to be the date of judgment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 3 July 2018. The valuation date was not challenged on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 We provided an interim valuation of DyStar in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>. We found DyStar’s equity value as at the valuation date to be US$1,636m, subject to the nine adjustments (the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment </span>at [312]). The parties’ experts were directed to submit (a) a joint revised valuation of DyStar based on their assessment of the impact of the nine adjustments on our interim valuation of DyStar, and (b) a joint report setting out their points of agreement and disagreement with reasons for any disagreement if they were unable to reach consensus. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The parties’ experts were unable to agree on every point. On 25 January 2021, they submitted a joint expert report (“the Report”) addressing the nine adjustments. This was accompanied by a letter from Kiri seeking clarification on (a) pre-judgment interest and (b) the relief to which it would be entitled if Senda failed to comply with the buy-out order in the <span class="font-italic">Main Judgment</span>. We addressed the latter two issues in an oral judgment on 17 March 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 This Judgment addresses the effect of the nine adjustments on our interim valuation of DyStar.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Outstanding adjustments to be made to DyStar’s valuation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> identified the nine adjustments at [312]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The notional licence fees for Longsheng’s use of the Patent and third-party licence fees collected by Longsheng ought to be incorporated into DyStar’s valuation, subject to the following amendments.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Mr Chan’s proposed US$473,744 notional licence fee must be amended to reflect a starting point of 2010 instead of 2013. The applicable tax rate should not be DyStar Germany’s, but that of DyStar’s instead.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) On the $13.5m of licence fees collected by Longsheng, the 5.33% interest added by Ms Harfouche must be revised. It should not be the interest rate prescribed for judgment sums, but ought instead to correspond to the interest that DyStar would have earned on the licence fees in the relevant years if it had duly received the same from Longsheng. The tax rate for the fees should be adjusted to correspond with DyStar’s historical tax rates.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The downstream financial impact on DyStar due to the Patent expiration must be deducted from Ms Harfouche’s computation of DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA. The Patent expiration would have an impact of US$6.5m as suggested by Mr Lie.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The downstream financial impact on DyStar due to the expiration of the Indigo 40% patents must be deducted from DyStar’s EBITDA. This risk event would have an impact of US$17.2m as suggested by Mr Lie.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) A DLOM of 19% is to be applied to Kiri’s 37.57% share in DyStar.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) A country risk premium of 1.6% is to be accounted for in DyStar’s cost of equity. That will increase DyStar’s WACC and result in a larger discount rate in the DCF approach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) The applicable tax rate for DyStar’s revenue ought to be 26.7% instead of 23%.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) The tax rate for the 2015 and 2016 Longsheng Fees ought to be adjusted to match DyStar’s historical tax rates. We note that the Longsheng Fees for 2017 and 2018 have not been (and should not be) accounted for in Ms Harfouche’s valuation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(h) While the special incentive payment has been accounted for in Ms Harfouche’s valuation, adjustments to the applicable tax rate must be made. The applicable rate ought to be DyStar’s historical tax rate in 2014 when the special incentive payment was made.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) The US$4m insurance pay-out must be incorporated into DyStar’s valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We will refer to the nine adjustments as Issues 1 to 9 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Issues 4 and 8 (on DLOM and the special incentive payment, respectively) are not in dispute.

The experts explained the difference between the two expressions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Adjustments to DyStar’s EV are made <span class="font-italic">first</span>. These are the adjustments to the DCF method used in Ms Harfouche’s valuation approach, and impact on matters such as DyStar’s cost of capital and maintainable EBITDA. These matters pertain to Issues 2 and 3 (the expiration of the Patent (Issue 2) and the Indigo 40% patents (Issue 3) which affects DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA), Issue 5 (the country risk premium which affects DyStar’s cost of capital) and Issue 6 (the effective tax rate for DyStar). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Making these adjustments results in DyStar’s adjusted EV. The remaining adjustments, which relate to Issues 1, 7 and 9 and concern one-off events, are made to DyStar’s adjusted EV. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 A final inconsequential divergence between the experts is not fully captured in the table. The experts disagree over whether the 19% DLOM (see [246] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>) is to be applied to the value of the equity/shareholding in DyStar <span class="font-italic">before</span> or <span class="font-italic">after</span> deriving the value of Kiri’s 37.57% shareholding. Senda favours the former and Kiri the latter. Despite the disagreement, both experts arrive at broadly the same outcome. Conceptually, we prefer Kiri’s approach (as reflected in the table above) of applying the 19% DLOM to <span class="font-italic">Kiri’s minority share</span> in DyStar. This is because, as held in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, the DLOM is a discount reflecting the lack of marketability of <span class="font-italic">Kiri’s minority share</span>. Having said that, we note that the outcome is not any different mathematically, even if Senda’s approach is adopted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The following matters arise in relation to the seven issues on which there is no consensus between the experts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) DyStar’s applicable historical tax rates. This concerns Issue 1 – on the notional licence fee and third-party licence fees collected by Longsheng – and Issue 7 – on the Longsheng Fees for 2015 and 2016. We directed these adjustments to be made at [193], [205], [276], [312(a)] and [312(g)] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The impact, if any, of the expiration of DyStar’s various patents. This concerns Issue 2 – on the Patent (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Orange 288 patent) – and Issue 3 – on the Indigo 40% patents. We directed that the expiration of these patents be taken into account in DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA, at [212], [223], [312(b)] and [312(c)] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The impact, if any, of certain variables on the DCF method used by Ms Harfouche in her valuation. This concerns Issue 5 – on the country risk premium – and Issue 6 – on the effective tax rate to be applied to DyStar. We directed that these factors be considered by the experts at [250], [268], [312(e)] and [312(f)] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The insurance pay-out DyStar received in May and June 2019. This concerns Issue 9. We directed that this adjustment be made at [305] and [312(i)] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In general, Ms Harfouche’s position in the Report on the seven disputed issues is well-reasoned and explained with reference to <span class="font-italic">her valuation model</span> and the relevant accounting principles. In assessing the views in the Report, it should be borne in mind that, in arriving at our interim valuation, we had accepted Ms Harfouche’s valuation model and methodology (see the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> at [45]–[156]). Accordingly, any impact of the nine adjustments must be assessed in the context of that model and methodology. Not to do so would be to (a) re-open the debate on the appropriate valuation methodology<span class="font-italic"> </span>and (b)<span class="font-italic"> </span>ignore the basis upon which our interim valuation was reached. Mr Lie and Mr Chan adopted an approach that departed in several instances from Ms Harfouche’s valuation model and methodology. We discuss this in detail at [61] and [62] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 For this reason, it would be apt for us to recapitulate at this juncture Ms Harfouche’s valuation approach. In the valuation proceedings, Ms Harfouche adopted an approach synthesising the market and DCF approaches. Both methods were based on a cluster of companies with similar characteristics to DyStar (in terms of the industry in which they operated, EV, EBITDA, and the geographical reach of their businesses). We had accepted Ms Harfouche’s selection of the comparable companies at [55]–[60] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>. As noted in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> at [42]–[44],<span class="font-italic"> </span>Ms Harfouche took this approach because of significant shortcomings in DyStar’s disclosure of financial information. The experts were consequently unable to verify DyStar’s actual financial performance and their ability to project its financial performance into the future using a pure DCF method was therefore constrained. Using a pure DCF method was not suitable for this reason. Ms Harfouche therefore devised a valuation model under which she charted a range of DyStar EV values derived from both the market approach and DCF method, employing a graphical representation which was referred to in the valuation proceedings as the “football field”. Using the football field, she arrived at an estimated valuation. Ms Harfouche’s updated football field (following the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>) is reflected at page 22 of the Report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In addition, to support her positions in the Report, Ms Harfouche referred to underlying documents. In contrast, on several issues, Mr Lie and Mr Chan failed to refer to any underlying documents.

The exception is for 2019 on which there is insufficient information to derive a figure (see [26] below). Thus, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, the rates in Table A ought to apply to all tax issues.

Effective tax rates are derived after taking into account <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the profits and losses of the companies in the <span class="font-italic">DyStar</span><span class="font-italic"> group</span> and the corresponding tax deductions/savings that would be made as a result. In contrast, the simple tax rate is the rate stipulated in tax regulations, which does not take into account the tax savings or liabilities of individual companies in the DyStar group in a given year of assessment as a result of their financial performance. DyStar’s group rates (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the historical <span class="font-italic">effective</span> group tax rates of the DyStar group) is the appropriate metric to apply, as it accounts for the savings (or increased tax) of the DyStar group by reason of the profit/loss of individual companies in the group in a given year. That DyStar’s group rates are sensitive to this is seen from the fluctuation of the tax rates in Table A over the years.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Group</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, not individual entity, tax rates: </span>Third, the experts agree, for the most part, that the applicable tax rate ought to be DyStar’s group rate and not the tax rate for individual companies in the group.

On the other hand, Mr Chan arrives at US$1.2m. The difference of US$0.1m arises from the experts’ disagreement on how DyStar’s group rates ought to be determined.

His position is confusing. Specifically, Senda’s portion of the Report states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.8 Ms Harfouche attempts to justify her position with lengthy explanations about what “<span class="font-italic">effective</span>” tax rate means and presents various tax theories and approaches.

On closer examination, it becomes clear that Mr Chan has in fact applied DyStar’s group rates as tabulated in Table A, save for 2010 and 2012 (see below at [23]). Senda’s reference to the “historical tax rate as set out in paragraph 1.3 above” (italicised in the extract above) is a reference to a table in the Report that mirrors Table A save for 2010, 2012 and 2019. It is unclear, therefore, whether Mr Chan takes issue with an application of DyStar’s group rates as opposed to the simple tax rate (the simple tax rate being the alternative to the <span class="font-italic">effective</span> tax rate that Mr Chan appears to reject). In any case, as explained at [17(b)] and [20] above, DyStar’s group rates ought to apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On specific tax rates to be applied for certain years between 2010 and 2018, Ms Harfouche has, with the exception of 2010, 2012 and 2018, applied DyStar’s group rates in Table A for every year. The application of Table A is correct for the reasons explained at [17] and [18] above. As for Ms Harfouche’s approach to 2010, 2012 and 2018, we elaborate on this at [24] and [25] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Chan disagrees with Ms Harfouche on the applicable tax rates for 2010, 2012 and 2018. He suggests (a) accepting DyStar’s group rate in 2018 (which was a high rate of 45.5%) as reproduced in Table A and (b) departing from Table A as regards DyStar’s group rates in 2010 and 2012, which were <span class="font-italic">negative</span> for those years (-2.3% and -8.8% respectively), and instead applying a 10% withholding tax rate. This appears to be selective application of Table A, which we do not accept for the reasons stated at [18] above. Mr Chan’s choice of the high DyStar group rate for 2018 (45.5%) is also significant for another reason. He uses that rate as the applicable tax rate for 2019 without explaining why. He has not considered the reasons why the rate was high in 2018: see [26] and [27] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On the applicable tax rates for 2010 and 2012, we prefer Ms Harfouche’s position. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ms Harfouche has proposed applying a 0% tax rate instead of the negative rates for 2010 and 2012 as captured in Table A. She uses 0% “as applying a negative effective tax rate would increase the notional licence fees after tax”. Ms Harfouche’s approach actually favours Senda as applying the negative rates for the relevant years would “increase” the notional licence fees and therefore increase the valuation of DyStar. Having said that, we question the validity of the reason articulated by Ms Harfouche in light of our observations at [16]–[18] above; specifically, the “increase” in notional licence fees would be savings in fact enjoyed by DyStar in 2010 and 2012 in light of DyStar’s group rates for the relevant years. Any “increase” in the notional licence fees that is incorporated into DyStar’s value is a substantiated increase. Nevertheless, as noted above, Ms Harfouche’s position is to Kiri’s disadvantage and Kiri nonetheless accepts it. There may also be assumptions and concerns embedded in Ms Harfouche’s position that have not been fully expressed in the Report. With these considerations, we accept her position on the 0% tax rate for 2010 and 2012. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On the other hand, Mr Chan applies a 10% tax rate for 2010 and 2012. This rate, according to Mr Chan, is the Chinese withholding tax rate in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) for those years. However, there is no evidence, apart from Mr Chan’s bare assertion, that this rate was in fact the applicable Chinese withholding tax rate. There is also no evidence supporting Mr Chan’s assertion in the Report that “the Chinese withholding tax would have been naturally accounted for through the avoidance of double taxation agreement mechanism as DyStar’s historical rates … were all higher than 10%”. Also, it is unclear whether Mr Chan is qualified to express an opinion on tax laws in the PRC. In such circumstances, and as stated at [14] above, we are unable to accept Mr Chan’s position. For the reasons stated above, we accept Ms Harfouche’s position on the 0% tax rate for 2010 and 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 There is an aspect of Ms Harfouche’s position that we do not accept. On the basis of Ms Harfouche’s opinion, Kiri submits that the 45.5% tax rate in 2018 was an “anomaly” occasioned by <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the one-off Nanjing incident. For this reason, Kiri further submits that the average rate of 26.7% over the years should be applied. In the course of oral submissions, we highlighted to Kiri that the logic of “one-off events” could be applied to <span class="font-italic">all</span> the years in Table A leading to the use of the average rate for all years. Counsel for Kiri fairly accepted the point. The possibility of one-off events could in part explain the fluctuation in DyStar’s group rates as reflected in Table A. Kiri cannot contend on the one hand that the high DyStar’s group rate in 2018 ought not to be accepted and on the other argue for acceptance of the lower rates in the other years. Kiri cannot have it both ways. We therefore decline to accept Ms Harfouche’s view on DyStar’s group rate for 2018. <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">er</span> Table A, DyStar’s group rate for that year should be 45.5%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The experts were not able to arrive at an <span class="font-italic">actual </span>figure for DyStar’s group rate for 2019 due to a lack of evidence on DyStar’s financial performance for that year. The available option is therefore to use a suitable proxy. Mr Chan proposes that DyStar’s group rate for 2018 of 45.5% be used. We have questioned whether this is correct at [23] above. Ms Harfouche proposes instead that an average of DyStar’s group rates of 26.7% (see [266]–[268] of the Valuation Judgment) be used as a proxy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 We agree with Ms Harfouche. Senda does not dispute that DyStar’s group rate in 2018 (45.5%) is an anomaly when juxtaposed against DyStar’s group rates for preceding years. The explanation offered by Kiri, which Senda does not challenge, is that it arose as a result of the financial impact of a one-off event, namely, the explosion at the Nanjing plant. The evidence on the Nanjing plant explosion was extensively canvassed during the valuation proceedings. On this basis, we find it arbitrary to apply DyStar’s group rate for 2018 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 45.5%) to 2019. Senda has not pointed to any one-off events that would have had a similar pronounced impact on DyStar’s group rate for 2019. Accordingly, the fair and reasonable course would be to apply the average of DyStar’s group rates, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 26.7%. We should add that the observations above at [25] with regard to the use of DyStar’s group rate for 2018 do <span class="font-italic">not</span> apply as regards 2019. The 2018 rate is an <span class="font-italic">actual</span> rate and the issue was whether it ought to be discounted because of a one-off event. On the other hand, there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> actual rate for 2019. Using a rate that has its roots in a one-off event as a proxy for the rate in a subsequent year is therefore inappropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In view of our conclusions above, the applicable tax rates are as set out in the table (“Table B”) below:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Year</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Effective tax rate</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2010</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">0%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2011</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">35.6%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2012</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">0%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2013</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">20.3%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">18.4%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2015</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">20.0%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2016</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">25.1%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2017</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">26.7%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2018</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">45.5%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2019</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">26.7%</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Third-party licence fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Ms Harfouche’s opinion is that the third-party licence fees ought to be US$12.6m, while Mr Chan’s is US$12.4m. The US$0.2m divergence is again a result of a dispute over the applicable tax rates from and including 2013, and principally over the tax rate to be used for 2018. We repeat our reasons and conclusion above at [17]–[28]. We prefer Ms Harfouche’s position, save for DyStar’s group rate for 2018. DyStar’s group rate for 2018 ought to be 45.5% as set out in Table B.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Audit fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 A further issue was highlighted in the Report and arose in the course of oral submissions: whether the audit fees of US$0.7m incurred by Longsheng ought to be taken into account in DyStar’s final valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In oral submissions, counsel for Senda pointed out that the audit fees were for services “to compute the number of products that are being produced and then you multiply that by applicable licence fee and then Longsheng charges that licence fee … it has absolutely nothing to do with litigation or the defence of the patent proceedings”. Senda’s submission is that as the court has directed “the licence fees which Longsheng has received from third parties are to be repaid or incorporated into the value of DyStar”, Senda ought to be given “credit for any expenses they have paid which are related to the collection of these licence fees”. Such expenses would include the audit fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Senda’s submission must be seen in the context of our finding in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> that in quantifying the licence fees payable by Longsheng to DyStar, “DyStar should not have to bear the costs of defending the Patent” (at [195]–[197]). Senda’s submission that the audit fees ought to be taken into account in the valuation is in effect an attempt to distinguish the fees from the costs of defending the Patent (which we have disallowed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 We do not accept Senda’s submission that the audit fees ought to be taken into account. The point is <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In arriving at the quantum of licence fees payable by Longsheng to DyStar, we considered <span class="font-italic">but declined to include</span> any line items apart from those specified in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> (see [190]–[205]). We considered the issue of audit costs, which were a line item in Senda’s closing submissions in the valuation proceedings, and declined to direct that it be taken into account in DyStar’s valuation. All sums relating to the licence fees earned by Longsheng that were to be incorporated into (or deducted from) DyStar’s final valuation were identified in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The findings on the licence fees in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> were on two premises, that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the licence fees were to be incorporated into DyStar’s valuation to remedy the effects of Longsheng’s oppressive conduct in <span class="font-italic">impermissibl</span><span class="font-italic">y and wrongfully</span> exploiting the Patent; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the valuation that is arrived at ought to be <span class="font-italic">fair, </span><span class="font-italic">just and equitable</span> and not constrained by adherence to accounting strictures that would lead to unfairness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We therefore concluded that the licence fees, <span class="font-italic">as quantified in the Valuation Judgment</span>, had to be incorporated into DyStar’s final valuation.

Accordingly, there is little basis for the audit fees to be included in the computation of the licence fees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Further, as a matter of fairness, Senda ought not to be allowed to claim, on Longsheng’s behalf, the reimbursement of expenses incurred in the course of Longsheng’s <span class="font-italic">wrongful exploitation of </span><span class="font-italic">DyStar’s intellectual property</span>. DyStar was not privy to Longsheng’s sub-licensing of the Patent or to any of the costs and benefits associated with the same. Nor did DyStar have a say in those dealings.

DyStar’s group rates ought to apply to <span class="font-italic">all</span> tax issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Ms Harfouche’s position is that DyStar’s tax rate (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Singapore tax rate for the 2nd defendant in SIC/S 4/2017), and not DyStar’s <span class="font-italic">group</span> rates, ought to apply.

However, she concedes that the Longsheng Fees, when incorporated into DyStar’s valuation, would be charged to “the Profit &amp; Loss Account of the DyStar <span class="font-italic">Group</span>” [emphasis added]. This suggests that DyStar’s group rates are germane. It is also significant that Ms Harfouche goes to some length to consider the alternative scenario where “the Court decides that the historical effective tax rates of the … Group should apply”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 More importantly, Ms Harfouche’s position is inconsistent with our conclusion in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> that the applicable tax rate ought to be that of the <span class="font-italic">group</span>, not the <span class="font-italic">individual entities</span>. This was accepted by the experts in the Report (see [17(c)] above).

The evidence actually suggests the contrary. In fact, Eric’s evidence was that the impact would be finite:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The evidence on the Indigo 40% patents was discussed in [215] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>. Eric forecasted a 15% drop, spread across five years, as a result of the expiry of the Indigo 40% patents. He did not suggest that the effects would extend into perpetuity. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As is clear from the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, we accepted Eric’s evidence, having assessed his forecast as reasonable.

In his AEIC in the valuation proceedings, Eric provided the following table which essentially mirrored the table setting out his position on the impact of the expiry of the Indigo 40% patents. (The latter table was reproduced at [215] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>.) It shows the projected impact of the expiry of the Patent as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">2019</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">2020</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">2021</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">2022</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">2023</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sales value<br/>(US$ ’m)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">16.9</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">13.6</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">13.0</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">11.6</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">9.9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">ASP <br/>(US$ / kg)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">5.5</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">4.8</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">4.6</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">4.2</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">3.7</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The points at [46(a)] and [46(b)] above apply <span class="font-italic">mutatis mutandis</span>.

Given the importance of the Indigo 40% patents and the Patent to the DyStar group, it stands to reason that solutions would have been worked out in due course. Indeed, Eric’s evidence was that the DyStar group would continue to maintain research and development efforts to ensure that it retained a competitive edge despite the expiry of existing patents (which would obviously include the Indigo 40% patents and the Patent). Mr Lie suggests that any new products or intellectual property developed by DyStar pursuant to such solutions would be “distinct” and “already captured” in DyStar’s revenue growth rates, and would not <span class="font-italic">replace</span> the expired patents. We do not find this persuasive. As there is no clear evidence either way, the conclusion to be preferred is the one that comports with common and commercial sense. Expiry of the various patents would surely have spurred DyStar in its research and development efforts <span class="font-italic">to ensure that it</span> <span class="font-italic">retained a competitive edge</span>. This would be done so that efforts in mitigation would be truly be a replacement for any loss suffered as a result of the expiry of the Patent and the Indigo 40% patents. It would not be logical to suggest that DyStar’s research and development efforts would not be targeted at replacements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We acknowledge Senda’s point that there is no evidence, as the court found in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, of the <span class="font-italic">contingency measures</span> that DyStar was prepared to take to ameliorate the impact of the expiration of the Patent and Indigo 40% patents. But Senda’s argument takes the point too far. Our finding on the absence of evidence on contingency measures simply means that the expiration of the relevant patents <span class="font-italic">would have </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">an impact</span><span class="font-italic"> on </span><span class="font-italic">DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA, which must be factored into DyStar’s valuation</span>. That is precisely what the experts were tasked to evaluate. Our conclusion on the absence of contingency measures <span class="font-italic">does not mean</span> that the impact of the expiration of the Patent and the Indigo 40% patents <span class="font-italic">would </span><span class="font-italic">extend into perpetuity</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Accordingly, we are of the view that the expiry of the Patent and the Indigo 40% patents would have finite impacts on DyStar’s final valuation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">How the finite impact is to be quantified and incorporated into DyStar’s valuation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having determined that the impact of the expiry of the patents ought to be finite, the question that arises is how that is to be incorporated into DyStar’s valuation. In this respect, it is worth restating Ms Harfouche’s and Mr Lie’s respective methodologies: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ms Harfouche’s position is that only the DCF method allows a finite impact of the expiry of the various patents to be modelled. Using the DCF method, she arrives at a US$72.5m impact. Ms Harfouche arrives at this figure by reflecting the impact of the expiry of the patents in DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA until 2023 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a five-year impact from the date of expiry of the Patent and the Indigo 40% patents) before linearly increasing her adjusted EBITDA forecasts from 2024 onwards to return to a terminal EBITDA margin of 14.8%. Arriving at the figure of US$72.5m as a result, she then <span class="font-italic">deducts</span> the US$72.5m figure from her multiples valuation. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Lie is of the view that the impact ought to be perpetual. We disagree for reasons stated in the previous section. On this basis, he quantifies the impact of the expiries of the patents using Ms Harfouche’s comparable companies approach, resulting in a US$228.8m impact. He arrives at this number by making deductions to DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA-CapEx margin, which are components of Ms Harfouche’s calculations for DyStar’s EV. As explained at [46]–[76] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, Ms Harfouche derived DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA-CapEx margin using the revenue and EBITDA figures of a cluster of comparable companies as points of reference, due to the inadequacy of DyStar’s disclosure of documents that evidence its actual financial performance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Senda and Mr Lie do not appear to dispute Ms Harfouche’s view that the DCF method is the <span class="font-italic">only way</span> to model a finite impact. Apart from contending that the impact ought to be perpetual and not finite, they criticise Ms Harfouche’s methodology as being “inherently incongruent”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Ms Harfouche had allegedly force-fed the DCF method into her market approach valuation. We have addressed the point of finite and perpetual in the previous section. The second point warrants some elaboration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Senda has not clearly explained the basis of its criticism that Ms Harfouche has, as part of her “compromise” solution, “force-[fed]” the DCF method figure into her market approach valuation. In our view, this may be understood as a criticism against Ms Harfouche for <span class="font-italic">not</span> applying the market approach in computing the impact of the expiry of the various patents. This may be inferred from Mr Lie’s views at para 4.21 of the Report:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.21 Mr Lie notes that Ms Harfouche’s application of her proposed impact from the expiry of the Patents of US$72.5 million calculated using the DCF method to her valuations derived using other valuation approaches is inherently incongruent. She can and should have carried out the Court directed adjustments using a particular chosen method, instead of selectively deriving certain inputs using one approach, and force-feeding that input into her computation in another approach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In computing the overall impact of the Court-directed adjustments, Ms Harfouche adopts the Market Approach. However, when computing the impact of the expiries of the Patent, she arbitrarily relies on and adopts the value of US$72.5 m which she computed using the DCF approach. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The above must be understood in light of the fact that Ms Harfouche did apply her market approach (specifically, using comparable companies as explained at [13] above) in determining the impact of <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the country risk premium on DyStar’s valuation: see [58] below onwards. The question that consequently arises is this: is it acceptable for Ms Harfouche to use the comparable companies approach in determining the impact of <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the country risk premium on DyStar’s valuation, but to use a different approach – the DCF method – in computing the impact of the expiry of the various patents?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In our view, Ms Harfouche’s methodology should be accepted. While we note her acknowledgement that her approach is a “compromise” solution”, in this instance, it is explicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Ms Harfouche accepts that the expiry of the patents would have <span class="font-italic">an effect</span> on the market approach EVs derived using her valuation model. It is not her position that the expiry of the patents would have no impact. She simply disagrees that Mr Lie’s method would achieve an accurate figure as it assumes that the expiry of the various patents has a perpetual impact. Thus, it was necessary to arrive at a figure that was based on a finite impact. This was only possible with the DCF method and not the market approach (this was common ground between the experts). Using the DCF method, the figure of US$72.5m was arrived at which has to then be incorporated into the market approach. This was done by way of deduction. This overall approach was the “compromise” that Ms Harfouche has acknowledged. In short, given that only the DCF method is able to estimate the finite impact of the expiration of the patents, Ms Harfouche had to find an acceptable way – the “compromise” – of incorporating that assessment into her market approach valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As noted earlier, Mr Lie’s approach is inapplicable as it proceeds on the basis that the impact of the expiration of patents is perpetual. Mr Lie has not provided an alternative figure on the basis of a finite impact: see <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> paras 5.28–5.38 of the Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 We accept that Ms Harfouche did adopt a differing method when computing the impact of the country risk premium and the 26.7% tax rate (see [58] below onwards). But this can be explained. Aside from the point raised above that only the DCF method is able to estimate the finite impact of the expiration of the patents, there is a further difficulty with incorporating the impact by making deductions to DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA-CapEx margin, as Mr Lie has done.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It must be borne in mind that DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA-CapEx margin were derived with reference to the cluster of comparable companies selected by Ms Harfouche. In other words, the revenue and EBITDA figures of the comparable companies were used as proxies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As noted by Ms Harfouche, it is not necessary to adjust DyStar’s EVs for country risk premium (under Issue 5, which we elaborate on at [59] below) based on the market approach because it has <span class="font-italic">already</span><span class="font-italic"> been factored into the market approach</span>. Specifically, the comparable companies used by Ms Harfouche to derive the EVs “are subject to country risk to at least the same extent as DyStar, and so no further adjustment for country risk should be made to the multiples derived from their share prices”. In other words, the country risk premium is already factored in as the comparable companies that have been chosen have the same country risk factor as DyStar by reason of their similarities. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The same cannot be said as regards expiration of the patents. The patents and their importance are factors that are unique to DyStar. Consequently, the impact of the expiration of the patents can only be assessed with reference to DyStar. Using a cluster of comparable companies is not a suitable proxy in this regard. It is therefore necessary to assess the impact (which can only be done using the DCF method) and thereafter work that into the market approach. It is for this reason that Ms Harfouche makes a<span class="font-italic"> US$72.5m deduction</span> to DyStar’s EV, having arrived at the US$72.5m figure with reference to DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA figures. These figures in turn adjust DyStar’s terminal EBITDA margin. As explained at [62]–[65] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, DyStar’s maintainable EBITDA figures and terminal EBITDA margin were derived <span class="font-italic">after</span> Ms Harfouche forecasted DyStar’s revenue and EBITDA using the comparable companies. The maintainable EBITDA and terminal EBITDA margin were then used to compute a stable terminal growth rate unique to DyStar, extrapolated until 2027: the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> at [64].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the circumstances, Ms Harfouche’s US$72.5m figure is the best available information upon which the court is able to act. It is the best available means of striking a fair figure that reflects our view that the expiry of the Patent and the Indigo 40% patents has a finite impact on DyStar’s valuation. We therefore accept Ms Harfouche’s position on Issues 2 and 3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues 5 and 6: Country risk premium and effective tax rate of 26.7%</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Ms Harfouche has put the question before the court succinctly: are the experts to (a) update Ms Harfouche’s model in accordance with the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> or (b) prepare new DCF method calculations? The answer must be (a), for the reasons stated at [12] above. Mr Lie’s calculations on Issues 5 and 6 in the Report involve fresh DCF calculations that do not accord with our acceptance of Ms Harfouche’s valuation method (as recapitulated at [13] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As stated in the Report, Ms Harfouche has worked into <span class="font-italic">her </span><span class="font-italic">valuation model</span> the <span class="font-underline">country risk premium</span> of 1.6% that was directed in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation </span><span class="font-italic">Judgment</span>. However, this was done only to understand whether there was a meaningful shift in the DCF method line that she had previously drawn on the football field. A meaningful shift would warrant a revision to her previous valuation. Ms Harfouche found that there was no meaningful shift and so there was no need to adjust DyStar’s estimated EV previously arrived at. As stated above at [56(b)], Ms Harfouche explains that “[a]s a consequence of selecting a group of companies with an overall global operating presence, the Comparable Listed Companies used by Ms Harfouche are subject to country risk to at least the same extent as DyStar, and so no further adjustment for country risk should be made to the multiples derived from their share prices”. In other words, the country risk premium had already been embedded into her approach of using comparable companies to derive DyStar’s estimated EV.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Ms Harfouche’s position is similar for the 26.7% DyStar group rate. She states that the headline corporate tax rates for the comparable companies (which, as noted at [55]–[58] and [68]–[69] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, had been factored into her valuation approach) ranged from 18% to 34% and so no further adjustment was required. In other words, the tax rate had already been taken into account in her model by the selection of comparable companies with similar characteristics. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 On the other hand, Mr Lie prepares a fresh set of calculations using a pure DCF method. He first selects a company from the cluster of companies with a valuation that is closest to the interim valuation of DyStar that was arrived at in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>US$1,636m. Using the financial data of that company, Mr Lie then suggest deductions for the country risk premium and 26.7% group rate and works out a fresh set of calculations using the DCF method. He ignores in the process Ms Harfouche’s point that the country risk premium and 26.7% group rate are already embedded in the financials of the comparable companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Therefore, Mr Lie’s approach does not assess the impact of the country risk premium and 26.7% tax rate <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> the context of Ms Harfouche’s valuation approach as reflected in the football field model</span>. Mr Lie has instead advanced a separate DCF calculation using a starting point of US$1,636m. This is objectionable for three reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It ignores Ms Harfouche’s point that the country risk premium and 26.7% group rate are already embedded in the financials of the comparable companies. By making these deductions again, he is in effect double counting.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Lie’s position is at odds with our decision in the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>. We arrived at an interim valuation of US$1,636m on the ground <span class="font-italic">that </span><span class="font-italic">Ms Harfouche’s valuation approach was appropriate</span>: see [12] above and <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45]–[156]. This being the case, the nine adjustments to DyStar’s interim valuation must be made <span class="font-italic">in the context of her valuation model</span>. Senda cannot re-open the point by proposing a fresh set of calculations <span class="font-italic">based on the DCF </span><span class="font-italic">method</span>. This would be relitigating the appropriate valuation approach.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The new DCF method calculations introduced by Mr Lie are laden with multiple assumptions that (a) do not correspond with the assumptions made in Ms Harfouche’s model and (b) have not been explained or tested at trial. Further, as stated at [14] above, there is insufficient reference to any underlying material supporting the calculations. It would accordingly be unsafe for the court to arrive at DyStar’s final valuation on untested material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For those reasons, we accept Ms Harfouche’s position on the adjustments to be made under Issues 5 and 6. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 9: Insurance pay-out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 We resolve Issue 9 in Kiri’s favour.

Ms Harfouche has done precisely that and arrived at a net impact of US$4.6m to be added to DyStar’s final valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Mr Lie’s position does not conform with our direction at [305] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>It ignores portions of Ms Harfouche’s updated calculations as contained in Kiri’s Bundle of Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (Amendment No 2). Mr Lie appears to have taken a flat US$4m figure, which corresponds with (a) the position Senda expressed during oral closing submissions for the valuation proceedings on 1 July 2020; and (b) the figure indicated at [312(i)] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>. On the former, the position expressed by Senda does not correspond with Ms Harfouche’s updated calculations. The line items specified therein add up to US$4.6m. On the latter, the figure indicated at [312(i)] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span> was a round figure used to <span class="font-italic">refer to the issue of the insurance pay-out</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a term of reference that parties had adopted in the course of the valuation proceedings. Reading [312(i)] together with [305] of the <span class="font-italic">Valuation Judgment</span>, it is clear that our direction required the final figure to be that found in Ms Harfouche’s updated calculations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 We therefore agree with Ms Harfouche that the net impact of the insurance pay-out is US$4.6m and this amount ought to be incorporated into DyStar’s final valuation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Outstanding issues and directions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The experts are now directed to arrive at DyStar’s final valuation based on the conclusions above.

<p>3 June 2021</p><p><strong>Case summary</strong></p><p>Singapore International Commercial Court Suit No 4 of 2017 <br/>Kiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Limited and another [2021] SGHC(I) 2<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Decision of Kannan Ramesh J, Roger Giles IJ and Anselmo Reyes IJ (delivered by Justice Ramesh)<br/>Outcome: SICC addresses outstanding issues relating to final valuation of DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd. <br/><br/>Background facts<br/><br/>In DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kiri Industries and others and another suit [2018] 5 SLR 1 (the “Main Judgment”), the SICC held that Senda International Capital Ltd (“Senda”) had engaged in instances of oppressive conduct against Kiri Industries Ltd (“Kiri”). Senda was thus ordered to purchase Kiri’s shares in DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“DyStar”), their joint venture. Kiri’s shares were to be valued as at 3 July 2018 (“the valuation date”). The findings in relation to oppression in the Main Judgment were upheld on appeal in Senda International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others and another appeal [2019] 2 SLR 1. The valuation date was not challenged on appeal by either party.<br/> <br/>In Kiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another [2019] 4 SLR 1, it was held, amongst other things, that no minority discount for lack of control should be applied to the valuation of Kiri’s shares. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld this decision: Senda International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others [2020] 2 SLR 1. <br/><br/>Following further tranches of trial (“the valuation proceedings”), the SICC provided an interim valuation (“the Interim Valuation”) of DyStar in Kiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another [2021] 3 SLR 215 (the “Valuation Judgment”). Nine issues remained outstanding, concerning adjustments to be made to the Interim Valuation. In arriving at the Interim Valuation, the SICC generally accepted the approach and valuation model adopted by Kiri’s expert (“the Valuation Model”): the Valuation Judgment at [45]–[156]. The respective experts were directed to submit their views on these issues in a joint report, indicating any points of disagreement with reasons. <br/><br/>The most recent tranche of proceedings concerned the nine issues. Two of the nine issues were agreed. These were the adjustments for the discount for lack of marketability of Kiri’s shares, and the special incentive payment made by DyStar. The experts submitted a joint report (“the Report”) setting out their views on the remaining seven issues. <br/><br/>Two issues concerned the applicable historical tax rates for various sums that were taken into account in determining the Interim Valuation. These sums were:<br/><br/>- The third-party licence fees that were collected by Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co, Ltd (“Longsheng”) and the notional licence fees that ought to have been paid for use of “Orange 288” dyes (“the Patent”). An issue also arose as to whether audit fees incurred by Longsheng when collecting the third-party licence fees should be taken into account in DyStar’s final valuation.<br/><br/>- The fees paid by DyStar to Longsheng for services to DyStar (“the Longsheng Fees”).<br/><br/>Two issues concerned the impact of the expiry of various patents on the Interim Valuation. These patents were:<br/><br/>- the Patent; and<br/><br/>- DyStar’s patents over “Indigo 40% solution” dyes (“the Indigo 40% patents”).<br/><br/>Two issues concerned the adjustments, if any, for country risk premium and the effective tax rate of 26.7%, to the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) component of the Valuation Model.<br/><br/>The final issue was the impact on the Interim Valuation of the insurance pay-out received by DyStar in May and June 2019.<br/><br/>The Court’s decision <br/><br/>As stated above, the SICC accepted the Valuation Model. Accordingly, any impact of the nine issues must be assessed within the framework of the Valuation Model. <br/><br/>There were three components to the applicable tax rates. First, DyStar’s actual historical tax rates ought to be applied. This was the effect of the SICC’s directions at [193] and [205] of the Valuation Judgment. Second, the effective tax rates of the DyStar group, and not the simple tax rate, ought to be applied. The effective tax rate was the appropriate metric, as it correctly accounted for the profit/loss of individual companies in the group in a given year. Third, DyStar’s group rate, and not the tax rates of the individual entities in the group, ought to be applied. The experts agreed that this was the effect of the SICC’s decision in the Valuation Judgment. The rates comprising these three components (“DyStar’s group rates”) were stated in a table (“Table A”) in the Report (at [16]), and were to be applied to all tax issues unless valid reasons for applying a different rate were provided (at [17]).<br/><br/>The notional and third-party licence fees were to be taxed using DyStar’s group rates (at [20], [21], [29]). The experts, however, disagreed on the rates for 2010, 2012, 2018 and 2019.<br/><br/>For 2010 and 2012, Kiri’s expert proposed a 0% tax rate instead of the negative rates stated in Table A, because “applying a negative effective tax rate would increase the notional licence fees after tax”. This position was to Kiri’s disadvantage. On the other hand, Senda’s expert proposed a 10% tax rate for 2010 and 2012 without providing an evidential basis to support the rate. The SICC accepted Kiri’s position of a 0% tax rate for 2010 and 2012 (at [24]).<br/><br/>As regards 2018, Kiri’s expert was of the view that DyStar’s group rate of 45.5% stated in Table A should be disregarded as it was an “anomaly” occasioned by the explosion of DyStar’s plant in Nanjing. The SICC did not accept this view on the ground that “one-off events” could have also occurred in the other years in Table A. This could account for the fluctuation in DyStar’s group rates in Table A (at [25]).<br/><br/>As regards 2019, the absence of evidence meant that the experts were not able to arrive at DyStar’s group rate for 2019. Senda’s expert proposed that DyStar’s group rate for 2018 (45.5%) be used as a proxy, but was not able to identify any event that would have had a similar pronounced impact on DyStar’s group rate for 2019. Accordingly, the fair and reasonable course was to apply the average of DyStar’s group rates, ie, 26.7% (at [26], [27]).<br/><br/>The audit fees incurred by Longsheng when collecting the third-party licence fees should not be taken into account in DyStar’s final valuation (at [33], [34]). The point was res judicata. In arriving at the quantum of licence fees payable by Longsheng to DyStar, the SICC declined to include any line items apart from those specified in the Valuation Judgment at [190]–[205]. Further, as a matter of fairness, Senda ought not to be allowed to claim on Longsheng’s behalf expenses incurred during Longsheng’s wrongful exploitation of DyStar’s intellectual property (at [35]).<br/><br/>The Longsheng Fees for 2015 and 2016 were to be taxed using DyStar’s group rates (at [40]). This was the position of Senda’s experts, which was preferred as a matter of consistency, given the SICC’s conclusion in the Valuation Judgment that DyStar’s group rates should be applied across all tax issues (at [37]). The position of Kiri’s expert that the individual entities’ tax rates should apply was inconsistent with the SICC’s conclusion in the Valuation Judgment that the applicable tax rates ought to be those of the group, not the individual entities (at [39]).<br/><br/>On the issues concerning the expiry of various patents, Kiri was not allowed to challenge the finding in the Valuation Judgment that Eric Hopmann, CEO of the DyStar group, did not forecast an “immediate drop” in revenue due to the expiry of the Indigo 40% patents as the issue had been decided (at [41], [42]). Two issues remained. First, whether the expiry of the Patent and the Indigo 40% patents would have finite or perpetual impacts on DyStar. Second, how such finite or perpetual impacts should be quantified and incorporated in DyStar’s final valuation.<br/><br/>The expiration of the relevant patents ought to have a finite impact (at [49]). The evidence did not support a perpetual impact and suggested the contrary (at [46]). As a matter of commercial and common sense, plans would have been formulated by the DyStar board to mitigate any losses arising from the expiration of the patents if they were commercially significant to DyStar.<br/><br/>The SICC accepted the use of the DCF method by Kiri’s expert to assess the finite impact of the expiration of the patents on DyStar’s final valuation on the basis that only the DCF method was capable of making that assessment (at [54]). The SICC did not accept the approach of Senda’s expert as it was based on the assumption that the impact of the expiration of the patents was perpetual. An alternative approach based on a finite impact had not been proposed (at [55]). <br/><br/>Kiri’s expert used a different approach to assess the effects of the country risk premium on the Interim Valuation (at [59]). However, the SICC found this to be explicable and acceptable as the country risk premium was already factored into the financials of the group of companies that was the basis of the Valuation Model. This approach was not applicable to the impact of the expiry of the patents. This was because the commercial importance of the patents was unique to DyStar and accordingly could only be assessed with reference to DyStar (at [56]).<br/><br/>Kiri’s expert incorporated the effects of the country of risk premium and the 26.7% tax rate using the Valuation Model (at [60]). The SICC agreed with her as the Valuation Model was accepted in the Valuation Judgment (at [58]).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Senda’s expert’s calculations on the country risk premium and 26.7% tax rate involved fresh DCF calculations. This did not accord with the SICC’s acceptance of the Valuation Model (at [58], [61], [62]).<br/><br/>The net impact of the insurance pay-out to DyStar was US$4.6m. This amount ought to be incorporated into DyStar’s final valuation (at [66]). Kiri’s expert arrived at the sum of US$4.6m based on her updated calculations in the valuation proceedings, per the SICC’s direction at [305] of the Valuation Judgment (at [64]). Senda’s expert did not conform with the SICC’s direction, and instead proposed a flat US$4m figure, which was rejected (at [65]).<br/><br/>The SICC ordered the parties’ experts to revert with a final value of Kiri’s shares in DyStar based on the conclusions above (at [67]–[69]).<br/><br/>This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
