        Lee Seiu Kin J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In
this summons the defendant applied for a declaration that its acceptance
on 24 September 2013 of the plaintiff’s offer to settle dated 28 July 2011
was valid and that the action had been settled on the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
defendant is to pay to the plaintiff the sum of S$2,588,666.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
defendant is to pay to the plaintiff the plaintiff’s costs of the claim
and counterclaim to be taxed if not agreed:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       on a standard basis, from the date of commencement of these
proceedings on 20 May 2011 to 11 August 2011; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       on an indemnity basis, from 12 August 2011 up to the date of
the defendant’s notice of acceptance (<em>ie</em>,
24 September 2013).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
defendant is to pay to the plaintiff interest at 1.5% per annum,
for the period from 20 May 2011 up to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
plaintiff is to discontinue its claims against the defendant within
seven days of payment of the sum of S$2,588,666, interest and costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On
5 November 2013, after hearing submissions from both sides, I made
an order in terms of the application and granted costs to the defendants
fixed at $5,000 plus disbursements. On the application of counsel
for the plaintiff, I granted leave to appeal as the matter concerned
a novel point of law. The plaintiff filed the appeal on 2 December 2013
and I now give my grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiff’s offer to settle
of 28 July 2011 had expired prior to the defendant’s acceptance
on 24 September 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
background to the matter is as follows. The plaintiff commenced this
action, Suit No 369 of 2011, on 20 May 2011. The claim was for a
sum of $10,138,128.28, which consisted of two parts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Loss
of prospective fees for architectural works not carried out amounting
to $5,626,653.31; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Fees
of $4,511,474.97 for certain architectural work carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
defendant in turn counterclaimed for the sum of $23,410,000. This
was for loss and damage suffered as a result of the plaintiff’s
delay in providing the defendant with a letter of release after
the defendant terminated the plaintiff’s services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On
28 July 2011, some two months after the writ was filed, the plaintiff’s
solicitors, M/s MPillay (“MPillay”), sent a letter (“the OTS”) to the
defendant’s then solicitors, M/s Kelvin Chia Partnership. In it,
the plaintiff offered to settle its claim against the defendant
for the sum of about $2.6m. The letter stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">The Plaintiff offers to fully and
finally settle all of the Plaintiff’s claims, all of the Defendant’s
counterclaims and all matters arising in this Suit on the following
terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">1.   The Defendant is to pay
to the Plaintiff the sum of S$2,588,666;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">2.   If this Offer to Settle
is accepted by the Defendant no later than 14 days from today, i.e.
by 11 August 2011:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a)    Parties
will bear their own legal costs from the date of commencement of
these proceedings on 20 May 2011 to the date of the Defendant’s
notice of acceptance (if any); and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    The Settlement Sum shall be inclusive
of interest accrued from the date of commencement of these proceedings
on 20 May 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    If this Offer to Settle is accepted
by the Defendant after 11 August 2011:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a)    The
Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff the Plaintiff’s costs:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">a.    on
a standard basis, from the date of commencement of these proceedings
on 20 May 2011 to 11 August 2011,</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">b.    on an indemnity basis, from 12 August
2011 up to the date of the Defendant’s notice of acceptance (if
any);</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    The
Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff interest at 1.5% per annum,
for the period from 20 May 2011 up to the date of payment;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Costs
to be paid pursuant to this Offer to Settle, to be taxed if not agreed;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The Plaintiff is to discontinue its
claims against the Defendant, and the Defendant is to discontinue
its counterclaim against the Plaintiff, within 7 days of payment
of the sums payable pursuant to this Offer to Settle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On
8 February 2012, the plaintiff applied in summons no 603 of 2012 for
bifurcation of the suit to determine the issues of liability and
quantum in separate trials. The court granted the application on
7 March 2012. The trial on liability was heard in October 2012.
On 26 March 2013, I issued my decision, allowing part of the plaintiff’s
claim and dismissed the rest. I also dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim.
I ordered damages to be assessed by the registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On
22 April 2013, a few days before expiry of the period to file notice of
appeal against my decision, the defendant’s solicitors, M/s Jimmy
Yap &amp; Co (“JYC”), wrote to MPillay to ask if the plaintiff was <em>“prepared to accept the outcome of the matter without
taking the matter further to the Court of Appeal”</em> [emphasis
in original]. The letter further stated that if the plaintiff was
prepared to do so, the defendant would also not appeal. MPillay
replied on 23 April 2013 stating that “[i]f your client’s proposal
is made with the intention of avoiding further time and costs, please
be reminded that our client’s Offer to Settle remains open for acceptance”.
There was no further correspondence on this matter and on 25 April 2013,
both parties filed notices of appeal against that part of my decision
that found the defendant liable to the plaintiff with damages to
be assessed. However the defendant did not appeal against the dismissal
of its counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On
24 September 2013, the Court of Appeal heard the appeals. The plaintiff’s
appeal was allowed and the defendant’s appeal dismissed. Later that
same day, JYC sent to MPillay a document entitled “Notice of Acceptance
of Plaintiff’s Offer to Settle”. This document (“the NOA”) purported
to accept the OTS. It stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendant accepts your Offer to Settle
dated the 28<sup>th</sup> day of July 2011 on the
following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The
Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff the sum of S$2,588,666.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff
the Plaintiff’s costs of the Claim and Counterclaim to be taxed
if not agreed:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading2">a)   on a standard basis,
from the date of commencement of these proceedings on 20 May 2011
to 11 August 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    on an indemnity basis, from 12 August
2011 up to the date of this Notice of Acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The
Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff interest at 1.5% per annum,
for the period from 20 May 2011 up to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The Plaintiff is to discontinue its
claims against the Defendant within 7 days of payment of the aforesaid
sum of $2,588,666, interest and costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">By a letter dated 25 September 2013 from MPillay to JYP, MPillay
stated, among other things, that the OTS “remained open for acceptance
so long as the Court had not disposed of the matter in respect of
which the OTS was made” and as “that had ceased to be the case before
[the defendant’s] purported acceptance”, the OTS was “no longer
capable of being accepted”. There was further exchange of correspondence
between the solicitors on whether the defendant’s purported acceptance
of the OTS was valid and therefore had compromised the action, but
such correspondence are not relevant for my determination of the
issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
defendant’s position was that the OTS did not specify a time for acceptance.
Order 22A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed)
(“ROC”) states that an offer may be withdrawn at any time after
the expiry of 14 days from the date of service of the offer on the
other party, provided that at least one day’s prior notice is given.
Order 22A r 3(5) of the ROC provides that, if not withdrawn, the
offer may be accepted at any time before the court disposes of the
matter in respect of which the offer is made. As no such notice
was given in this case, it remained open for acceptance at the time
the NOA was served.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The
defendant submitted that, at the time of the NOA, the court had not
disposed of the matter in respect of which the OTS was made (O 22A r 3(5)).
This was because the OTS was made in respect of the entire suit
as it dealt with both issues of liability and damages. As at the
date of the NOA, 24 September 2013, only the issue of liability
had been disposed of. The issue of damages, which remain to be assessed,
has not yet been disposed of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
defendant highlighted that the OTS was an offer to “fully and finally
settle all of the Plaintiff’s claims, all of the Defendant’s counterclaims and
all matters arising in the Suit”. While it was a term of the OTS
that the defendant was to discontinue its counterclaim against the
plaintiff, it had become irrelevant by 24 September 2013 because
there was no counterclaim for the defendant to discontinue. The
defendant further pointed out that, even after the defendant’s counterclaim
had been dismissed by the High Court, the plaintiff itself had maintained,
by way of a letter, that the OTS remained open for acceptance by
the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
defendant also submitted that its position made eminent sense. Its
argument was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
defendant’s position may be tested by looking at the matter from
the plaintiff’s perspective.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Pursuant
to O 22A r 9(1) of the ROC, where an offer to settle made by a plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of
the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       is not accepted by the defendant, and the plaintiff obtains a
judgment not less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to
the date the offer to settle was served, and costs on the indemnity
basis from that date, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Could
the plaintiff rely on O 22A r 9(1) of the ROC, and its OTS if it
were subsequently awarded damages of more than S$2,588,666 (assuming
the OTS was neither accepted nor withdrawn in the interim)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
answer must be “yes”. Otherwise, the plaintiff would be put in the
absurd situation of its OTS being nullified, and losing the advantage
of making that OTS, simply because the Court had decided on the
issue of liability first.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     More
importantly, if the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the OTS when
damages are determined, then why could not the defendant accept
it before that determination? If the plaintiff were to have the advantage
of the OTS, it must necessarily follow that the OTS remained open
for acceptance by the defendant until the issue of damages was determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
defendant further submitted that its position was consistent with the
policy behind offer to settle, and the <em>contra
proferentum</em> rule for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
whole object of offer to settle was to spur the parties to bring
litigation to an expeditious end without judgment, and thus to save
costs and judicial time: <em>Singapore Court Practice
2009 (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009)</em> at para
22A/1/2; <em>Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan Shwu
Leng</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [37] (<em>“Singapore
Airlines Ltd”)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Consistent
with this principle, an offer to settle made in a bifurcated action,
and which dealt with both liability and damages, must remain open
for acceptance after liability had been determined but before damages
were assessed as a party could not benefit from its offer to settle
if it were withdrawn before the disposal of the claim in respect
of which the offer to settle was made: see O 22A r 9(1) of the ROC;
also see <em>Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd
and another v PT Bumi International Tankers and another appeal</em> [2004]
3 SLR(R) 267, in which the Court of Appeal held that the appellants
were not entitled to indemnity costs because their offer to settle
(which was valid only for 14 days) had expired before the disposal
of the claim. In other words, the offer to settle was, according
to O 22A r 3(4), deemed to have been withdrawn after the 14 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Indeed,
one of the benefits of bifurcation was precisely to allow parties
to settle once liability had been decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     Further,
if there were any ambiguity about the meaning of the OTS, the words
must be construed against the plaintiff, who made the offer. Not
only was this consistent with the <em>contra proferentum</em> rule, where
the words of an ambiguous document will be construed against the
person who put them forward: Kim Lewison, <em>The
Interpretation of Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th
Ed, 2011) at para 7.08, it was also consistent with the object of
offers to settle, which was to encourage the speedy termination
of litigation by agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     Indeed,
after the interlocutory judgment, the plaintiff took the position
that the OTS remained open for acceptance, which the defendant accepted
on 24 September 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
plaintiff’s submissions were threefold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
defendant’s acceptance was invalid as it did not accept the OTS
on its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
OTS was no longer capable of being accepted, as the Court has disposed
of the matter in respect of which it was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
defendant’s conduct in these proceedings ran contrary to, and made
a mockery of the rationale underpinning the offer to settle regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a) Acceptance not on terms
of OTS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
plaintiff first referred to <em>Fuyawa Enterprise
Pte Ltd v Lim Han Tee trading as Wifu Marketing</em> [1996]
SGHC 300 (“<em>Fuyawa Enterprise”</em>) for
the proposition that an offeree’s acceptance must mirror the terms
of the offer to settle. The defendant in that case had accepted
the plaintiff’s offer to settle dated 23 September 1995. The disputed
term stated that “the Defendant will bear taxed costs of the Plaintiff’s
claim and the Defendant’s counterclaim which the Plaintiffs are
entitled to of this matter to-date”. The High Court recorded consent
judgment on 3 November 1995, and held that the order for costs was
for costs up to 3 November 1995. The defendant sought clarification
on the period covered by the costs order, arguing that costs should
be ordered only up to 23 September 1995, <em>ie</em>,
the date of the offer to settle. The judge disagreed and held that
the expression “to-date” in the offer to settle referred to the
date of acceptance and not the date of offer. The judge reasoned
as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may be unfortunate that the Plaintiffs’
offer of settlement did not say costs as at the date of acceptance,
but <em>in the scheme of things under O 22A of
the Rules of Supreme Court, a party must accept the offer in the
prescribed form. The acceptance by the Defendant in this case was
not in the prescribed form. Had he done so he would have been obliged
to set out the terms in consecutively numbered paragraphs and the
acceptance would be dated the 3 November 1995.</em> The phrase
“to-date” in paragraph 5 of the Plaintiffs’ offer must be read to
mean the date of acceptance and not the date in which the offer
was dated as <em>the offeree’s acceptance must
necessarily mirror this term</em> and the date of the acceptance
must be 3 November 1995 and not 23 September 1995. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     With
respect, I do not see anything in this authority that assists the plaintiff’s
position. If anything, it shows that the courts look at the substance
of the offer and acceptance rather than the strict form when considering
whether a purported acceptance is valid. In my opinion, this is necessary
because there is no standard manner of formulating an offer as there
is an infinite variety of circumstances as well as differing quality
of drafting. In <em>Fuyawa Enterprise</em>,
despite the fact that, on the face of a document dated 23 September 1995
the offer was for “costs to-date”, the court interpreted this to
refer to costs as at the eventual date of acceptance and not the
date of the document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
plaintiff next referred to <em>Ip Yun Ha v Dennis
Wee Realty Pte Ltd</em> [2011] SGDC 15 (“<em>Ip
Yun Ha</em>”) and to <em>Re Desanto et al
v Cretzman et al</em> 53 OR (2d) 732; 1986 CanLII 2663 (“<em>Re Desanto</em>”), a District Court of Ontario decision,
for the proposition that an acceptance must be done without any amendment
or variation and must be unqualified and unconditional. If a party
qualified its acceptance of the offer to settle, it would amount
to a counter-offer, not an acceptance. This is correct in principle,
but it is a question of fact and law whether the purported acceptance
is an acceptance of the offer or is a counter-offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
plaintiff submitted that the NOA did not mirror the terms of the OTS
as it did not make reference to (a) the S$2,588,666 concurrently settling
defendant’s counterclaim, and (b) the defendant’s obligation to discontinue
its counterclaim. The nub of this submission is as follows. The OTS
required the defendant to pay the plaintiff $2,588,666 in full and
final settlement of all the plaintiff’s claims and defendant’s counterclaims
arising in the suit along with certain terms as to costs and discontinuance
of the claim and counterclaim. Upon expiry of the period for appeal
against the decision to dismiss the counterclaim, such counterclaim
was finally determined. The defendant was therefore unable in the
NOA to mirror the terms of the OTS and state that it was to settle
both the claim and counterclaim. Further, the OTS obliged both parties
to discontinue the claim and counterclaim. However the defendant
was not able to discontinue the counterclaim as it had been dismissed
by the High Court and was made final when the defendant did not
file an appeal within time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b) OTS no longer capable of
being accepted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
plaintiff submitted that the OTS was no longer capable of being accepted
as the court had disposed of the matter in respect of which it was made, <em>ie</em>, both the claim and the counterclaim,
in the sense that the counterclaim was already disposed of, even
though the quantum of the claim was not. This argument relied on
an interpretation of the OTS not apparent on its face, <em>ie</em>, that the OTS would no longer be open
for acceptance if the claim was finally determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(c) Defendant’s conduct contrary
to offer to settle regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
plaintiff referred to <em>The “Endurance 1”</em> [1998]
3 SLR(R) 970 at [41], which cited <em>Data General
(Canada) Ltd v Molnar Systems Group Inc </em><em>and
Corporation of the Town of Lindsay</em> (1991) 85 DLR (4th)
392 (“<em>Data General</em>”) for the proposition
that the purpose of the offer to settle regime was to “encourage
the termination of litigation by agreement of the parties – more
speedily and less expensively than by judgment of the court at the end
of the trial. <em>The impetus to settle is a mechanism
which enables a plaintiff to make a serious offer respecting his
or her estimate of the value of the claim which will require the
defendant to give early (that is, when the offer is served) and
careful consideration of the merits of the case</em>” [emphasis in
original]. The plaintiff also cited <em>Singapore
Airlines Ltd</em> at [37], which stated that the whole object
of this regime was to “spur the parties to bring litigation to an
expeditious end without judgment, and thus to save costs and judicial
time”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
plaintiff submitted that the defendant’s conduct was contrary to the
spirit of the regime. Its acceptance was served very late in the proceedings, <em>ie</em>, after a two-week trial, judgment,
and the hearing and disposal by the Court of Appeal of its subsequent
appeal, on 24 September 2013. This was more than two years after
the OTS had been made, <em>ie</em>, on 28 July 2011.
The defendant had refused, contrary to the aims of the offer to
settle regime, to “<em>give early and careful consideration</em>” [emphasis
in original] of the proposed settlement sum in relation to the merits
of both the plaintiff’s claim and its own counterclaim. The defendant’s
conduct in these proceedings clearly ran contrary to the rationale
underpinning the offer to settle regime. In essence, the defendant was
seeking to utilise the offer to settle regime after a two-week trial
of the action and a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, when
the OTS, made before the close of pleadings, was designed to avoid
such costs. The defendant’s actions made a mockery of the purpose
underpinning the offer to settle regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     To
understand the law relating the offer to settle regime established by
O 22A of the ROC, it would be instructional to trace its origins.
I now do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Payment into Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Prior
to 1993, the Rules of the Supreme Court (the predecessor to the ROC)
provided a specific regime under O 22 to make an offer to settle
with consequences on costs. That order sets out in detail the manner
in which parties may make payment into court as an offer to settle
a claim or counterclaim or both. Aside from minor amendments to
O 22 to insert r 1(7) and to reflect the changes to (a) Form numbers
as set out in the Rules, and (b) section numbers of the Civil Law
Act, its present form is unchanged. Order 22 r 1 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. —(1) In any action for a debt or damages
any defendant may at any time after he has entered an appearance
in the action pay into Court a sum of money in satisfaction of the
cause of action in respect of which the plaintiff claims or, where
2 or more causes of action are joined in the action, a sum or sums
of money in satisfaction of all or any of those causes of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    On
making any payment into Court under this Rule, and on increasing any
such payment already made, the defendant must give notice thereof
in Form 31 to the plaintiff and every other defendant (if any);
and within 3 days after receiving the notice the plaintiff must
send the defendant a written acknowledgment of its receipt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    A defendant may, without leave, give
notice of an increase in a payment made under this Rule but, subject
to that and without prejudice to paragraph (5), a notice of payment
may not be withdrawn or amended without the leave of the Court which
may be granted on such terms as may be just.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Where 2 or more causes of action are
joined in the action and money is paid into Court under this Rule
in respect of all, or some only of, those causes of action, the
notice of payment —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    must state that the money
is paid in respect of all those causes of action or, as the case
may be, must specify the cause or causes of action in respect of
which the payment is made; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    where
the defendant makes separate payments in respect of each, or any
2 or more, of those causes of action, must specify the sum paid
in respect of that cause or, as the case may be, those causes of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Where
a single sum of money is paid into Court under this Rule in respect
of 2 or more causes of action, then, if it appears to the Court
that the plaintiff is embarrassed by the payment, the Court may,
subject to paragraph (6), order the defendant to amend the notice
of payment so as to specify the sum paid in respect of each cause
of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    Where a cause of action under section
10 of the Civil Law Act (Chapter 43) and a cause of action under
section 20 of that Act are joined in an action, with or without
any other cause of action, the causes of action under those sections
shall, for the purpose of paragraph (5), be treated as one cause
of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7)    For the purposes of this Rule, the
plaintiff’s cause of action in respect of a debt or damages shall
be construed as a cause of action in respect, also, of such interest
as might be included in the judgment, if judgment were given at the
date of the payment into Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Strict
clarity is required on the terms of any payment into court. Rule 1(4)
requires the offeror to specify which of several causes of action
the payment is made for and r 1(5) empowers the court to order a
party to clarify an ambiguous offer. Rule 6 provides that rules
apply with necessary modifications to a counterclaim. Rule 3(5)
provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where money is paid into Court by a defendant
who made a counterclaim and the notice of payment stated, in relation
to any sum so paid, that in making the payment the defendant had
taken into account and satisfied the cause or causes of action,
or the specified cause or causes of action in respect of which he
claimed, then, on the plaintiff accepting that sum, all further proceedings
on the counterclaim or in respect of the specified cause or causes of
action, as the case may be, against the plaintiff shall be stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These requirements are encapsulated in the prescribed notice
of payment, Form 31, which requires a statement as to the cause
or causes of action for which payment is made and whether it includes
settlement of the counterclaims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Under
O 22 r 3 of the ROC, a plaintiff has 14 days from the receipt of the
notice of payment, or within 14 days of receipt of an amended notice,
to accept the payment or amended payment, but such acceptance must
be done prior to the commencement of the trial or hearing. After
such commencement of the trial, the plaintiff has two days of receipt
of notice of payment or amended notice but this must be done before
the Judge has begun to deliver judgment. Upon acceptance, all further
proceedings in the action, or in respect of the causes of action
and counterclaims, the subject of the payment into court shall be
stayed – O 22 r 3(4) and (5).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It
should be noted that O 22 is silent on the situation where a counterclaim
is finally determined before the claim is determined. As to withdrawal,
O 22 r 1(3) states that a payment into court “may not be withdrawn
or amended without leave of the Court which may be granted on such
terms as may be just” although a defendant may, without leave, give notice
of an increase to any payment into Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The
cost consequences of payment into court are set out in O 59 r 5(<em>a</em>) and r 10(2) of the ROC. Rule 5(<em>a</em>) provides that the Court shall take into
account any payment of money into Court and the amount of such payment.
Rule 10(2) states that a plaintiff who accepts money paid into Court
is entitled to costs up to the time of receipt of the notice of
payment, unless the Court orders otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In
addition, O 59 r 3(8) deals with costs of counterclaim in the following
manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a plaintiff accepts money paid into
Court by a defendant who counterclaimed against him, then, if the
notice of payment given by that defendant stated that he had taken
into account and satisfied the cause of action or, as the case may
be, all the causes of action in respect of which he counterclaimed,
that defendant shall, unless the Court otherwise directs, be entitled
to his costs of the counterclaim incurred to the time of receipt
of the notice of acceptance by the plaintiff of the money paid into
Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The
payment into court regime contemplates that the court may take into
account money paid into court to settle all or some of the causes
of action and all or some of the counterclaims. The default position
is that where a party accepts the payment, he is only entitled to
costs up to the time of receipt of the notice of payment. However
there is a residual discretion on the part of the court to make
a different order in accordance with the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Calderbank offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     A
significant lacuna in O 22 of the ROC is that it is only applicable where
the action pertains to the payment of a sum of money. Furthermore, it
is only available to a defendant, or a defendant to a counterclaim.
It is not available where the subject of the dispute did not turn
on payment of a sum of money, or where a plaintiff wished to make
an offer to settle for a lower sum than what he claimed. Finally
this procedure is only available after the writ is filed. The courts
eventually developed an extra-statutory inducement for parties to
settle through the exercise of its discretionary powers to order costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     
          <em>Calderbank v Calderbank</em> [1976] Fam 93
(CA) concerned divorce proceedings in England in which the wife
sought a declaration that she was the sole beneficial owner of the
matrimonial home which she had paid for but was held in the husband’s
name. The wife had also purchased a house in her name for the occupation
of the husband’s mother. The court granted the declaration sought
by the wife and ordered her to make a lump sum payment of £10,000
to the husband out of the proceeds of sale. The judge made no order
as to costs. The wife appealed. The English Court of Appeal dismissed
her appeal on the substantive order. When it came to the wife’s appeal
against the order that each party was to bear its own costs, her solicitor
asked for guidance of the Court of Appeal in relation to the wife’s offer,
by a letter from her solicitors marked “without prejudice”, to settle the
matter by transferring the house occupied by the husband’s mother which
was worth substantially more than the £10,000 the husband obtained.
The offer had not been accepted. The Court of Appeal held that as the
letter was marked “without prejudice”, it could not be brought up
for consideration of the court even on the question of costs. Addressing counsel’s
point that it was difficult for a party in such a situation to make
an offer to a claimant in order to save cost, Cairns LJ suggested
that it was possible for a party to make an offer which was without
prejudice to the issue of damages but with the right to be used
on the question of costs. The judge stated as follows (at 105-106):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Mr. Hordern then indicated the difficulty
that a party might be in in proceedings of this kind when he or
she was willing to accede to some extent to an application that
was made and desired to obtain the advantages that could be obtained
in an ordinary action for debt or damages by a payment into court,
that not being a course which would be appropriate in proceedings
of this kind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are various other types of proceedings
well known to the court where protection has been able to be afforded
to a party who wants to make a compromise of that kind and where
payment in is not an appropriate method. One is in proceedings before
the Lands Tribunal where the amount of compensation is in issue
and where the method that is adopted is that of a sealed offer which
is not made without prejudice but which remains concealed from the
tribunal until the decision on the substantive issue has been made
and the offer is then opened when the discussion as to costs takes place.
Another example is in the Admiralty Division where there is commonly
a dispute between the owners of two vessels that have been in collision
as to the apportionment of blame between them. It is common practice
for an offer to be made by one party to another of a certain apportionment.
If that is not accepted no reference is made to that offer in the
course of the hearing until it comes to costs, and then if the court’s apportionment
is as favourable to the party who made the offer as what was offered,
or more favourable to him, then costs will be awarded on the same basis
as if there had been a payment in.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I see no reason why some similar practice
should not be adopted in relation to such matrimonial proceedings
in relation to finances as we have been concerned with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Millar drew our attention to a provision
in the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1968 with reference to damages which
were then payable by a co-respondent, provision to the effect that
an offer might be made in the form that it was without prejudice
to the issue as to damages but reserving the right of the co-respondent
to refer to it on the issue of costs. It appears to me that it would
be equally appropriate that it should be permissible to make an
offer of that kind in such proceedings as we have been dealing with
and I think that that would be an appropriate way in which a party
who was willing to make a compromise could put it forward. I do
not consider that any amendment of the Rules of the Supreme Court
is necessary to enable this to be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     However
Cairns LJ ruled that the wife was entitled to costs in the court
below because she had made an offer in an affidavit filed in the proceedings
to transfer to the husband the house occupied by his mother, then
worth about £12,000. The husband ought to have accepted that offer but
he had persisted in the proceedings and recovered a sum smaller
than the value of the house. For the proceedings in the court below,
the husband was awarded costs up to the date of the affidavit and
the wife was awarded her costs from that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Following
this decision, the dictum of Cairns LJ was adopted in matrimonial
proceedings, in which a party made a written offer to settle “without
prejudice save as to costs”: see <em>Cutts v Head
and another</em> [1984] 1 Ch 290 at 302 (“<em>Cutts</em>”).
Such letters became known as a Calderbank offer. The English Court
of Appeal in <em>Cutts</em> considered the
authorities and held that the Calderbank offer was not restricted
to matrimonial proceedings. This position was followed in Singapore.
If the outcome was less favourable than a Calderbank offer, the
letter would be shown to the court and taken into consideration
on the question of costs: see <em>Shi Fang v Koh
Pee Huat</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 at [54]-[55].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However
a Calderbank offer, unlike the statutory regime under O 22 and O 22A
of the ROC, does not bind the court to award costs in any particular
manner but is one factor that the court will take into consideration
in the exercise of its discretion to award costs: see <em>SBS Transit Ltd (formerly known as Singapore Bus
Services Limited) v Koh Swee Ann</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 365
(“<em>SBS Transit</em>”) at [21] and [24].
Further, a Calderbank offer is terminated by the other party’s rejection
of it: see <em>SBS Transit</em> at [23].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Hence
it is not surprising that no consistent treatment was given by the
courts to Calderbank offers as there is a wide variation in circumstances of
each case. In <em>Lie Djioe </em><em>Boei alias Lee Yew Wee Executor of the Estate of Lioe </em><em>Soei </em><em>Tjin alias Liu
Swee Chin (or Lie Soei </em><em>Tjin also
known as Liu Swee Chin, deceased) v Huang Han Jiang (alias Huang
Han Jiang)</em> [2000] SGHC 107 at [9], the defendant made
a Calderbank offer near the end of the trial. It was rejected by
the plaintiff. The judgment resulted in an outcome that was substantially
similar to the offer and much lower than the plaintiff’s claim.
The court took the view that the plaintiff was entitled to some
costs and awarded him one-third costs up to the date of the Calderbank
offer. In <em>Colgate Palmolive Ltd and another
v Markwell Finance and another</em> [1990] RPC 197, the circumstances
of the defendants’ Calderbank offer was such that it would be inappropriate
to deprive the plaintiffs of any part of their costs of the action
(at 201, [25]). The court held that the offer was inadequate in
three respects: (a) it was delivered four days (including a weekend)
before the trial in which the plaintiffs’ witnesses had to travel from
abroad; (b) the letter did not offer all the relief to which the
plaintiffs were entitled; and (c) the offer related to part of the
subject matter of the actions and thus, a settlement on that basis
would have no, or no significant, reduction in the time occupied
by the trial. In contrast, in <em>Butcher v Wolfe
and another</em> [1999] 2 FCR 165, the plaintiff was ordered
to pay all the costs of the action. The defendant made a Calderbank
offer to buy out the plaintiff’s interest in the land on a tenanted
basis and stated that, if the sum was not acceptable but the basis
of valuation was agreed, parties should agree on a procedure for
determining an independent valuation. It was met with an outright
refusal by the plaintiff because she disagreed with the basis of
valuation. In the course of the action, however, she accepted the
offer, and it was on the basis for which the defendants had always
contended and which she had always opposed (at 173). Accordingly, the
plaintiff had obtained nothing in the action that she could not
have obtained more cheaply by accepting the letter (at 178), and
the court unanimously upheld the decision below that the plaintiff
should pay costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As
can be seen from the foregoing, the court has broad discretion as to
costs in assessing Calderbank offers. Generally, the court’s consideration will
bear on reasonableness or otherwise of an offeree’s refusal to accept
the Calderbank offer: see <em>Chrulew and others
v Borm-Reid &amp; Co</em> [1992] 1 WLR 176 (per Waller J at
185). This will, as illustrated above, will turn upon the terms
of Calderbank offer and the specific circumstances surrounding it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The
Calderbank offer was much more flexible than the payment into court
procedure as it was available even before the writ was filed and applicable
to the plaintiff as well as the defendant. It could also handle circumstances
that did not involve cash. An important and practical difference
between a Calderbank offer and payment into court was that the latter
procedure required a defendant to actually come up with the money to
make the payment into court. This was an inconvenient procedure compared
to the Calderbank offer, especially at an early stage in the proceedings.
In practice, this meant that the payment into court procedure became
otiose as defendants would simply resort to Calderbank offers as opposed
to coming out with cash at the outset. In <em>Cutts</em>,
Oliver LJ cautioned that a Calderbank offer cannot be used as a
substitute for payment into court, stating as follows (at 312):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would add only one word of caution. …
it should not be thought that this involves the consequence that
[the Calderbank offer] can now be used as a substitute for a payment
into court, where a payment into court is appropriate. In the case
of the simple money claim, a defendant who wishes to avail himself
of the protection afforded by an offer must, in the ordinary way,
back his offer with cash by making a payment in and, speaking for myself,
I should not, as at present advised, be disposed in such a case
to treat a <em>Calderbank</em> offer as carrying
the same consequences as payment in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The
caution sounded by Oliver LJ was incorporated in the UK Rules of
the Supreme Court by the addition of O 22 r 14 in 1986. This rule
gave legislative effect to the Calderbank offer but excluded from
its ambit any offer that, at the time it was made, was capable of
being the subject of a payment into court under the same order.
Following the changes to the English rules, a similar change was
enacted in O 22 r 13 of the Singapore’s Rules of the Supreme Court
and Rules of the Subordinate Courts in 1992. As with the UK amendment,
the Singapore amendment ensured that the “Calderbank letter is only
available to a party who could not have protected his position by
payment into court”: see <em>Jet Holding Ltd and
Others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Another</em> [2006]
SGHC 20 at [12].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">O 22A: Offer to Settle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In
1993, the Rules of the Supreme Court and the Rules of the Subordinate
Court were amended to include O 22A, which implemented the offer
to settle regime. At that time, various statutory procedures relating to
offers to settle were in place in a number of Canadian and Australian states.
They included r 37 of the British Columbia Supreme Court Rules, r 49
of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, Pt 22 and Pt 52 r 17 of
the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules 1970 and r 26 of the Victoria
General Rules of Procedure in Civil Proceedings 1986. It was against
this backdrop that O 22A was introduced via S 278/93 and S 279/93
and took effect on 1 July 1993. Importantly, O 22A bore significant
similarities to the provisions in British Columbia, Ontario, New
South Wales and Victoria. For example, except in Victoria, the offer
to settle procedure applied to all actions (not just monetary claims),
and was equally available to plaintiffs and defendants: see O 22A
r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and the Rules of the Subordinate
Court, r 37(2) of the British Columbia Supreme Court Rules, r 49.02(1)
of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure and Pt 22 r 2 of the New
South Wales Supreme Court Rules 1970. Another example was where
a plaintiff, in several of these jurisdictions, would <em>prima facie</em> be entitled to costs on an
indemnity basis or a solicitor and client basis if he made an offer
to settle (which was not accepted by the defendant) and the judgment
he eventually obtained was not less favourable than the offer: see O 22A
r 9 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and the Rules of the Subordinate
Court, r 49.10(1) of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, Pt 52 r 17(4)
of the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules 1970 and r 26.08(2) of
the Victoria General Rules of Procedure in Civil Proceedings 1986.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As
the provisions in British Columbia, Ontario, New South Wales and Victoria
constituted important background to the enactment of O 22A of the
ROC, it would be useful to briefly examine their underlying purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In
British Columbia, the offer to settle mechanism was established
as early as in 1977, though in its earliest form, only a plaintiff
may “at any time before the commencement of the trial” make an offer
to settle, and only for an “action for damages”: r 57(13)(a) of
the Supreme Court Rules. Even then, the policy articulated in r 57
was to “[reward] parties who offer to settle”: see <em>FSM
v Clarke et al</em> [2000] BCSC 96 at [7]. However, the limited scope
in which the offer to settle operated restricted the efficacy of
the regime. Thus, in 1984, when the British Columbia Law Reform Commission
studied the procedures for offer to settle and payment into court,
it was concerned with the way the procedures were “impaired by their
confinement to liabilities that sound in money” and their inability
to “be used by an impecunious [defendant]”. Recommendations to broaden the
scope of the procedures were made, such as providing that the procedure
for offers to settle should be open to any party to litigation and for
both monetary and non-monetary relief. The British Columbia Law Reform
Commission also thought that it was “desirable to encourage parties
to litigation to negotiate in good faith”. To this end, the possibility
of increased costs following a refusal of a reasonable offer was
proposed as a solution. If costs could be increased, it would encourage
parties to consider the merits of their case carefully and to either
make an offer to settle or to consider seriously whether to accept
the offer to settle: see Law Reform Commission of British Columbia, <em>Report on Settlement Offers</em> (LRC 77, September
1984). The offer to settle regime went through a major revision. On
1 April 1993, when the revised r 37 was enacted, the gist of these recommendations
materialised; the revised rule contained cost consequences favouring
a party who made a reasonable offer that was refused by the other
party: rr 37(2), 37(23)–(26) of the Supreme Court Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Likewise,
the Ontario procedure was established with a mind to encourage settlement.
In <em>Data General</em>, Morden ACJO had
stated (at 398(h)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of Rule 49 is to encourage
the termination of litigation by agreement of the parties - more
speedily and less expensively than by judgment of the court at the
end of a trial. <em>The impetus to settle is a mechanism
which enables a plaintiff to make a serious</em> offer <em>respecting his or her estimate of the value of the
claim which will require the defendant to give early (that is, when
the</em> offer <em>is served) and careful
consideration of the merits of the case</em>. … [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Insofar
as r 49 was envisaged to encourage settlement of litigation, the rule
bore fruit. Within four years of its implementation in Ontario,
the fact of “formal offers and their attendant cost consequences”
compelled counsel to “[assess] the merits of a claim more quickly
and more seriously”: see Ian R Stauffer, “Offers to Settle: A Review
of Recent Developments” [1989] 10 Advoc Q 344 at 344. The success
of r 49 could, in large part, be attributed to the cost sanctions
in r 49.10 that brought pressure to bear on the offeree to settle.
Indeed, because the Ontario High Court of Justice in <em>Jacuzzi Canada Ltd v A Mantella &amp; Sons Ltd et
al</em> (1988) 31 CPC (2d) 195 recognised that the intent
of the r 49.10 was to induce settlement and avoid trials, it took
the view that tinkering with its <em>prima facie</em> operation
would destroy the predictability necessary for r 49.10 to accomplish
its purpose. This was echoed by Morden JA in <em>Niagara
Structural Steel (St Catharines) Ltd v WD LaFlamme Ltd</em> (1987)
19 CPC (2d) 163 at [11]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The general, or basic, rule contained
in r. 49.10(1) is intended to be an incentive to the settlement
of litigation. While r. 49.10(1) does not set forth the basis for
resorting to the exception to it, it is reasonable to assume that
the occasions for the application of the exception should not be
so widespread or common that the result would be that the general
rule is no longer, in fact, the general rule. If this were to happen,
the presumption in favour of the general rule and the resulting
reasonable degree of predictability respecting the incidence of
costs would disappear and the incentive policy of the rule would be
substantially frustrated. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Subsequently,
r 49 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure formed the basis upon
which the Australian rules were derived and a similar procedure, called
“offer of compromise”, was adopted in, among other Australian states.
New South Wales (Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 22 and Pt 52 r 17) and
Victoria (General Rules of Procedure in Civil Proceedings 1986,
r 26): see <em>The Laws of Australia</em> vol
5 (5.1–5.6) (Sheryl Jackson, Chris George, BC Cairns &amp; Grant
T Riethmuller eds) (Thomas Reuters) at para 60; Bernard C Cairns, <em>Australian Civil Procedure</em> (The Law Book
Company Limited, 3rd Ed, 1992) at p 376.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The
New South Wales Court of Appeal in <em>Maitland
Hospital v Fisher (No 2)</em> (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 held that
the obvious purpose of legislating cost consequences (with respect
to the failure to accept a reasonable offer to settle) was to facilitate
the proper compromise of litigation by equal measures of a “carrot”
and “stick”. The court elaborated (at 724(c)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Relevantly, the “carrot” is the promise
of indemnity costs to a plaintiff in the event that the defendant
is found unreasonably to have refused an offer of compromise. The
“stick” is the threat of the penalty of the imposition of an indemnity
costs order against a defendant in such circumstances. It is the obvious
intention of the rule to oblige a defendant, which has received
an offer of compromise, to give serious thought to the risk which
it may run of losing the proceedings and then being ordered to pay
costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The
same rationale was expressed in Victoria. In <em>Mutual
Community Ltd v Lorden Holdings Pty Ltd and others</em> (unreported,
SC (Vic), No 10561/90, 28 April 1993, BC9303878). Byrne J identified
the Court’s policy “to encourage litigating parties to undertake genuine settlement negotiations
and, for the purpose, to face up to serious offers of settlement”
(at 12). While Byrne J found that “[t]he response of a litigant
in receipt of an offer of settlement will always be affected by
the prospect that the sum which the Court might order … may be less advantageous
than the terms of the offer”, he observed that “this prospect alone
is not always sufficient to compel a litigant to face up to the
offer”. As such, “[t]he further prospect of a super-added costs
penalty if a reasonable offer be not accepted is a salutary inducement
to an offeree to undertake this often painful task” (at 13).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     To
summarise, the offer to settle procedure in all four jurisdictions had
a common purpose of encouraging settlement. This purpose was effected
by a common measure of penalising a party who rejected a reasonable
offer with costs (and correspondingly, rewarding the other party with
such costs). Put another way, the imposition of certain cost consequences
effectively encouraged settlement by providing parties with a tangible
incentive to offer to settle and to treat offers to settle seriously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The
experiences in these jurisdictions also demonstrated, firstly, the feasibility
of instituting an offer to settle regime that is considerably broader in
scope than payment into court or Calderbank offer and, secondly,
that having such a regime could save legal costs and judicial time
in ways that were not possible with payment into court or Calderbank
offer. Furthermore, the arguments in favour of settlement that underlined payment
into court or Calderbank offer would apply with equal force to an offer
to settle regime. Hence, there appeared to be no reason why Singapore should
not similarly introduce a formal procedure for making offers to settle.
In fact, there were several advantages O 22A of the ROC had over payment
into court and Calderbank offer, and these are concisely laid out
in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2013</em> (G
P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2013) at para 22A/0/2 and
needs no repeating here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>Singapore Airlines Ltd</em>, Chao JA set out
the policy behind the O 22A procedure in the following terms (at
[38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The scheme of things under O 22A is verily
to encourage the plaintiffs to be realistic in their assessment
of what they are entitled to and on the part of the defendants,
to make reasonable offers, on pain of having to bear the costs on the
indemnity basis if they should persist in their exaggerated claims
or maintain their unreasonable position (in respect of an offer
from the plaintiff). The order seeks to promote responsible conduct
on the part of both parties. It discourages obstinacy. The wide
discretion given to the court in r 12 is to enable the court to
take all pertinent facts and circumstances into account and arrive
at an order on costs which is fair and just. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     There
is one final point to be made. To the extent that O 22A of the ROC,
when enacted, overlapped with payment into court as a means to initiate
settlement, it rendered the latter otiose. This is to be expected
given that O 22A did not require a party making an offer to pay
money into court, and was, on the whole, a more convenient and flexible
method. In the scheme of things, the availability of O 22A as a
tool to promote settlement meant that payment into court would dwindle
in significance, although it would still have its uses in other
areas, such as the payment into court to fulfil a condition for
obtaining leave to defend. Along with the enactment of O 22A, O 22
r 13 was repealed and the Calderbank offer was effectively replaced
by the offer to settle mechanism in O 22A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Having
traced the origin of the O 22A procedure and the policy upon which
it is founded, I turn to consider the facts of the present case
in the light of that policy. The following are the salient features
of the case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <u>Unequal pressure on the parties</u>: The
writ was filed on 20 May 2011. The defendant filed its defence and
counterclaim on 27 June 2011 and an amended defence and counterclaim
three weeks later on 20 July 2011. The plaintiff had made the OTS
under O 22A on 28 July 2011. By operation of O 22A r 9, the plaintiff
could be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis from that date
onwards. The action proceeded to trial which lasted some ten days
and one appeal which was disposed of in September 2013, more than
two years from the date of the OTS. The peril for the defendant
was that it could face substantial indemnity costs were the plaintiff
to recover a sum higher than the amount offered in the OTS. Since
the OTS was on the basis that the defendant would pay indemnity
costs from 12 August 2011, had the defendant not accepted the OTS,
it would still be liable for indemnity costs for the proceedings
to follow, which would be the assessment of damages. The plaintiff,
on the other hand, had no such pressure. It had, at a very early
stage, been prepared to accept the sum in the OTS. If it did obtain
more than that sum at the end of the assessment of damages, the
costs advantage it had accrued from 12 August 2011 meant that it
would recover a sum that is close to its full legal costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <u>Plaintiff had full control</u>: The plaintiff
was in full control of the situation. It was open to the plaintiff
(but not the defendant) to withdraw the OTS at any time subject
to giving one day’s notice under O 22A r 3(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <u>Terms of OTS determined by the plaintiff</u>:
Most importantly, the terms of the OTS were the plaintiff’s. It
was open to the plaintiff to limit the period of validity or phrase
it in any fashion but did not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The
nub of the plaintiff’s position is that the OTS had a self-destruct provision.
Because the OTS states that the settlement is for “all of the plaintiff’s
claims, all of the defendant’s counterclaims and all matters arising in
this Suit”, upon the defendant’s counterclaim being finally determined (when
the defendant did not file an appeal in respect of the dismissal
of its counterclaim), the OTS was no longer capable of being accepted.
The problem is that this position, even if it is tenable, is not
explicit. This means that it is equally possible for the plaintiff
to argue, if the OTS was not accepted and the plaintiff obtained
judgment for a more favourable sum, that the OTS had all the time
remained open for acceptance and asked for indemnity costs all the
way back to August 2011. Consequently, it means that the defendant
faced an uncertain state of affairs, and unfairly so. At the juncture
when the time for appealing on the counterclaim had just passed, it
was not wholly clear whether the OTS had expired. If the defendant adopted
the position that the OTS had remained valid, it would be compelled
to seriously consider settlement and the costs consequences of not
doing so. If the defendant assumed instead that the OTS had expired,
it would be taking a chance that the proper interpretation of the
OTS was that the OTS was still valid and that there would be adverse
cost consequences for failing to accept it. Either way, the defendant
could not have eliminated the possibility that it would be made
to pay costs on an indemnity basis by virtue of O 22A r 9 of the
ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The
question in the end is, faced with an ambiguity, where should the court
draw the line. To me, it is clear from the features set out in [52]
above that the court should come down in favour of clear drafting
in terms of unambiguous offers and expiry dates. These factors are
entirely within the control of the offeror. There should be no scope
in the O 22A regime for the offeror to turn it into an instrument
of oppression against the offeree. A party making an offer to settle
must state clearly the time within which it is open for acceptance
if there is to be such a limitation. If the acceptance is to be
limited by circumstances rather than a date (<em>eg</em>,
first day of the trial of the action), then it must be stated in
the clearest of terms. Any ambiguity will be interpreted <em>contra proferentem</em>. To hold otherwise
in this case would be to arm the plaintiff with a double edged sword
against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Keeping
in mind that the offer to settle regime was aimed at promoting settlement,
it is most unfortunate that the OTS in this case had spurred parties
to further litigate on the offer itself (rather than to settle) because
the ambiguity of the terms had attracted conflicting interpretations.
In my view, favouring clear and certain terms in an offer to settle
can only accord with the policy of encouraging settlement. If an
offer to settle is to come to an end according to its own terms,
it is sensible that the terms should be clear enough, such that
both parties are able to pinpoint when exactly the offer expires
and the offeree can make a considered decision on whether, and if
so, when to accept.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The
plaintiff made three points in its submissions (see [15] above). My
responses are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <u>Acceptance not on terms of OTS</u>: I have
pointed out in [17] above that <em>Fuyawa Enterprise</em> showed
that the court would look at the substance of the offer rather than
the strict form when considering whether a purported acceptance
is valid. If the acceptance is qualified or has conditions attached
to it such that <em>it amounts to a counter-offer</em>, then
it will not be valid, as was held in <em>Ip Yun
Ha</em> and in <em>Re Desanto</em>; see
[18] above. In the present case, there was no qualified or conditional
acceptance in the way that was envisaged in <em>Ip
Yun Ha</em> and <em>Re Desanto</em>.
This was simply a case where, by the time of the defendant’s acceptance
of the OTS, the counterclaim had been determined and therefore there
was no need for the defendant to undertake to discontinue it.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <u>OTS no longer capable of acceptance as counterclaim
had been determined</u>: As alluded to in [20] above, this
argument relies on an implied term that the OTS would no longer
be open for acceptance if the counterclaim was settled. I have held
in [54] above that the OTS will be interpreted <em>contra
proferentem</em> and therefore that interpretation is not
available to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <u>Defendant’s conduct</u>: I can see nothing
in the manner in which the defendant accepted the OTS that could
operate to deprive them of the right to accept the OTS where they
otherwise would be entitled to do so. Order 22A does not impose
any limitation on the acceptance so long as the offer has not been
withdrawn. Indeed the Order envisages acceptance at any time before
final determination. If a party chose to accept near the conclusion
of the suit it is because that party has deemed it to be in its
best interest to do so. It must be remembered that the defendant
in this case had elected to pay indemnity costs up to the date of
acceptance even when the possibility was still there that he may
only incur standard costs should the final award be less favourable
than the offer. So long as the offer has not been withdrawn, and
the risk of indemnity costs being incurred continues, there cannot
be any reason why the court would disallow acceptance at any stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     For
the reasons given above, I held that the OTS had not expired on 24 September 2013
and it was therefore validly accepted by the defendant on that date.
Accordingly I gave the declarations prayed for in this summons.</p>
