        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the Law Society of
                    Singapore (“the Law Society”) made under s 98(1) of the Legal
                    Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) for
                    Mr Andre Ravindran Saravanapavan Arul (“the Respondent”) to
                    show cause as to why he should not be dealt with pursuant to s 83(1) of the
                    LPA. The Law Society’s application arises from the findings of the
                    disciplinary tribunal (“the DT”) that the Respondent was guilty of
                    the disciplinary offence of overcharging his client in a manner which amounted
                    to grossly improper conduct within the meaning of s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA, and that cause of sufficient gravity for
                    disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the LPA: see <em>The Law Society of Singapore v Andre Ravindran Saravanapavan
                        Arul</em> [2011] SGDT 2 (“the
                Report”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Respondent is an advocate and solicitor of
                    the Supreme Court of 22 years’ standing. He is the sole proprietor of the
                    law firm known as “M/s Arul Chew &amp; Partners”
                    (“ACP”). He has had in his employment for the last ten years or so
                    one Adrian Kho Ngiat Sun (“Kho”). Kho graduated with a law degree
                    from the National University of Singapore and subsequently passed the Practical
                    Law Course. He was qualified to be admitted to the Bar as he had also served his
                    pupillage as required by the LPA. However, he did not hold a practising
                    certificate. In fact, he was working as a paralegal in ACP at the material
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The complainant is Management Corporation Strata
                    Title Plan No 1886 (“MCST 1886”), a body corporate
                    constituted to manage the condominium known as “West Bay
                    Condominium” at 58 West Coast Crescent, Singapore 128039. At all
                    material times, MCST 1886’s Management Council chairman was
                    Mr Jaffar bin Hassan (“Mr Hassan”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 14 December 2007, Chew Swee Siong
                    (“Chew”), an employee of MCST 1886’s managing agent,
                    confessed to misappropriating about $2m of MCST 1886’s funds. In
                    January 2008, a mutual friend of Mr Hassan and the Respondent recommended
                    the Respondent to Mr Hassan, and this led to MCST 1886 appointing the
                    Respondent as its solicitor to recover the misappropriated moneys from Chew, his
                    accomplices and others who might be held responsible for the losses suffered by
                    MCST 1886, including its auditors and its bankers (“the intended
                    defendants”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 30 January 2008, MCST 1886 signed
                    the Respondent’s warrant to act captioned “Misappropriation of the
                    MCST’s funds and bank accounts and all related and/or ancillary matters
                    and in respect of general advice on legal matters of the MCST 1886 (West
                    Bay Condominium)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (“the Warrant to
                    Act”). The Warrant to Act stated that the hourly charge rate was $450 for
                    the Respondent and $350 for Kho. It was silent regarding Kho’s status as a
                    paralegal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       From 25 July 2008 to 13 May 2009, the
                    Respondent rendered nine bills to MCST 1886, three of which form the
                    subject of the amended primary charge against the Respondent for overcharging.
                    These three bills (“the Bills”) totalled $226,308.12 and their
                    details are as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       By December 2008, MCST 1886 had paid
                    $109,297.35 (including Disbursements Bill No 0096 of 2008 for $572.35)
                    towards payment of the Bills.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> On 23 February 2009,
                    MCST 1886 discharged the Respondent as its solicitor because of the slow
                    progress in the recovery of its losses and also because of the quantum of the
                    Respondent’s charges. It was not disputed that up to the date of the
                    Respondent’s discharge as MCST 1886’s solicitor, he had not
                    sent out any letter of demand to any of the intended defendants. On 21 May
                    2009, MCST 1886 complained to the Law Society that it had been grossly
                    overcharged by the Respondent for the amount of work he and Kho had done (for
                    ease of discussion, references hereafter to work done by the Respondent should
                    be read as including work done by Kho). This complaint resulted in the
                    proceedings before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The amended primary charge based on
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA, of which the
                    Respondent was found guilty, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [the Respondent], are charged that between 25 July 2008 and

                        Singapore 069113, you did charge one [MCST 1886] a total fee of
                        $226,308.12 (including S$572.35 for disbursements) for work done by you as
                        its solicitor for the period 23 January 2008 to 23 February 2009,
                        as evidenced by your Interim Bill No. 0094 of 2008 dated 7 August
                        2008, your Disbursement Bill No. 0096 of 2008 and Bill No. [0]042
                        of 2009 dated 13 May 2009, which fee was far in excess of and
                        disproportionate to what you were reasonably entitled to charge for the
                        services you rendered to MCST 1886, and such overcharging by you
                        amounts to a breach of Rule 38 of the Legal Profession Professional
                        Conduct Rules, and you have thereby breached a rule of conduct made by the
                        Council under the provisions of the [LPA] as amounts to grossly improper
                        conduct in the discharge of your professional duty within the meaning of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Respondent was charged alternatively that

                    within the meaning of s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the LPA.
                    The amended alternative charge provides as follows:</p>

                        as evidenced by your Interim Bill No. 0094 of 2008 dated 7 August
                        2008, your Disbursement Bill No. 0096 of 2008 and Bill No. [0]042
                        of 2009 dated 13 May 2009, which fee was far in excess of and

                        meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the [LPA].</p>

                        s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the LPA, the DT stated that
                    since it had found the Respondent guilty of the amended primary charge under
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA, it was not
                    necessary to make a finding on the amended alternative charge. Nevertheless, it
                    expressed the opinion that it was satisfied that the Law Society had proved
                    beyond reasonable doubt that the amended alternative charge had been made out as
                    well (see [93] of the Report).</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DT hearing and the DT’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The DT heard the parties over three days from
                    25 October 2010 to 28 October 2010. The witnesses for the Law Society
                    were Mr Hassan, who testified on the legal work done by the Respondent, and
                    Mr Peter Cuthbert Low (“Mr Low”), who testified as an
                    expert on the value of the Respondent’s legal work. The Respondent
                    testified as to the nature of the work done by him, and Mr Sivakumar
                    Vivekanandan Murugaiyan (“Mr Murugaiyan”) testified as an
                    expert witness on the following issues:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     how legal fees are

                        practice of requiring a warrant to act as well as the terms

                        include time spent by support staff and paralegals; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether the Respondent’s
                        charge-out rate was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Murugaiyan was
                    not asked to opine on what would have been a reasonable fee for the
                    Respondent’s work. The Respondent’s defence to the amended primary
                    and alternative charges was that he had rendered the Bills on the basis of his
                    and Kho’s respective hourly rates as set out in the Warrant to Act (which
                    the Respondent had signed after due deliberation).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is not necessary for us to go into the
                    detailed evidence adduced by both parties before the DT. A number of irrelevant
                    issues were raised, such as whether MCST 1886 was informed that Kho was
                    only a paralegal (the DT found that it was not informed (at [57] of the Report))
                    and whether Kho’s hourly rate of charge of $350 was too high (the DT found
                    that it was high but did not determine what rate would have been reasonable (at
                    [60]–[61] of the Report)). The material issue was whether the total fee of
                    $226,308.12 charged for a 13-month period of preparatory work (including
                    attending to clients, seeking information from the police, answering queries,
                    researching the law and giving legal opinions, <em>etc</em>), which did not result in any letter of demand being sent to the
                    intended defendants, was grossly excessive. In this connection, the
                    Respondent’s evidence that he had prepared a draft statement of claim
                    which he said he had not shown to Mr Hassan or any representative of
                    MCST 1886 during a meeting with them was rejected by the DT (at [78] of the
                    Report).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Law Society analysed the timesheets
                    produced by the Respondent and was able to point to a number of inconsistencies
                    in the entries. In some cases, the time periods for which the Respondent charged
                    MCST 1886 could not be reliably matched to either the work items in the
                    Bills or contemporaneous documents. On the other hand, the Respondent was able
                    to show that the timesheets had omitted a number of items of work which had been
                    recorded in his files. In effect, the Respondent did not keep proper timesheets
                    for the work done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After the hearing concluded, the DT considered
                    the evidence and found (at [76] and [79] of the Report) that the only
                    substantive work which the Respondent had done to progress the matter was
                    limited to three legal opinions rendered to MCST 1886, and that the total
                    of 570 hours spent on the case by the Respondent (at 260 hours) and Kho (at 310
                    hours) was “exceptionally astronomical and totally unjustified”
                    (at [79] of the Report).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With respect to the value of the work done by
                    the Respondent, the DT accepted Mr Low’s expert evidence that a sum
                    of around $75,000 would have been an “eminently reasonable [sum]”
                    (at [90] of the Report) to charge MCST 1886 (adding 10% if the alleged
                    draft statement of claim had indeed been prepared). Accordingly, the DT found
                    that the Respondent’s conduct in claiming a total sum of $226,308.12 in
                    the Bills amounted to gross overcharging as that sum was more than 300% of what
                    the work done was worth (at [90] of the Report).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The show cause proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Before us, the Respondent accepted
                    unequivocally the DT’s decision on the amended primary charge under
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA that he had grossly
                    overcharged MCST 1886 for the amount of work he had done. He also accepted
                    “in large part”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> the DT’s finding that his
                    services comprised mainly the rendering of the three legal opinions mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above, with much of the other work
                    taking the form of liaison work and the sending of chasers. He further accepted
                    the following shortcomings on his as well as ACP’s part:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     the recording of timesheets fell
                        short of the desirable level of detail and particularity (in mitigation, the
                        Respondent said that this was because ACP was a small firm and did not have
                        timesheet accounting software);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Bills did not expressly set out a sufficient
                        breakdown of the time spent and the work done; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Respondent should have proposed to
                        MCST 1886 that his bills for the work done in respect of its matter be
                        taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In his written submissions, the Respondent
                    apologised unreservedly to MCST 1886 and to this court for these
                    shortcomings, and expressed his remorse by accepting the amended primary charge
                    against him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> He also stated his intention
                    (and this was reiterated to us at the hearing) to refund to MCST 1886 the
                    sum of $33,725, which is the difference between the amount paid by
                    MCST 1886 up to the time of the disciplinary proceedings (<em>viz</em>, $109,297.35) and the sum of $75,572.35 (comprising
                    the sum of $75,000, which the DT had found to be a reasonable quantum for the
                    work done (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), and
                    disbursements of $572.35).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the circumstances, the only live issue
                    which we have to decide in the present case is the appropriate sanction to
                    impose on the Respondent. Counsel for the Law Society, Mr Philip Fong
                    (“Mr Fong”), argued that the Respondent’s conduct was
                    egregious in the light of the DT’s findings as to: (a) the quantum of
                    gross overcharging which the Respondent was guilty of; (b) the
                    Respondent’s failure to inform MCST 1886 that Kho was a paralegal and
                    not an advocate and solicitor; (c) Kho’s high hourly rate of charge;
                    and (d) the improperly maintained timesheets. However, Mr Fong
                    accepted that it was not the Law Society’s case that the
                    Respondent’s conduct had been dishonest, or that he had fabricated bills
                    for work which had not been done, or that he had cheated MCST 1886. Rather,
                    the Law Society’s case was that the Bills simply could not be justified by
                    the amount and the nature of the work done. In other words, the Respondent had
                    charged for a lot of work which would not have been necessary had he conducted
                    the matter efficiently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For these reasons, Mr Fong submitted that
                    the sentence of a suspension from practice for nine months would be appropriate.
                    He referred to the following precedents where solicitors had been suspended from
                    practice for the gross overcharging of clients: <em>Re Lau Liat
                        Meng</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 186, <em>Re Han Ngiap
                        Juan</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 135 and <em>Law Society
                        of Singapore v Low Yong Sen</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 802
                        (“<em>Low Yong Sen</em>”). In these three
                    cases, the court had imposed suspension periods of three to six months for this
                    disciplinary offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In rebuttal, counsel for the Respondent,
                    Mr Francis Xavier SC (“Mr Xavier”), submitted that
                    the DT’s findings –
                    <em>viz</em>, that MCST 1886 had not been informed of
                    Kho’s status as a paralegal, that Kho’s hourly charge rate was high
                    and that the Respondent’s claim to have drafted a statement of claim was
                    dubious – should all be disregarded by the court in determining the
                    appropriate penalty to impose as these matters were not part of the statement of
                    the Law Society’s case against the Respondent, who thus had no notice that
                    these specific matters formed part of the allegations against him. He further
                    argued that if, as the DT found, a sum of around $75,000 was a reasonable fee
                    for the work done by the Respondent, there would still be a buffer to be crossed
                    before the fee charged by the Respondent became grossly excessive. He also
                    pointed out that the Respondent had in fact written to MCST 1886 twice in
                    October 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> reminding it about
                    his proposal for an agreed fee of around $220,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> for an eight-day High Court
                    trial (which proposal was not accepted by MCST 1886). The Respondent had
                    even stated that his costs charged on an hourly basis (for the period from
                    19 March 2008 to 30 September 2008 alone) had already reached
                    $110,998.29, effectively indicating to MCST 1886 that the proposal of an
                    agreed fee of around $220,000 was a much better bargain for it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> However, MCST 1886 never
                    signed the fee agreement proposed by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Xavier thus submitted that in the
                    circumstances of this case, a “hefty fine” combined with a censure
                    would be an appropriate sanction for the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">New sanction of a monetary penalty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     This is an important case for the legal
                    profession as this is the first time that a solicitor has been found guilty of
                    gross overcharging since s 83(1) of the LPA was amended in 2008 to provide
                    for the additional sanction of a monetary penalty for disciplinary offences
                    committed by solicitors. Prior to that amendment (which came into effect on
                    1 December 2008), the court could only strike off an advocate and solicitor
                    from the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court, suspend him from
                    practice for a period not exceeding five years or censure him. As pointed out by
                    Prof Tan Yock Lin in his article, “Sentencing for Legal Professional
                    Misconduct” (2000–01) 21 Sing L Rev 62 (at
                    pp 66–68), the lack of the power to impose a fine could result in
                    disproportionate punishments being imposed on errant solicitors. This point was
                    noted by the Committee to Develop the Singapore Legal Sector (chaired by
                    V K Rajah JA) in its report published in September 2007 (at
                    para 4.20), and its recommendation (at para 4.33 of the same report)
                    led to the then version of s 83 of the LPA being amended by the Legal
                    Profession (Amendment) Act 2008 (Act 19 of 2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The amended version of s 83 of the LPA
                    provides as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Precedents for penalising overcharging</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     An important point which we need to address in
                    the present proceedings is the status of past precedents where solicitors were
                    suspended from practice for the disciplinary offence of overcharging. We
                    consider, first, the three precedents relied upon by counsel for the Law Society
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>). In <em>Re Lau Liat Meng</em>, the Court of Three Judges found the solicitor
                    guilty of grossly improper conduct in overcharging his client by billing a total
                    of $23,000 (for professional fees) and $604.60 (for disbursements) for work done
                    in connection with obtaining letters of administration for an estate with
                    $68,394.53 in assets. The expert in that case assessed the proper fee as being
                    “at the most $4,000” (at [11] of <em>Re Lau Liat Meng</em>). The
                    court suspended the solicitor from practice for three months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Re Han Ngiap
                        Juan</em>, the Court of Three Judges likewise suspended the solicitor
                    from practice for three months for grossly improper conduct in overcharging his
                    client. The solicitor had billed his client $6,725 for acting in the purchase of
                    a property and $3,000 for filing an application for the lapsing of a caution
                    when the prescribed fees were only $1,975 and $100 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, in <em>Low Yong
                        Sen</em>, the Court of Three Judges found the solicitor guilty of
                    overcharging his client by charging disbursements of $4,300 when the fair amount
                    was $1,385.62. Although the overcharged sum was not large in absolute terms, it
                    was about 210% of the fair amount, and four of the disbursement items were
                    overcharged (egregiously, in our view) by 346%, 598%, 600% and 855%
                    respectively. More importantly, the court had particular regard to the
                    subterfuge which the solicitor resorted to (by way of charging the inflated
                    disbursements bill through a third party), and found such misconduct to border
                    on dishonesty (at [41] of <em>Low Yong Sen</em>). Another aggravating factor which the
                    court took into account was that in 2006, the solicitor had been fined $7,500 by
                    the Council of the Law Society on each of three charges of overcharging and
                    reprimanded on two other charges of overcharging. Considering all these factors,
                    the court suspended the solicitor from practice for six months. In our view, all
                    these precedents have to be reconsidered in the light of the new punishment
                    regime under the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The nature of the disciplinary offence of overcharging</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Allegations of overcharging of fees for
                    professional work are not infrequent in the services sector. This is
                    particularly true in the legal and the medical professions, where there are no
                    prescribed fees for certain kinds of services (like advocacy or surgery) as
                    these services are highly dependent on personal skills and their benefit to the
                    client or the patient concerned may not be quantifiable in terms of money.
                    Furthermore, overcharging may also occur because a lawyer with an inflated idea
                    of his own legal knowledge or forensic skills may think that his work is worth
                    more to the client than what the client thinks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It should be noted that in some jurisdictions,
                    overcharging of legal fees may not amount to a disciplinary offence where the
                    client has agreed to a fixed fee for a specific job or transaction (<em>eg</em>, to give a legal opinion or to conduct a trial),
                    however exorbitant or unreasonable the fee might appear to a third party or
                    another solicitor. In Australia, for instance, it would appear that a barrister
                    or solicitor is entitled to charge what the market can bear (<em>ie</em>, what the client is prepared to pay) and the court will not
                    inquire into the exorbitance of a contractually agreed fee in any disciplinary
                    proceedings for overcharging (see <em>D’Alessandro v Legal
                        Practitioners Complaints Committee P9/1996</em> [1996] HCA Trans 300
                    (9 August 1996) <em>per</em> Toohey J). In
                    contrast, the legal position in Singapore, which is governed by s 109 of
                    the LPA (for non-contentious business) and s 111 read with s 113 (for
                    contentious business), is that the court or the judge may cancel any agreement
                    on costs which is unfair or unreasonable (see the observations of the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Lin Jian Wei and another v Lim Eng Hock
                        Peter</em> [2011] 3 SLR 1052 at [25]–[26]).
                    Nevertheless, even if the court or the judge were to cancel an agreement on
                    costs on the ground that it is unfair or unreasonable, it does not necessarily
                    follow that the overcharging by the advocate and solicitor would constitute
                    grossly improper conduct (see further <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We should add that where fees are charged on a
                    time basis, overcharging can also occur even where the client has agreed to the
                    tariff of charges (as in the present case, where the tariff set out in the
                    Warrant to Act was $450 per hour for the Respondent and $350 per hour for Kho)
                    if the number of hours billed for has been inflated or if work unnecessary to
                    achieve the purpose of the retainer has been billed for. This is because while
                    the client has contractually agreed to the tariff of charges, he has not agreed
                    to the number of hours which he may be charged for. He trusts his solicitor to
                    bill fairly for the time taken to work on his matter, and rules of professional
                    conduct are in place to prevent that trust from being abused by unethical
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Rule 2(2)(<em>c</em>) of the LP(PC)R provides that every advocate and solicitor is
                    obliged to “act in the best interests of his client and to charge fairly
                    for work done”. What is a “fair” charge depends very much
                    on all the circumstances of the case, including the standing of the lawyer
                    concerned, the nature of the legal work, the time spent on the work, <em>etc</em>. Different lawyers will have different opinions
                    about their professional worth. Similarly, different clients will have different
                    opinions on the professional worth of the same lawyer. As a general concept, a
                    fair charge is merely a general guide to a lawyer not to grossly overcharge his
                    client to the extent that it will “affect the integrity of the
                    profession” (see r 38 of the LP(PC)R (reproduced at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above)). The corollary of the integrity of
                    the legal profession being undermined is that the entire profession will be
                    brought into disrepute. Gross overcharging will create a reaction or perception
                    from the public that lawyers are merciless parasites, and that will produce a
                    stain on the noble nature of legal services.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Taxation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Even where a bill rendered by a solicitor is
                        <em>prima facie</em> excessive, any potentiality of the
                    solicitor’s conduct in rendering that bill being regarded as professional
                    misconduct in the form of overcharging can usually be remedied or ameliorated by
                    an offer to have the bill taxed (if it is taxable) under the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (in this regard, see <em>The Law Society of Singapore v Tan Thian Chua</em> [1994]
                    SGDSC 11 at [5], where the solicitor was
                    merely reprimanded and ordered to pay the costs incurred by the Law Society in
                    the disciplinary proceedings as, <em>inter alia</em>, his
                    bill, although excessive, had been accompanied by an offer of taxation in the
                    first place). Taxation provides the best means for an aggrieved client to
                    determine what the proper fee is for the actual work done by his lawyer, and for
                    the lawyer to avoid having to face a disciplinary charge for overcharging. If
                    the bill is not taxable, the prudent course is for the solicitor to negotiate a
                    mutually acceptable amount or even offer mediation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the present case, the Respondent did not
                    offer to have his bills for the work done in respect of MCST 1886’s
                    matter taxed. If he had done so, the DT might well have concluded that his
                    overcharging (albeit “gross” because of the amount or percentage
                    of overcharging involved) did not constitute grossly improper conduct since he
                    did not have the intention to overcharge (<em>ie</em>, he
                    did not intend to charge more than what he would have received had his costs
                    been taxed). If the Respondent had offered taxation and MCST 1886 had
                    refused, then it would have been more difficult for the DT to have found that
                    the Respondent had overcharged MCST 1886 in a manner which amounted to
                    grossly improper conduct. All solicitors should act on the basis that they can
                    have their bills of costs taxed under the law, and they must remember that many
                    clients do not know this. Accordingly, they have an obligation to inform their
                    clients of this option, and they fail or omit to do so at their peril. A
                    solicitor who offers to have his bill of costs taxed is, in our view, unlikely
                    to have the frame of mind or intention to overcharge his client.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proportionate sanctions for overcharging</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It can be seen from the foregoing discussion
                    (especially at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above) that not all
                    cases of overcharging amount to grossly improper conduct. As the Court of Three
                    Judges in <em>Low Yong Sen</em> stated at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>We recognised that not every instance of
                            overcharging would constitute grossly improper conduct</em>. In
                            <em>Re Han Ngiap Juan</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R)
                        135, the court of three judges constituted under the LPA stated (at
                            [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Obviously not every case of overcharging will constitute grossly
                            improper conduct. Inevitably there will be some diversity of opinion as
                            to what would or would not be correct in each case, and where the line
                            ought to be drawn. The passages quoted from [the case of <em>Re Lau Liat Meng</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 186]
                            indicate clearly that the extent to which a client is overcharged is a
                            very strong factor against an advocate and solicitor accused of
                            overcharging amounting to grossly improper conduct under
                                s 83(2)[(<em>b</em>)] of the [LPA], and
                            this must be so whether or not there is any allegation of dishonesty or
                            deceit. In our view, while this may not be a conclusive factor, it is a
                            very material one, and the more a client is overcharged, the harder it
                            will be for the advocate and solicitor concerned to persuade the court
                            that the explanation he gives does justify the overcharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, in cases where overcharging does amount to grossly improper
                    conduct, whilst all such instances of overcharging are punishable as
                    disciplinary offences, not all are deserving of the penalty of suspension from
                    practice, much less of disbarment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The case precedents show that prior to
                    1 December 2008, solicitors who were found guilty under the then version of
                    s 83 of the LPA of grossly improper conduct arising from overcharging
                    clients were punished either by censure or suspension from practice. In our
                    view, as most of those cases were of too serious a nature to merely merit
                    censures, the court had no choice but to suspend the solicitors concerned from
                    practice for periods ranging usually from three to six months. In many of those
                    cases, there was also evidence of some degree of deception, dishonesty or
                    unfairness by the solicitors in taking advantage of the ignorance of their
                    clients. In those circumstances, the only punishment that would meet the
                    requirements of just deserts, deterrence and the protection of public confidence
                    was suspension from practice. A censure would not have been a sufficient
                    sanction. Indeed, the case of <em>Low Yong Sen</em> shows
                    that a censure would often just be water off a duck’s back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The current regime provides for a new penalty
                    in the form of a maximum fine of $100,000. This penalty was introduced to enable
                    the Court of Three Judges to impose fines for disciplinary offences that are too
                    serious to be punished with mere censures, but insufficiently serious to deserve
                    the punishment of suspension from practice. In our view, the disciplinary
                    offence of overcharging amounting to grossly improper conduct falls within this
                    category of disciplinary offences, provided no deception or dishonesty is
                    involved. We hold that the starting point in imposing a proportionate penalty
                    for overcharging amounting to grossly improper conduct should be a fine in the
                    first instance, and not a suspension of the errant lawyer from practice. A fine,
                    especially a heavy fine, together with payment of the disciplinary
                    tribunal’s and the Law Society’s costs in the proceedings, should
                    generally be an adequate punishment for the errant solicitor. Repeat offenders
                    will, of course, be penalised more severely. In this regard, we note the
                    observations of this court in <em>Low Yong Sen</em> (at
                        [38]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… overcharging may seem to be a minor transgression when compared
                        to the case of a solicitor who commits a breach of trust of a client’s
                        money … But the harm done by such misconduct can be far more
                        insidious and prolonged. Whereas the dishonest lawyer who absconds with his
                        client’s money would likely be found out soon enough and be disbarred,
                        and thus prevented from further cheating any future clients, the solicitor
                        who systematically overcharges by small amounts and is not discovered over
                        an extended period can potentially defraud a large number of clients. We
                        must therefore not condone an act of overcharging merely because it involves
                        a small sum as ultimately, what is at stake is of far greater importance
                        – the integrity and standing of the profession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Nevertheless, we also note that these
                    observations were made in the context of a punishment regime under which the
                    court had no power to fine the errant lawyer. Under the current regime, the
                    court has the power to impose a fine of up to $100,000. This is a not
                    inconsiderable sum for many lawyers, especially sole proprietors whose annual
                    net income might not even reach this amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Of course, if the gross overcharging in
                    question is redolent of cheating or deceiving the client, the penalty for such
                    unprofessional conduct may be enhanced to suspension from practice. One example
                    of such unprofessional conduct can be found in <em>Re Han Ngiap
                        Juan</em>, which involved conveyancing fees based on a prescribed
                    scale that was or should have been known to the solicitor concerned. Yet, the
                    solicitor charged a fee well in excess of the scale charges. He also appeared to
                    have tried to take advantage of an ignorant client by charging $3,000 for
                    routine work that was estimated to cost only about $100. Another example is the
                    case of <em>Low Yong Sen</em>, where the solicitor set up a
                    fig leaf arrangement with a third party to camouflage the fact that he was
                    benefiting from inflated disbursement charges (see <em>Low Yong
                        Sen</em> at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the most egregious cases where cheating is
                    involved (such as where there are fabricated bills or invoices for work which
                    has not in fact been done), the penalty may even be enhanced to striking the
                    solicitor off the roll. In this connection, it is necessary to note that counsel
                    for the Law Society has not brought to our attention any disciplinary case in
                    the Commonwealth where a lawyer has been struck off the roll or disbarred for
                    the disciplinary offence of overcharging clients without more. The nature of
                    this disciplinary offence would not normally, in our view, call for such a
                    drastic punishment when the penalty of suspension from practice is
                    available.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Reverting to the present case, there was no
                    allegation that the Respondent cheated MCST 1886 or fabricated any bills.
                    Further, the Law Society’s position was that the Respondent’s
                    conduct leaned more towards being unethical rather than dishonest. As mentioned
                    above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>, the material issue before the
                    DT was whether the total fee of $226,308.12 charged for the Respondent’s
                    work was grossly excessive. An objective evaluation by Mr Low (the Law
                    Society’s expert witness) concluded that it was, and that a sum of around
                    $75,000 instead would have been a reasonable fee. The DT accepted
                    Mr Low’s evidence (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                    above). We see no reason to disagree with the DT’s decision, even though
                    we would have been prepared to accept an even lower valuation of the
                    Respondent’s work. Hence, in determining the appropriate sanction to
                    impose on the Respondent, who has admitted to overcharging MCST 1886 in a
                    manner which amounted to grossly improper conduct, we evaluate the extent of his
                    overcharge by reference to the sum of around $75,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This is an appropriate juncture for us to
                    mention that in future cases involving complaints of overcharging, the Law
                    Society, instead of embarking on an investigation into the complaint without
                    more, should first advise or require the aggrieved party to apply to court to
                    have the bill of costs taxed (where the bill in question is taxable, as in the
                    present case). As alluded to above at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>,
                    taxation is the most objective and conclusive way of determining the amount of
                    fees a solicitor is entitled to. The opinion of another solicitor (called as an
                    expert witness for the Law Society) on the matter, regardless of how eminent he
                    may be, would ultimately still be a personal opinion and, thus, would not have
                    the same degree of objectivity as a taxation done by the court. Further, it can
                    be invidious for a solicitor to give expert evidence on the monetary value of
                    another solicitor’s professional services. For these reasons, we would
                    advise that <em>vis-à-vis</em> future complaints of
                    overcharging, the Law Society should not pursue such complaints without more
                    (not even with the aid of expert evidence) if the bill in question is taxable.
                    Instead, it should advise or require the aggrieved party to have the bill taxed
                    first. The amount of fees awarded by the court upon taxation would then enable
                    the Law Society to assess whether the aggrieved party’s complaint of
                    overcharging merits investigation (see, in this regard, <em>Wee
                        Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R)
                    482 at [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We also suggested earlier (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>) that in the present case, had the
                    Respondent offered taxation to MCST 1886 when the latter expressed
                    dissatisfaction or unhappiness with the quantum of the Bills, these proceedings
                    might never have been necessary and the Respondent might not have ended up much
                    worse off, as he is now. Let this be a morality tale for the edification of all
                    like-minded solicitors in similar situations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Taking into account all the circumstances of
                    the case, including the Respondent’s undertaking to refund the sum of
                    $33,725 to MCST 1886, we make the following orders against the
                    Respondent:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     that he be fined
                    $50,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     that he be
                        censured (for failing to keep proper timesheets, failing to offer taxation
                        and taking, in the proceedings before the DT, an indefensible stance on the
                        amended primary and alternative charges against him); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     that he pay the costs of the Law
                        Society for the proceedings before this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We also
                    affirm the DT’s order that the Respondent pay the Law Society’s
                    costs for the proceedings before the DT.</p>
