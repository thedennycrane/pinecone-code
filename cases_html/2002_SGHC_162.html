<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">INTRODUCTION</font></b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">1.    Melvin Anthony Long and Neo Mei Lan Helena were

married on 14 July 1984. They have three children. After about 16 years, their marriage

failed, and the wife petitioned for a divorce. A Decree Nisi was granted on 21 November

2000. However, for convenience, I will refer to the parties as ‘the Husband’ and

‘the Wife’ respectively. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">2.    At the hearing of the ancillaries, the District

Court made various orders. The Husband is appealing to the High Court against some of the

orders. I set out below only those orders which he has appealed against:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">‘2. The parties shall be entitled to the following

  properties:</p>
<p align="justify">        (a) Chesters</p>
<p align="justify">        (b) Hensman</p>
<p align="justify">        (c) Murdoch</p>
<p align="justify">        in the proportion of 60% to

  the wife and 40% to the husband;</p>
</font><font size="4">
</font></ol>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">But (i) the Chesters property shall be transferred to

  the wife upon her paying the husband 40% of the value (40% of A$225,000)</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">(ii) the husband shall have the option to purchase the

  share of the wife in Hensman by paying the wife 60% of the net value (60% of A$67,000)</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<ol xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">(iii) the wife shall have the option to purchase the

  share of the husband in Murdoch by paying the husband 40% of the value (40% of A$185,000)</p>
<p align="justify">5. The wife shall be entitled to the amount of S$187,000 of the

  husband’s CPF monies in his ordinary account and usual consequential orders as per

  the standard CPF charge terms.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The husband shall pay the wife the amount of S$4,500 a month for the

  maintenance of the three children.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The husband shall pay the wife the lump sum maintenance of

  S$240,000; the amount shall be satisfied from the husband’s share of the three

  properties from the amount due to him by the wife or his share of the sale proceeds; the

  balance shall be in instalments of S$1,000 a month provided that should the husband

  withdraw any monies from his CPF account, he shall pay the wife the balance of the lump

  sum maintenance immediately after such withdrawal.’</p>
</font>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">THE THREE PROPERTIES: CHESTERS, HENSMAN AND MURDOCH</font></p></b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">3.    The District Court granted the Wife 60% of

each of the above three properties Chesters, Hensman and Murdoch in Australia and the

Husband 40% . The reason for this is stated in para 26 of the Grounds of Decision

(‘GD’):</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">‘26 This was a marriage of 16 years. For 9 years

  until 1993, both parties worked full time and they pooled their resources. They operated a

  joint account. They made many joint purchases of assets. After 1993, only the husband was

  working. The wife took care of the home. For a number of years, she alone took care of the

  children in Australia as the husband was working in Singapore. Parties also had the

  assistance of the wife’s family. The indirect contribution of the wife had to be

  given due recognition. All except two of the properties they bought were in joint names.

  Even for the properties in the sole name of the husband, a substantial portion of the

  repayments were made through rentals earned from the properties. The wife, being

  physically in Australia, was managing and maintaining the properties. I also attributed

  the financial assistance obtained by the wife from her family members as her contributions

  to the family. In respect of the financial and non-financial contributions, it would be an

  appropriate case for equal division, whether or not the assets were paid by the wife or

  the husband and whether or not they were in joint or sole name. However, the wife had to

  provide not only for her but also a roof for the three children. I therefore felt it fair

  that she be given a 10% premium in the division in respect of the three real properties in

  Australia.’</p>
</font>
</ol>
<p></p></font><font size="3">4.    Mr M P Rai, Counsel for the Husband,

submitted that the Husband did not dispute that the matrimonial assets should be divided

equally between the Husband and Wife. However, he submitted that the District Court erred

in granting the Wife a further 10% of the three properties. The Wife’s indirect

contributions had already been taken into account in reaching an equal apportionment. To

grant a further 10% was a duplication. The interest of the children of the marriage could

be met by ordering a transfer of one property to the Wife, upon her paying the

Husband’s share, which was in fact ordered. There was no reason for the division of

all three properties to be affected.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">5.    Mr Palakrishnan SC, Counsel for the Wife, submitted

that under s 112(2)(c) Women’s Charter, the District Court was entitled to take into

account the needs of the children in the division of matrimonial assets. He submitted that

in arriving at the equal division initially, the District Court had taken into account the

past non-financial contributions of the Wife whereas the further 10% was to take into

account the future needs of the children. There was no duplication.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">6.    He also relied on a lecture given by Justice

Prakash at the Eighth Singapore Law Review Lecture to support his submission.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b><font size="3">THE WIFE’S ENTITLEMENT TO S$187,000 IN THE

HUSBAND’S CPF ACCOUNT</font></b></i></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">7.    Aside from the three properties, the District Court

divided the rest of the matrimonial assets equally, between the Husband and the Wife as

stated in para 26 of the GD which I have cited above.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">8.    As each of the parties had monies in his/her

account with the Central Provident Fund (‘CPF’), the District Court divided

these monies equally and found that the Husband had $187,000 more than the Wife in his CPF

account.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">9.    Paragraph 29 of the GD states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<font size="4"><font size="3"><p align="justify">‘29 …. For the CPF funds, I

  divided the entire balance of both parties in the ordinary, special and medisave account

  equally. As a result, there was an amount of $187,000 which the husband had in (<i>sic</i>)

  access of the wife and I accordingly ordered that this amount be charged against the

  husband’s monies in his CPF ordinary account as the wife’s share of his CPF

  assets. The usual CPF standard clauses on the charge was incorporated.’</p>
</font>
</font></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">10.    However, as it turned out, these two

sentences were not accurate.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">11.    First, the District Court took into account not

only the balance in the respective CPF accounts of the parties. It had also taken into

account the Wife’s shares which had been bought with monies from her CPF account. The

details were as follows:</font></p>

<p></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">12.    Secondly, the Husband’s excess was

S$182,813, say S$182,000, and not S$187,000. This was conceded by Mr Palakrishnan.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">13.    Having said that, I note that the GD had also

listed some monies in the Wife’s bank accounts and the Husband’s. The Husband

had slightly more i.e between S$2,000 to S$2,500 more, depending on the exchange rate of

some of the foreign currencies in the Husband’s bank accounts. However, this could

not account for the difference of $5,000 between $187,000 and $182,000. Besides, the

District Court did not say it had taken the monies in the bank accounts into

consideration. It may also be that the $187,000 figure was a typographical error and

should have read $182,000 instead.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">14.    Accordingly, the $187,000 granted to the Wife

should be amended to $182,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">15.    Besides this point, Mr Rai submitted that the

pre-marital balance in the Husband’s CPF account should not have been taken into

account as matrimonial assets. For this purpose, he relied on <i>Lam Chih Kian v Ong Chin

Ngoh </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7126&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 2 SLR 253</a>. However, there was no evidence about the pre-marital balance in

the Husband’s CPF account and Mr Rai sought leave to adduce fresh evidence in respect

of that balance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">16.    Mr Rai also submitted that monies in CPF accounts

should be treated differently from other matrimonial assets because such monies were

forced savings meant for retirement. Accordingly, he submitted that there should not be an

equal division of the combined monies in the CPF accounts but rather that the Wife should

be entitled to 30% only. For this point, Mr Rai relied on an unreported judgment of

Prakash J in Divorce Petition No 1147 of 1995, <i>Yah Cheng Huat v Ong Bee Lan</i> in

which the wife was granted 30% of the combined monies in the CPF accounts. However, he

accepted that there were other High Court cases in which the wife was granted 50% of such

monies.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">17.    Mr Palakrishnan objected to fresh evidence being

admitted in respect of the Husband’s pre-marital balance in his CPF account. He

stressed that there was a long history of litigation on the present disputes. The Husband

did not raise this point at the first hearing before the District Court on 2 July 2001. It

was only at the adjourned hearing of 4 July 2001, when the District Court was about to

give its decision, that the Husband’s Counsel applied to adduce such fresh evidence

and seek an adjournment. This was refused by the District Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">18.    In addition, Mr Palakrishnan submitted that the

additional evidence would not be material as there was a difference between the old s 106

Women’s Charter and the current s 112 Women’s Charter.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">19.    The current s 112(10) Women’s Charter states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<font size="3"><font size="4"><p align="justify">‘(10)</p></font>    For

  the purposes of this section, "matrimonial asset" means - 

  <blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties

    to the marriage - </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their

      children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for

      household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the

      other party or by both parties to the marriage; and</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one

    party or both parties to the marriage,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has

  been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been

  substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the

  marriage.’ </p>
</font><font size="4">
</font></ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">Section 112(10)(a)(i) is new while s 112(10)(a)(ii) is

similar, but not identical, to the old s 106(5).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">20.    It was submitted for the Wife that the

parties’ monies in their respective CPF accounts had been used to buy an apartment in

Dairy Farm estate in Singapore. Subsequently, that property was sold at a profit and the

monies withdrawn from the CPF accounts were paid back into those accounts. Accordingly the

Husband’s pre-marital CPF monies would still constitute matrimonial assets under s

112(10)(a)(i).</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">21.    As regards the question whether monies in

CPF accounts should be treated differently, Mr Palakrishnan submitted that the <i>Yah

Cheng Huat</i> case was decided under the old s 106 Women’s Charter and in particular

s 106(1), (3) and (4). Under that regime, where the matrimonial asset is obtained through

the sole effort of one of the parties, the court should be inclined towards giving that

party a greater proportion (see the old s 106(4)). However, under the current and

applicable s 112 Women’s Charter, this inclination was done away with. He also relied

on the case of <i>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59755&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 4 SLR 466</a> in which this amendment

was explained by Prakash J herself. At para 30 of the judgment in that case, Prakash J

said:</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘30 The enactment of s 112 in 1996 removed the

  dichotomy which the previous legislation had contained: the difference in approach to the

  division of assets that had been acquired by the joint efforts of the parties from the

  approach taken to the division of those that had been acquired by the sole efforts of one

  of them. In the context of the famous and often analysed s 106, the efforts that resulted

  in any particular asset falling into one category or the other were financial efforts only

  and when it was established that only one party had financed an acquisition, the court had

  to give that party a greater share in that asset. On the other hand, when assets had been

  acquired by joint efforts, the court had a freer hand in dividing them though there was a

  suggestion that the court should divide them equally.’</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">WIFE’S ASSETS WHICH WERE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY

<p></p></font><font size="3">22.    Mr Rai submitted that the District Court

omitted to take into account some of the Wife’s assets in the division of matrimonial

assets:</font><font size="4">

the GD but her jewellery was mentioned at para 20. He submitted that the Australian shares

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">25.    In my view, this claim was a non-starter.

The Wife had offered the furniture to the Husband save for a piano which she had purchased

Husband did not want the physical furniture but the cash instead.</font><font size="4"></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">MAINTENANCE: (A) FOR THE THREE CHILDREN AND (B) THE LUMP

SUM FOR THE WIFE</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">27.    Mr Rai said that the aggregate of S$6,500

per month maintenance for the children (S$4,500) and the Wife (S$2,000) was initially

ordered on 30 August 2000 as interim maintenance pending the hearing of the ancillaries.

At that time, the Husband was employed by a Singapore company Cisco Systems (USA) Pte Ltd.

Although this is a Singapore company, I will refer to it as ‘Cisco USA’ which is

the description used by the District Court. The Husband’s basic salary was S$170,000

per annum. However, the Husband was posted to Sydney to work for Cisco Systems Australia

Pty Ltd (‘Cisco Australia’) with effect from 1 January 2001 and his annual

salary was reduced to A$155,000 per annum. Moreover, even that employment was terminated

effective 16 March 2001 before the District Court’s decision on 4 July 2001. The

Husband said he could not get a job since and he exhibited a few letters from prospective

employers in Australia to support his contention. He was still unemployed as at the date

of the hearing before the District Court.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">28.    The District Court had this to say about

the change of employment at the beginning of 2001 and the termination on 16 March 2001

(see paras 31, 36 to 38, 41 and 42 of the GD):</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">‘31 The husband was working as a Training Manager

  with Cisco when the proceedings started. Before January 2001, he worked in Singapore with

  Cisco USA. In January 2001, he moved to Sydney to work with Cisco Australia. There was

  however no formal contract between him and Cisco Australia and the document produced by

  him to prove his income with Cisco Australia was issued by Cisco USA. On 16 March 2001,

  his employment with Cisco Australia was terminated. No reason was given for the

  termination. The husband’s counsel informed the wife’s counsel of the

  husband’s termination of employment only in May 2001. The letter exhibited as

  evidence of the termination was not a termination letter given to the husband but a letter

  dated 22 May 2001 addressed to "whom it may concern". At the time of hearing, he

  had not found another job despite make various applications.</p>
<p align="justify">36 The wife’s counsel submitted that the circumstances of the

  change and the subsequent termination of his employment were highly suspect. There was no

  formal contract between him and Cisco Australia while there was a very comprehensive

  contract with Cisco USA. The attachment of earnings order took effect from October but he

  changed employer in January 2001. The termination of employment with Cisco Australia took

  effect from 16 March 2001 but notice was not given to the wife’s counsel until May

  2001 and this was after a court hearing in May 2001 ordering him to produce letters from

  Cisco USA and Cisco Australia on his entire remuneration package. The wife also pointed

  out that as late as February 2001, he still had the use of an American Express Corporate

  card from Cisco USA as shown by the credit card statement exhibited. The husband’s

  third affidavit was signed on 16 March 2001, the alleged day his service was terminated

  and that affidavit mentioned nothing about the termination of his employment.</p>
<p align="justify">37 I agreed with the wife that the circumstances concerning the

  husband’s employment status were suspicious.</p>
<p align="justify">38 The husband also blamed the wife for not getting employment in

  Australia and said that the wife could easily get a job because she was a graduate and

  qualified. However, at the same time, he said that it was difficult for him to get (<i>sic</i>)

  at job in Australia ….</p>
<p align="justify">41 I found that many items of expenses given by both parties were

  excessive. They were certainly beyond the parties’ financial abilities. As stated

  earlier, the circumstances surrounding the employment status of the husband were

  suspicious. The husband had not shown that the reduction in his salary and the loss of his

  job were due to circumstances beyond his control. In any event, the husband’s earning

  capacity would be relevant even if he was unemployed. In my view, it was totally

  irresponsible for the husband to suggest in his affidavit that he should not pay any

  maintenance, even for the children, for 12 months since he was unemployed. The children

  would still need to go to school, be fed and clothed even if their father was without a

  job and he could not just leave it to the wife, who had not been working for the last 8

  years, to bear all the expenses of the children. His counsel changed the position during

  hearing and offered A$500 a month until October 2001 and thereafter at A$1,000 a month.</p>
<p align="justify">42 However, even the A$1,000 a month offered by the husband was

  obviously insufficient. ….’</p>
</font>
</ol>
<p></p></font><font size="3">29.    Mr Rai submitted that the District Court

had erred in concluding that the circumstances of the termination of the Husband’s

employment were suspicious. He submitted that the Wife could have checked on the

circumstances but did not do so even though the termination letter mentioned a contact

telephone number and an e-mail address for inquiries. He submitted the burden was on the

Wife to prove her suspicions. He relied on another unreported decision of Prakash J in

Divorce Petition No 202 of 1999, <i>Wong Wai Leng Laura v Yap Thiam Nguan</i>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">30.    Accordingly, he submitted that the maintenance was

exorbitant. He also submitted that even if I was not prepared to accept that the

Husband’s employment had been terminated, the Husband was earning a smaller sum in

Australia than in Singapore.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">31.    Secondly, he submitted that the District Court

should have taken into account the Husband’s debts like his debts to the Singapore

Inland Revenue and his debts to credit card companies.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">32.    Thirdly, he submitted that the District Court

erred in granting a lump sum maintenance of S$240,000 to the Wife based on S$2,000 per

month x 10 years (i.e 120 months).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">33.    The District Court’s reason for the lump sum

maintenance is stated in para 43 of the GD and elaborated in para 44:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘43 As to the maintenance of the wife, I agreed

  with her that she should be given a lump sum maintenance in so far as the husband had the

  resources to pay. The husband had blatantly defaulted in the payment of the interim

  maintenance. It was probable that he would default in future maintenance, especially that

  of the wife.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">44 I calculated the amount of lump sum maintenance to be

  S$240,000, based on the monthly sum of S$2,000 a month for the period of 10 years. The

  husband would receive a certain amount from the share of the three properties in

  Australia. This should be paid over to the wife to satisfy the lump sum maintenance. If he

  did not want to retain the Hensman property, he would have about $190,000 being 40% of the

  value of the three properties at $477,000. If he decided to keep the Hensman property, he

  would have about $123,000, being $190,000 less $67,000, the value net of loan of the

  Hensman property. The balance should then be paid in monthly instalments of S$1,000. He

  had the option of withdrawing his CPF monies when he decided not to return to Singapore

  permanently. When he so withdrew the CPF monies, he should use them to pay the rest of the

  lump sum maintenance. I agreed that other than these sums of monies, he had no other

  substantial assets.’</font></p>
<font size="4">
</font></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">34.    Mr Rai did not dispute the multiplier of

ten years. His submission was that the fear of the Husband failing to pay the monthly

maintenance was not a sufficient reason to warrant an order for the lump sum maintenance.

He relied on an unreported decision of Michael Hwang JC in Divorce Petition No 838 of

1991, <i>Seow Soo Huan v Lauw Boon Pek</i>. There the court declined to order a lump sum

maintenance after citing various factors.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">35.    Mr Rai further submitted that the Husband was

expecting to get something from the three properties which he could use so as to move on

with his life. With the District Court’s order, he would be crippled. Mr Rai stressed

that although the Husband had monies in his CPF account, he could withdraw the monies only

if he was prepared to undertake that he would not work in Singapore again. I would add

that the undertaking is a requirement of the relevant authority before allowing a foreign

worker to withdraw his CPF monies before a specified retirement age. Mr Rai said that the

Husband could not give the undertaking and withdraw his CPF monies as he was still

considering working in Singapore because that was where he had got his highest income of

S$170,000 per annum.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">36.    Mr Palakrishnan urged me to conclude that the

Husband’s relocation to Australia was to thwart the Wife’s efforts to get

maintenance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">37.    Furthermore, the purported termination should not

be accepted at face value. He stressed the following:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) The reasons given by the District Court. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) After the Husband was ordered to produce letters

  from Cisco USA and Cisco Australia on his entire remuneration package, the Husband

  belatedly produced the alleged letter of termination. In addition, notwithstanding the

  alleged letter of termination, he was still obliged to but failed to produce the letters

  on his entire remuneration packages prior to the alleged termination. On this point, Mr

  Rai countered with the Husband’s explanation that as his services had been

  terminated, Cisco Australia had refused to entertain ‘any request for information or

  documents’ (see para 5 of the Husband’s affidavit filed on 11 June 2001). I

  should point out that had the entire remuneration package been disclosed, it would have

  also disclosed the bonuses and stock options, if any, that the Husband had received. The

  quantum of the bonuses and stock options could not be obtained from the terms of

  employment. Moreover, as regards the terms of employment, Cisco USA’s terms were

  disclosed but not Cisco Australia’s. The Husband had alleged that, as far as he knew,

  there was no formal contract with Cisco Australia but Mr Palakrishnan did not accept this

  given the existence of comprehensive terms with Cisco USA.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) The letter of termination was dated 22 May 2001

  although the Husband’s termination was effective 16 March 2001. It was not even a

  termination letter as such, as noted by the District Court. If the termination was

  genuine, the Husband could not be unaware of the termination until May 2001 when he

  disclosed the letter.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(d) It was not known who purportedly signed the alleged

  letter of termination on behalf of the Group Manager, Human Resources.</font></p>
<font size="4">
</font></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">38.    Mr Palakrishnan did not accept that the

burden of proof was on the Wife to prove her suspicions. Rather, it was for the Husband to

establish his allegations. The decision in <i>Wong Wai Leng Laura</i> was because of the

peculiar facts there.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">39.    As for the Husband’s debts, Mr

Palakrishnan submitted that this point had already been raised during arguments for

interim maintenance. Also, the Husband had deliberately failed to pay his Singapore income

tax so as to use it to counter the Wife’s application for maintenance.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">40.    As for the credit card debts, Mr

Palakrishnan pointed out, as an illustration, that one of the statements of account was in

relation to a corporate credit card and not the Husband’s own credit card.

Furthermore, that illustration referred to a statement of account dated 13 February 2001.

It was addressed to the Husband and below his name was the name of the company ‘CISCO

SYSTEMS USA P L’. It was also addressed to Cisco USA’s address. Yet the Husband

was supposed to have ceased being employed by Cisco USA with effect from 1 January 2001.

In addition, Mr Palakrishnan submitted that there was no documentary evidence for some of

the alleged credit card expenses.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">41.    As regards the lump sum maintenance, Mr

Palakrishnan stressed the Husband’s default in paying maintenance even when he was

working for Cisco USA and Cisco Australia. He also submitted that the Husband could give

the undertaking to withdraw the monies in his CPF account as he was not interested in

coming back to work in Singapore. He had not exhibited any letters from potential

employers in Singapore to demonstrate his attempts to find a job here, even though his

highest salary was derived from Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b><font size="3">CURRENCY OF MAINTENANCE</font></b></i></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">42.    Mr Rai submitted that as the expenses of the Wife

and the children were incurred in Australia, the maintenance should have been granted in

the currency of Australia.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">43.    Mr Palakrishnan submitted that the currency of

maintenance had not been raised before the District Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">44.    Furthermore, while he could not dispute that the

expenses were incurred in Australia, he pointed out that the Wife had submitted the

expenses in Singapore currency and she did distinguish between the two currencies in her

affidavits.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">MY DECISION</font>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The three properties</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">45.    Section 112(1) Women’s Charter gives the

court power to order a division of matrimonial assets, when granting or subsequent to the

grant of a decree of divorce, in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">46.    Section 112(2) provides that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding

  whether to exercise its power under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have

  regard to all the circumstances of the case, including …. ’</font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">Various factors are set out, one of which is the needs

of the children of the marriage.</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">47.    However, it is my view that the needs of

the children are taken into account in order to determine the division. It is not correct

to determine the division and then add a premium to take into account the needs of the

children. There was nothing in the lecture given by Justice Prakash which would lead to

such a conclusion. In addition, I do not see why the 10% should apply to all the three

properties. </font>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">48.    In my view, the needs of the children have already

been taken into account when the District Court ordered that the Chesters property be

transferred to the Wife upon her paying the Husband his share. It is not as though the

Wife is unable to pay the Husband’s share unless that share is reduced from 50% to

40%. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">49.    Accordingly, the District Court’s order in

respect of the division of the three properties is varied in that the Wife’s

proportion is 50% and the Husband’s proportion is 50% also. The consequential orders

of the District Court in respect of the three properties remain, subject to the variation

as mentioned.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The Wife’s entitlement to S$187,000 in the

Husband’s CPF account</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">50.    As I have said, the Wife’s entitlement to the

monies in the Husband’s CPF account should be reduced, in the first instance, to

S$182,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">51.    As for the question whether the Husband’s

pre-marital CPF balance should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets, it is true

that in the <i>Lam Chih Kian</i> case, the Court of Appeal considered the post-marital CPF

monies only as matrimonial assets. However, I agree with Mr Palakrishnan that that

decision was under the old s 106 Women’s Charter and that the current s 112(10)(a)(i)

is new.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">52.    In my view, s 112(10)(a)(i) applies to the

situation where the parties’ CPF monies have been used to purchase the apartment in

Dairy Farm estate because the parties were residing there (see para 29 of the Wife’s

Affidavit of Means). Even though this matrimonial home was subsequently sold and the sale

proceeds were used to reimburse the CPF accounts from which the monies had been drawn, the

monies which were returned to the CPF accounts remained matrimonial assets. According to

the Wife, the surplus arising from the profit was used to acquire other matrimonial assets

like:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) a 1991 Ford Falcon</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) a 1974 Mercedes</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) the Chesters Way property (see GD para 13)</font></p>
<font size="4">
</font></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">53.    Although Mr Rai had sought to argue that

not all the monies in the Husband’s CPF account had been used to buy the Dairy Farm

apartment, he was not able to establish this, even if the fresh evidence which he had

sought to adduce had been allowed. That fresh evidence was simply a statement of his CPF

account as at 13 July 1984, one day before the marriage. Besides, his argument might have

been effectively countered by the ‘first in, first out’ principle, but I need

say no more thereon. </font><font size="4"></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">54.    At this stage, I would mention that I

disallowed Mr Rai’s application to adduce the fresh evidence in respect of the

Husband’s pre-marital CPF balance even if I had an unfettered discretion to do so

because:</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) The Husband had had more than ample time to obtain

  such evidence but did not think of doing so until the eleventh hour when the District

  Court was about to deliver its decision. Even then, he did not have the evidence and was

  seeking an adjournment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></p></ol></font><font size="3">(b) If I were to admit such evidence, I would

  have to give the Wife an opportunity to obtain and produce evidence of her pre-marital CPF

  balance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">(c) In any event, the fresh evidence was unlikely to

  make a material difference to the substantive dispute.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">55.    I would also mention that I also disallowed Mr

Rai’s application to adduce fresh evidence as to which party was earning dividends

from shares because that evidence was not material. Indeed, Mr Rai did not attempt to

illustrate its materiality in the course of the substantive arguments. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">56.    As regards the question whether CPF accounts

should be treated differently from other matrimonial assets, I accept Mr

Palakrishnan’s argument that the decision of Prakash J in the case of <i>Yah Cheng

Huat</i> was based on the old s 106 Women’s Charter.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">57.    I am of the view that there is nothing in the

current s 112 Women’s Charter and nothing in the facts before me which would require

me to treat monies in CPF accounts differently from other matrimonial assets which have

been acquired by the sole effort of one of the parties.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">58.    Accordingly, the District Court’s order as

regards the Wife’s entitlement to monies in the Husband’s CPF account is varied

only by reducing the sum from $187,000 to $182,000. The usual consequential orders

regarding a charge thereon remain.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Wife’s assets which were not taken into account by

the District Court</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">59.    As regards the Wife’s insurance policy, she

has to continue paying the insurance premiums on it and she had said it was taken out for

the security of the children in case something happens to her. I am of the view that the

policy need not be taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">60.    The Wife’s Australian shares should be taken

into account. There is a limit as to how far the argument about the children’s

security or welfare should go and it is not as though the Wife is penniless. I round up

the value of the Australian shares to A$20,000 and grant the Husband half the value

thereof i.e A$10,000. The Wife may se-off the A$10,000 against any arrears of or future

maintenance payable for herself. This set-off does not apply to maintenance payable for

the children.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">61.    The Wife’s jewellery is mentioned in para 20

of the GD and was probably taken into account by the District Court before giving the Wife

an equal proportion in the matrimonial assets. In any event, the jewellery is personal to

her and the value is only A$4,000. Furthermore, the Husband’s excess in the bank

accounts comprising S$2,000 to S$2,500 has not been divided into two. I am of the view

that the value of the jewellery need not be divided into two to give the Husband cash in

lieu of jewellery.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Furniture</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">62.    I have already said above that the Husband’s

claim for half of the value of the furniture is a non-starter.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Maintenance: (a) for the children and (b) the lump sum

for the Wife</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">63.    For the reasons given by the District Court and as

elaborated by Mr Palakrishnan, I am of the view that the circumstances relating to the

posting of the Husband to Sydney and the termination of his employment thereafter were

more than suspicious. The posting was engineered by the Husband. Also, if his services

were indeed terminated on 16 March 2001, the termination was also engineered by him. He

did all these things to avoid paying maintenance to the Wife and the children. On this

point, I</font><font size="4"> </font><font size="3">reiterate what the District Court

said in para 7 of the GD i.e that the Husband had said he did see the children regularly

as he did not want to be served with a summons for maintenance enforcement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">64.    I do not agree that, prima facie, it is for the

Wife to prove her suspicions. The decision of Prakash J in the case of <i>Wong Wai Leng

Laura</i> did not go as far as that. In that case, the judge was satisfied with the

husband’s explanations and accordingly it was then the wife who had to establish her

suspicions. It is first for a husband to provide satisfactory evidence to establish that

his posting or termination is bona fide. Likewise as regards his attempts to secure

another job.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">65.    In the case before me, the Husband’s evidence

was far from satisfactory. I do not accept his explanation that it was not possible for

him to get information from Cisco Australia after his services were terminated by them. He

apparently had no difficulty in getting the alleged termination letter from them two

months after the alleged termination. Furthermore, he did not say that he faced a similar

difficulty with Cisco USA. In my view, the Husband did not make any genuine attempt to

obtain letters from either employer on his entire remuneration package. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">66.    As for the debts of the Husband, his liability to

the Singapore Inland Revenue arises from his highest income from Singapore. There was no

suggestion that at that time, he was unable to pay the maintenance and his income tax

which was payable in instalments. There is no valid reason why he cannot pay the tax in

instalments. I am of the view that he did not do so so that he could use this outstanding

debt as an excuse to reduce the maintenance to be paid by him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">67.    As for the credit card debts, he has no business

incurring them if he cannot afford to do so. I also note that some of the debts were

incurred on a corporate credit card.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">68.    As regards the question whether a lump sum

maintenance should have been ordered, the decision of Hwang JC in the case of <i>Seow Soo

Huan</i> was on different facts. There, it was not alleged that the husband was a

persistent defaulter.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">69.    Indeed in <i>Choo Guay Tin v Lee Mong Seng </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61534&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 3 SLR 116</a>, Justice G P Selvam was of the view that a lump sum maintenance was appropriate

where the husband would not make regular payments, provided the husband was able to pay a

lump sum. That was my view too in Divorce Petition No 983 of 1992, <i>Soh Seng Hwee v Paw

Ling Chiang Lina</i>. The only reason why</font><font size="4"> </font><font size="3">I

nevertheless declined to make a lump sum maintenance order in that case was because there

was insufficient evidence before me about the husband’s assets and income and I was

concerned that a lump sum maintenance order might cripple him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">70.    In the present case, I do not have such a fear

because the District Court has directed how the lump sum may be paid i.e with most of it

being paid with the aid of various set-offs and the balance in instalments. I do not agree

with Mr Rai’s submission that the Husband will be crippled because he will not

receive any monies, after the set-offs, from the three properties. As I have said, he has

deliberately failed to obtain letters on his entire remuneration package and he has his

earning capacity. If he is truly jobless, that is by his design.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">71.    The Husband has only himself to blame for the lump

sum maintenance. Even when he was earning his highest income from Singapore, he was in

default of his maintenance obligations.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">72.    On the other hand, I accept that the Husband may

want to work in Singapore in future and hence he is not able to give the requisite

undertaking to withdraw all the monies in his CPF account. The real reason why he has not

sought alternative employment here after May 2001 is, as I have said, because of the

Wife’s legal proceedings. However, again, it is up to him to decide whether to seek

employment in Singapore.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Currency of maintenance</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">73.    I accept that, as a general rule, the currency of

maintenance should be that of the currency of the country where the expenses, for which

maintenance was ordered, were incurred. That country is Australia. No reason was given by

Mr Palakrishnan as to why the Wife should be entitled to list the expenses in Singapore

currency.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">74.    Accordingly, I vary the District Court’s

orders on the currency of maintenance, including the lump sum maintenance, to the currency

of Australia. For the avoidance of doubt, the currency of interim maintenance is not

affected by my order. If any monies has already been received by the Wife in Singapore

currency towards account of maintenance for the children and/or for herself, there is no

need to convert such monies to the Australia equivalent. For this limited purpose, the

Wife will be deemed to have received the monies in Australian currency.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">SUMMARY</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">75.    Accordingly, the District Court’s order is

varied to the extent I have stated. I will hear the parties on costs.</font></p>
