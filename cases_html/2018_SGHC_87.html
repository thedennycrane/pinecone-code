Singapore is also the appropriate forum because the BVI Court cannot effectively supervise the receivers’ conduct in Singapore.

In Suit 966, the plaintiff had sought permanent injunctions restraining the receivers from demanding the books and records of MDWL, and from dealing with the assets of MDWL’s subsidiaries in Singapore. The receivers had submitted to the court’s jurisdiction in Suit 966 on the basis that it had the powers to carry out the very acts challenged under BVI law. By contrast, the plaintiff is claiming in Suit 202 that the receivers had breached their duties, and the defendants are of the view that Singapore is not the appropriate forum to deal with these claims.

</div> The plaintiff’s claim of breach of duty of care by the receivers of MDWL did not have a good prospect of success. It was plain and obvious that no duty of care was owed by the receivers to the plaintiff or the Estate, and in any event, the receivers had not breached any such duty since they had exercised their powers within BVI law. In addition, the losses claimed by the plaintiff were losses suffered by MDWL and not by the plaintiff or the Estate. The plaintiff was hence prevented by the rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span> (1843) 67 ER 189 (“<span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span>”) from seeking damages for the losses suffered by MDWL.

Where a defendant took a step in a previous suit which has since been discontinued, it would not be appropriate to infer that he has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts in a separate fresh suit, notwithstanding that there may be some overlap in the parties and the subject matter of both suits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The following extract from <span class="font-italic">Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments</span> (Informa Law, 6th Ed, 2015) by Professor Adrian Briggs (at para 2.86) is to my mind apt: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has been held that a defendant who … submits to the jurisdiction in respect of the claim set out in the writ does not necessarily submit to the jurisdiction in respect of other claims which, in the exercise of its procedural discretion, the court allows to be introduced by later amendment of the claim. One can see why this ought to be the answer: it would not appear obviously right that if a defendant enters an appearance in relation to a narrowly-drafted claim, he has no opportunity to re-consider his position if the claimant later seeks to add new claims, or if other parties seek to be added to the claim: to put it in homely terms, it does not seem right that a claimant should be allowed to use a sprat to catch a mackerel. On the other hand, a defendant does not have a right to pick and choose which claims in a writ he is prepared to submit to if he has no basis for, and does not make, a jurisdictional challenge … It may be that the best answer is that the court should exercise its rules of procedural law to [prevent] new claims to be added in such a way as to prevent the jurisdiction, originally established … being abused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The plaintiff in this case had sought unsuccessfully to introduce new causes of action through an amendment to her statement of claim in Suit 966.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In the circumstances, it is unjustified to find that the defendants have submitted to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction to determine Suit 202 by virtue of their previous submission in Suit 966. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In a similar vein, the commencement of OS 1074/2016 (to seek recognition of the appointment of the receivers) did not constitute submission to jurisdiction by the defendants. During the hearing for OS 1074/2016, the defendants stated that their application for recognition was not to be construed as a submission to jurisdiction. In my judgment, an express reservation of a right to challenge jurisdiction is immaterial if the step taken, in substance, constitutes a submission to jurisdiction. I did not think however that an application for recognition of foreign receivership (pursuant to common law principles outlined<span class="font-italic"> inter alia</span> in <span class="font-italic">Beluga Chartering GmbH (in liquidation) and others v Beluga Projects (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another (deugro (Singapore) Pte Ltd, non-party)</span> [2014] 2 SLR 815) can be said to amount to such a step. Unlike the filing of a counterclaim or defence, an application for the recognition of the appointment of foreign receivers is not premised on the Singapore courts having jurisdiction over a dispute, which in this case concerns whether the receivers breached any duties owed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As the learned author of <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Litigation</span> (Richard Fentiman, Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2015) states at para 9.10(vi): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A defendant, having acknowledged service of the claim, which applies to contest the court’s jurisdiction, does not submit. Again, until a court exercises jurisdiction, a defendant which expressly maintains its continued challenge to the court’s jurisdiction does not submit by making an application unrelated to the court’s jurisdiction …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I also note that the order in OS 1074/2016 was granted without prejudice to any issues of jurisdiction potentially arising in Suit 202. The recognition of the receivers was subject to the following condition stipulated in the order: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Such powers recognised in paragraphs (a) and (b) are not to be exercised without leave of Court pending the resolution of proceedings in Singapore in relation to the assets and documents covered by paragraphs (a) and (b), including for the avoidance of doubt HC/S 202/2017. This qualification of the powers recognised is not to be taken in itself as a submission by the Applicants to Singapore jurisdiction in respect of those proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I rejected also the plaintiff’s claim that the first and second defendants’ act of entering appearance on behalf of the third defendant constituted submission to jurisdiction. The law is clear that a defendant may enter an appearance and dispute the existence of the court’s jurisdiction in any of the manners set out under O 12 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court, including through seeking the discharge of any order giving leave to serve originating process out of jurisdiction. This is apparent from the wording of O 12 r 7(1) itself and is also made clear in case law (see for instance, <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications </span>at [27]). Therefore, the defendants’ entry of appearance to challenge jurisdiction, including the first and second defendants’ entry of appearance on behalf of the third defendant, cannot be construed as a submission to jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Good arguable case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my judgment, the plaintiff failed to make out a good arguable case that her claim falls within one of the limbs under O 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In order to obtain leave to serve originating process out of jurisdiction, a plaintiff must establish that it has a good arguable case that its claim falls under one of the grounds set out under O 11 r 1.

The practice, where questions of fact are concerned, is to look primarily at the plaintiff’s case and not to attempt to try dispute of fact on affidavit; it is of course open to the defendant to show that the evidence of the plaintiff is incomplete or plainly wrong. On <span class="font-italic">questions of law, </span>however, the court may go fully into the issues and will refuse leave if it considers that the plaintiff’s case is<span class="font-italic"> bound to fail. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In order to show a good arguable case to establish jurisdiction, it is not sufficient for the plaintiff to show that its claim has a prospect of success (<span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span> at [95]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Once a plaintiff satisfies, in relation to jurisdiction, the requirement of “a good arguable case” that the claim falls within one of the grounds under O 11 r 1, the plaintiff must then show that there is a “serious question to be tried” on the merits of the claim (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span>at [14] and [19]; <span class="font-italic">Goodwill Enterprise (Malaysia) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v CT Nominees Ltd (in liquidation) and others</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 330 at [3]; <span class="font-italic">Seaconsar</span> at 767). Thus, the “serious question to be tried” standard is applicable to an examination of the merits of the plaintiff’s claim. On the other hand, the “good arguable case” standard is the standard that has to be met by the plaintiff in establishing that the court has jurisdiction under one of the grounds under O 11 r 1. It is at this stage, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the stage of considering whether a good arguable case has been made out that the claim falls within one of the grounds under O 11 r 1, that questions about the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>of the plaintiff to make the claim, among other things, should be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 However, it is not always necessary to consider the question of whether there is a serious issue to be tried on the merits following a consideration of whether the plaintiff has established a good arguable case that its claim falls within one of the grounds under O 11 r 1. Depending on the ground(s) relied on under O 11 r 1, it may be that the requirement of a serious issue to be tried on the merits would have been proved once the higher standard of proof, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, good arguable case, required to establish jurisdiction is satisfied (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span>at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Seaconsar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 765). Therefore, even though the standard of “serious question to be tried” pertains to the merits of the claim while “good arguable case” pertains to the grounds under O 11 r 1, there may be some overlap between the court’s consideration of the two matters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, a number of issues arose in relation to whether the plaintiff had a good arguable case, namely whether the plaintiff possessed the standing to sue and whether leave to sue was required.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Locus standi</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The plaintiff’s statement of claim (amendment no. 1) stated that the plaintiff commenced the action </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">as a beneficiary of the estate of AVS (the Estate) for her benefit and for the benefit of her 4 children, being all the other beneficiaries as defined by section 7 of the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146).

However, the plaintiff argued that in this case, reverse piercing of the corporate veil was permissible to allow the shareholder, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Estate, to sue for MDWL’s losses. Exceptions to the reflective loss principle were said to be applicable. First, the plaintiff was entitled to sue for MDWL’s losses because MDWL was prevented from suing since it was subject to the control of receivers. If the plaintiff was not entitled to sue, there would be a lack of remedy against the receivers.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my judgment, the plaintiff lacked <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the claim as the beneficiary of the Estate. The case of <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> cited by the plaintiff, which stands for the proposition that a beneficiary could in certain circumstances institute an action to recover the assets of an unadministered estate, was inapplicable. Unlike the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, the plaintiff in the present case sought to recover losses for alleged breaches of duties owed to MDWL, rather than to recover or protect the assets belonging to the deceased which were held on trust for the estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The plaintiff also invoked the principle of reverse piercing. In reverse piercing, it is the shareholder of the company as opposed to a third party such as a creditor or contractor that invites the court to disregard the separate legal personality of the company. In <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck</span><span class="font-italic"> v Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch </span>[2015] SGHC 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck</span>”), I left the issue of whether reverse piercing was legally permissible open, and dismissed the defendant’s application to strike out the statement of claim on the ground that it was an impermissible attempt at reverse piercing (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck</span> at [63]). In <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck</span>, the plaintiff brought a claim in tort against the defendant bank, alleging that the bank had breached its duty of care to him by failing to give him proper investment advice, resulting in losses incurred by him. Strictly speaking, the plaintiff was not the defendant’s client as he had carried out his investments and banking with the defendant through a trust company which the plaintiff had set up for this purpose. The plaintiff thus claimed that the company was his <span class="font-italic">alter ego </span>in its dealings with the defendant. I found in that case that the issue of reverse piercing involved a point of law which merited serious argument. A conclusive determination on the permissibility of reverse piercing was thus not required for the disposal of that striking out application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The present case is distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck.</span> What was relied upon by the plaintiff here was that MDWL was the <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> of the <span class="font-italic">deceased</span>. Even if the claim was brought by the plaintiff in her capacity as administrator of the Estate and therefore <span class="font-italic">qua</span> shareholder of MDWL (which it was not), the defect in standing would not be remedied. This was since any claim as expressed in the pleadings was in respect of a duty, if it existed, owed to the company, and not in this context to the shareholder. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck</span>, where the defendant had provided banking advice directly to the plaintiff,<span class="font-italic"> </span>there could be no assertion of a direct duty owed by the receivers to the shareholder by way of any representation or assumption of responsibility towards the shareholder. There was, as argued by the defendants, nothing specifically pleaded that would support the assertion that there was any such representation or assumption of responsibility to the plaintiff. The pleadings as they stood, and for which leave to serve out of jurisdiction was granted, thus did not adequately show any obligation that could arise if reverse piercing were indeed permitted. Any losses suffered by MDWL could not be claimed by the plaintiff in her capacity as a shareholder through the Estate. The plaintiff’s claim thus infringed the rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span>.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is settled law that leave to serve out of jurisdiction will not be granted under O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) unless the injunction forms part of the substantive relief sought by the plaintiff:<span class="font-italic"> Siskina (</span><span class="font-italic">owners of cargo lately laden on board) and others v Distos Compania Naviera S.A. </span>[1979] 1 AC 210 (“<span class="font-italic">The Siskina</span>”). In other words, an interim injunction is not itself a cause of action and cannot, without a pre-existing cause of action, found jurisdiction under O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The Court of Appeal has in <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another appeal</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) endorsed the holding in <span class="font-italic">The Siskina</span> which it expressed at [37] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The House held that in order for a plaintiff to avail himself of this provision, the injunction sought in the action had to be part of the substantive relief to which the plaintiff’s cause of action entitled him and could not be only an interlocutory injunction that was not founded on a substantive cause of action in respect of which the relief was not sought in England. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62  Therefore, to avail itself of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), any injunction sought had to be part of the substantive relief claimed by the plaintiff. In addition, contrary to the suggestion of the plaintiff, this does mean that a plaintiff may successfully rely on this ground where it had causes of action independent from the interim restrain. Instead, to rely on this ground, the act which the plaintiff sought to restrain the foreign defendant from doing under O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) must amount to “an invasion of some legal or equitable right belonging to the plaintiff in this country and enforceable here by a final judgment for an injunction” (<span class="font-italic">The Siskina</span> at 256). An interim injunction to preserve the state of affairs pending final resolution of the dispute is thus insufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In this case no order to do or refrain from doing anything in Singapore was sought by the plaintiff as a substantive relief arising from the causes of action alleged. The substantive relief sought by the plaintiff was limited to indemnity, recovery of sums, damages and costs.

In addition, in my judgment, any damages incurred were not incurred in Singapore. This is given that in her statement of claim (amendment no. 1), the plaintiff sought damages “arising in the BVI in relation to BVI Claim 101”, and damages for losses (be it arising from diminution in share value, or fees and expenses incurred by the receivers appointed under BVI law) suffered by MDWL, a BVI-incorporated company. These losses were to my mind incurred in the BVI. Likewise, the claim for legal fees incurred in Singapore was not sufficient to fulfil O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii), as that would invariably allow service out of jurisdiction in all cases where leave to serve out of jurisdiction is sought. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Given that the plaintiff lacked <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to bring the claim, she was unable to establish a good arguable case that she had a cause of action against the defendants and that the cause of action arose in Singapore.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">Excalibur Group Pte Ltd v Goh Boon Kok</span> [2012] 2 SLR 999 (“<span class="font-italic">Excalibur Group</span>”), the court held that leave of court was required before a suit may be commenced against a liquidator. The court found that a requirement for leave would ensure that frivolous claims are filtered out to avoid unnecessary and expensive legal proceedings when the main focus of a company and its liquidators once winding-up had commenced should be to prevent the fragmentation of its assets and ensure creditors’ interests are protected (at [28]–[29]). In England, leave of court is required in order to sue a receiver (see <span class="font-italic">In re Maidstone Palace of Varieties, Limited</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1909] 2 Ch 283<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">re Maidstone</span>”)). I agreed with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Excalibur Group</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">re Maidstone </span>and was of the view that the same approach of obtaining leave from the court which appointed the receivers should be applied in circumstances such as the present, where an action is sought to be commenced in a foreign court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff argued that <span class="font-italic">re Maidstone</span> and <span class="font-italic">Excalibur Group</span> stood for the proposition that leave of court was required to commence an action within the same jurisdiction, but that the same proposition did not and should not extend to the commencement of an action in a foreign jurisdiction. I had difficulties finding a rationale for this position. Such a distinction is unjustifiable given that the appointing court has an interest in protecting receivers from having to defend frivolous litigation, whether locally or elsewhere. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Further, contrary to the submissions of the plaintiff, a requirement for leave to sue in such circumstances does not result in the BVI Court being able to confer jurisdiction on the Singapore courts. The effect of a denial or grant of leave by a foreign appointing court on the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts is a separate matter. While the denial or grant of leave by a foreign appointing court to commence action in Singapore is itself not determinative of the Singapore court’s jurisdiction to hear the matter, it may be taken into consideration in the Singapore court’s assessment of whether the plaintiff has established a good arguable case under O 11 r 1 and if Singapore is the appropriate forum for the suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Given my findings above on the defects in the plaintiff’s claim in terms of standing, there were sufficient grounds to set aside the leave to serve out of jurisdiction without having to consider the effect of the absence of leave obtained from the BVI Court to commence action in Singapore. Nevertheless, I found that the absence of leave obtained from the BVI Court was another factor in favour of setting aside the leave for service out of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Serious issue to be tried</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Having found that the plaintiff lacked <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>and could not establish a good arguable case under O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>), it was unnecessary to consider separately whether there was a serious issue to be tried on the merits given that the plaintiff had failed the higher standard of proof required to establish jurisdiction (see <span class="font-italic">B</span><span class="font-italic">radley Lomas</span> at [18]–[19]). Given my findings above, there was no serious issue to be tried on the merits. I should add however, that as the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span> at [20], the evidence required to establish jurisdiction under certain limbs of O 11 r 1 such as O 11 r (1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) may not involve an examination of the merits of the claim. In such circumstances, where the relevant jurisdictional limb is fulfilled, a separate examination of whether the claim involves a serious issue to be tried on the merits would still be required. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Forum non conveniens</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Aside from establishing a good arguable case under O 11 r 1, a plaintiff seeking to serve originating process out of jurisdiction must also satisfy the court that Singapore is the proper forum for the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The plaintiff argued that the central issues are not centred in the BVI and that Singapore is the proper forum for the dispute. The dispute concerns whether the defendants had acted in excess of authority and in bad faith in Singapore. The relevant witnesses for the dispute are in Singapore not in the BVI. These witnesses are the persons against whom wrongful demands were made by the receivers, including HHP and the Singapore Land Authority. Vivek, whom the receivers appointed to work in Singapore, would also be a relevant witness.

The substance of the plaintiff’s allegations predominantly occurred in the BVI. In addition, the various connecting factors point to the BVI being the appropriate forum, as the substantive dispute required the determination of BVI law, especially in relation to the receivers’ conduct of the receivership. Further, proceedings are already underway in the BVI which the plaintiff is entitled to join so as to raise the allegations made here, and there are also other related proceedings pending before the BVI Court. In addition, the key witnesses, namely the receivers and the plaintiff reside outside Singapore, and the only insubstantial nexus is that the assets of MDWL and its subsidiaries are in Singapore. The plaintiff’s concern that she did not have standing to sue in BVI was inoperative now that she has been granted letters of administration and may take the necessary steps to join the Estate as a party to the BVI proceedings.

</div> Furthermore, as the plaintiff had already been involved in BVI 101, and the BVI Court had indicated that it wished to hear from the plaintiff, the plaintiff would likely be able to join as a party. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The test applicable in Singapore for <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> is that laid down in the landmark UK case of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada Maritime Corp</span><span class="font-italic">oration v Cansulex Ltd </span>[1987] 1 AC 460 (“<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test”) (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC v Mineral </span><span class="font-italic">Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1322). The <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test involves two stages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 First, the court determines if there is some other available and more appropriate forum, aside from the Singapore court, for the trial of the action (“stage one”). At stage one, the court considers the relevant connecting factors such as the location of the parties, connection to events and transactions, and applicable law to the dispute, in order to identify the natural forum for the dispute, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the forum which has the most real and substantial connection with the dispute (<span class="font-italic">JIO</span><span class="font-italic"> Minerals</span> at [41]–[42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The court then considers at stage two, whether there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the Singapore court ought to hear the matter notwithstanding that Singapore is not the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> natural forum (“stage two”). Thus at stage two, the court is concerned over whether justice to the parties can be delivered in the natural (foreign) forum though the court ought not to pass judgment on the competence of the judiciary of a foreign country (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In addition, the substance of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test, the objective of which is to determine the forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial, does not differ whether the court is considering a stay application or an application to set aside leave to serve out of jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> at [77]). The burden of proof however differs depending on the nature of the application. Where leave is granted to serve originating process out of jurisdiction, and the defendant seeks to set aside such leave, the burden lies on the plaintiff to establish that Singapore is the more appropriate forum (see <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span><span class="font-italic">Communications</span> at [71]; <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 363 at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Further, it bears noting that the inquiry as to the appropriate forum for the dispute is not to be taken in an overly mechanical manner.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The thrust of the plaintiff’s claim to my mind concerned whether or not the receivers had properly discharged their duties as receivers. The plaintiff argued that the acts which constituted the tort committed by the defendants took place in Singapore, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the place of the tort was Singapore. However, all of the acts alleged were traceable to and carried out in the course of the receivership. Given that the receivers were appointed by the BVI Court in relation to a BVI-incorporated company, BVI was both the place giving rise to the tort and the place in which damages if any were incurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I accept that receivers appointed under one jurisdiction may indeed owe duties in tort, or contract for that matter, in another jurisdiction. However, where matters go to the office and performance of the functions of that office, and such office is created under foreign law, particularly if that creation is by order of court, it is generally more appropriate for any dispute on the duties owed by the receivers to be made in such a forum. In the English case of <span class="font-italic">re Maidstone</span>, the court held that the proper remedy for a party aggrieved by the conduct of a receiver was to commence an action in the court in which the receiver was appointed. The following passage from <span class="font-italic">re Maidstone</span> (at p 286), is to my mind persuasive: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this case the applicant is a receiver appointed by this Court in a debenture-holders' action, and by virtue of that appointment he has had the management of the theatre known as the Maidstone Palace of Varieties. In the course of that management he made use of certain plant which is claimed by the respondent company as their property. They say that he had no right to use it … It appears to me that a dispute of that kind is one which … the Court will deal with itself, and that it will not allow its officer to be subject to an action in another Court with reference to his conduct in the discharge of the duties of his office, whether right or wrong. The proper remedy for any one aggrieved by his conduct is to apply to this Court in the action in which he was appointed. If any wrong has been done by the officer, the Court will no doubt see that justice is done, but no one has a right to sue such an officer in another Court without the sanction of this Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 While the relevant non-appointing court in <span class="font-italic">re Maidstone</span> was not a foreign court, I am of the view that the same principle is applicable where the aggrieved party seeks to commence an action in a foreign court for alleged misconduct of a receiver. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In addition, since the duties owed to the Estate and conduct of the receivers are put into question, I was satisfied that the applicable law is the law of the BVI. The centre of the dispute is really a question of the proper discharge of the receivers’ duties. While the plaintiff referred to activities or actions in Singapore, there is little role for Singapore law to apply here as the conduct of the receivers and scope of the duties owed by the receivers are to be measured against the law applicable to the receivership, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, BVI law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The fact that property in Singapore was involved did not point to Singapore being the more appropriate forum. The nub of the complaint was not about the assets as such but the conduct of the receivership. Title or possession was not in direct issue; thus Singapore land law was not engaged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As for the witnesses, the weight of this factor to my mind is much less than it might have been in the past given the possibility of remote testimony. But in any event, while there may no doubt be witnesses in Singapore, the scope of the dispute would primarily centre on the conduct of the receivers themselves and the plaintiff, who were not witnesses located in Singapore. Witnesses in Singapore are likely to play only a supporting role. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It could certainly be argued that a comparison of the general connecting factors between the proposed forums would result in a neutral conclusion on which is the more appropriate forum, given the greater ease of travel and the possibility of remote testimony, as well as availability of experts of foreign law today. But this does not assist the plaintiff here as she had to show that Singapore is the more appropriate forum. For the foregoing reasons, I found that in fact BVI is the more appropriate forum for the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In relation to stage two of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test, there are no special circumstances which require the Singapore courts to hear the matter notwithstanding that BVI is the natural forum for the dispute. The plaintiff, having been granted letters of administration in Singapore, can join the Estate as a party to BVI 101 and any related BVI proceedings. In relation to the plaintiff’s submission that having the dispute heard in the BVI would result in protracted litigation given that enforcement proceedings would have to be commenced in Singapore for any injunction issued by the BVI courts to be operative in Singapore, I was not satisfied that this was a special circumstance requiring the Singapore courts to hear the matter. The need to commence enforcement proceedings in addition to the main proceedings is a normal occurrence to be expected in all disputes involving cross-border transactions, or disputants domiciled in different jurisdictions. Therefore, this factor alone cannot tip the scale in favour of the Singapore courts hearing the matter in cases where the connecting factors point to the other (foreign) forum as being the natural forum for the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Full and frank disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The defendants submitted that the plaintiff had obtained leave from this court to serve the writ of summons out of jurisdiction without fulfilling her obligation to make full and frank disclosure of material facts to the court. The plaintiff ought to have disclosed to the court that Darsan claims to be the ultimate beneficial owner of MDWL, and that there is presently a suit pending, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Suit 821, to determine his claim. That beneficial ownership of MDWL was being challenged by Darsan should have been brought to the attention of the court, given that it influences the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to commence the present suit.

In relation to the defendants’ claim that the plaintiff ought to have disclosed to the court that Darsan was claiming to be the ultimate beneficial owner of MDWL, Darson had not made such a claim at the time when the present suit was commenced on 3 March 2017, when the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>injunction was obtained on 6 March 2017, or when the order granting leave to serve out of jurisdiction was issued on 9 March 2017. Further, Suit 821 concerns AVS’s claim against Darsan for the return of other assets to AVS, and not the single share in MDWL which Darsan had already transferred to AVS. Darsan had not disputed the transfer of the MDWL share to AVS or made a positive claim for the share. It was only on 15 May 2017 that Darsan commenced an action in BVI claiming title to the MDWL share. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff also denied having misrepresented the effect of the BVI order to the Singapore court. The plaintiff argued that the meaning of the BVI orders was a matter of interpretation which the Singapore court was entitled to undertake on its own. The plaintiff did not know and had no reason to believe that the BVI proceedings were not discontinued on 31 March 2017 when no application to extend the stay of the BVI proceedings was filed by that date. In addition, the defendants had not been fully transparent in sharing the information on the BVI proceedings with the plaintiff and could not subsequently assert that the plaintiff failed to make full and frank disclosure to the court.

In <span class="font-italic">Manharlal, </span>the court stated the following in relation to the duty to make full and frank disclosure (at [78]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Given the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>nature of the application, the applicant <span class="font-italic">must </span>place <span class="font-italic">all </span>material facts before the court can be so satisfied. It goes without saying that this includes facts which are unfavourable to the applicant’s case because the duty to make full and frank disclosure is not merely a matter of fairness between the parties to the action but it is a duty that is owed to the court. It is driven by the need for the court to satisfy itself that the case is a <span class="font-italic">proper </span>one for service out of<span class="font-italic"> </span>jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The duty to make full and frank disclosure is an onerous one and a party may be found to have failed to discharge such duty even if it had not acted in bad faith. As the court noted in<span class="font-italic"> Transniko</span> at [11]—[12], </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 Where an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for leave to serve a writ out of jurisdiction was made, the applicant is under a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all matters material to the application. We need only to refer to the most recent of the cases on this point cited by counsel for the defendants, the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Trafalgar Tours Ltd v Alan James Henry</span> [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 298, where Purchas LJ (with whom Nourse LJ and Beldam LJ concurred) said (at 308) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">there is a heavy duty upon those applying <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>under RSC O 11, r 1 for leave to serve a writ out of the jurisdiction … to make full and frank disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 The duty on the applicant is onerous, and if he fails to discharge it, the leave granted may be set aside even if the non-disclosure is innocent. In <span class="font-italic">Lazard</span><span class="font-italic"> Brothers and Company v Midland Bank, Limited</span> [1933] AC 289, Lord Wright held (at 306–307) that although the failure in that case was not tainted with the slightest suggestion of bad faith, ‘The court has a discretion to set aside an order made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> when the applicant has failed to make sufficient or candid disclosure.’</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In determining what must be disclosed by the applicant, the applicable test is the objective test of materiality, which asks whether the facts in question are matters that the court would likely take into consideration in making its decision on the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> at [68]; <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Vasiliy Golovnin”</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“<span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin</span>”) at [86]). What is material and should be disclosed is essentially a matter of common sense and would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case (<span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [88]). As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [88], citing <span class="font-italic">Commercial</span><span class="font-italic"> Injunctions</span> (Steven Gee, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2004), the duty of disclosure involves striking a right balance between competing considerations: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is often a difficult exercise to settle a suitable affidavit which achieves the <span class="font-italic">right balance</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>between full and fair disclosure and a far too detailed description of the facts, with perhaps too much generosity towards the defendant. The duty of disclosure does not require the applicant to describe his case or the factual background in minute detail, nor does it require him to search for possible but unlikely defences. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis original] </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic"> My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Turning to the facts of this case, considered as a whole, I did not find that any lack of disclosure or misinformation on the part of the plaintiff was so material as to warrant a setting aside of the leave to serve out of jurisdiction on this ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The defendants took particular issue with the following paragraph from the plaintiff’s statement of claim, which they said deliberately misled the court on the status of the proceedings in the BVI: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The BVI Order of 29.11.16 stayed proceedings in BVI Claim until 31.1.17 to give parties liberty to apply. It provided that Shanmuga was granted permission to discontinue the claim after the expiry of the stay. There was no application for a stay nor was there any application for an extension of time to apply for a stay. BVI Claim 101 was therefore discontinued after 31.1.17. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 To my mind the above-quoted paragraph of the statement of claim did not show that the plaintiff had deliberately misled the court knowing that the true status of the BVI proceedings was otherwise. I was satisfied that the plaintiff’s assertion of the discontinuance of the BVI claim in the above-quoted section of the statement of claim was an expression of her own opinion on the status of the proceedings based on her interpretation of the relevant BVI order, though I note that it would have been prudent for the plaintiff to have made that qualification more clearly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In relation to the defendants’ submission that the plaintiff should have disclosed the claim made by Darsan in Suit 821 to the beneficial interest in MDWL, it was not shown that Darsan’s claim to the beneficial interest was within the knowledge of the plaintiff at the time she commenced this action. I was of the view that in any event, this was not a material fact which had to be expressly disclosed during the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application. Neither was I satisfied that the plaintiff’s lack of express reference in the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application to her partial failed attempt to amend the statement of claim for Suit 966 was so material as to cause leave to be set aside on grounds of non-disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Therefore, in my judgment, leave granted to serve out of jurisdiction should not be denied on the ground of lack of full and frank disclosure. However, this was immaterial to the outcome of this application given my findings above that there were other grounds for setting aside the leave to serve out of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other issues</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Letter from the BVI Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 During the hearing for this matter, the defendants referred to a letter of request that was said to have been sent by the BVI Court addressed to the Supreme Court of Singapore, which sought the assistance of the Singapore courts to, amongst others, recognise the appointment and powers of the receivers of MDWL. However, as it turned out, this BVI letter had not been sent out by the BVI Court, at least at the point of the hearing before me.

</div>
</div>
</div> In any event, I did not consider the contents of the letter in determining this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Further arguments after hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 After the oral hearing, and pending my reserved decision, the plaintiff sent in further arguments without seeking leave to do so beforehand. Notwithstanding that, I asked the defendants to respond. These further arguments have been considered and incorporated in these grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 However, I should make clear that this does not absolve the plaintiff from the obligation to ask for leave. As I have reiterated in <span class="font-italic">Re: Zetta Jet Pte Ltd and Others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2018] SGHC 16, once oral arguments have concluded, it is a matter of courtesy at the very least to ask for leave to send in further arguments. In addition, courts would be disinclined to allow further arguments after oral hearings save when good reasons are established, as there must be finality to the process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Having regard to the foregoing, I set aside leave to serve the writ on the defendants out of jurisdiction. I made no order on the application for a declaration that all proceedings in the suit, including the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> injunction, be set aside. Given that the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> injunction was the subject of a separate application under Summons No 994 of 2017, I was satisfied that it should be determined under that application, given that it is a separate mater from the setting aside of leave to serve out of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Costs of $10,000 excluding disbursements were granted to the defendants, with disbursements to be determined. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kanapathi Pillai Nirumalan, Liew Teck Huat and Anand George (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Melvin See Hsien Huei and Yeow Guan Wei Joel <br/>(Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
