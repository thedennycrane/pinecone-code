        George Wei JC:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In
Originating Summons No 399 of 2014 (“OS 399/2014”), Chancery Law
Corporation (“Chancery Law”) seeks to enforce agreements as to costs for
contentious business against its previous client, the Management Corporation
Title Plan No 1024 (“the MCST”). I shall refer to these agreements
as “contentious business agreements”. Provisions relating to contentious
business agreements and their enforcement may be found in ss 111
and 113 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
contentious business agreements relate to Chancery Law’s representation
of the MCST in Suit No 311 of 2012 (“S 311/2012”), Originating Summons
No 569 of 2013 (“OS 569/2013”) and Civil Appeal No 110 of 2013 (“CA 110/2013”).
The latter two are concluded matters. The former is still ongoing,
although Chancery Law has since ceased to act for the MCST in it.
The parties dispute the date and circumstances under which Chancery
Law’s appointment as the MCST’s legal representatives in S 311/2012
was discharged <em>or</em> terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
MCST applied for leave to issue a third party notice to join eight current
or ex-council members of the MCST (“the Council Members”) as third
parties to OS 399/2014. The MCST’s position is that it is entitled
to an indemnity and/or a contribution from the Council Members should
it be liable to Chancery Law for the fees claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On
15 September 2014, the learned assistant registrar granted the MCST
leave to issue the third party notice. The matter before me is Chancery
Law’s appeal against that decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings giving rise
to the contentious business agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Chancery
Law’s application in OS 399/2014 comes on the back of a long-standing
dispute between two rival factions of subsidiary proprietors at
a development managed by the MCST. I shall refer to the two factions
as “the Mok faction” and “the Opposition faction”. At the time when
the dispute took root, the Mok faction had control of the MCST council.
The Opposition faction, on the other hand, possessed a majority
in share value, allowing it to pass resolutions requiring a simple
majority at general meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">S 311/2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On
8 May 2012, the Opposition faction commenced S 311/2012 against
Mr Mok Wing Chong (“MWC”), a previous chairperson of the MCST council
and a member of the Mok faction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
claim is for alleged breaches of MWC’s duties and misuse of the MCST’s
funds in relation to renovation works at the development. MWC issued
a third party notice in S 311/2012 and brought the MCST in as a third
party to the suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Chancery
Law acted for the MCST in S 311/2012. On 12 November 2012, the MCST
council, which was controlled by the Mok faction, unanimously resolved
to appoint Chancery Law as its legal representatives in S 311/2012.
Mr Mok Wai Chung delivered a signed copy of Chancery Law’s standard
letter of engagement and a warrant to act to Chancery Law on 19 November
2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Opposition faction was dissatisfied with this turn of events. It convened
an extraordinary general (“EOGM”) meeting on 5 June 2013 and passed
various motions by ordinary resolution. One of the motions, “Motion 2”,
stipulated that “the appointment of [Chancery Law] as legal representatives
of [the MCST was to] be terminated with immediate effect”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The
then-chairperson of the MCST council, Mr Mok Wai Hoe (“MWH”), who
is MWC’s son, rejected the votes cast in favour of Motion 2 by the
Opposition faction and some other subsidiary proprietors. MWH’s reason
was that the contested votes were cast by the voters when they were in
a position of conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OS 569/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     About
three weeks later, on 26 June 2013, the Opposition faction filed OS 569/2013.
The respondents in OS 569/2013 were MWH and the MCST. The Opposition
faction prayed for an invalidation of MWH’s rejection of the contested
votes in favour of Motion 2, amongst other reliefs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Chancery
Law acted for the MCST in OS 569/2013. On 3 July 2013, the MCST
council passed a resolution appointing Chancery Law as the MCST’s
legal representatives in OS 569/2013. On 17 July 2013, the MCST executed
Chancery Law’s terms of engagement and a warrant to act. The signed
documents were delivered to Chancery Law on 24 July 2013 by hand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On
28 October 2013, a judge of the High Court gave judgment in OS 569/2013
(the decision is reported at <em>Fu Loong Lithographer
Pte Ltd and others v Mok Wai Hoe and another</em> [2014] 1
SLR 218). The judge held that MWH was correct to reject the contested
votes on Motion 2. Allowing the Opposition faction to terminate
the appointment of Chancery Law as the MCST’s counsel in proceedings
where the Opposition faction’s interests were adverse to those of
the MCST would effectively deny the MCST its right to be heard in
S 311/2012. The judge accordingly validated MWH’s rejection of the
contested votes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 110/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In
CA 110/2013, the Opposition faction appealed against, amongst others,
the portion of the judge’s decision validating MWH’s rejection of the
votes cast in support of Motion 2. Chancery Law also acted for the MCST
in the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
Court of Appeal delivered its judgment on 23 May 2014 (the decision
is reported at <em>Fu Loon Lithographer Pte Ltd
and others v Mok Wai Hoe and another and another matter</em> [2014]
3 SLR 456). The Court of Appeal allowed the Opposition faction’s
appeal on the Motion 2 point. The Court of Appeal held at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> that MWH’s
rejection of the contested votes on Motion 2 was invalid. The appeal
was allowed (at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>)
on the narrow ground that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[It was] difficult to see how a breach
of the rules of natural justice would be occasioned if [the MCST]
itself validly determines in a general meeting that its lawyers
in [S 311/2012] should be discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Court of Appeal did
not address the effect of its ruling on Chancery Law’s status as
the MCST’s legal representatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Chancery
Law has since ceased to be the solicitors on record for the MCST
in S 311/2012, which is still ongoing. However, as noted earlier,
the exact point of Chancery Law’s termination is disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
MCST’s position is that the Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 110/2013
invalidated Chancery Law’s appointment retrospectively from 5 June
2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> on
the basis that that was the date when Motion 2 was “deemed to have
been carried”. Chancery Law’s position is that it ceased to be the
MCST’s legal representatives only when its appointment was formally
terminated by the MCST on 6 August 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This
is the date when Chancery Law received an email from the MCST, informing
Chancery Law that its appointment as solicitors for the MCST in
S 311/2012 had been terminated on the basis of votes taken at an
EOGM on that day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I
note also that Chancery Law asserts that it received a letter from solicitors
acting on behalf of the Opposition faction in S 311/2012 on 7 July 2014.
The letter referred to the Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 110/2013 and
explained that the Opposition faction had made a requisition for
an EOGM <em>to consider termination</em> of
Chancery Law’s appointment and their replacement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It appears that the EOGM
was held on 6 August 2014. Prior to 6 August 2014, Chancery Law
asserts that it had not received any instructions from the MCST
terminating its (Chancery Law’s) retainer. It is apparent that the
Opposition faction (through their lawyers) at this point in time
was also taking the position that termination of the retainer had
to be considered as a result of the Court of Appeal decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings in OS 399/2014</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It
appears that subsequent to those events described above, the Opposition
faction has come to be in control of the MCST. The MCST now refuses
to pay Chancery Law’s fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Chancery
Law commenced OS 399/2014 against the MCST for the enforcement of
contentious business agreements relating to S 311/2012, OS 569/2013
and CA 110/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It
is established law that an agreement will only be a contentious business
agreement within s 111 of the LPA if it is specific in terms and signed
by the client (this is considered in greater detail below at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>). I note, however,
the rather peculiar nature of the contentious business agreements
before me. The contentious business agreements are said to arise
from clauses in Chancery Law’s letters of engagement for S 311/2012 and
OS 569/2013, both of which state:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you have not asked us to tax our bill/[statement
of charges] pursuant to clause 26, and do not pay our bill/[statement
of charges] within 21 days of its receipt, <em>the
bill</em>/[statement of charges] <em>in question
shall then be deemed to be an agreed costs bill</em>/[statement
of charges], <em>pursuant to</em> ... <em>s. 111</em> (in respect of contentious business)
of the Legal Profession Act ... Further, if you continue to instruct
us to carry out work or accept our work product after 14 days of the
receipt of a bill/[statement of charges], this act shall be taken
as your unconditional acceptance (in principle and in quantum) of
that bill/[statement of charges] and all bills/[statement of charges]
rendered previously. If this is not the case, please inform us in
writing immediately. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These clauses are peculiar
in that the contentious business agreement is deemed to arise from
the client’s non-response to a bill or statement of charges issued
by the solicitors. However, since the parties have proceeded on
the basis that s 111 is applicable, I will proceed on the assumption
that these are contentious business agreements within the meaning
of s 111.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In
OS 399/2014, the grounds on which the MCST refuses to pay the legal
fees include the assertion that Chancery Law pursued the interests
of the Council Members or the Mok faction instead of those of the
MCST in all the proceedings mentioned above. The details are set
out in Ms Tay Lay Suan’s affidavit dated 24 July 2014 filed in OS 399/2014.
Ms Tay is a manager with one of the subsidiary proprietors from
the Opposition faction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
MCST resists payment of Chancery Law’s fees for S 311/2012 on the
following grounds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Three
of the four bills issued by Chancery Law relate to work done between
4 and 21 February 2014. These fees were incurred in respect of work
done after the termination of Chancery Law’s warrant to act by the
MCST on 5 June 2013. The fourth bill covered the period from 8 November
2012 up to 3 February 2014. Work done after 5 June 2013 was undertaken
after termination of the warrant to act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chancery
Law did not act in the interest of the MCST in S 311/2012, but rather,
acted in a manner that preferred the interests of the Mok faction;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Chancery
Law’s fees are manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the alternative, the
MCST asserts that it is entitled to an indemnity and/or a contribution
from the Council Members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
MCST resists payment of Chancery Law’s fees for OS 569/2013 and
CA 110/2013 on the basis that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chancery
Law acted in OS 569/2013 and CA 110/2013 in a position of conflict
of interest; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chancery
Law could have taken a completely neutral position in the proceedings
without compromising the MCST’s position. Instead, Chancery Law
pursued a rigorous defence in OS 569/2013 and CA 110/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the alternative, the
MCST asserts that it is entitled to an indemnity and/or a contribution
from the Council Members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
MCST filed Summons No 4368 of 2014 for leave to issue a third party
notice against eight Council Members. In the third party notice,
the MCST seeks an indemnity and/or a contribution from the Council Members
on the basis that they acted in excess of power or authority by appointing
Chancery Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
MCST relies on resolutions purportedly passed at its EOGMs dated
6 October 2010 and 12 December 2012. In the former, the MCST was only
authorised to incur legal fees up to a limit of $500. In the latter,
it was mandated that any expenditure exceeding $2,000 had to be
approved at a general meeting of the MCST. The MCST argues that
the effect of these resolutions is that the Council Members did
not have the power or authority to appoint Chancery Law as the legal
representatives of the MCST. In doing so, the Council Members have
acted in breach of their duties, in bad faith, and in abuse of their
position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I
pause to mention that prior to the issuance of the third party notice, the
6 October 2010 and 12 December 2012 meetings and resolutions were not
raised or mentioned in Ms Tay’s affidavits filed in OS 399/2014. Ms Tay’s
affidavits also never previously mentioned that the MCST council did
not have the authority to appoint Chancery Law because of restrictions placed
on the MCST council by resolutions made at the MCST’s general meetings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue and the arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The
sole issue before me is whether leave should be granted for the MCST
to issue the third party notice against the Council Members in OS 399/2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Chancery
Law argues that leave should not be granted. The first point made
is that a law firm cannot sue on a contentious business agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The only way to enforce
such an agreement is by commencing an originating summons, and by
satisfying the “fair and reasonable” test. Chancery Law argues that
the inquiry is a narrow one: first, is there a contentious business
agreement; and second, is it fair and reasonable between the parties?<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Chancery
Law argues that whether or not the Council Members had authority
to appoint Chancery Law is “an indoor management issue that does
not concern [Chancery Law]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The
issues are distinct, and the Council Members should not be joined
as third parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Chancery
Law also argues that proceedings under s 113 of the LPA are “equivalent
to a taxation proceeding”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Both
proceedings are in the context of solicitor-and-client costs. In
both proceedings, the court considers the nature of the work done
and the value to be placed on it. The “only distinction” is that
the court need not assess “solicitor-and-client costs at a fixed
figure”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Chancery
Law relies on cases which show that at a taxation hearing, the fact
that the solicitors may have been negligent, or may have acted in breach
of duty is irrelevant: <em>Re Massey and Carey</em> (1884)
26 Ch D 459; <em>Abrahams and another v Wainwright
Ryan</em> [1998] VSC 335; and <em>Nicholas Drukker
&amp; Co v Pridie Brewster &amp; Co</em> [2006] 3 Costs LR
439. Chancery Law states that the substance of the MCST’s allegation
is that Chancery Law acted negligently or in breach of duty. Chancery
Law’s case is that this is irrelevant to proceedings under s 113
of the LPA, where all the court is concerned with is the fairness
or reasonableness of the contentious business agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
MCST’s submissions on leave for the issuance of the third party notice
are scant, and do not add anything to their position taken in OS 399/2014
described at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>–<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It
is apparent that many of the submissions raised by the parties before
me cover the <em>substantive</em> positions
which they intend to take at the hearing of OS 399/2014, rather
than the question of whether leave should be granted for the MCST
to issue a third party notice against the Council Members. I will
only address the arguments in so far as they are relevant to the
application before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Before
considering whether leave to issue the third party notice should
be granted, it will be helpful to consider two points. First, the
nature of an application to enforce a contentious business agreement
under the LPA. Second, the purpose of the third party proceedings
provisions under O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014
Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”). I begin with the nature of proceedings
under s 113 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The nature of an application
to enforce a contentious business agreement under the LPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Section 111
of the LPA permits a solicitor to enter into contentious business
agreements with his client. Section 111 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>111.</b>­—(1)
 Subject to the provisions of any other written law, a solicitor
or a law corporation or a limited liability law partnership may
make an agreement in writing with any client respecting the amount
and manner of payment for the whole or any part of its costs in
respect of contentious business done or to be done by the solicitor
or the law corporation or the limited liability law partnership,
either by a gross sum or otherwise, and at either the same rate
as or a greater or a lesser rate than that at which he or the law
corporation or the limited liability law partnership would otherwise
be entitled to be remunerated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Every
such agreement shall be signed by the client and shall be subject to
the provisions and conditions contained in this Part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law Corp and another</em> [2010]
4 SLR 590, Steven Chong J said at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> that this provision entitles
a solicitor and client to agree to a higher rate of costs than what
the solicitor would usually charge. Chong J stated that the enforceability
of such agreements is nonetheless subject to the “fair and reasonable”
requirement in s 113 of the LPA, which I shall come to in a moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     More
recently, the court of three judges in <em>Law
Society of Singapore v Tay Choon Leng John</em> [2012] 3 SLR
150 held at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> that
s 111 of the LPA is a permissive rather than mandatory provision.
The court adopted at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> the
comments of Professor Tan Yock Lin in <em>The Law
of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia</em> (Butterworths
Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at p 685:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 111 has <em>nothing
to do with validity but is concerned only with enforceability by
the solicitor</em>. Being an empowering section, it does not
affect the position of a client who sets up an agreement as to costs.
Before the enactment of section 111, a client could enforce an oral
agreement as to costs against his solicitor and that remains true
after the enactment. Thus in <em>Clare v Joseph</em>,
in an action brought to recover moneys received by a solicitor to
the use of his client, the English Court of Appeal held that the
client continued to be entitled, despite the enactment of the English
equivalent of section 111, to set up an oral agreement by the solicitor
to be paid less than usual costs. However, where a solicitor purports
to set up an agreement as to costs, the agreement must be in writing
for it to be enforceable. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Also
integral to the working of the statutory scheme for contentious business
agreements is s 113, which is the section under which Chancery Law’s
application is made. Section 113 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>113.</b>­—(1)
 <em>No action or suit shall be brought or instituted
upon any such agreement as is referred to in section 111</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Every
question respecting the <em>validity or effect</em> of
the agreement may be examined and determined, and the agreement
may be enforced or set aside without suit or action on the application
by originating summons of any person or the representatives of any
person, party to the agreement, or being or alleged to be liable
to pay, or being or claiming to be entitled to be paid the costs,
fees, charges or disbursements in respect of which the agreement
is made, by the court in which the business or any part thereof
was done or a Judge thereof, or, if the business was not done in
any court, then by the High Court or a Judge thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Upon any such application, if it appears
to the court or Judge that the agreement is in all respects fair
and reasonable between the parties, it may be enforced by the court
or Judge by rule or order, in such manner and subject to such conditions
(if any) as to the costs of the application as the court or Judge
thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    If the <em>terms
of the agreement are deemed by the court or Judge to be unfair or
unreasonable, the agreement may be declared void</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     An
application to enforce a contentious business agreement must be made
by originating summons under s 113(2) of the LPA. In an application to
enforce a contentious business agreement under s 113, the court
is concerned with three questions: form, validity and effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
first preliminary question is whether the agreement satisfies the <em>formal requirements</em> of a contentious business
agreement in s 111 of the LPA. These include the need for the agreement
to be in writing (s 111(1) of the LPA) and signed by the client
(s 111(2) of the LPA). There is also a need for sufficient certainty
or specificity of the terms governing the fees: <em>Shamsudin
bin Embun v P T Seah &amp; Co</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 1108 (<em>“Shamsudin v Seah</em>”) at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>, citing the
English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Chamberlain
v Boodle &amp; King</em> [1982] 3 All ER 188 at 191<em>a</em>. Only agreements satisfying the requirements
in s 111 fall within the remit of s 113 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The
second question concerns the contractual <em>validity</em> of
the contentious business agreement. It will only be enforced “in
the absence of there being any vitiating factors”: <em>Wee
Soon Kim Anthony v Chor Pee &amp; Partners</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R)
518 at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>.
In <em>Shamsudin v Seah</em>, Chan Sek Keong JC
(as he then was) resolved a plea of <em>non est
factum</em> in determining whether to enforce a contentious
business agreement under s 113 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The
third question concerns the <em>effect</em> of
the agreement. This is underpinned by the principle stated by Andrew
Phang Boon Leong JC (as he then was) in <em>Wong
Foong Chai v Lin Kuo Hao</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 74 at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[N]o agreement for the payment of costs
between client and solicitor is sacrosanct in the sense that it
is conclusive and immune to, as well as impervious from, any investigation
by the court itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Even if the contentious
business agreement overcomes the hurdles of form and validity, the
court must be satisfied that the terms of the agreement are fair
and reasonable before the court will enforce it: ss 113(3) and 113(4)
of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This
is a convenient point to deal with Chancery Law’s submission that
an application under s 113 of the LPA is “equivalent to a taxation proceeding”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The
discussion above shows that the court is not concerned only with
“the nature of the work done and the value to be placed on it” as
is the case in taxation proceedings. Proceedings under s 113 of
the LPA are broader than that. They may necessitate an examination
of the circumstances under which the agreement is formed to determine
whether it was validly entered into and whether the terms of the
bargain were fairly struck and reasonable: see <em>In
re Stuart, ex parte Cathcart</em> [1893] 2 QB 201 (“<em>In re Stuart</em>”) at 205, cited with approval
in <em>Shamsudin v Seah</em> at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>. Indeed, in <em>In re Stuart</em>, the English Court of Appeal
noted in passing arguments that the agreement under consideration
was void as against public policy (on the grounds of champerty).
I therefore reject this submission of Chancery Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I
recognise, however, that an application under s 113 of the LPA is usually
“dealt with in a summary manner”: <em>Shamsudin
v Seah</em> at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>.
It is commenced by originating summons and not by writ (indeed,
s 113(1) of the LPA prohibits a suit on a contentious business agreement).
There may, however, be a need for the court to take oral testimony
to resolve the narrow issue of the circumstances under which the
contentious business agreement was entered into. This was done in <em>Shamsudin v Seah</em>, in relation to a plea
of <em>non est factum</em> by the client.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The purpose of third party proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The
provisions governing the issuance of a third party notice are found
in O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court. The defendant in a proceeding
may issue a third party notice in three situations. First, where
he seeks a contribution or indemnity from a person who is not a
party to the action: O 16 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>).
Second, where he seeks relief relating to the original subject-matter
of the action or seeks relief substantially similar to relief claimed
by the plaintiff: O 16 r 1(1)(<em>b</em>).
Third, where any issue relating to the original subject-matter of
the action should be determined between a person not already party
to the action: O 16 r 1(1)(<em>c</em>). The
MCST relies on all three grounds to join the Council Members as
third parties to OS 399/2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The
learned assistant registrar granted leave on the basis that the
MCST was seeking an indemnity or contribution, and because the factual
bases upon which the liability to indemnify arose were (in his view)
related to the validity of the agreement and the limits of the MCST
council’s authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In
the present case, pursuant to O 16 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court, leave
of court is required to issue the third party notice since the proceedings
were commenced by originating summons. Order 16 r 2 of the Rules
of Court sets out the procedure governing leave applications. Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <em>Singapore Court Practice 2014</em> (Lexis Nexis,
2014) (“<em>Singapore Court Practice</em>”)
explains at paragraph 16/2/5 that the court enjoys a general discretion
in all cases whether or not to allow the issuance of a third party notice.
I note in passing that in cases where a third party notice can be issued
without leave, any objections by the plaintiff or the third party
are considered at the hearing of the defendant’s summons for third
party directions: <em>Singapore Court Practice</em> at
paragraph 16/4/5.  Factors relevant to the exercise of the court’s
discretion are considered below at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Regardless
of which limb of O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court is relied on, the
objective of third party proceedings is twofold: <em>Singapore
Court Practice</em> at paragraph 16/1/1. First, to enable
parties to raise all issues relating to the subject-matter of the
hearing in one set of proceedings. This avoids delay and unnecessary
costs resulting from multiple actions. The second related objective
is to avoid inconsistency between judicial decisions if common issues
are litigated in separate proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether leave should be granted
for the MCST to issue the third party notice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In
its third party notice (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above), the
MCST pleads that it is entitled to an indemnity and/or a contribution
from the Council Members who appointed Chancery Law as its legal
representatives. The third party notice was filed on 18 September
2014. Shortly after, the learned assistant registrar granted the
leave that is now being appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The
learned assistant registrar’s decision was based primarily on the assessment
that the MCST’s claim fell within the contribution or indemnity ground
articulated in O 16 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of
the Rules of Court. The learned assistant registrar may also have
been of the view that O 16 r 1(1)(<em>c</em>) applied,
given his holding that the factual bases of the indemnity claim
were related to the validity of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Before
I set out my reasons for deciding that leave should not have been
given for the MCST to issue the third party notice, I should note
that neither party in the submissions touched on the question of
law as to when a right to an indemnity arises, particularly between
the MCST and the Council Members. This is understandable given that
at this stage, what is in issue is whether a <em>prima
facie</em> case has been made that the matter falls with a limb
of O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court. It is not necessary to go into
the substantive merits as such. Nevertheless, I mention in passing
that in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em> at
paragraph 16/1/3, it is stated that the right to an indemnity can
be based on a principle of law or equity. Cases where the right
has been recognised include a situation where the third party was
the managing director of the defendant-company, and his breach of
duty to the company caused losses: <em>Eastern
Shipping Co v Quah Beng Kee</em> [1924] AC 177, cited in <em>Goh Sin Huat Electrical Pte Ltd v Ho See Jui (trading
as Xuanhua Art Gallery) and another</em> [2012] 3 SLR 1038.
However, even if there is a <em>prima facie</em> basis
for the claim to an indemnity, it is my view that leave should not
be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The
court has the discretion to set aside, or to refuse to grant leave
to issue a third party notice, where there may be nothing to be
gained from determining all matters at once (<em>Singapore
Court Practice</em> at paragraph 16/4/4), or where the plaintiff
would “be embarrassed by the desire of the defendants to have the
whole question of [the third party’s] liability decided at once”
(<em>Carshore v North Eastern Railway Company</em> (1885)
29 Ch D 344 at 346). In cases where the defendant needs leave to issue
a third party notice, as in the present case, it does not follow
that leave must be granted whenever a <em>prima
facie</em> case is made out which would bring the matter within
any limb of O 16 r 1(1). The court retains the discretion to refuse
leave in the circumstances outlined above: <em>Singapore Court
Practice</em> at paragraph 16/2/5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In <em>Bower v Hartley and another</em> (1876) 1 QB
652, the defendant insurance brokers were approached by the plaintiff
shipper to effect insurance for cargoes that the plaintiff was shipping
abroad. The cargoes were lost at sea but the underwriters refused
to make payment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought a claim
against the defendants in negligence. The defendants issued a third
party notice to join a second insurance broker (“Leyland &amp; Co”).
The defendants’ position was that they effected one of the insurance
policies through Leyland &amp; Co and the latter was responsible for
indemnifying the former. The plaintiff resisted the joining of Leyland
&amp; Co as a third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The
English Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Queen’s Bench
Division to set aside the third party notice. Mellish LJ took into account
the fact that the defendant’s claim against Leyland &amp; Co “would
be distinct” (at 657) from the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant.
The issue of negligence between the plaintiff and the defendant
was distinct from the negligence between the defendant and third
party. He also said that the inclusion of Leyland &amp; Co might
delay the trial. Mellish LJ concluded that the court should exercise
its discretion to refuse to make the order to serve the third parties.
James LJ also said at 656 that “the convenience of having this question
determined once for all in this action is not enough to outweigh
the injury to the plaintiff which may result from the introduction of
the third party”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It
is my view that to allow the third party notice to be issued in
this case will cause substantial prejudice to Chancery Law. Further,
there would be little to be gained from determining all at once
Chancery Law’s claim for fees under the agreement and the MCST’s
claim for an indemnity against the Council Members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Joining
the Council Members as third parties would deprive Chancery Law
of what is in essence a summary procedure for a solicitor to enforce
a contentious business agreement against his client. The enforcement
of a contentious business agreement hangs on the resolution of the
three narrow questions of form, validity and effect discussed above. Proceedings
under s 113 of the LPA are commenced by originating summons. The
provisions do not envisage the resolution of substantial disputes
of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The
issue of whether the Council Members had authority to appoint Chancery
Law, on the other hand, raises disputed factual and legal questions.
Chancery Law will be put through the expense of having to participate
in a factually intensive dispute with little relation, if any at
all, to Chancery Law’s claim for fees. Further, an action commenced
by originating summons is a blunt tool to resolve contested facts.
A conversion of OS 399/2013 to a writ action is not possible because
s 113(1) of the LPA prohibits a contentious business agreement from
being the subject of a suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     While
oral evidence can be heard in cases commenced by originating summons,
this is not the norm. The fact that Parliament saw fit to mandate that
proceedings under s 113 of the LPA must be by way of originating summons
supports the view that a summary procedure is intended. <em>Shamsudin v Seah</em>, referred to earlier,
was a case where the court heard oral evidence on the issue of whether
the client understood the nature of the contentious fee agreement
in the context of his assertion that the agreement was void for <em>non est factum</em>. <em>Shamsudin
v Seah</em> was not a case where third party proceedings were
in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It
also seems to me that there is little to be gained from resolving
the issue of the Council Members’ authority to engage Chancery Law
(and therefore whether the MCST is entitled to an indemnity from
them for Chancery Law’s fees) together with whether Chancery Law
should be entitled to enforce the contentious business agreements
against the MCST. There is no suggestion in Ms Tay’s affidavit that
Chancery Law had actual or constructive notice of the Council Members’
alleged lack of authority, which would have affected the validity
of Chancery Law’s retainer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Chancery
Law relies on letters of engagement and warrants to act that were
signed in accordance with and pursuant to what appeared to be valid resolutions
of the MCST’s council. It may be said (without deciding) that the
MCST council had, at the very least, apparent or ostensible authority
to engage Chancery Law. At the substantive hearing of OS 399/2014,
the issues to be decided between Chancery Law and the MCST are:
(a) whether the contentious business agreements are valid (in particular
whether Chancery Law can rely on the apparent or ostensible authority);
(b) whether the agreement is fair; and (c) whether the terms are
reasonable. Issues as to whether the fees are excessive or whether
Chancery Law did not act in the best interests of the MCST, <em>etc</em>, are relevant to (b) and (c). But
those matters are not before me and must ultimately be resolved
at the substantive hearing of OS 399/2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The
issue of whether the Council Members had actual authority when they
appointed Chancery Law and whether they had breached any duty owed
to the MCST is a distinct question from Chancery Law’s application under
s 113 of the LPA. There is no need for them to be resolved together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In
coming to this decision, I have noted the comment of the Court of Appeal
in <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> [2008]
4 SLR(R) 543 (“<em>CIMB Bank v Dresdner Kleinwort</em>”)
at [82] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We must emphasise, and this seemed to have
been overlooked by CIMB, that the real test to determine whether
a third-party action should be heard together with the main action
is not that of connection alone but whether they are inextricably
linked and the third party action is an integral and inseparable
part of the main action …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I
accept that the Court of Appeal’s remarks in <em>CIMB
Bank v Dresdner Kleinwort</em> appear to relate only to O 16
r 1(1)(<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>)
of the Rules of                                                
             Court (there did not appear to be any issue of indemnity
and/or contribution before the Court of Appeal in that case).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Nevertheless,
these comments are of some relevance given that the MCST relies
on all the limbs of O 16 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court.  Further, whilst
the learned assistant registrar decided the application primarily
on the basis of the indemnity claim, it appears that he also accepted
the applicability of the limb in O 16 r 1(1)(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It
will be recalled that the position taken by the MCST in resisting payment
of Chancery Law’s fees for S 311/2012 is rooted in the claim that much
of the work claimed in the four bills rendered by Chancery Law (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above) related
to work done after Chancery Law’s warrant to act had been terminated
on 5 June 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Leaving
aside the apparent inconsistency between this and the position taken
by the Opposition faction in their lawyer’s letter referred to at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above, Chancery
Law’s position is that as a matter of law, their appointment was
only terminated on 6 August 2014. The question as to when Chancery
Law’s appointment was terminated is indeed a matter of law. The
possible dates are 5 June 2013, 23 May 2014 (the date when the Court
of Appeal allowed the Opposition faction’s appeal in CA 110/2013)
or 6 August 2014. This is quite different from the main issue raised
in the third party proceedings against the Council Members: namely
that they had appointed Chancery Law in breach of the resolutions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The
other grounds of attack relied on by the MCST in resisting fees for
S 311/2012 is the allegation that Chancery Law did not act in the
interest of the MCST in S 311/2012, and that the fees are manifestly
excessive. The latter bears no connection with the claim against
the third party. The former is only loosely connected with the third
party claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The
position taken by the MCST in resisting payment of Chancery Law’s
fees for OS 569/2013 and CA 110/2013<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> rests
on the assertion that Chancery Law acted in a position of conflict
of interest. In addition, it is claimed that Chancery Law could
have taken a completely neutral position in the proceedings without
compromising the MCST’s position. In my view, there are no good
reasons for these issues and the third party claim to be resolved
in the same set of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In
the circumstances, leave to issue the third party notice should
not have been granted. The third party notice is set aside. I will
hear the parties on costs.</p>
