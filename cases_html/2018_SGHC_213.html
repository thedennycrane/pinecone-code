One of the shareholders alleges that the company has breached the articles and commences litigation against the company.

How this inquiry is to be carried out has been comprehensively analysed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>. In that case, a minority shareholder brought an action claiming that the affairs of the company were being conducted in an oppressive or unfairly prejudicial manner within the meaning of s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The defendants to the action were: (a) the company itself; (b) the majority shareholder; and (c) certain current and former directors of the company and of its related companies. All of the defendants applied to have the entire action stayed. The majority shareholder applied to stay: (a) part of the action against it on the ground that that part fell within the scope of an arbitration agreement between itself and the minority shareholder; and (b) the remainder of the action pursuant to the court’s inherent powers of case management. The other defendants, none of whom had an arbitration agreement with the minority shareholder, all applied to stay the entire action against them purely on case-management grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The two sides in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>urged the court to adopt two diametrically opposed approaches to determining the “matter” in the litigation. The minority shareholder urged the court to adopt a broad approach in which all that the court need do is to identify the “essential dispute” or “main issue” between the parties. Adopting and applying that approach, the minority shareholder submitted that its action raised only one “matter”: whether the affairs of the company were being conducted in an oppressive or unfairly prejudicial manner towards the minority shareholder: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [109].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The majority shareholder, on the other hand, advocated a more granular approach to the inquiry. It contended that a “matter” is each “issue which is material to the relief sought and/or is capable of settlement as a discrete controversy”. The majority shareholder thus submitted that the minority shareholder’s litigation in fact comprised four “matters”, broadly equivalent to each of the four sets of acts alleged to be oppressive or unfairly prejudicial towards the minority shareholder: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [109].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Court of Appeal adopted the majority shareholder’s approach. It observed that s 6(2) of the IAA expressly accommodates the possibility that only a part of the litigation before the court may be the subject of the parties’ arbitration agreement and therefore subject to a mandatory stay. Thus, the Court of Appeal held, the language of s 6(2) itself envisages the more granular inquiry which the majority shareholder advocated and militates against the excessively broad view which the minority shareholder advocated. To determine whether a “matter” is the subject of an arbitration agreement (at [113]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The court] should undertake a practical and common-sense inquiry in relation to any reasonably substantial issue that is not merely peripherally or tangentially connected to the dispute in the court proceedings. The court should not characterise the matter(s) in either an overly broad or an unduly narrow and pedantic manner. In <span class="font-italic">most</span> cases, the matter would encompass the claims made in the proceedings. But, that is not an absolute or inflexible rule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Court of Appeal then conducted a practical and common sense inquiry at the intermediate level of conceptual generality. It agreed with the majority shareholder and held that that each of the four sets of oppressive acts alleged by the minority shareholder constituted a separate “matter” within the meaning of s 6(1) of the IAA (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [122]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> (at [115]–[118]) was influenced by the approach taken upon a similar application by Austin J in the New South Wales case of <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon v Tridon Australia </span>[2002] NSWSC 896 (“<span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon </span>a minority shareholder commenced litigation against: (a) the company; (b) two individuals who were the majority shareholders and directors of the company; and (c) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. The minority shareholder and one of the majority shareholders were parties to a shareholders’ agreement which contained an arbitration clause. All of the defendants in <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon</span> applied to stay the litigation in favour of arbitration under s 7(2) of Australia’s International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth), the Australian equivalent of s 6(1) of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The minority shareholder in <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon</span> tried to draw a distinction between “matters” and “issues”. It submitted that its action raised five claims (at [20]) and submitted that each claim constituted a separate “matter” even though it acknowledged that each “matter” comprised several “issues”. Thus, although the minority shareholder accepted that each of the five claims raised an issue relating to the construction of the shareholders’ agreement – an issue which was therefore within the scope of an arbitration clause in that agreement – it argued that no stay should be granted because those were merely “issues” and were therefore not<span class="font-italic"> </span>“matters” within the meaning of the statutory stay provision (<span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon </span>at [102]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Austin J did not accept the minority shareholder’s approach. Instead, he adopted a more granular approach and found that the issues relating to the shareholders’ agreement comprised in each claim were, in themselves, sufficiently substantial to constitute “matters” (<span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon </span>at [110]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I had decided that each of the five claims … involves a “matter” arising out of the Shareholders’ Agreement [and the Distribution Agreement] and also one or more matters arising out of claims to statutory and equitable rights.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To my mind, each party has characterised the “matter” at too high a level of generality. They have each done so in a self-serving attempt to colour, if not pre-empt, the outcome of the inquiry on the second sub-issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Thus, the plaintiff characterises the “matter” as one of the defendant’s corporate capacity. That is an obvious attempt to set the stage for an argument on the second sub-issue that a dispute over corporate capacity can arise only out of the Articles and never out of the Investment Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Likewise, the defendant characterises the “matter” as a breach of Art 61 and in the alternative as a breach of its own obligation to comply with the Articles. That is an equally obvious attempt to set the stage for its argument on the second sub-issue that both Art 61 and its obligation to comply with the Articles are merely the product of an express obligation which the defendant initially and originally undertook in the Investment Agreement and for which the Investment Agreement is therefore the ultimate contractual source. Clause 11 of the Investment Agreement, as I have explained, is the source of the defendant’s obligation in Art 61. Further, para 1.1.1 of Schedule 10 of the Investment Agreement obliges the defendant to conduct its business and deal with its assets in all material respects in accordance with, amongst other documents, its own Articles.

</div>
</div>
</div> Presumably, the plaintiff’s position is that this additional head of relief does not expand the “matter” in this litigation beyond corporate capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is significant to my mind that a breach of the Articles is the <span class="font-italic">sine qua non</span> of each of the plaintiff’s three current claims for relief and of its foreshadowed claim for additional relief. By those claims, and by the grounds raised in its affidavit in support, the plaintiff has rested this litigation solely upon a breach of the Articles, whether of Art 61 or of Art 44 read with Art 43.3. Looking at the manner in which the plaintiff has framed its claim in this litigation, therefore, it appears to me that the “matter” in this litigation is simply this: has the defendant adopted or approved the 2015 Accounts in breach of the Articles?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This characterisation of the “matter” in this litigation amounts to accepting the plaintiff’s submissions on the first sub-issue, but without tilting the framing of the “matter” impermissibly towards the conclusion on the second sub-issue which is implicit in framing it explicitly in terms of corporate capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I am conscious, however, that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> made it clear that the manner in which a party chooses to frame its claim in any given litigation is not conclusive as to how the substance of the controversy in that litigation should properly be characterised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As Austin J recognised in <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon</span> (at [109]), it is useful to look at the defence which the defendant advances on the merits in order to characterise accurately the “matter” in any given litigation. Of course, in any application to stay an action commenced by writ, there will be no formal, pleaded defence available when the court deals with the stay application. That is because s 6(1) of the IAA requires the defendant to apply for a stay “before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the proceedings”. In the litigation before me, there is no formal, pleaded defence, but for another reason. Because this litigation has been commenced by originating summons, the defendant will never have to file a formal, pleaded defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendant has, however, foreshadowed in its affidavits in support of this application the defences which it intends to raise, albeit while reserving its right to expand upon or add to these defences in the future. The defences which the defendant has foreshadowed are as follows:

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  The defendant’s affidavit filed on 10 August 2017 at paras 33 – 36.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) To the claim on prayer 1 (see [62] above):</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) The 29 March 2017 resolution was not passed in breach of Art 61, because it is not the directors’ role to adopt or approve the 2015 Accounts within the meaning of Art 61. That is the role of the defendant’s shareholders in general meeting. And the shareholders have not yet adopted or approved the accounts.</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) Insofar as Art 61 requires the plaintiff to consent to the directors resolving to place the 2015 Accounts before the shareholders in general meeting, that is an unlawful fetter on the directors’ powers under s 201 of the Companies Act and therefore expressly outside the scope of Art 61;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) To the claim on prayer 2 (see [62] above):</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) It is premature to attempt to declare void and <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the result of an AGM which had not yet been held when this litigation was commenced;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) In any event, to commence litigation against <span class="font-italic">the defendant</span> to have the adoption and approval of the 2015 Accounts declared void and <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> is to commence litigation against the wrong party because the defendant cannot control how <span class="font-italic">the majority shareholder</span> will cast its vote on the 2015 Accounts at the AGM;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) To the claim on prayer 3 (see [62] above), the injunction ought not to be granted because it will have significant adverse impact on the defendant’s ability to secure funding and maintain transactions with banks and other creditors. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The critical point which emerges from this analysis is that the defence on the merits which the defendant foreshadows occupies precisely the same field as the plaintiff’s claim. Thus, the defendant: (a) denies a breach of the Articles; (b) argues that Art 61 must give way to s 201 of the Companies Act by the express terms of the proviso found in Art 61 itself; and (c) argues against an injunction because of the effect it would have on the defendant as a company. In other words, like the plaintiff’s claim, the foreshadowed defences implicate only the Articles and the Companies Act and not the Investment Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendant’s foreshadowed defences therefore reinforce my view that the “matter” in this litigation is simply this: has the defendant adopted or approved the 2015 Accounts in breach of the Articles?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 A similar situation arose in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] SGCA 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings </span>was decided after I gave my decision in the present case. I therefore do not rely on it as the basis of my decision. I refer to it merely as <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> support for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The dispute in <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings </span>arose out of a joint venture agreement entered into between two shareholders and their joint venture vehicle. The joint venture agreement contained an arbitration clause. The minority shareholder commenced litigation under s 216 of the Act, alleging oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct. The majority shareholder argued that the minority shareholder was obliged to arbitrate their dispute by virtue of the arbitration agreement. The Court of Appeal observed <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that it was “not even clear” that the minority’s complaints of oppression fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement. This was because, as noted at [184]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The minority shareholder’s] complaints concerned the making of unauthorised loans, the misappropriation of the Company’s assets, the attempt to wrongfully dilute [the minority’s] agreed shareholding in the Company as well as the creation of fictitious or sham agreements to conceal the impugned transactions. <span class="font-italic">All of these actions were oppressive to </span><span class="font-italic">[the minority shareholder] even without regard to the [joint venture agreement]. </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, the Court of Appeal allowed the minority shareholder’s litigation to continue because he did not have to prove or rely on any breach of the parties’ joint venture agreement in order to succeed in his oppression claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The same is the case in this litigation. the plaintiff’s complaint is that the defendant has adopted or approved its 2015 Accounts in breach of the Articles. If the plaintiff is right, the defendant’s act is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. That is so without any need whatsoever to have regard to the provisions of the Investment Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the “matter” is the subject of the parties’ arbitration agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The second sub-issue is the heart of the defendant’s stay application. Is the “matter” in this litigation a “dispute, controversy or conflict arising out of or in connection with this Agreement”? The second sub-issue thus raises two questions on cl 29.2:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) What does “this Agreement” mean in cl 29.2?</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Is a dispute over whether the 2015 Accounts have been adopted or approved in breach of the Articles a dispute “arising out of or in connection with this Agreement” within the meaning of cl 29.2?</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On both of these questions, I find against the defendant. I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the “matter” in this litigation arises out of or in connection with the Articles and not out of or in connection with the Investment Agreement and, further, that the Articles and the Investment Agreement are entirely separate agreements. I find further that the phrase “this Agreement” in the arbitration agreement encompasses only the Investment Agreement and does not extend to the Articles whether as a matter of incorporation, of construction or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It is well-established that arbitration agreements are to be construed generously: <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil and Gas Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Petroprod Ltd (in official liquidation in the Cayman Islands and in compulsory liquidation in Singapore) </span>[2011] 3 SLR 414 (“<span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span>”) at [19]. But that is not to say that there is any special rule of construction which applies only to arbitration agreements and which leans in favour of ushering disputes away from litigation and into arbitration. As is the case when construing any agreement, the objective of construing an arbitration agreement is simply to determine and give effect to the objectively-ascertained intention of the parties in agreeing to arbitrate, bearing in mind the context in which they so agreed: <span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> International Pte Ltd v Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza SpA</span> [2016] 5 SLR 455 (“<span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> International</span>”) at [32] and [34]. Thus, an arbitration agreement must be construed based on the presumed intentions of the parties as rational commercial parties and not on any technical basis: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [124]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 If, taking this approach, the defendant is able to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the dispute as to whether it has adopted or approved the 2015 Accounts in breach of the Articles – which is what I have found the “matter” in this litigation to be – is the subject of the parties’ arbitration agreement, then I am obliged to stay this litigation in favour of arbitration under s 6(1) of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In my view, the defendant has failed to discharge even the light burden which <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> casts upon it. The “matter” in this litigation does not arise either “out of” or “in connection with” the Investment Agreement, as required by the parties’ arbitration agreement found in cl 29.2 of the Investment Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Investment Agreement and the Articles create two separate legal relationships between the parties which operate on two separate legal planes. Clause 29.2 of the Investment Agreement on its proper construction applies only to the private contractual relationship between the parties created by the Investment Agreement itself. Disputes under the Articles are not within the scope of cl 29.2 and are governed by recourse to the courts in accordance with ordinary principles of company law. By the phrase “company law”, I mean the interaction of a company’s “constitution” (as that term is now defined in s 4(1) of the Companies Act), the statutory provisions of the Companies Act and the gloss which the common law has applied to those statutory provisions and their precursors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I first explain why I have found that the Investment Agreement and the Articles give rise to two different legal relationships operating on separate planes before turning to explain why I have found that cl 29.2 does not apply to the legal relationship created by the Articles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Two different relationships on two different planes</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Different legal character</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Investment Agreement and the Articles both have contractual force. However, each agreement derives its contractual force by a fundamentally different mechanism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Investment Agreement is a private contract. It derives its contractual force purely from the private law of obligations. The law of contract, which is a branch of the law of obligations, provides that the coincidence of offer, acceptance and consideration gives rise to obligations which are legally binding. At common law, nobody who is not a party to the contract can be bound by its provisions or can claim any rights under its provisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Articles are of a fundamentally different legal character to a private contract. The Articles are a component of the defendant’s constitution. A company’s constitution derives its contractual force from company law, not private law. Section 39(1) of the Companies Act provides that the constitution of a company binds the company and its members as if the constitution had been signed and sealed by each member and contained covenants on the part of each member to observe its provisions. The constitution is therefore a deemed contract which binds immediately by force of statute upon and by virtue of registration. As such, it binds without any need for offer, acceptance or consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In addition to being a deemed contract, a company’s constitution is also a public contract. It is public in two senses. It is a public contract in the sense that it is given binding force by a public Act of Parliament and not by a private act of the parties. It is also a public contract in the sense that a company’s constitution, which includes its articles, must be lodged with ACRA (s 19(3) of the Companies Act). Thereafter, any member of the public has the right to inspect the company’s constitution on ACRA’s register (s 12(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act) and may rely on what he finds there in deciding whether to transact or not to transact with the company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Operating on separate planes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The fundamentally different legal character of the two contracts means also that they operate on separate planes. A company’s constitution operates on the company law plane (as I have defined the term “company law” (see [79] above)). A shareholders’ agreement operates on the private law plane. Five examples serve to illustrate this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 First, on the private law plane, a shareholders’ agreement can bind any party to the agreement in any capacity the parties intend it to, whether it be as a shareholder of the company, as an employee of the company, as an independent contractor providing services to the company, as a creditor of the company and even (with considerable caution) as a director of the company. On the company law plane, even though a company’s constitution has contractual force, it can bind a shareholder <span class="font-italic">only in his capacity as a shareholder</span> and not in any other capacity: <span class="font-italic">Hickman v Kent</span><span class="font-italic"> or Romney Marsh Sheepbreeders’ Association </span>[1915] 1 Ch 881 at 900, cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Guoh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sing Leong alias Quek Sing Leong the Administrator of the Estate of Guoh Koh Boey (deceased) v Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Co (Pte) Ltd </span>[1995] SGHC 279. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Second, on the private law plane, no person can be bound by a shareholders’ agreement unless he accedes to it expressly and separately by contract. On the company law plane, an incoming shareholder becomes a member of the company only if he agrees to do so and only if his name is entered on the register of member (s 19(6A) of the Companies Act). The incoming member is thereupon, by force of company law, immediately and automatically bound by the company’s constitution. The incoming shareholders’ consent to be bound by the constitution is not, in itself, sufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Third, on the private law plane, the provisions of a shareholders’ agreement can be modified only with the consent of <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the parties to the agreement. On the company law plane, any provision of a company’s constitution which is not entrenched within the meaning of s 26A of the Companies Act can be amended by special resolution under s 26 or s 33. Thus, a shareholder who holds under 25% of a company’s shares can find himself bound against his will by a modification of a provision in the company’s constitution so long as it is carried out in accordance with company law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Fourth, on the private law plane, the most common remedy for a breach of contract is an award of damages. On the company law plane, a shareholder who commences litigation against a company on a claim related to his status as a member cannot at common law recover damages from the company as a remedy for that claim: <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span><span class="font-italic"> v City of Glasgow Bank </span>[1874–80] All ER Rep 333 and <span class="font-italic">Webb Distributors (</span><span class="font-italic">Aust) Pty Ltd v Victoria </span>(1993) 179 CLR 15. That is because an award of damages in these circumstances would constitute the shareholder a creditor of the company and elevate the shareholder into impermissible competition with the company’s creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Finally, on the private law plane, a shareholders’ agreement, just like any other private law contract, can be rectified to bring the written record of the parties’ agreement into the form it ought to have been in when executed. On the company law plane, a company’s constitution can never be rectified: <span class="font-italic">Scott v Frank F Scott (London) Limited</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1940] Ch 794 (“<span class="font-italic">Scott</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Santos Ltd &amp; Anor v </span><span class="font-italic">Pettingell &amp; Ors</span> (1979) 4 ACLR 110. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The private law plane is subordinate to company law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In addition to showing that a shareholders’ agreement and a company’s constitution operates on separate planes, the last three examples I have cited show that company law subordinates a private agreement – such as a shareholders’ agreement – to company law on company law matters. To put it another way, on company law matters, company law allows a shareholders’ agreement to supplement company law but never to supplant it. As Austin J pointed out in <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon</span> at [165]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Of its nature, <span class="font-italic">a shareholders’ agreement is supplementary to the rights and liabilities of the shareholders conferred by company law</span>. It does not purport to exclude or replace the shareholders’ company law rights. <span class="font-italic">Indeed, the statutory rights of shareholders cannot, for the most part, be taken away by an agreement.</span> Instead, <span class="font-italic">a shareholders’ agreement imposes consensual limitations on the way in which certain rights, such as voting rights and the right to transfer shares, may be exercised</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Company law subordinates a shareholders’ agreement to company law on the company law plane even if the shareholders’ agreement precedes the company’s constitution in time and even if obligations in the shareholders’ agreement are the source, whether factually or contractually, of the obligations in the constitution. Any obligation which a company or a shareholder undertakes privately in a shareholders’ agreement which is contrary to a mandatory provision of company law must yield to company law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 This is typically for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 First, as Austin J pointed out, company law confers many rights on shareholders for their benefit and protection <span class="font-italic">inter se</span> and as against the company. If there is a shareholders’ agreement running in parallel with a company’s constitution, there is no guarantee that <span class="font-italic">every</span> shareholder of the company will be a contractual party to that agreement. Therefore, the rights of all shareholders must be governed by company law and not by private agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Thus, on the third example (see [88] above), a shareholder who finds himself bound by an amendment to the company’s constitution on the company law plane will be bound by that amendment: (a) even if he opposed the amendment; (b) even if the provision in the constitution which is amended is one which has its factual and contractual origin in a shareholders’ agreement to which he is a party; and (c) even if the amendment is carried out in breach of the shareholders’ agreement. That is so even though his rights under the shareholders’ agreement cannot be modified as a matter of private law without his positive assent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Second, company law rules exist not only to benefit and protect shareholders but also to benefit and protect those who extend credit to the company. Once again, company law must prevail over a private agreement where that might otherwise prejudice creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Thus, on the fourth example (see [89] above), the common law rule limiting a shareholder’s right to recover damages from the company on a claim related to his status as a member is a limitation imposed ostensibly to protect creditors, as they are outsiders to the company and also to any shareholders’ agreement. Thus, no shareholder can contract out of this common law rule by private agreement. Indeed, it was only by statute that the common law rule could be abrogated in English company law: see s 111A of the English Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK), now s 655 of the English Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Finally, a company’s constitution is a public document which must be lodged with ACRA and which the public may inspect on ACRA’s register and rely upon (see [84] above). Company law therefore ensures that the constitution represents the complete agreement of the shareholders on the company law plane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Thus, on the fifth example (see [90] above), where a provision in a shareholders’ agreement is vulnerable to rectification but has been restated in a company’s constitution, the shareholders will continue to be bound by the unrectified provision in the constitution on the company law plane until and unless the shareholders amend the constitution in accordance with the Companies Act. That is so even if a court orders rectification of the source provision in the shareholder’s agreement. That is because of the public nature of a company’s constitution (<span class="font-italic">Scott</span> at 802):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is quite true that in the case of the rectification of a document, such as a deed inter partes, or a deed poll, the order for rectification does not order an alteration of the document; it merely directs that it be made to accord with the form in which it ought originally to have been executed. This cannot be the case with regard to the memorandum and articles of association of a company, for it is the document in its actual form that is delivered to the Registrar and is retained and registered by him, and it is that form and no other that constitutes the charter of the company and becomes binding on it and its members. … In all cases any change in the name or constitution of the company must be registered with the Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ agreement recognises the separate planes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In the case before me, the Investment Agreement expressly recognises that it operates on a plane separate to company law and that it is subordinate to company law. Two provisions make this clear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 First, Recital C records the parties’ intent in entering into the Investment Agreement as an intent to <span class="font-italic">regulate</span> their rights and obligations as shareholders, thereby recognising that those rights and obligations <span class="font-italic">originate</span> elsewhere:

Indeed, no private contract is capable of conferring the status of shareholders on its parties. Only company law in conjunction with the statutory contract which is the defendant’s constitution can do that. In short, Recital C is explicit acknowledgment that the parties to the Investment Agreement intend it – as Austin J noted in <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon</span> – to “[impose] consensual limitations on the way in which certain rights, such as voting rights and the right to transfer shares, may be exercised”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Second, and most importantly, cl 27.10 explicitly provides that the Investment Agreement yields to company law:

It acknowledges that the Investment Agreement operates on a plane subordinate to company law as far as issues of company law are concerned and that it is company law which decides the extent to which the Investment Agreement can bind the defendant on matters of company law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 These provisions show that it was the parties’ intent, objectively ascertained, that the Investment Agreement was to be subordinate to company law, which confers primacy on the defendant’s constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Company law determines validity of corporate acts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 A company’s constitution, by virtue of s 23(1) of the Companies Act, determines a company’s corporate capacity and therefore the validity of its acts. As noted in <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 121 at [44], s 25(1) of the Companies Act has made corporate capacity very much a non-issue for outsiders to the company. Nevertheless, the <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>doctrine retains considerable relevance for insiders to the company. Shareholders can rely on the <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> nature of a company’s act in litigation against the company (s 25(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act). And both the shareholders and the company can rely on the <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> doctrine in litigation against present or former officers of the company (s 25(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Companies Act). Further, where an <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> act is to be carried out in the future pursuant to a contract, the court may, if it considers it just and equitable, set aside and restrain the performance of the contract (s 25(3) of the Companies Act).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 A shareholders’ agreement, on the other hand, says nothing about – and indeed cannot in law say anything about – the validity of corporate acts. That concept is the exclusive domain of company law. No doubt the defendant has a contractual obligation to its shareholders under cl 11.2 of the Investment Agreement not to adopt or approve its annual accounts without the plaintiff’s consent. But the only consequence of acting in breach of that obligation is civil liability on the private law plane for breach of contract. The corporate act itself remains valid on the company law plane until and unless it is invalidated on that plane in accordance with company law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 To be clear, I am prepared to accept the defendant’s submission that an arbitral tribunal is empowered to grant the relief sought by the plaintiff in this case. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>noted that the IAA confers wide remedial power on arbitral tribunals: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [97]. Section 12(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IAA stipulates that an arbitral tribunal “may award any remedy or relief that could have been ordered by the High Court if the dispute had been the subject of civil proceedings in that Court”. This is of course subject to public policy considerations and the rights of third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 But my readiness to accept the defendant’s submission on relief does not take the defendant’s case for a stay very far. The plaintiff raises the issue of relief not to argue against a stay on the grounds that an arbitral tribunal is unable to grant the relief it seeks in this litigation. The plaintiff raises the issue as support for its principal argument that the two agreements in question here – the Investment Agreement and the Articles – are of a fundamentally different character and that the dispute in this litigation arises out of the agreement which is not subject to an arbitration clause. I accept the plaintiff’s submissions on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s careful framing of this litigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It is to my mind irrelevant that, as the defendant argues, the Investment Agreement contains an express provision requiring the defendant to comply with the Articles of Association. It is true that the Articles are silent on the defendant’s obligation to comply with the Articles. But that is not because the true source of that obligation is the Investment Agreement. The Articles are silent on this obligation because the Articles operate on the company law plane and a company’s obligation to comply with its Articles is axiomatic as a matter of company law. That obligation arises by force of law under s 39 of the Companies Act. In my view, the true source of the defendant’s obligation to comply with the Articles is neither the Articles nor the Investment Agreement but company law itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Counsel for the defendant contends that the plaintiff is trying to “slice and dice to find a way to get into court rather than into arbitration”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Notes of Argument dated 27 October 2017 at p 17.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Even if this is so, absent bad faith, a litigant has the freedom to frame his cause of action in any way which is more advantageous to him: <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [47]–[48]. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff is acting in bad faith in choosing to frame its cause of action in this litigation as arising from a breach of the Articles alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Indeed, no such argument could succeed. An action in which a plaintiff deliberately selects and pursues one available cause of action and omits another is not by that fact alone an action brought in bad faith. Nor does it become one simply because the cause of action which is omitted is arguably governed by an arbitration agreement while the cause of action which is pursued is arguably not. Clause 29.2 of the Investment Agreement does not operate to oblige the plaintiff to pursue a cause of action against the defendant which arises both under the Articles and under the Investment Agreement in a manner which triggers cl 29.2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 It therefore appears to me that the connection between this litigation and the Articles – and the omission of any reference to the Investment Agreement in both the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s currently foreshadowed defences to the claim – is a matter of substance and not simply a contrivance arising from the form in which the plaintiff has chosen to frame this litigation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does cl 29.2 of the Investment Agreement apply to disputes arising under the Articles?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I now consider whether the parties’ objectively-ascertained intention is that cl 29.2 of the Investment Agreement should apply to disputes arising from the separate legal relationship between the parties created by the Articles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As a starting point, the fact that the parties have two agreements which, as I have found, create two separate legal relationships operating on two separate legal planes points away from an objectively-ascertainable intention that a dispute arising out of one agreement should be the subject of an arbitration clause found in the other agreement. In this regard, the case of <span class="font-italic">Robotunits</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd v Mennel </span>[2015] VSC 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Robotunits</span>”) is instructive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In that case, a company commenced an action against a former director, who was also a shareholder and employee of the company. The company alleged that the director had caused the company to make certain payments to him without a basis at law or in equity, and therefore in breach of his duties as a director. The company and the director were parties to an express shareholders’ agreement and also to an express employment agreement. The shareholders’ agreement contained an arbitration clause while the employment agreement did not. The director applied to stay the action on the basis of the arbitration agreement in the shareholders’ agreement:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Robotunits </span>at [4]–[5] and [8].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The court in <span class="font-italic">Robotunits</span> found that there were two matters to be determined in the company’s litigation against the director. First, whether the <span class="font-italic">shareholders’</span> agreement provided a legal or equitable basis for the director to cause the company to make the payments. Second, whether the <span class="font-italic">employment</span> agreement provided a legal or equitable basis for the director to cause the company to make the payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The court held that the first matter fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the shareholders’ agreement, whereas the second did not. In reaching its decision, the court noted that the arbitration agreement did not expressly limit its scope to matters relating to the shareholders’ agreement. But a reasonable person in the position of the parties would not have understood the arbitration agreement to extend to matters arising outside the shareholders’ agreement. Matters arising under the employment agreement did not therefore fall within the arbitration clause, because the employment agreement governed “the parties’ relationship as employee and employer and thus relates to a separate transaction altogether”: <span class="font-italic">Robotunits</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [28], [47] and [56]–[58].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Similarly, in the case before me, as I have found, the Investment Agreement and the Articles create two separate legal relationships between the parties operating on two separate planes. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would thus not have understood the arbitration agreement in the Investment Agreement, without more, as extending to disputes arising under the Articles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The defendant argues for three reasons that the parties <span class="font-italic">did</span> manifest an objectively-ascertainable intent that cl 29.2 should apply to disputes arising under the Articles.

</div> I reject this argument also. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The supremacy clause operates on the private law plane, not on the company law plane. Its commercial intent is two-fold. First, it creates an immediate contractual obligation requiring the parties to adhere to their rights and obligations under the Investment Agreement and to disregard their rights and obligations under the Articles where those rights or obligations are in conflict or are inconsistent. Second, it creates a longer-term contractual obligation requiring the parties to address and resolve that conflict or inconsistency by amending the Articles on the company law plane. Indeed, if the effect of the supremacy clause was as the defendant submits, there would be no need for the second half of the supremacy clause imposing the longer-term contractual obligation. The supremacy clause would simply prevail over the Articles on the company law plane also simply by virtue of the conflict of inconsistency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Further, the parties could not have intended a “conflict or inconsistency” within the meaning of cl 23 to arise simply because a provision which is present in the Investment Agreement is absent from the Articles. If that were the case, the effect of cl 23 would be to import automatically into the Articles all of the terms which are found in the Investment Agreement but which are absent in the Articles, and to remove from the Articles all of the terms found in the Articles which are absent from the Investment Agreement. The effect would be to make the Articles identical in content to the Investment Agreement, making the entire scheme of having the two separate agreements run in parallel on their separate planes entirely redundant. Not only does such an outcome serve no commercial purpose, it is also contrary to the expressly-stated purpose of the Investment Agreement, which was to <span class="font-italic">supplement </span>the Articles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 It is also arguable that, if the effect of the supremacy clause is as argued by the defendant, then the entire Investment Agreement constitutes an impermissible attempt to amend the Articles without complying with the procedure in s 26 of the Companies Act and without making the amendments manifest to the public on ACRA’s register as required by the Companies Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I therefore reject the argument that cl 23 of the Investment Agreement operates to allow cl 29.2 of that agreement to “prevail” over the absence of an arbitration agreement in the Articles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Entire agreement clause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Finally, the defendant relies on cl 24.1

Lord Hoffmann said at [13] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the construction of an arbitration clause should start from the assumption that the parties, as rational businessmen, are likely to have intended any dispute arising out of the relationship into which they have entered … to be decided by the same tribunal.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> International </span>at [34], “the rule of construction formulated in <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> is not to be applied irrespective of the context in which the underlying agreement was entered into or the plain meaning of the words.” Closer to the context of this case, Austin J stated in <span class="font-italic">ACD </span><span class="font-italic">Tridon</span> at [177]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I have been urged to resist such a construction of the clauses, on the ground that the Court should not attribute to the parties an intention to have different parts of their dispute resolved before different tribunals … That does not seem to me to be a compelling argument in the case of a Shareholders' Agreement, where the contractual arrangements are superimposed on company law rights.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">83 It is true, as the Plaintiff submits, that the conspiracy claims do not directly invoke the [shareholders’ agreement]. Nonetheless … these claims are still likely to involve a determination of the nature of the actions taken or omissions of various persons, including the directors and the Shareholders. In particular, the conduct of the Shareholders in this regard is a matter governed by the [shareholders’ agreement]. As submitted by the Defendants, the gravamen of the complaint by the Plaintiff is the dilution of its interests in Lime PLC and thus its say or participation in the various associated companies. In determining that essential issue, the findings of the court … is likely to overlap with the various findings that may be made in the arbitration between the Plaintiff and RME in relation to the actions or omissions of the Shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">85 At a holistic level, it is unlikely for the connections between the conspiracy claims here and the actions or omissions of the Shareholders as bound by the [shareholders’ agreement] to be untangled and separated. Furthermore, given that the risk of inconsistent findings between the arbitral tribunal and the court is a relevant consideration in determining whether [a] stay should be granted … another reason thus operates: there is to my mind a significant risk that there may be inconsistent findings between the court proceedings and arbitration …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The defendant acknowledges that the court in <span class="font-italic">Gulf Hibiscus </span>did not consider s 6(1) of the IAA and instead considered only whether the litigation should be stayed in the exercise of the court’s case-management powers. Indeed, that is made clear at [69] of <span class="font-italic">Gulf Hibiscus</span>. To my mind, that makes all the difference. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Gulf Hibiscus </span>noted at [59]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The power to order a case management stay is part of the court’s own inherent and immediate powers to control proceedings before it. While the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties would give strong grounds for a stay of court proceedings taken in contravention of that agreement, there are already express statutory provisions conferring the power to stay under s 6 of the [IAA] … Instead, the <span class="font-italic">inherent power is invoked to deal with situations without an express agreement between the relevant parties to the </span><span class="font-italic">court proceedings</span>. <span class="font-italic">Furthermore, the jurisprudential basis for the exercise of the power to stay in the absence of an agreement is the wider need to control and manage proceedings between the parties for a fair and efficient administration of justice; it is not predicated on holding parties to any agreement</span> – the absence of such an agreement is therefore irrelevant. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The considerations which arise when a court is asked to grant a case-management stay are conceptually quite different from those which arise when a court is asked to stay litigation under s 6(1) of the IAA. A stay under s 6(1) of the IAA is mandatory and the considerations are narrow. The court is concerned only with whether the applicant for the stay has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the one or more of the matters in the litigation are in fact the subject of an arbitration agreement between the parties which is not null and void, inoperable or incapable of being performed. If they are, the stay is mandatory. If they are not, there is no <span class="font-italic">statutory</span> basis for a stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 A case-management stay, on the other hand, is entirely discretionary. The considerations are wide. The court considers factors such as whether there will be a duplication of the witnesses and the evidence and whether there is a risk of inconsistent findings of fact or holdings of law between the tribunal and the court: <span class="font-italic">Gulf Hibiscus </span>at [63].

</div> I do not find that to be the case. As I have shown, all of the claims and all of the foreshadowed defences raise only company law issues, without implicating the Investment Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In any event, even if the defendant’s submission were correct, it does not mean that this litigation falls with the scope of the arbitration agreement in the Investment Agreement. Unless it can succeed on that critical issue, the defendant has no entitlement to a stay under s 6(1) of the IAA. I have found against the defendant on that issue. The defendant advances no other basis for a stay.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Clause 29.2 of the Investment Agreement on its proper construction applies only to the legal relationship between the parties which arises out of the Investment Agreement itself. The Articles create a separate legal relationship between the parties which operates a separate legal plane. A dispute under the Articles is not within the scope of cl 29.2 and are governed by recourse to the courts in accordance with ordinary principles of company law. This dispute arises only under the Articles. The defendant has failed to establish the only basis on which it sought to stay this litigation. The assistant registrar should have dismissed the application. The plaintiff’s appeal against the assistant registrar’s decision to the contrary ought to be allowed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Arbitrability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I have found that the “matter” in this litigation is not the subject of the parties’ arbitration agreement, and therefore a statutory stay under s 6(1) of the Companies Act is not available. But it also seems to me that it could be argued that an application to challenge the filing of documents on ACRA’s register is not arbitrable because the outcome could affect a public register and thereby could affect third parties who may have acted in reliance on the accuracy of that register. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Before the assistant registrar, the plaintiff appears to have conceded that the dispute underlying this litigation is arbitrable.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 26 October 2017 at para 49(c).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The defendant] has stated that the invalidation of the accounts will have a significant impact as they need to be provided to banks and other creditors in order to secure funding and maintain transactions. The <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> effect on third party rights militate against the matter falling within the ambit of arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff is making two points in this paragraph of its written submissions, only one of which I am prepared to accept might be valid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The first point which it makes, and the one which I reject, is that the order which the plaintiff seeks in this litigation will operate <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>. That is not so. If the plaintiff succeeds in this litigation, it will secure an order invalidating the approval of the accounts which the plaintiff alleges has taken place. But that order will operate only as between the plaintiff and the defendant, as the parties to this litigation. It will not operate against the whole world. It would, for example, be open to any person not a party to this litigation – such as the majority shareholder – to proceed on the basis that the accounts had been validly approved. So too, a creditor who had secured a copy of the defendant’s audited accounts from ACRA’s register and relied upon them in making a credit decision would not be bound by any invalidation which might be ordered in this litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The second point which the plaintiff makes, and which I accept might be a valid consideration on the question of arbitrability, is that any order which might be made in this litigation has the potential to affect third party rights. I bear in mind that the plaintiff made the point on arbitrability in its written submissions only in passing and did not pursue the point in oral submissions with any great enthusiasm. I have therefore rested my decision on the proper construction of s 6(1) of the IAA and cl 29.2 of the Investment Agreement and not on arbitrability. But since the plaintiff has raised arbitrability, is nevertheless apposite that I make a few remarks on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>noted, there is a class of disputes which is not capable of settlement by arbitration. At the core of this class are disputes which are of a public character and disputes whose outcome will affect the interests of persons beyond the immediate disputants. An agreement to resolve any such dispute by arbitration is ineffective and cannot ground a stay: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [71] and [74].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The limits of arbitrability where third party rights intrude have been explored in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span>, <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Fulham Foot</span><span class="font-italic">ball Club (1987) Ltd v Richards </span>[2012] Ch 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Fulham Football</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil </span>concerned a dispute over payments made by a company and its subsidiaries under a management agreement, before the appointment of liquidators. The liquidators, after appointment, commenced litigation against the counterparty to the management agreement, seeking to avoid the payments on the grounds that they were unfair preferences, transactions at an undervalue or payments made with intent to defraud. The counterparty applied to stay the litigation in favour of arbitration, relying on an arbitration clause in the management agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The Court of Appeal accepted that there is ordinarily a presumption of arbitrability. Nevertheless, in the context of a company under the control of insolvency officeholders, the court drew a distinction between a dispute arising only upon insolvency and by reason only of the insolvency regime (an insolvency law dispute) and a dispute arising from the insolvent company’s pre-insolvency rights and obligations (a private law dispute). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The Court of Appeal held that an insolvency law dispute is not arbitrable. Part of the purpose of the insolvency regime is to enable insolvent companies to recover assets for the collective benefit of the company’s creditors. This very often requires pursuing insolvency law claims against the company’s pre-insolvency management. This aspect of the insolvency regime’s purpose could be compromised if management were permitted to bind the company’s insolvency officeholders to arbitrate insolvency law disputes. Further, the insolvency regime envisages that a single insolvency law dispute could arise against multiple persons, some of whom might be counterparties to an arbitration agreement with the insolvent company but others of whom might not be counterparties to <span class="font-italic">any</span> agreement with the insolvent company at all, let alone an arbitration agreement. Having all insolvency law disputes determined under the collective procedure set out in the insolvency regime, regardless of the presence or scope of an arbitration agreement, prevents conflicting findings by different adjudicators: <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil </span>at [44]–[46].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 On the other hand, the Court of Appeal considered that a private law dispute is arbitrable, at least where it does not affect the substantive rights of the creditors. Where an arbitration agreement obliges a company’s insolvency officeholders to arbitrate a private dispute, there is usually no good reason not to give effect to the arbitration agreement: <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span> at [51]. This is despite the fact that the arbitration agreement affects the <span class="font-italic">procedural</span> rights of all of the insolvent company’s creditors in the following two senses. First, the creditors collectively have the real economic interest in the outcome of the private law dispute but can be compelled to submit to having the dispute resolved through arbitration even though the creditors are not parties to any arbitration agreement: <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span> at [48]. Second, an arbitration agreement can be seen as an attempt to contract out of the specialised procedure for resolving private law disputes which is mandated by the insolvency regime, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by the lodgement and adjudication of proofs of debt (<span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span> at [49]). But where an arbitration agreement affects the <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> rights of the creditors, the liquidator cannot be compelled to arbitrate the private law dispute: <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil </span>at [50]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The facts of <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>have been stated at [45] above. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>held that the liquidation of an insolvent company is not arbitrable because it is a process in which the public has an interest. The interest arises because any state’s insolvency regime necessarily reflects public policy in how to distribute amongst the company’s creditors the inevitable loss arising from the company’s insolvency and also the point at which the state should intervene in the affairs of the insolvent company to mandate that distribution. The public interest in insolvency is why public notice of an application for an insolvent winding-up must be given by way of advertisement as required by the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 50, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed). On the other hand, litigation under s 216 of the Companies Act does not engage the public interest. That class of litigation almost always arises in the context of a solvent company and is concerned with the shareholders’ private interest in protecting their commercial expectations. That is why an application under s 216 of the Companies Act does not have to be advertised, even if winding up is sought as relief: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [82]–[89].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>also considered the case of <span class="font-italic">Fulham Football</span>. In that case, the appellant (“Fulham”), was a member of the second respondent (“FAPL”). As a member of FAPL, Fulham was required to comply with FAPL’s articles of associations and rules, and also with the rules of the English Football Association (“the FA rules”). Fulham presented a petition under s 994 of the English Companies Act 2006, which is substantially similar to s 216 of the Companies Act. Fulham alleged that the first respondent had breached the FA rules and had thereby caused FAPL to conduct its affairs in a manner which was unfairly prejudicial to Fulham’s interests. The first respondent applied to stay the litigation in favour of arbitration, relying on the arbitration clauses in FAPL’s rules and the FA rules. Fulham resisted the stay application, arguing that a petition under s 994 of the English Companies Act 2006 was not arbitrable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The English Court of Appeal rejected Fulham’s argument and found that the dispute was arbitrable (at [77]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[t]he determination of whether there has been unfair prejudice consisting of the breach of an agreement or some other unconscionable behaviour is plainly capable of being decided by an arbitrator and it is common ground that an arbitral tribunal constituted under the FAPL or the FA rules would have the power to grant the specific relief sought by Fulham in its section 994 petition. We are not therefore concerned with a case in which the arbitrator is being asked to grant relief of a kind which lies outside his powers or forms part of the exclusive jurisdiction of the court. Nor does the determination of issues of this kind call for some kind of state intervention in the affairs of the company which only a court can sanction. <span class="font-italic">A dispute </span><span class="font-italic">between members of a company or between shareholders and the board about alleged breaches of the articles of association or a shareholders’ agreement is an essentially contractual dispute which does not necessarily engage the rights of creditors or impinge on any statutory safeguards imposed for the benefit of third parties.</span> The present case is a particularly good example of this where the only issue between the parties is whether [the first respondent] has acted in breach of the FA and FAPL rules in relation to the transfer of a Premier League player. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The present case is superficially similar to <span class="font-italic">Fulham Football</span>. Both cases concern a dispute about an alleged breach of a company’s articles of association. But the dispute in <span class="font-italic">Fulham Football</span> was entirely contractual. As the English Court of Appeal held, the parties’ dispute there did not “engage the rights of creditors or impinge on statutory safeguards imposed for the benefit of third parties”. That is not the case in the present litigation: statutory safeguards for the benefit of third parties are impinged upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Just as the liquidation process (see [154] above) engages statutory safeguards for the benefit of third parties, so too does a company’s obligation to lodge documents with ACRA under the Companies Act. ACRA’s register is the public face of a company. Thus, the register is open to inspection by any person for any reason or for no reason subject only to payment of the prescribed fee: s 12(2) of the Companies Act. There is an obvious public interest in ensuring that a company fulfils its filing obligations. Thus, a failure to file documents as required by the Companies Act is a criminal offence: s 407(1) of the Companies Act. And any member or creditor of a company which is in default of a filing obligation can, if the default is not cured after 14 days’ notice, seek a court order to compel the company and its officers to comply with that obligation: s 13(1) of the Companies Act. There is equally a public interest in ensuring that a company, in any document which it lodges, takes care to state accurately the particulars required by the Companies Act. Thus, s 12B of the Companies Act provides that a company cannot correct any particular recorded in ACRA’s register without a Court order. The only exception is if the particular to be corrected is a mere typographical or clerical error which is unintended and has not caused prejudice to any person. Only in that case does the Companies Act permit ACRA’s register to be corrected without a court order under s 12C or s 12D of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 A company’s obligation to lodge its accounts under the Companies Act is of a particularly public character. The purpose of that obligation is so that creditors and potential creditors can access the accounts to assess the creditworthiness of the company before taking a decision to extend credit to or withdraw credit from the company. That is why the Companies Act requires a company’s accounts to reflect a true and fair view of its financial position and performance and, if it is a parent company, to be consolidated to reflect a true and fair view of the group’s financial position and performance: ss 201(2) and 201(5) of the Companies Act. That is also why the Companies Act requires a company’s accounts to be lodged and available for public inspection: s 197(2) of the Companies Act read with Regulations 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 36(2) of the Companies (Filing of Documents) Regulations (Cap 50, Rg 7, 2005 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I am conscious that the “matter” in this litigation, as I have found, is whether the defendant has adopted or approved the 2015 Accounts in breach of the Articles. Whether the 2015 Accounts reflect a true and fair view of the defendant’s financial position and performance for the 2015 financial year is no part of the dispute in this litigation. But if the plaintiff is correct: (a) the public face of the defendant has disclosed inaccurate information – to put it neutrally – to its creditors and potential creditors since August 2017; and (b) that information will have to be expunged from the register. To my mind, that engages the public interest in the “matter” which is at the heart of this litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I need say nothing further on arbitrability. As I have said, the plaintiff raised it only obliquely in its written submissions and did not argue it with any great enthusiasm in its oral submissions. In any event, having rested my decision on the proper construction of s 6(1) of the IAA and cl 29.2 of the Investment Agreement, it is not necessary for me to decide the question of arbitrability in order to dispose of this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 For the reasons above, I have allowed the plaintiff’s appeal and set aside the assistant registrar’s stay of this litigation. I have also ordered the Company to pay the plaintiff’s costs fixed at $18,000 including disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Also before me is the Company’s application for an order sealing the court’s file in this litigation. That application is premised on a stay being granted and the parties’ dispute being referred to arbitration. If I had agreed with the Company’s submissions, the sealing order would have followed virtually as a matter of course to preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration. My decision against the Company, however, defeats the premise of the sealing application. I have therefore dismissed the sealing application and ordered the Company to pay the plaintiff’s costs of that application fixed at $500 including disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I mentioned at the outset that the defendant’s appeal to the Court of Appeal has been brought with my leave. When I granted that leave, the defendant asked for an interim stay of this litigation pending the outcome of the appeal and, in the meantime, for the court’s file in this matter to be sealed and for these grounds of decision to be anonymised.
