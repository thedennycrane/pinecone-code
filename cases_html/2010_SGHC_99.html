        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present proceedings concern the estate of
                    the late Mr Lim Hong Choon (“LHC”), who came to Singapore in
                    the 1940s, returned to China for good in 1959, and died there in 1981. The
                    plaintiffs, who claim to be LHC’s children, were described by their
                    counsel as “simple folk from a rural part of China who simply want their
                    fair share of what had been wrongfully taken from them”. However,
                    according to the defendants, the plaintiffs’ claim is “a tale of
                    greed in its most unappealing form”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first plaintiff, Mr Lim Weipin
                    (“LW”), and his wife, the second plaintiff, Mdm Lim Yuyan
                    (“LY”), reside in Fujian, China. LW claims that he is LHC’s
                    adopted son while LY claims that she is LHC’s biological daughter. On the
                    basis that they are LHC’s children, they relied on the Intestate
                    Succession Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to
                    claim two-thirds of the shares that LHC allegedly held in a partnership, Chop
                    Hup Seng Huat (“the partnership”). They also contended that
                    LHC’s shares in the partnership are traceable to shares in a company, Hup
                    Seng Huat Pte Ltd (“the company”), which was set up in 1973 and is
                    now a public listed company called “Hupsteel Limited”
                    (“HupSteel”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiffs asserted in their Statement of
                    Claim that LHC’s eldest son, the late Mr Lim Tian Siong
                    (“Siong”), impersonated LHC in 1952 in order to take over
                    LHC’s shares in the partnership. This explains why they are suing
                    Siong’s children, who are the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant,
                    Mr Lim Boh Chuan (“LBC”), the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant, Mr Lim Puay Koon, and the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    defendant, Mdm Lim Siew Bee. The administrators of Siong’s estate are
                    the 4<sup>th</sup> defendants and the administrators of the
                    estate of Siong’s wife, Mdm Goh Choon Eng “GCE”), are
                    the 5<sup>th</sup> defendants. The plaintiffs contended that the
                    defendants are constructive trustees of LHC’s shares in the partnership
                    and of the shares in the company that were allegedly exchanged for LHC’s
                    shares in the partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendants, who did not accept that LW is
                    LHC’s adopted son or that LY is LHC’s biological or legitimate
                    child, resisted the claim against them on a number of grounds, including the
                    plaintiffs’ lack of <em>locus standi</em> to commence
                    the suit, lack of proof of impersonation of LHC by Siong and the fact that the
                    claim against them is time-barred. The defendants also asserted that even if LHC
                    had shares in the partnership, those shares have nothing to do with
                    Siong’s shares in the company because the partnership, which continued
                    until 1983, was not converted to the company, which was formed much earlier in
                    1973.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Three brothers, LHC, Mr Lim Boon Kee
                    (“LBK”) and Mr Lim Boon Wan (“LBW”), who have
                    all passed away, came to Singapore from Fujian around 1940.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In 1947, LBK and LBW set up the partnership,
                    which traded in iron, steel, copper and brass materials obtained from used cars,
                    machinery and ships. It is evident from the records filed with the Registry of
                    Business Names at the material time that LHC was not one of the founding
                    partners of the partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In 1952, a third person joined the partnership.
                    His name was stated on the registration certificate issued by the Registrar of
                    Business Names as “Lim Hong Choon alias Lim Tian Siong”. The
                    plaintiffs claimed that this third partner was in fact LHC and that Siong added
                    his name as an alias of Lim Hong Choon in order to impersonate him for the
                    purpose of taking over his shares in the partnership. However, the defendants
                    contended that the third partner was in fact Siong, whose alias was “Lim
                    Hong Choon”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At this juncture, it must be noted that the
                    persons who have actual knowledge of the partnership’s affairs in the 1952
                    are dead and the plaintiffs’ claim rested on their own speculation as to
                    why the third partner was named “Lim Hong Choon alias Lim Tian
                    Siong”. It is also noteworthy that both LHC and Siong used a number of
                    aliases. Siong was known as “Lim Tian Siong alias Lim Thian Siong alias
                    Lim Thiam Siong alias Lim Hong Choon”. In its letters, the Inland Revenue
                    Department addressed him as “Lim Thian Siong alias Lim Hong
                    Choon”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In 1959, LHC left Singapore and returned to
                    China for good.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 10 March 1970, another registration
                    certificate of the partnership was issued by the Registrar of Business Names.
                    The three partners were stated as LBK, LBW and Siong and their respective
                    identity card numbers were stated in the said form under their
                names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     LBK died on 11 July 1973, after which
                    another registration certificate dated 19 July 1973 was issued by the
                    Registrar of Business Names in respect of the change of members of the
                    partnership. LBK was named as the withdrawing partner and his estate was listed
                    as the new partner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 31 July 1973, LBW and Siong
                    incorporated the company. Both of them were the subscriber shareholders and
                    initial directors of the company. The company’s shares were allowed in the
                    following proportions: 700 for LBW and his family, 700 for LBK’s family
                    and 600 for Siong. It is common ground that LHC was no longer in Singapore at
                    the material time and that he did not work in or for the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Although the plaintiffs claimed that the
                    partnership was converted to the company, the fact is that the partnership
                    continued to operate after the company was formed. In fact, on 20 September
                    1974, one year after the company was formed, the partnership was renamed
                    “Hup Seng Huat” and it continued to operate on its own and it even
                    sold a property to the company in 1975.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 26 February 1981, LHC, who had
                    suffered a stroke in 1974, died intestate in China. No registration certificate
                    to reflect a change of partners in the partnership was filed after his
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 27 June 1983, almost ten years after
                    the company was formed, the partnership was finally terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 23 August 1983, Siong, who had a
                    relatively short life, died intestate in Singapore. His wife, GCE, and his
                    children inherited his assets. GCE passed away intestate on 26 July
                    1992.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In 1994, the company became a public listed
                    company named Hup Seng Huat Co Ltd. In 2005, the company’s name was
                    changed to “Hupsteel Limited”
                (“HupSteel”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 8 June 2003, LHC’s brother, LBW, who
                    had been quite generous to the plaintiffs, passed away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant,
                    LBC, said that LW tried to borrow a few million dollars from him in 2003. LW
                    admitted that he asked LBC for a loan and that he told LBC that he owed a few
                    million dollars to someone in China. LBC contended that after he refused to lend
                    LW any money, the plaintiffs resorted to intimidation, blackmail and the
                    institution of the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In 2006, the plaintiffs instructed a Chinese
                    law firm, Beijing Zhong Ji (“BZJ”), to act for them. BZJ sent a
                    letter to LBC on 12 September 2006, which included the following
                    paragraphs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As Mr Lim Hong Choon’s son, Lim Tian Siong, disregarded
                        morality and law, revised and distorted the company registration documents,
                        passed himself off as his father, and snatched Mr Lim Hong
                        Choon’s share and property in Chop Hup Seng Huat and Hoe Seng Huat. He
                        even used the illegal income to establish other company and get a huge sum
                        of wealth. After Lim Tian Siong … died, Mr Lim Boh Chuan applied
                        to receive inheritance by judicature channel and became the real occupant of
                        Lim Tian Siong’s huge sum of illegal wealth ….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We hope Mr Lim Boh Chuan and Lim Puay Koon contact our lawyer
                        ZhangYing within 10 days after [receiving] our letter of demand and to
                        consult and discuss with each other to get a good way to settle the
                        historical problem, and to avoid using the media report or judicature
                        channel to settle the problem, which is disadvantageous for all
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     LBC instructed Shook Lin &amp; Bok
                    (“SLB”) to reply to BZJ on 29 September 2006. In its reply,
                    SLB stated that its client denied the allegations in BZJ’s letter of
                    12 September 2006. However, BZJ continued to make similar allegations in
                    their subsequent letters to SLB on 16 October 2006, 14 November 2006
                    and 21 November 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     LBC and LPK regarded the allegations in
                    BZJ’s letters of 12 September 2006, 16 October 2006,
                    14 November 2006 and 21 November 2006 as defamatory. They applied for
                    an injunction restraining the plaintiffs from publishing defamatory statements
                    “similar to the words and meaning contained in 4 letters issued under the
                    letterhead of the plaintiffs’ Beijing solicitors dated 12 September
                    2006, 16 October 2006, 14 November 2006 and 21 November
                    2006”. The injunction was granted by Justice Lai Siu Chiu on
                    1 December 2006. BZJ declined to accept service of the injunction on the
                    plaintiffs’ behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In July 2008, the plaintiffs instituted
                    the present action against the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Expert Witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiffs and the defendants called
                    expert witnesses on Chinese law to testify on a number of issues relating to
                    Chinese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendants’ expert witness,
                    Mr Zhang Zhiqiang (“ZZQ”), who is from Jingtian &amp;
                    Gongcheng Attorneys, was a rather helpful witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiffs’ expert witness was
                    Mdm Zhang Ying (“ZY”), a director of BZJ. In her curriculum
                    vitae that was furnished to the court, she had stated that English is one of her
                    “working languages” and that she is able to “provide legal
                    services in Chinese (Mandarin), English and French”. Remarkably, when
                    questioned, ZY categorically denied that English was one of her “working
                    languages” and she insisted on testifying in Mandarin with the assistance
                    of a court interpreter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     ZY did not fulfil her duty to the court as an
                    expert witness. In <em>Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v Technology
                        Inc</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491, the Court of Appeal pointed
                    out (at [60]) that an expert’s duty to the court is of such central
                    importance that O 40A r 2(h) of the Rules of Court makes it a requirement that
                    the expert report contains “a statement that the expert understands that
                    in giving his report, his duty is to the Court and that he complies with that
                    duty”. The Court of Appeal endorsed (at [73]) GP Selvam J’s
                    statement in <em>Ganapathy Muniandy v Khoo James</em>
                    [2001] SGHC 165 at [12.16] that any special relationship between the party and
                    his expert must be disclosed in the expert’s report. In the present case,
                    ZY did not disclose in her report that she and her law firm had acted for the
                    plaintiffs with respect to the claim against the defendants. When cross-examined
                    by Mr Davinder Singh SC (“Mr Singh”), the counsel for
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendants, ZY tried to hide this fact. The relevant part of the
                    cross-examination is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If you have any relationship with any party, you
                            must disclose it. “Yes” or
                        “no”?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes….</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Have you at any time before affirming your affidavit
                            acted for the plaintiffs in connection with the dispute that is
                            presently in this court? “Yes” or “no”
                            please.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     When questioned further, ZY merely conceded
                    that her law firm had acted for the plaintiffs. Mr Singh then pointed out
                    that BZJ’s letter to LBC dated 12 September 2006 had invited the
                    latter to contact a “Zhang Ying” from the said law firm to discuss
                    the plaintiffs’ claim. ZY wasted the court’s time by saying that she
                    needed to see the Chinese version of the said letter before she could know
                    whether she is the “Zhang Ying” mentioned in the said letter.
                    After reading the Chinese version of the letter, ZY finally admitted that she
                    had acted for the plaintiffs with respect to their claim against the defendants.
                    The relevant part of the proceedings is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So, now, are you the Zhang Ying referred to [in the
                            letter of 12 September 2006]?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>

<em>So contrary to your evidence

</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>Yes…</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[The 1st plaintiff, LW] gave evidence yesterday that
                            he instructed your firm. <em>The person in the firm that
                                he instructed in 2006 was you, correct?</em></span></p>

<em>Yes</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     After admitting that she had acted for the
                    plaintiffs, ZY revealed that after studying the plaintiffs’ case, she had
                    written a number of letters to SLB. She testified that she believed that her
                    accusations against the defendants including that of impersonation, which is the
                    foundation of the plaintiffs’ claim, are true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Finally, it ought to be noted that when LW
                    took medical leave for two days in the middle of his cross-examination, ZY met
                    him for dinner on the day that she herself had been cross-examined. This led
                    Mr Singh to suggest that she must have met LW to discuss how LW could
                    tailor his evidence to take into account her own evidence when she knew that LW
                    was not supposed to discuss his evidence with anyone at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Why ZY was called as an expert witness for
                    this case cannot be readily understood. Her testimony about her involvement with
                    the plaintiffs’ case certainly undermined her credibility as an impartial
                    expert witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether LW and LY are LHC’S children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiffs are entitled to rely on the Act
                    to advance their claim against the defendants only if they are LHC’s
                    children. Rule 3 of s 7 of the Act provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the rights of the surviving spouse, if any, the estate…
                        of an intestate who leaves issue shall be distributed by equal portions per
                        stirpes to and <em>amongst the children</em> of the
                        person dying intestate and such persons as legally represent those children,
                        in case any of those children be then dead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Section 3 of the Act defines a
                    “child” as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this Act —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">"child" means a <em>legitimate</em> child and
                            <em>includes any child adopted</em> by virtue of an
                        order of court under any written law for the time being in force in
                        Singapore, Malaysia or Brunei Darussalam.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether LW is LHC’s adopted son</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     LW claimed that he was adopted by LHC and his
                    third wife, Mdm Chen Yan Shi, when he was 5 years old. To support his
                    claim, he submitted a notarial certificate issued by one Xu Jing Hong from the
                    Nan’an Notary Public Office (“the notarial certificate”), a
                    family ancestral book and photographs of LHC’s funeral and LHC’s
                    mother’s tombstone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The notarial certificate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     There is some confusion as to what the
                    notarial certificate purports to say because LW furnished two translated
                    versions of the certificate to the court. The first translated version is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is to certify that the applicant Lin Wei Pin is the <em>foster</em> son of the related person Lin Feng Chu (Lim
                        Hong Choon).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The other translated version of the notarial
                    certificate provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is to certify that the applicant Lin Wei Pin is the <em>adopted</em> son of the related person Lin Feng Chu (Lim
                        Hong Choon).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiffs relied on <em>Wong Kai Woon alias Wong Kai Boon v Wong Kong Hom alias Ng Kong Hom &amp;
                        Others</em> [2000] 1 SLR 546 (“<em>Wong Kai Woon</em>”), where notarial certificates were
                    admitted as evidence. Whatever may have been decided in that case, it cannot be
                    overlooked that in the present case, the defendants pointed out that there was
                    no evidence of the authenticity of the notarial certificate submitted by
                    LW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Furthermore, there was credible evidence from
                    the defendants’ expert witness, ZZQ, that the notarial certificate is not
                    in the prescribed form required by Chinese law. In his written opinion, he
                    explained as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under Chinese law, this document, <em>even if
                            authentic</em>, shall be <em>given little or no
                            evidential value with respect to proving an adoptive
                            relationship</em> between [LW] and [LHC] in a Chinese
                        court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The document entitled “Notarial Deed of
                            Relative Relationship” does not comply with the prescribed form
                            under Chinese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Under Chinese law, a Notarial Deed of Relative
                            Relationship which does not comply with the prescribed form shall be
                            given little or no evidential value in a Chinese court applying Chinese
                            law; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The document entitled “Notarial Deed of
                            Relative Relationship” has not been properly legalized by the
                            embassy or consulate in accordance with the procedure under Chinese
                            law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Elaborating on the third of the
                    above-mentioned reasons, ZZQ explained the rules regarding use of notarial deeds
                    of relationship <em>outside China</em> in the following
                    succinct terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under Article 27 of the Interim Regulations on Notarization, <em>prior to being delivered for use overseas</em>, a
                        Notarial Deed of Relative Relationship has to be legalized by the competent
                        authorities of the Chinese Government (ie the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
                        or the foreign affairs office of the province, autonomous region or
                        municipality directly under the Central Government) and the embassy or
                        consulate of the foreign country in China. <em>The
                            document</em> entitled “Notarial Deed of Relative
                        Relationship”
                        <em>produced by the 1st Plaintiff has not been legalized by
                            the embassy or consulate in accordance with Chinese
                        law</em>….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiffs’ expert witness, ZY, had
                    no real answer to ZZQ’s assertion regarding the deficiency of the notarial
                    certificate. The relevant part of the cross-examination of ZY is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You have read the expert evidence of my expert,
                            right, Zhang Zhiqiang, Right?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And my expert has annexed the [proper form to prove
                            an adoption], correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">My expert has commented on the effect of not
                            complying with the form, right? “Yes” or
                            “no”?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>But then I felt it had nothing to
                                do with what I have stated in paragraph 7</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In her report at [7], ZY had merely made the
                    following general statement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, the notarial certificates as produced by the 1st and
                        2nd plaintiffs, are the only forms of proof that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs
                        may produce to certify their kinship and relationship with the late LIM HONG
                        CHOON under the Chinese laws during their (sic) 1950s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It follows that ZY did not effectively counter
                    the assertions of ZZQ as to why the notarial certificate is deficient under
                    Chinese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the plaintiffs’ closing submissions,
                    it was asserted that “there could never be a notarial certificate of
                    adoption issued for [LW] as he was adopted in 1959 when … there was no
                    system in China of a record of adoption”. This misses the point as what
                    matters is the date of the notarial certificate presented to the court, which
                    was purportedly issued on 15 October 2004, and not the date of adoption.
                    ZZQ pointed out that under Chinese law, notarial certificates for adoptions
                    registered after 1993 had to be in the prescribed form. In regard to the
                    notarial certificate, I prefer ZZQ’s evidence over that of
                ZY.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Another point canvassed by the plaintiffs is
                    that the notarial certificate should be admitted under ss 76 and 80 of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”).
                    Sections 76 and 80 of the EA cannot be relied on by LW because they concern
                    public documents. In <em>Sturla v Freccia</em> (1880)
                    LR 5 App Cas 623 at 643, Lord Blackburn explained that a public document
                    means “a document that is made for the purpose of the public making use
                    of it, and being able to refer to it”. LW’s notarial certificate is
                    intended for his private use. In any case, s 80 of the EA only concerns
                    original copies of public documents or copies certified “by the legal
                    keeper thereof” under specified conditions. As has been mentioned, LW
                    failed to prove the authenticity of the notarial certificate, which is, in any
                    case, not in the form required by Chinese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the reasons already stated, I hold that
                    the notarial certificate does not establish that LW is LHC’s adopted
                    son.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The ancestral book </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As for the ancestral book, which was relied on
                    by the plaintiffs as a record of their family tree, it was most unsatisfactory
                    that the book was not produced for the perusal of the defendants before the
                    trial. On the <em>final</em> day of the trial, the
                    plaintiffs suddenly produced what they claimed to be the family’s
                    ancestral book. After perusing it, the defendants’ expert witness, ZZQ,
                    was unable to confirm the authenticity of the said book. He also pointed out
                    that there were inconsistencies between LW’s date of birth in the
                    ancestral book and in the notarial certificate. There was also an inconsistency
                    with respect to LY’s date of birth in the ancestral book and in another
                    document submitted by LY to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     When cross-examined, LW admitted that he had
                    no personal knowledge as to who made the entries in the alleged ancestral book.
                    The following part of the cross-examination of LW merits attention:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[A]nd so you would take this book whenever a boy is
                            born to somebody to update it, right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, no, it’s not done this way. What
                            happened would be that <em>after a collection of 10 or
                                twenty years, maybe thirty years, then there would be a
                                standardization of all the names and then all these records would be
                                entered in the book</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     If the names in the alleged ancestral book are
                    updated only after 10, 20 or 30 years, the accuracy of the entries therein
                    cannot be confirmed when one does not know who gave the instructions for the
                    updating of the said book, and especially so when it contains discrepancies
                    relating to the birth of both LW and LY.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     ZY claimed that ancestral books are often used
                    by Chinese courts to prove family relationships. She stated as follows in her
                    expert report annexed to her affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”) at [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Chinese law, the family ancestral book is an important book that
                        depicts the history and origins of the family... It is compiled by a
                        specialist in this area and new names shall only be added during a very
                        formal and grand ritual. The Book is then passed down from generations to
                        generations. Accordingly, this book is recognised in Chinese law and is
                        often used in the Chinese Courts to prove blood ties and relationship. Also,
                        in the Chinese society, ancestral books like these are widely
                        recognized.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     However, ZZQ took a totally different view.
                    When questioned by Mr Singh, he referred to ZY’s opinion and
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not agree with what is [stated by ZY] …. [T]his ancestral book
                        in China is planned and compiled by every … clan in the social
                        organization…. <em>It is not produced by …
                            authorities or the government departments to prove … blood
                            relationship</em>. As such, during the compilation, it is not
                        constrained by government departments. <em>It also does not
                            have any requirements in meeting the regulations</em>…. In
                        the courts, the truth of it has very little strength of evidence .... or
                        certification. <em>In the Chinese courts, the ancestral book,
                            as or approved evidence, has to be put together with the other evidence
                            as a chain of evidence. It has to be judged by the
                        courts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In relation to the ancestral book, I prefer
                    the more balanced approach of ZZQ over ZY’s evidence. I thus find that the
                    ancestral book, the authenticity of which was rightly challenged by the
                    defendants, is of no value in proving that LW is LHC’s adopted son or that
                    LY is LHC’s biological daughter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The photographs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     LW contended that photographs of him in white
                    mourning attire at LHC’s funeral and of LHC’s mother’s
                    tombstone in China corroborate his claim that he is LHC’s adopted
                    son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The donning of funeral attire by a person does
                    not, without more, prove that he or she is an adopted or a biological child of
                    the deceased. LHC died in China and it is highly likely that LW, who took care
                    of him until he passed away, made the arrangements for LHC’s funeral. It
                    was open to him to wear white mourning attire. As such, the photograph in
                    question does not, by itself, establish that LW is LHC’s adopted
                    son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As for LHC’s mother’s tombstone
                    (“the tombstone”) in China, LW claims that the fact that his name
                    appears on the tombstone shows that he is related to LHC. What is engraved on a
                    tombstone depends on the instructions given to the engraver by the person who
                    ordered its erection. LW stated in his AEIC at [29] that he was “solely
                    in charge” of the erection of the tombstone. If this is so, there is
                    nothing to stop him from instructing the engraver to add his name onto the
                    tombstone. As such, the fact that his name is found on the tombstone cannot,
                    without more, prove that he is LHC’s adopted son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In the plaintiffs’ closing submissions,
                    reliance was placed on s 32(f) of the EA for the admission of the
                    inscriptions on the tombstone as evidence. The reliance on s 32(f) of the
                    EA is misplaced for the simple reason that it concerns statements regarding the
                    “relationship by blood marriage or adoption <em>between
                        persons deceased</em>”. As LW is claiming that he is related to
                    the late LHC, s 32(f) of the EA is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Foster son or adopted son</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     There is a yet another reason why LW did not
                    establish that he is LHC’s adopted son. While an adopted child is entitled
                    under the Act to a share of the deceased’s parent’s estate, a foster
                    child is outside the ambit of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     When cross-examined, LW accepted that he knew
                    that there is a difference between an adopted son and a foster son. The relevant
                    part of the cross-examination is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You’ve agreed with me that an adopted son is
                            one who is legitimately part of the family?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s correct….</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>And would you agree with me that
                                a foster son is not a legitimate member of the
                            family?</em>
</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>That’s
                            correct</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Despite knowing about the difference between
                    an adopted son and a foster son, LW referred in his AEIC to himself as a
                    “foster” son and to LHC as his “foster” father. For
                    instance, he referred at [4] to a notarial certificate that verifies “the
                        <em>foster</em> relationship between Lim Hong Choon and
                    I”. Furthermore, LW stated in his AEIC at [6] that he had been adopted by
                    his “foster” parents because his “foster father, being
                    Hokkien, was interested to look for a boy to ensure continuity in the
                    family”. Finally, he stated in his AEIC at [33] that he and LY suspected
                    that “my foster father may have assets in
                Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     LW tried to distance himself from the use of
                    the word “foster” in his AEIC, claiming that he does not
                    understand English. However, this excuse cannot be countenanced as LW admitted
                    that the AEIC had been translated to him in Mandarin by his counsel,
                    Mr Irving Choh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I thus find that LW did not prove that he was
                    an adopted son rather than a foster son. As such, he has no claim to LHC’s
                    assets under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The family tree chart in LW’s AEIC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs
                    relied on <em>Wong Kai Woon</em> (<em>supra</em>, at [40]) to support their assertion that the family tree
                    chart produced by LW to the court is admissible as evidence under s 159 of
                    the EA to corroborate their claim that they are LHC’s children. Section
                    159 of the EA, which concerns the use of <em>former</em>
                    statements of a witness to corroborate later testimony as to the same fact, is
                    not applicable in the present case because the family tree chart relied on by
                    the plaintiffs is not a “former” statement. It appears in
                    LW’s AEIC and was produced for the sole purpose of supporting his claim to
                    a share of LHC’s estate. In any case, the chart is inaccurate as it showed
                    that LHC had four children whereas LW testified that LHC had six
                    children.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As LW did not establish that he is LHC’s
                    adopted son, his claim against the defendants is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether LY is LHC’S biological daughter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     LY had merely pleaded that she is LHC’s
                    biological daughter. This is rather puzzling as she is only entitled to rely on
                    the Act if she is LHC’s <em>legitimate</em> child. In
                        <em>AAG v Estate of AAH, deceased</em>
                    [2009] SGCA 56, the Court of Appeal reiterated at [22] and [38(c)]
                    that the Act excludes an illegitimate child from succeeding to his or her
                    parent’s intestate estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     LY was born in 1953, several years before her
                    mother married LHC in 1958. In their Reply to the Defence, the plaintiffs
                    pleaded as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">LIM HONG CHOON married his third wife, one named [Chen Yan Shi] in Fujian,
                        China, sometime in 1958. <em>At that time, the 2nd Plaintiff
                            was only about four years of age</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It follows that even if LY was LHC’s
                    biological child, she was not his legitimate child when she was born. When
                    cross-examined, LW contradicted his pleaded case and claimed that he had
                    “heard” that LHC married LY’s mother before 1949. Neither he
                    nor LY offered any proof of this new position and no attempt was made to amend
                    the plaintiffs’ pleadings regarding the date of the marriage between LHC
                    and Chen Yen Shi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     There was no evidence before the court that LY
                    was legitimated in any way after her mother married LHC. In his closing
                    submissions, LY’s counsel referred to s 9(1) of the Legitimacy Act
                    (Cap 162, 1985 Rev Ed), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the parents of an illegitimate person marry or have married one
                        another, whether before, on or after 18th May 1934 and the father of the
                        illegitimate person was or is, <em>at the time of the
                            marriage, domiciled in a country other than Singapore, by the law of
                            which the illegitimate person became legitimated by virtue of the
                            subsequent marriage</em>, that person, if living, shall within
                        Singapore be recognised as having been so legitimated from 17th May 1934 or
                        from the date of the marriage, whichever last happens, notwithstanding that
                        his father was not at the time of the birth of that person domiciled in a
                        country in which legitimation by subsequent marriage was permitted by
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Section 9(1) of the Legitimacy Act
                    requires LY to prove that she was legitimised by virtue of the subsequent
                    marriage under Chinese law. No evidence of Chinese law on legitimacy was
                    tendered by her. On this basis alone, LY’s claim against the defendants
                    may be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Even if the presumption of similarity of law
                    applies, and I am not saying that the presumption applies in this case, and
                    Singapore law is applicable, LY’s case does not go any further.
                    Section 9(1) of the Legitimacy Act is only relevant where the <em>parents</em> of an illegitimate child marry. In <em>Principles of Family Law in Singapore</em> (Butterworths
                    Asia, 1997) at pp 608-609, Professor Leong Wai Kum rightly pointed out that
                    legislation allows a child who was illegitimate at birth as his or her parents
                    were not married to each other, to acquire legitimate status when the parents
                    subsequently marry each other <em>and not, simply on any
                        subsequent marriage of the mother with any man</em>” (emphasis
                    added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     LY produced a “Certificate of Relative
                    Relationship” from the Sanbao Villagers Committee, Liucheng Subdistrict
                    Office, Nan’an City (“the village committee’s
                    certificate”), which stated that she is LHC’s biological daughter.
                    The defendants rightly objected to this document as the makers of the document
                    were not called as witnesses and one does not know the grounds on which the
                    village committee decided that LY is LHC’s biological daughter. In any
                    case, the defendants’ expert witness, ZZQ, testified that a village
                    committee had no authority to determine kindred relationships. He explained as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The document entitled “Certificate of Relative Relationship”
                        produced by [LY] states that it has been issued by the Residents’
                        Committee of Fujian Province. According to Article 5 of the Organic Law of
                        the Residents’ Committees of Fujian Province, the Residents’
                        Committee <em>does not have the authority to prove kindred
                            relationships</em>. Therefore, even if the document entitled
                        “Certificate of Relative Relationship” is authentic, it shall
                        be given little or no evidential value with respect to proving the existence
                        of a family relationship (father and biological daughter) under Chinese
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, under the Notice of Not Allowing Local Office to Issue
                    Certificate, a Certificate of Relative Relationship to be delivered for use
                    overseas shall be issued only by a local notary office. Local residents’
                    committees of the local offices of civil affairs departments are not authorized
                    to accept and handle notarizations related to birth and kinship and required by
                    citizens of China for use overseas. The document entitled “Certificate of
                    Relative Relationship” produced by LY has not been issued by a local
                    notary office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     According to ZZQ, the village
                    committee’s certificate is also of no value because it has not complied
                    with requirements under the Chinese Interim Regulations on Notarization law
                    regarding the use of certificates of relationship overseas. This rule has
                    already been discussed earlier on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     ZZQ’s evidence, as outlined above, was
                    not countered by the plaintiffs’ expert witness, ZY, who had wrongly
                    concluded in her written opinion that LY had produced a notarial certificate to
                    prove her relationship with LHC when only a village committee’s
                    certificate had been produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As for the ancestral book and photographs of
                    the funeral of LHC and of LHC’s mother’s tombstone, these have been
                    already been considered earlier on and need not be considered
                here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As LY did not prove that she is LHC’s
                    biological daughter and legitimate child, her claim against the defendants is
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Alleged Impersonation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Even if the plaintiffs are LHC’s
                    children, they are not entitled to any of the shares in the partnership unless
                    LHC owned shares in the partnership when he died in 1981.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The plaintiffs’ case is that Siong had
                    unlawfully taken over LHC’s shares in the partnership (“LHC’s
                    shares”) by impersonating him in 1952. They then asserted that LHCs
                    shares that were in Siong’s hands were converted to the company’s
                    shares in 1973 and that Siong’s shares in the company that are now in the
                    defendants’ hands are held on constructive trust for LHC’s children,
                    including themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The plaintiffs made a very serious allegation
                    against Siong. In <em>Yogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas
                        Bank</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 788, the Court of Appeal made it
                    clear that the standard of proof for allegations of fraud, forgery or criminal
                    conduct in civil cases is determined in line with <em>Hornal v

                    English Court of Appeal approved the following passage from an earlier judgment
                    of Denning LJ in <em>Bater v Bater</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n civil cases, the case may be proved by a preponderance of probability
                        but there may be degrees of probability within that standard. The degree
                        depends on the subject-matter. A civil court, when considering a charge of
                        fraud, will naturally require for itself a higher degree of probability than
                        that which it would require when asking if negligence is established. It
                        does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even when it is
                        considering a charge of a criminal nature but still it does require a degree
                        of probability which is commensurate with the occasion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     LW outlined his case on Siong’s
                    impersonation of LHC in 1952 in his AEIC at [35] to [40] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    On the forms, I observed <em>some
                                irregularities with respect to the signatures</em>. For
                            instance, in the ACRA form dated 29 August 1952 … against my
                            father’s name, Lim Hong Choon, there was an additional alias name,
                            in both Chinese and English characters, of “Lim Tian
                            Siong”. There was also a cancelled signature. Against the
                            cancelled signature, the Chinese characters of “Lim Hong
                            Choon” was re-signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    For the ACRA form dated 10 March 1970
                            …, my father’s name, “Lim Hong Choon”, was
                            again signed on the first and second pages of the ACRA forms. In
                            addition to the name of “Lim Hong Choon”, there was also
                            an alias name of “Lim Tian Siong” in both Chinese and
                            English characters. At that time, my father was not in Singapore. It is
                            impossible that he could have signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Again, for the ACRA form dated 28 February
                            1972 …, there is no longer a signature of “Lim Hong
                            Choon”. Instead, there are two signatures of “Lim Tian
                            Siong” and in place of Lim Tian Siong’s alias name, there
                            was my father’s (Lim Hong Choon) name. The irregularities continue
                            to be spotted in the ACRA forms dated 19 July
                        1973….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>38</em>
                From these ACRA
                            forms, <em>it is clear that in 1952, order to impersonate
                                my father, LIM TIAN SIONG (deceased) unlawfully adopted the identity
                                of his father, LIM HONG CHOON (deceased), by adding as an
                                alias/previous name of “Lim Tian Siong” and added its
                                Chinese characters against my father’s name on the ACRA
                                form</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    This continued in 1970, 1972 and 1973 where LIM
                            TIAN SIONG (deceased) impersonated the identity of my father again but
                            this time, by switching the name of my father against his and by adding
                            “Lim Hong Choon” in its Chinese character as an
                            alias/previous name against his own name of “Lim Tian
                            Siong”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    Furthermore, it is also clear that LIM TIAN SIONG
                            (deceased) also cancelled his Chinese signature “LIM TIAN
                            SIONG” in place with a signature by the name of LIM HONG CHOON in
                            the ACRA forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In regard to proof of the alleged
                    impersonation by Siong, it has been pointed out that the persons who had any
                    direct knowledge as to what happened in relationship to the partnership’s
                    affairs in 1952 are dead. Thus, the plaintiffs had to speculate on what
                        <em>might</em> have happened in 1952 on the basis of
                    the documents presented by them to the court to prove their allegation of
                    impersonation of LHC by Siong. It is evident from LW’s AEIC at [35] that
                    the plaintiffs’ case on impersonation is premised on their non-expert
                    opinion that there are some irregularities with respect to the signatures of LHC
                    and Siong in the 1952 certificate. The plaintiffs called a handwriting expert,
                    Mr Yap Bei Sing (“YBS”), to testify at the trial about the
                    alleged irregularities. Surprisingly, during the trial, the plaintiffs changed
                    their mind and decided not to call YBS to testify. No reasons were furnished to
                    the court for this abrupt change of mind. The defendants asserted that an
                    adverse inference should be drawn against the plaintiffs for failing to call YBS
                    to testify after having listed him as a witness in these proceedings. They
                    relied on <em>Teng Ah Kow and Another v Ho Sek Chiu and
                        Others</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 43, where the court held at [28]
                    that if a party fails to call a relevant witness without offering any
                    explanation, the court is entitled to presume that such evidence will be
                    unfavourable to the said party. In the present case, whether an adverse
                    inference is drawn or not is quite academic for the simple reason that without
                    YBS’s evidence, the plaintiffs, on whom the burden of proof lay, had
                    nothing to corroborate their allegation on the alleged irregularities regarding
                    the signatures in the 1952 certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Leaving aside the plaintiffs’ lack of
                    proof of irregularities, it is astounding that after having claimed in his AEIC
                    at [38] that Siong impersonated his father in 1952, LW declared when he was
                    cross-examined that he did not know whether or not there was any impersonation
                    of LHC by Siong in 1952. The relevant part of the proceedings is as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Mr Singh then made sure that LW
                    understood what is meant by “impersonation” but LW maintained that
                    he did not know how to explain whether Siong impersonated LHC in 1952. The
                    relevant part of the proceedings is as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Consistent with what LW had alleged in his
                    AEIC, the plaintiffs pleaded in their Statement of Claim at [11] that
                    Siong’s impersonation of LHC commenced in 1952. However, in their Opening
                    Statement, it was asserted at [6] that Siong impersonated LHC when the latter
                    left for China in 1959. The relevant part of the Opening Statement is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>After Lim Hong Choon … left for China in
                            1959</em>, Lim Tian Siong … assumed the identity of Lim
                        Hong Choon … by impersonating Lim Hong Choon … as a partner of
                        [Chop Hup Seng Huat].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>From 1959</em>, Lim Tian Siong (deceased) took
                        all the shares belonging to Lim Hong Choon (deceased).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     When cross-examined on the inconsistency
                    between his AEIC and the plaintiffs’ Opening Statement, LW attempted to
                    salvage his case by saying that what he had really meant in his AEIC at [38] was
                    that the impersonation began <em>after</em>
                1952.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Having testified that he did not know whether
                    there was any impersonation in 1952 and that the impersonation occurred
                        <em>after</em> 1952, LW appeared rather stressed when
                    he was further questioned by Mr Singh. Suddenly, he said that he required a
                    toilet break. When the trial resumed, LW admitted that during the toilet break,
                    he had telephoned his son, Mr Lim Rong Ching, who had been in court to hear
                    him give evidence. This led Mr Singh to suggest that LW had engineered the
                    toilet break to find out how he should answer the question posed to him, a
                    charge which LW denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     When Mr Singh asked him once again
                    whether the impersonation began in 1952, LW hesitated for an inordinately long
                    time before saying that his lawyer will answer the question. When told that he
                    could not pass the buck, LW decided to say that the impersonation began in 1952
                    after all and he added that he would leave it to his lawyer to explain his new
                    position. This <em>volte face</em> did not help LW as the
                    new answer contradicted the plaintiffs’ Opening Statement, which claimed
                    that the impersonation occurred in 1959.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In considering whether the very serious
                    allegation of impersonation by Siong was proven, it must be borne in mind that
                    apart from the impersonation theory offered by the plaintiffs, there are other
                    possible explanations as to why the third person who was admitted into the
                    partnership in 1952 was named “Lim Hong Choon alias Lim Tian
                    Siong”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     To begin with, LW testified that it is a
                    tradition in his family to use an alias for “connecting with
                    forefathers”. If this is so, it was not odd for Siong to take his
                    father’s name as an alias to connect himself to his father or as a mark of
                    respect to the latter. It should not be overlooked that Siong was a partner of
                    his uncle, LBW, in another partnership called Hoe Seng Huat (“other
                    partnership”). In this other partnership’s documents, Siong also
                    used “Lim Hong Choon” as his alias. When cross-examined, LW said
                    that he was not making any claim that Siong’s shares in the other
                    partnership belong to LHC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The plaintiffs had assumed that Siong wanted
                    to steal his father’s shares by using LHC’s name as an alias but
                    Mr Singh pointed out that it is also possible that it was LHC who wanted
                    Siong’s name added as his alias because he wanted to return to China. LY
                    herself testified that LHC regarded China as his home because he had his wife
                    and family there. Furthermore, LW conceded that it is possible that LHC and
                    Siong had both signed the 1952 form in relation to the partnership, in which
                    case Siong did not impersonate LHC. The relevant part of the proceedings is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Any of the following could have happened. <em>Lim Hong Choon could have</em> filled in this form,
                            signed under his own name, and <em>asked Lim Tian Siong
                                to sign under his own name; correct?</em>
                        ….</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, it’s possible.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Mr Singh submitted that even if LHC had
                    been a partner in 1952, it cannot be ruled out that he and Siong had settled the
                    question of ownership of the partnership shares before LHC’s return to
                    China and one cannot assume that Siong had usurped his father’s shares in
                    the absence of sufficient proof of this very serious allegation. It should not
                    be overlooked that LHC, who had to depend on handouts from his brothers and
                    Siong when he was in China, did not inform the plaintiffs, who were his primary
                    caregivers in China, that he had shares in the partnership even though he and
                    the plaintiffs had faced financial hardship and had, according to LW, to eat
                    “thin porridge”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     A relevant question that was not properly
                    answered by the plaintiffs concerns the persons whom Siong had intended to
                    deceive by the alleged impersonation. At first, LW said that Siong did not
                    impersonate “to anyone in particular”. However, his evidence on
                    this matter shifted after an intense barrage of questions from Mr Singh.
                    The relevant part of the proceedings is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[S]o tell us, who was Lim Tian Siong impersonating

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     What also merits attention is that LW agreed
                    that it is possible that LBK and LBW had seen the entries in the 1952
                    certificate before they signed the document. If this was so, they had seen and
                    had not objected to the name “Lim Hong Choon alias Lim Tian Song”
                    in the document. The plaintiffs accepted that LHC’s brother, LBW, was an
                    honest man and a man of integrity and LY even went so far as to agree that the
                    three brothers, LHC, LBK and LBW, would not have allowed anyone to cheat any one
                    of their brothers. It follows that the mystery as to who Siong had tried to
                    mislead by his alleged impersonation of LHC was not adequately addressed by the
                    plaintiffs. Furthermore, as Mr Singh pointed out, if Siong’s
                    objective was to impersonate his father in the records of the partnership in the
                    1950s to mislead someone, there was no reason for him to continue to use
                    LHC’s name as an alias in the context of official documents produced some
                    20 years after the alleged impersonation. Yet the evidence is that he did
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I will now deal with two other matters raised
                    by the plaintiffs to support their case of impersonation. First, they pointed
                    out that the prospectus issued by the company on 22 January 1994 in
                    conjunction with its public listing, had stated as follows at p 33:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chop Hup Seng Huat, the forerunner of the Company was founded in 1941 as a
                        partnership by Mr Lim Boon Wan and his two brothers, Mr Lim Boon
                        Kee and Mr Lim Boon Hong [ie Lim Hong Choon].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Siong’s son, LBC, explained in his AEIC
                    at [35] that the above-mentioned passage in the prospectus “was meant as
                    a mark of respect to the older generation and it was felt that it would not be
                    right to single out LHC by omission”. This is quite different from the
                    position he had taken in an earlier suit, Suit No 799 of 2006, which is that LHC
                    transferred his shares in the partnership to Siong in 1959 before he left for
                    China. In truth, LBC, like the plaintiffs, has no personal knowledge of events
                    in 1952 or 1959 and his evidence as to what could have occurred in the 1950s,
                    like that of the plaintiffs and LY, must be viewed as his speculation as to what
                    might have occurred before he was born. What is clear is that the statement in
                    the company’s prospectus as to who founded the partnership is inaccurate
                    and is contrary to the official records maintained by the Accounting and
                    Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore and its predecessor institutions.
                    The company should be taken to task for printing inaccuracies in its
                    prospectus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Another point made by LW is that Siong was not
                    competent to become a partner in 1952 as he was then only 20 years old. This
                    assertion was not pleaded. In any case, the defendants rightly retorted that
                    even if Siong was not competent to be a partner in 1952, this does not mean that
                    his shares in the partnership automatically became LHC’s shares. In any
                    case, even if the contract of partnership between Siong and his uncles was void
                    in 1952, this did not mean that he did not become a partner after he reached the
                    age of majority. I cannot hold that the fact that Siong was 20 years old proves
                    that he impersonated LHC in 1952 or at any time thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     To sum up, although LW and LY made a very
                    serious allegation against Siong, their case was absolutely confusing and
                    contradictory and it certainly did not meet the requirement stated in <em>Bater v Bater</em> by Denning LJ as “a degree of
                    probability which is commensurate with the occasion”. Evidently, all the
                    possibilities discussed above as to what was the reason for the third partner to
                    be named “Lim Hong Choon alias Lim Tian Siong” involve pure
                    speculation and are referred to for the sole purpose of pointing out that in the
                    absence of adequate proof of the serious allegation of impersonation, the court
                    is in no position to make a finding that Siong had impersonated LHC either in
                    1952 or at any time thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The HupSteel shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     For the sake of completeness, it ought to be
                    noted that whether or not LHC had shares in the partnership, he had none in the
                    company, which was renamed HupSteel in 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Although the records of the company show that
                    the shares in the company were allotted to “Lim Tian Siong”
                    without the alias “Lim Hong Choon”, the plaintiffs insisted as
                    follows in their Reply to the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendants’ Defence at [12]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[L]im Tian Siong was only directly/indirectly able to register himself as
                        an officer/director of Hup Seng Huat Pte Ltd by way of his impersonation and
                        misrepresentation of LIM HONG CHOON in Chop Hup Seng Huat between 1952 and
                        1972.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     LW confirmed that it is his case that the
                    HupSteel shares are part of LHC’s estate for two reasons. First, he
                    alleged that the partnership assets were handed over to the company. Secondly,
                    he claimed that all the shareholders of the company got their shares without
                    having to pay any money because the partnership was converted to the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Contrary to what LW alleged, the
                    partnership’s assets were not handed over to the company when the latter
                    was established in 1973. Indeed, in 1975, the company, which wanted to purchase
                    a property from the partnership, passed the following resolution:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Resolved that the company do hereby purchase the property containing an
                        area of 26,000 square feet from Mr Lim Boon Wan, the trustee of Chop
                        Hup Seng Huat for $400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     LW admitted that the above mentioned property
                    had been sold by the partnership to the company. When cross-examined by
                    Mr Singh, he answered as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">

                                injected into the company on incorporation but was purchased almost

                                that?</em>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    There was thus no basis for LW’s
                    assertion that the assets of the partnership were absorbed by the company
                    without any payment to the partnership. In fact, the partnership operated for
                    another 10 years after the incorporation of the company before it was terminated
                    in 1983.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    LW’s allegation that the shareholders
                    of the company got their shares free of charge because the company took over the
                    partnership was also not substantiated. The evidence is that all the
                    shareholders paid for their shares in cash when the company was incorporated.
                    Siong paid $60,000 for his 600 shares. He was not a man without financial
                    resources. Leaving aside his earnings from the partnership, Siong’s income
                    tax returns at the material time revealed that he had just earned $78,396 from
                    another partnership. Despite the evidence before him, LW stubbornly insisted
                    that Siong used partnership money to pay for his shares. The relevant part of
                    the cross-examination is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can you say where the money came from for Lim Tian
                            Siong to purchase the shares in the company? “Yes” or

                    admit he had no evidence that Siong had used partnership money to pay for his
                    shares. The relevant part of the proceedings is as follows:</p>

                    which was issued in conjunction with its public listing in 1994, stated that the
                    partnership was “converted” to the company. While this may have
                    helped in projecting the image of the company, the statement is clearly wrong in
                    the light of the evidence before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    As the company did not take over the assets
                    of the partnership and as it was not established that Siong had used the
                    partnership’s money to buy his shares in the company, Siong’s shares
                    in the company had nothing do with shares in the partnership. As such, even if
                    the plaintiffs are LHC’s children, they have no claim whatsoever to
                    Siong’s shares in the company that are presently in the defendants’

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The plaintiffs framed their claim against

                    that the limitation period of 12 years provided for under s 23(a) of the

                    of the said Act, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by
                        a beneficiary under a trust, being an action –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of
                            trust to which the trustee was a party or privy; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    to recover from the trustee trust property or the
                            proceeds thereof in the possession of the trustee, or previously
                            received by the trustee and converted to his own use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In regard to s 22(1) of the Limitation
                    Act, the plaintiffs did not plead fraud and they did not adduce any evidence to
                    prove the essential ingredients for a constructive trust, such as the presence
                    of a fiduciary relationship or unconscionable conduct, so as to be in a position
                    to rely on this statutory provision. All that LW was in fact telling the court
                    is that it looked rather suspicious that the third partner who joined the
                    partnership in 1952 was called “Lim Hong Choon alias Lim Tian
                    Siong” and that the only explanation for this oddity must be that Siong
                    impersonated LHC. Much more is required to suggest the existence of a
                    constructive trust. The court cannot, on the basis of speculation as to what
                    might have occurred in the 1950s, hold that Siong committed a fraud when, as has
                    been explained, there are other plausible explanations as to why the third
                    partner used the name “Lim Tian Siong alias Lim Hong Choon”. I
                    thus agree with the defendants that the superficial pleading by the plaintiffs
                    of an alleged impersonation of LHC by Siong is little more than a smokescreen
                    for what are in effect time-barred claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">LW’S conduct and evidence at the Trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    At this juncture, it must be noted that the
                    plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants was seriously undermined by
                    LW’s own conduct during the trial and by the evidence that he gave. On a
                    number of occasions, he declined to answer important questions or elaborate on
                    his answers, saying that he will leave it to his counsel to explain matters.
                    Often enough, his evidence was peppered with inconsistencies, untrue and
                    irrelevant statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    LW’s conduct during the trial must be
                    scrutinized. He was cross-examined on 11th and 12th January 2010. The
                    cross-examination of LW had to be postponed on 13th January 2010 because
                    LW’s counsel furnished to the court a medical certificate showing that he
                    was unfit to attend the trial on that day due to hypertension and
                    hospitalization. On the following day, LW’s counsel submitted yet another
                    medical certificate stating that he was unfit to attend court on that day. To
                    save time, LW’s wife, LY, and their expert witness, ZY, gave evidence
                    while LW was on medical leave. LY and ZY completed their testimony by the time
                    LW turned up in court on 15th January 2010. It is the defendants’
                    case that the medical certificates were obtained by LW to enable LY and ZY to
                    give evidence and thereafter brief LW on what they said before LW returned to be
                    cross-examined again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    LW gave the court the impression that he had
                    rested at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital while he was on medical leave for two
                    days. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So would it be right to say that on 13 January,
                            which was Wednesday, and on 14 January, which was yesterday, Thursday,
                                <em>you spent your entire time resting at the Mt
                                Elizabeth Hospital</em> and had met two persons ie the two
                            ladies you have identified?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>Yes</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Contrary to what he said, LW did not spend
                    the “entire time resting” in the hospital on 13 and
                    14 January 2010. When further questioned, he admitted that on the first
                    day, he went back to his hotel to “wash” himself although the
                    hospital room had bathroom facilities. LW said that he stayed in his hotel for
                    three hours with his wife, who completed giving her oral testimony on that
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    On the next morning, LW obtained another
                    medical certificate to excuse his absence from the court for yet another day.
                    Less than one and a half hours after the medical certificate had been presented
                    to the court, LW checked out of the hospital at around 11.40 am and found time
                    to visit a temple, after which he went shopping with his wife. Initially, LW
                    insisted that he had checked out of the hospital in the afternoon at around 1 pm
                    but he backtracked after he was informed that there was a video-tape of his
                    movements at the hospital’s check-out counter. The following part of the
                    proceedings reveals how evasive and incoherent LW was before he finally admitted
                    that Mr Singh was right:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So you don’t agree that at 11.40 you were
                            checking out for the purpose of leaving Mt Elizabeth? Mr Lim,
                            I ask you to think carefully because I’m telling you that we have
                            a video, so you think very carefully.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, what happened was that this is one place that
                            I was at. But then I was referred to another department to check on my

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    LW next claimed that after he was discharged
                    from the hospital, he rested in the hotel until he had to come to court the next
                    morning. However, Mr Singh asserted that this was untrue because LW had
                    left the hotel on 14 January 2010 to have dinner with his wife, his son and
                    his expert witness, ZY, who had just given evidence on that day. When
                    Mr Singh questioned him about this, the following answers show that LW was
                    again rather evasive:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And then having recovered from your severe
                            hypertension, you had dinner with your wife, your son who has been in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Apart from the controversy surrounding
                    LW’s hospitalization, a few examples of his unsatisfactory evidence may be
                    noted. For a start, LW’s evidence regarding the loan that he had tried to
                    obtain from LBC in 2003, which is as follows, is quite unbelievable:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Do you agree that you asked my clients for a loan in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    A question arises as to how LW, who,
                    together with LY, was described by their counsel as “simple folk from a
                    rural part of China”, managed to borrow a few million Singapore dollars
                    in China. More astonishing is his testimony that he had borrowed the few million
                    dollars from only <em>one</em> lender. What collateral did
                    LW offer to this solitary lender in China for the loan of a few million
                    Singapore dollars?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    LW next claimed that although he was unable
                    to obtain a loan from LBC, he has repaid the few million Singapore dollars that
                    he had borrowed. How did LW, who had, until the death of LBW in 2003, been
                    living on monthly hand-outs of $200 - $250 from his Singapore relatives, get a
                    few million dollars to repay his loan? LW claimed that apart from the monthly
                    handouts from his Singapore relatives, he had another source of income, namely a
                    Chinese company, Hui Lei Stone Company Ltd (“Hui Lei”). He said
                    that he had been receiving payments from Hui Lei since the 1980s. This cannot be
                    true as he had stated in his AEIC at [22] that Hui Lei began its operations only
                    in 1999. It is also to be noted that LW stated in his AEIC at [31] that he had
                    assisted LBW for around 15 years to complete various projects in his hometown
                    and that it was only after the completion of LHC’s mother’s
                    graveyard that he decided to start his own business. He stated in his AEIC at
                    [29] that he completed work on the said graveyard and the road leading to it in
                    2001. It follows that LW could not have received money from Hui Lei from the
                    1980s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    More startling is the fact that LW misled
                    the court that he and his son owned Hui Lei. The relevant part of the
                    cross-examination by Mr Singh, is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Is [Hui Lei] your business?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes. <em>A business that belonged to

<em>No</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    When LW was asked whether he had documents
                    to prove that he is one of the owners of Hui Lei, his initial and irrelevant
                    answer was that he wanted to show the court the medication given to him by the
                    hospital. Subsequently, his counsel produced a Chinese document that merely
                    stated that he is a director of Hui Lei. Mr Singh then revealed that in the
                    official Chinese registry records, Hoe Seng Huat is named as the investor in the
                    company and that there is no indication that LW owns Hui Lei. When asked to
                    comment on these revelations, LW gave the following garbled answer:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now, I would like to show you the search that we
                            were hoping you would give us but which we had to do on your
                            behalf…. You will see, Mr Lim, that as I told you and which
                            you denied, this company is not owned by you, but by Hoe Seng Huat
                            Hardware Company Private Limited of Singapore. Do you agree or disagree?
                            …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, on paper, yes, it does say that. But then only
                            the legal representative would be able to say.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    On the following day, when LW was
                    re-examined by his own counsel on the ownership of Hui Lei, he claimed for the
                    first time that Hoe Seng Huat was named as the sole shareholder of Hui Lei for
                    tax purposes and to make it easier for Hui Lei to obtain import and export
                    licenses. LW’s new evidence was a contrived afterthought which, if true,
                    should have been revealed when he was cross-examined by Mr Singh on the
                    previous day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Finally, although the plaintiffs had pleaded
                    that they were entitled to two-thirds of LHC’s estate, LW contradicted his
                    pleadings when he was cross-examined by claiming that he did not say that he
                    wanted two-thirds and that he had told his lawyer that he wanted to recover what
                    he deserved or was entitled to. However, when he was re-examined by his own
                    counsel, Mr Irving Choh, he suddenly disclosed his intention to distribute
                    to his China siblings their share of LHC’s estate. The relevant part of
                    the proceedings is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And you were also referred to the fact that …
                            you and the 2nd plaintiff are claiming a two-third share of the assets
                            of Lim Hong Choon’s estate? ….</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Among the six of them, five are in China, and of
                            these, two have passed away. One of them is not very much in contact.
                                <em>And because we have a view to settling this suit
                                fast, if this is resolved through this suit, when I return to China,
                                I would distribute</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    LW’s claim that he will distribute
                    what he and his wife receive from LHC’s estate shows how adept he is at
                    tailoring his evidence to suit his case. When cross-examined by Mr Singh,
                    LW did not mention that he or LY claimed any part of LHC’s assets on
                    behalf of his alleged siblings in China. Besides, if, as LW claims, he had three
                    other siblings in China, the plaintiffs and his siblings in China should be
                    claiming five-sixths and not two-thirds of LHC’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    LW has only himself to blame for severely
                    denting his own credibility when he was cross-examined by Mr Singh and
                    re-examined by Mr Choh although it is worth noting that even if he did not
                    do so, the claim brought by him and LY would have nonetheless have failed for
                    the reasons already stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defendants’ other defences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The defendants raised a number of other
                    defences. First, they contended that the plaintiffs’ claim is barred by
                    laches. Secondly, they asserted that the plaintiffs are not in a position to sue
                    them because beneficiaries have no equitable or beneficial interest in any
                    particular asset in an estate which has yet to be administered. Finally, they
                    pointed out that as the distribution of a deceased person’s personal
                    estate is, by virtue of s 4 of the Act, regulated by the law of the country
                    in which he was domiciled at the time of his death and as no evidence had been
                    adduced with respect to Chinese intestacy law, the plaintiffs have not proven
                    that they are entitled to any share of LHC’s estate. In view of the
                    findings which I have made earlier on in this judgment and of the hopelessness
                    of the plaintiffs’ claim, it is unnecessary for me to consider the other
                    defences referred to in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion and Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The findings which I have made may be
                    summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_i"></a>(i)     LW is not entitled to rely on the
                        Act to claim a share of LHC’s estate as he did not prove that he is
                        LHC’s adopted son.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     LY is also not entitled to rely on the Act to claim a
                        share of LHC’s estate as she did not prove that she is LHC’s
                        legitimate daughter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     If LW is LHC’s adopted son and LY is LHC’s
                        legitimate daughter, their claim against the defendants is
                        time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     It was not proven that Siong impersonated LHC in 1952 or at any time
                        thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_v"></a>(v)     The shares of the partners of the partnership were not converted to shares
                        in the company when the company was formed in 1973. As such, even if the
                        plaintiffs are LHC’s children, they have no claim in respect of
                        Siong’s shares in the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    For the stated reasons, the
                    plaintiffs’ claim is dismissed with costs.</p>
