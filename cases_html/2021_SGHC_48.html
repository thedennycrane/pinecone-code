In fact, it was Sanjay who gave instructions to Dzulkarnain regarding the delivery, including the location of the drop-off point at Lorong 37. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Shortly after Dzulkarnain drove off in his van, Sanjay drove into Lorong 37 in his car. He collected the “SKP” box from the drop-off point and drove off. Sanjay was arrested almost immediately thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 As Dzulkarnain and Sanjay were being tailed by different teams of officers from the CNB, it was undisputed that there was a short period of time – estimated to be a few minutes – when the brown box left by Dzulkarnain was not kept under observation by any CNB officer. However, the Prosecution’s position was that the “SKP” box picked up by Sanjay was the very same brown box left by Dzulkarnain. When Sanjay was arrested, he was on the way to perform an onward delivery of the cannabis in the “SKP” box. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 After the “SKP” box was recovered from Sanjay’s car, there was proper custody by the relevant CNB officers to ensure the integrity of the drug exhibits until they were handed over for analysis to be conducted by the HSA.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Apart from relying on the evidence of witnesses, especially the CNB officers, the Prosecution also relied on statements recorded from the accused persons in the course of investigations which were admitted without any objections by the accused persons pursuant to s 258(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). For convenience, I set out some of the contents of these statements in my summaries of the cases for the accused persons, together with the responses of the accused persons to such aspects: see [19]–[21] and [29] below.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 As against Sanjay, the Prosecution also relied on communication records of three out of the five handphones recovered from Sanjay’s car. The relevant communications for the period of 20 to 22 February 2013 were collated in an exhibit entitled “Summary of Telecommunications between B1, B2 &amp; Bala Luk Kor”, otherwise known as “Annex F”. In that period, there were communications between SK-HP1 with the number 81967339 (saved as “Bala” in SK-HP1). During the same period, there were also communications between Dzulkarnain’s handphone DBK-HP1 and the same number (saved as “Boss Bro” in DBK-HP1). Then, on 23 February 2015, the records of SK-HP2 and SK-HP3 showed 24 exchanges with DKB-HP1.

Neither of them was able to rebut the presumption of knowledge. The other elements of the respective charges had also been established. On this basis, the Prosecution contended that the accused persons should be convicted of the respective charges.

For example, the court will generally consider the nature, the value and the quantity of the purported item and any reward for transporting such an item. … <span class="font-italic">Ultimately, what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether his assertion that he did not know the nature of the drugs is true). This depends not only on the credibility of the accused as a witness but also on how believable his account relating to the purported item is.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings in relation to Dzulkarnain </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I now set out my findings in respect of Dzulkarnain. To reiterate, Mr Thuraisingam’s main plank was that the Prosecution did not prove that the brown box Dzulkarnain had delivered was the “SKP” box containing the cannabis: see [23] above. Indeed, Mr Thuraisingam argued that the short gap in time during which the brown box was unmonitored by any CNB officer constituted a “break” sufficient to raise reasonable doubt as to the identity of the drug exhibits. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Affandi bin Rosli v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 440 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Affandi</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39], it was argued that, if a gap in the chain of evidence occurring during police custody cannot sustain a conviction, an acquittal must result <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>where the break occurs before the exhibit enters police custody. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As for the Prosecution, it argued that from the contents of the statements, Dzulkarnain knew that the delivery concerned drugs. As highlighted above at [18], the Prosecution submitted that Dzulkarnain delivered the “SKP” box by depositing it at the drop-off point. Reliance on <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Affandi </span>was misplaced in that the “chain of custody” begins at the point in time when officers seize and take the evidence into custody. Based on the evidence, the “SKP” box was the brown box delivered by Dzulkarnain; it was farfetched to contend otherwise. Dzulkarnain had therefore trafficked in the drugs therein. As this would entail naturally that Dzulkarnain was in possession of the cannabis at the point of delivery, the Prosecution relied on s 18(2) of the MDA to presume Dzulkarnain’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs. Dzulkarnain elected not to give any evidence, and the presumption had not been rebutted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Weight to be accorded to contents of the statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I begin my analysis by considering the contents of Dzulkarnain’s statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I acknowledge that in Dzulkarnain’s s 33B MDA statement (which was the earliest statement to be recorded  from him), Dzulkarnain claimed that he thought the box he delivered contained cigarettes: see [19] above.

</div> However, as further set out in [20] above, from his cautioned statement onwards, Dzulkarnain disclosed that he was paid to collect a brown box of drugs from Tuas and was instructed to deliver the same brown box of drugs to Sanjay at Lorong 37. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 At trial, Mr Thuraisingam suggested that Dzulkarnain, rather than having knowledge that the brown box contained drugs, thought that he was delivering cigarettes. However, IO Ranjeet disagreed that the multiple references in the cautioned statement and the long statements to “drug” and/or “drugs” were not made by Dzulkarnain. In contrast, Dzulkarnain elected not to give evidence. As such, I did not have any explanation from Dzulkarnain how there could have been so many inaccurate references to “drug” and/or “drugs” in his statements.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having considered the contents of all the statements, as well as IO Ranjeet’s evidence, I did not accept the position mentioned only in the s 33B MDA statement and taken by Mr Thuraisingam during the cross-examination of IO Ranjeet that Dzulkarnain thought he was delivering cigarettes. Dzulkarnain chose not to give evidence on this. Further, this point was abandoned in the closing submissions. As admitted by Dzulkarnain in the cautioned statement and the long statements, I found that Dzulkarnain knew that he was collecting a brown box of drugs from Tuas which he then delivered by leaving it at the drop-off point for collection by Sanjay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 At this juncture, I digress to observe that Mr Fernando raised some concerns regarding Dzulkarnain’s statements. Specifically, he pointed out that there were inconsistencies with respect to: (a) his knowledge of the contents of the brown box; (b) the precise location in Tuas where he collected the drugs; (c) the availability of the van for use in the drug drop-off; (d) his knowledge of another Indian male at the meeting with Sanjay at UOB; (e) the mode and transfer of money to himself from Sanjay; and (f) the precise manner of the drug pick-up.

</div>
</div> As against Dzulkarnain, I have already given my reasons for accepting that Dzulkarnain knew that the delivery concerned drugs.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Dzulkarnain delivered the “SKP” box </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The key dispute, of course, centred on whether the brown box delivered by Dzulkarnain was the “SKP” box collected by Sanjay. Admittedly, the Prosecution accepted that nobody from the CNB watched the brown box for a few minutes after it was left behind by Dzulkarnain. In <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Affandi </span>at [39], the Court of Appeal stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is well established that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug exhibits analysed by the HSA are the very ones that were initially seized by the CNB officers from the accused. … <span class="font-italic">This requires the Prosecution to account for the movement of the exhibits from the point of seizure to the point of analysis.</span> In the context of the Prosecution establishing the chain of custody, the Defence may also seek to suggest that there is a break in the chain of custody. <span class="font-italic">This refers not necessarily to challenging the Prosecution’s overall account </span><span class="font-italic">but to showing that at one or more stages, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the chain of custody may have been broken</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As submitted by the Prosecution, I agreed that the applicable principles as to the integrity of the chain of custody were not applicable. Here, the “SKP” box had not yet been taken into custody by the CNB officers. Nonetheless, the heavy onus remained for the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the brown box was the “SKP” box. This was a crucial matter. While it was significant that there had been a gap of time during which the brown box was not monitored by CNB officers, in my view, this was not sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as against the Prosecution’s case. For the reasons that I elaborate below, the entirety of evidence proved that the brown box left at the dustbin was the “SKP” box. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For a start, Dzulkarnain’s description of the appearance, weight and contents of the brown box fitted the same aspects of the “SKP” box. To elaborate, Dzulkarnain did not dispute the portions of his long statement of 10 March 2015 where he estimated that the box weighed 5kg, and that it was a brown box sealed with tape.

</div> When the “SKP” box was recovered by the CNB officers, it was sealed with masking tape. Also, as weighed by IO Ranjeet, the gross weight of the drug exhibits amounted to 4,993.68g <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>about 5kg without taking into account the weight of the “SKP” box.

It was undisputed that there was an arrangement between the parties for a delivery and collection of a brown box at the dustbin at 14 Lorong 37. Pursuant to that arrangement, there was coincidence of time, place (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, behind the green dustbin at 14 Lorong 37) and subject matter (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a sealed brown box) in the delivery and collection. In these circumstances, it was rather farfetched to suggest that Sanjay picked up a wrong box at the green dustbin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Furthermore, I accepted Insp Faizal’s evidence that there was no other brown box at the drop-off point before Dzulkarnain dropped off the brown box, and that there was only that same brown box dropped off by Dzulkarnain as he drove past the drop-off point. Crucially, I reiterate what I said at [49] above that  Sanjay said that he got out of the car and picked up the box from behind the green dustbin (after he was specifically told by Dzulkarnain where the box was). In this regard, I also refer to [81(k)] below where I set out Sanjay’s evidence on this aspect in some detail. To my mind, the possibility that Sanjay missed the brown box dropped off by Dzulkarnain and collected the “SKP” box by mistake was remote. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I turn to deal with Dzulkarnain’s submission that the brown box he dropped off might have been switched with a different box <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “SKP” box. This submission began with the argument that in relation to the green dustbin, the “SKP” box was in a different position from the brown box that Dzulkarnain left behind.

</div> in contrast to Insp Faizal who was able to see a brown box as he drove past. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Based on the apparent contradictions in evidence, Mr Thuraisingam suggested that: (a) the green dustbin had moved during the intervening period between the drop-off and the pick-up; and (b) the brown box near the green dustbin might have been taken by a third party without being detected by the CNB. This was claimed to be likely given that the green dustbin was located next to residential property and was accessible by the general public. Further, given the way drug syndicates operate, it would not be surprising if there were other members of the syndicate (or even other syndicates) in operation at Lorong 37 that day.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I was not persuaded at all that this happened. First, Insp Faizal’s testimony was reconcilable with the accounts of SSSgt Eng and Sgt Hidayat. Insp Faizal did not clarify what “a bit further” from the kerb meant precisely. At the end of the day, it seemed to me that the CNB officers’ evidence was consistent that the green dustbin was near the kerb. Second, assuming that there was an inconsistency in the evidence as to the position of the green dustbin, I was not satisfied that the difference was material and sufficient to overcome the evidence establishing the coincidence of time, place and subject matter. Third, while I did not reject Sanjay’s account that he could not see the “SKP” box when he stopped beside the green dustbin, this certainly did not undermine Insp Faizal’s evidence of what he observed. Insp Faizal was in the middle of a surveillance operation. As he drove past the green dustbin, he certainly would have been alert to the location of the brown box as left behind by Dzulkarnain vis-à-vis the green dustbin. In contrast, Sanjay did not have the benefit of seeing Dzulkarnain’s actions in the vicinity of the green dustbin. He also knew that, in any event, he had to get down the car to collect the brown box.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 To accept that there was a possibility that the “SKP” box was not the brown box dropped off by Dzulkarnain would entail contemplating not only that the brown box dropped off by Dzulkarnain was removed from the scene by a third party (as postulated by Mr Thuraisingam at [53]), but further that the “SKP” box containing drugs was then placed at the location by the same or another third party at around the same time. To my mind, this added another layer of implausibility to Dzulkarnain’s tenuous position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Furthermore, as testified by DSP Qamarul, the street value of 1kg of cannabis at that time was between $1,800 to $2,800. Thus, the “SKP” box contained 5kg of cannabis with an estimated street value of $9,000 to $14,000. As I discuss above at [44], I accepted that Dzulkarnain knew that he was to deliver a box of drugs to Sanjay. If there had been an accidental switch of the two boxes by one or more third parties (as the area was accessible to the general members of the public), it was incredible that the “SKP” box would have involved drugs (and of such a large quantity with such a high value). If there had been an intentional switch of the two boxes by one or more third parties (which Mr Thuraisingam seemingly attributed to members of drug syndicates), there was certainly no suggestion by Dzulkarnain (or even Sanjay) that anyone would wish to implicate them in so serious a matter in such a surreptitious manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 At this juncture, I note that Mr Thuraisingam pointed out that despite the fact that the brown box’s surface and contents had been swabbed, the HSA could not trace Dzulkarnain’s DNA.

</div> In my view, the absence of Dzulkarnain’s DNA on the brown box was, at best, a neutral factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Based on the analysis above, to my mind, it was inconceivable that Dzulkarnain delivered a sealed brown box of drugs weighing about 5kg to the pre-arranged drop-off point at the pre-arranged time for Sanjay’s collection, but that Sanjay collected a wrong<span class="font-italic"> </span>sealed brown box weighing 5kg which contained not simply drugs, but a large quantity of drugs of a high street value. In this regard, I shall deal with Sanjay’s claim that he was meant to collect illegal knives and cigarettes in due course. Significantly, when called to give evidence, Dzulkarnain elected to remain silent. Thus, there was absolutely no evidence from Dzulkarnain even asserting a different version of events from the one that the Prosecution advanced. Dzulkarnain was best-placed to shed light on the matter, but he chose not to do so. As such, I did not think that a reasonable doubt had been cast on the Prosecution’s position that Sanjay picked up the “SKP” box left by Dzulkarnain. Any such doubt raised by Dzulkarnain was fanciful; it did not suffice to constitute a real or reasonable doubt: <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [58]. I should add that in accordance with s 291(3) of the CPC, arising from Dzulkarnain’s refusal to give evidence, I considered it proper to draw an adverse inference against him that he well knew that the “SKP” box was the one he delivered. Nothing put forth before me (including Dr Winslow’s evidence) suggested that “his physical or mental condition” made it “undesirable for him to be called on to give evidence” such that s 291(3) should not have applied by operation of s 291(6) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For all the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the brown box left behind by Dzulkarnain was the “SKP” box that Sanjay picked up. Therefore, Dzulkarnain had trafficked by delivering the “SKP” box of drugs to Sanjay.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Dzulkarnain knew the nature of the drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As Dzulkarnain was proved to be in possession of the box of drugs, by s 18(2) of the MDA, Dzulkarnain was presumed to have known of the nature of that drug. Again, I refer to [44] above where I rejected any suggestion that Dzulkarnain thought he was delivering cigarettes. I found that on a balance of probabilities, Dzulkarnaian had not rebutted the presumption that he had known of the nature of the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the charge against Dzulkarnain, and I convicted him of the charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings in relation to Sanjay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I turn now to my findings in respect of Sanjay. Under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, the Prosecution had to prove that: (a) Sanjay was in possession of the drugs; (b) Sanjay knew the nature of the drugs; and (c) Sanjay was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by delivering the drugs to another party. Prior to dealing with these elements, I turn to the challenge raised by Mr Fernando in relation to the chain of custody of the drug exhibits after they were seized by SI Tay to the time IO Ranjeet handed the exhibits over to the HSA for analysis.

This raises a question as to the sort of knowledge that would have to be shown in order to sustain a finding that the accused person was in fact in possession of the drugs. <span class="font-italic">In our judgment, all that is required in this context of establishing the fact of possession is that the accused person must know of the existence, within his possession, control or custody, of the thing which is later found to be a controlled drug; it is not necessary that the accused person also knows that the thing was in fact a controlled drug, much less its specific nature</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I agreed that based on <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31], it sufficed for the Prosecution to establish that Sanjay knew that the “SKP” box contained “<span class="font-italic">the thing</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>for delivery purposes<span class="font-italic">. </span>In other words, the Prosecution had to show that Sanjay knowingly took possession of the “SKP” box’s contents; the Prosecution was not required to show that he knew that the contents comprised five wrapped-up bundles. I observe, in this regard, that the outcome ultimately arrived at in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> should be understood in the light of the appellant’s contention that he did not even know that the drug bundles were hidden in the suitcase (which was a defence which went towards the question of whether he was in <span class="font-italic">knowing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>possession of the drug bundles), and the Prosecution’s concession that the appellant did not in fact have actual knowledge of the drug bundles within the suitcase: see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31] and [82].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In Sanjay’s oral testimony and statements adduced at trial, Sanjay gave an account that the “SKP” box was collected on behalf of one Boy Lai and he believed that it contained collectors’ hunting knives and possibly contraband cigarettes. He did not know, as such, that the “SKP” box contained five wrapped-up packages. None of the Prosecution witnesses gave evidence at trial to the effect that Sanjay knew that the box contained five wrapped-up packages. It was not disputed that the “SKP” box in question was, as observed by the CNB officers, sealed with masking tape. Neither was it disputed that the five wrapped-up packages did not contain Sanjay’s DNA. That said, at no time did the Prosecution concede that Sanjay did not know of the drug bundles. However, once again, I reiterate that the Prosecution only needed to prove <span class="font-italic">knowledge of the thing</span>.

Sanjay had certainty as to the thing’s existence or mere fact of the thing being within the “SKP” box but not its essence or nature. As the Prosecution argued, it was not Sanjay’s case that he thought that the “SKP” box was empty. As such, I found that Sanjay was in possession of the drugs. To my mind, the nature of Sanjay’s case essentially raised a defence concerning his knowledge of the nature of the drugs; his defence was not about an <span class="font-italic">unknowing </span>possession of the contents of the “SKP” box.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Sanjay knew the nature of the drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 With Sanjay’s possession of the drugs proven, the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs within s 18(2) of the MDA was triggered against Sanjay.

However, on this crucial aspect, Sanjay’s position had evolved over time. Upon his arrest, Sanjay responded to SI Tay’s query as to the contents of the “SKP” box by shrugging his shoulders. In the contemporaneous statement recorded on the same day by SI Tay, Sanjay replied that he did not know its contents. In his cautioned statement, Sanjay shifted his position, stating that it contained “illegal cigarettes”; there was no mention of the knives. It was only in the 8 March long statement that Sanjay claimed that the “SKP” box contained knives and possibly contraband cigarettes: see [29] above. He maintained this position thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In this regard, I accepted the evidence of the recording officers, SI Tay and IO Ranjeet, that the oral statement, the contemporaneous statement and the cautioned statement were correctly recorded. I did not see any reason for these officers not to accurately record what Sanjay said to them. In relation to the oral statement, apart from SI Tay, SSSgt Wong witnessed Sanjay’s non-verbal response. SI Tay was not asked about the accuracy of the contemporaneous statement, and the challenge arose only in the course of Sanjay’s cross-examination. As for the cautioned statement, it was inexplicable to suggest that IO Ranjeet would be willing to record Sanjay’s belief that it was a box of “illegal cigarettes” but refuse to include a reference to knives. While the cautioned statement was unsigned, I accepted that the contents reflect what Sanjay stated. The allegations casting aspersions on the accuracy of these statements, in my view, were untenable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Given that this was a core aspect of Sanjay’s defence, such differences were material. Further, it was troubling that the chronology was such that Sanjay mentioned the cigarettes before any mention of the knives. I say this because Sanjay’s defence was that while cigarettes might possibly be involved, the knives were the main items for his collection. Thus, it was baffling that he did not mention the knives first. It seemed to me that given that the “SKP” box measured approximately 43cm by 20cm by 9cm,

</div> This was shortly before the actual collection from Dzulkarnain. Thus, not only was there a departure from the original plan, but Boy Lai also appeared to have been available to collect the items himself until “4 plus”. Indeed, Boy Lai was in the vicinity of Lorong 37. Yet, he chose to await Sanjay’s delivery at Hotel La Mode at Lorong 10 (which was also in the vicinity).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) For Sanjay’s help, Boy Lai was prepared to pay Sanjay $300. In my view, for such a service within the vicinity of Geylang <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>from Lorong 37 to Lorong 10, $300 was a substantial amount (even if it was purportedly for a box of illegal knives and possibly cigarettes which carried some risk for the courier). It remained a substantial amount even though unexpectedly, Sanjay spent two hours aimlessly driving Boy Lai around. I note that the sum of $300 was meant to be paid in addition to the sum of $250 which Sanjay claimed had to be paid to Dzulkarnain by or through Boy Lai for the other leg of the delivery.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As described, Boy Lai spent close to two hours in the car with Sanjay. Despite that, Boy Lai did not tell Sanjay that the illegal knives and possibly cigarettes would be in a box. He only found this out from Dzulkarnain before he left the car to pick up the box: see [81(k)] above. It was odd that Boy Lai did not tell Sanjay any further details to facilitate the pick-up from Dzulkarnain; nor did Sanjay ask for the same. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Furthermore, it was inexplicable that Sanjay and Boy Lai did not exchange contact numbers. Contrary to Sanjay’s explanation that they had no reason to do so (see [81(h)]), it seemed to me that to facilitate the delivery, they would have done so. Further, during the two hours in the car, Boy Lai did not make any arrangements for Dzulkarnain to be able to contact Sanjay. Instead, just before Boy Lai left the car, Boy Lai left not one, but three handphones for Sanjay to use. If, as Sanjay explained, Boy Lai was concerned that he should be able to contact Sanjay, he could simply have left just one handphone behind.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Sanjay’s failure to obtain Boy Lai’s contact number, or indeed any other particulars from Boy Lai, was also in stark contrast to his approach when renting his car to other persons, when he would record “their names, their addresses, [and] their phone numbers”.

I found that SK-HP2 and SK-HP3 belonged to Sanjay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 If these three handphones had truly belonged to Boy Lai, Sanjay should have been able to inform IO Ranjeet of this fact during the recording of 1 March long statement. Instead, he prevaricated. The version of the narrative suggesting that these handphones belonged to Boy Lai was clearly concocted by Sanjay. In this connection, it seemed to me that Sanjay had every reason to disassociate himself from SK-HP1, SK-HP2 and SK-HP3. I elaborate as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From 20 to 22 February 2015, there were multiple communications between DBK-HP1 and “Boss Bro”, as well as multiple communications between SK-HP1 and “Bala”. By denying that SK-HP1 belonged to him, Sanjay distanced himself from any possible suggestion of his participation in a plan hatched with an unknown third party. That said, I should make it clear that as against Sanjay, I did not rely on what Dzulkarnain stated in his statement regarding the role of “Bala Luk Kor” (whose number was saved as “Boss Bro”) in the transaction. As Dzulkarnain did not give evidence, no light was shed on the role of the user of this contact number which was saved under “Boss Bro”. My point is simply that there was every reason for Sanjay to avoid any link with the same third party Dzulkarnain was in contact with by denying that SK-HP1 belonged to him.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 23 February 2015, from 12am onwards <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> just before the time of the meeting at UOB, there were multiple calls and messages between DBK-HP1 with SK-HP2 and SK-HP3 <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>24 instances of communications listed within Annex F. Therefore, it appeared that arrangements were being tied down on that day itself. By claiming that the handphones belonged to Boy Lai, Sanjay sought to minimise his role in the transaction on the day in question.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I should add that prior to 23 February 2015, there were no communications between DBK-HP1 and SK-HP1, SK-HP2 or SK-HP3. Specifically, it was only at 12am on 23 February 2015 that “Bro Sanjay” <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>SK-HP2, called Dzulkarnain on DBK-HP1. This was followed by a call from Dzulkarnain on DBK-HP1 to “Bro Sanjay” on SK-HP2 at 12.15am. Almost immediately, at 12.16am, a message was sent from Dzulkarnain on DBK-HP1 to<span class="font-italic"> </span>“Bro Sanjay” on SK-HP2, stating “Bro, I’m here already”.

After hearing parties, I ordered Sanjay to write three passages comprising a combination of words, number of symbols on paper pursuant to s 75(2) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”). However, Sanjay refused to provide a sample. Based only on a copy of a letter written by Sanjay, Ms Nellie Cheng, Senior Forensic Scientist of the HSA, submitted an expert report wherein she stated that given the limitations, she was unable to determine the authorship of the numerals or letters within the notebooks; the results were inconclusive.

</div> While the Prosecution submitted that I should draw an adverse inference against Sanjay under illustration (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of s 116 of the Evidence Act that the handwriting sample would not have been favourable to Sanjay, I state briefly that I did not consider it appropriate or necessary to do so.

According to Sanjay, Dzulkarnain expected a payment of $250 by transfer for his role, and Sanjay merely conveyed the message to Boy Lai. Sanjay had nothing to do with any actual payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 However, at 1.11am on 23 February 2015, shortly after Sanjay’s meeting with Dzulkarnain at UOB where Dzulkarnain told Sanjay he wanted a transfer of funds (see [ 81(f)] above), there was a message from DBK-HP1 to SK-HP2, furnishing the POSB account number 038586203 that belonged to Nur.

</div> As an aside, I would say that, again, this further linked SK-HP2 to Sanjay. Then, later the same day, two sums of $250 each were transferred via ATM at 9.34am and 2.45pm respectively to Nur’s bank account from Peninsula Plaza and Ngee Ann City. It was undisputed that Sanjay was present at these two locations<span class="font-italic"> </span>in the morning and the afternoon that very day (see [81(h)] above). His presence at two locations at two relevant time periods could hardly have been pure coincidence.

</div> I appreciated that there remained some uncertainty as to why there were two deposits amounting to $500 in Nur’s account on that day, instead of one deposit of $250. Nonetheless, relying on Sanjay’s evidence that Dzulkarnain was to be paid $250, and the objective evidence just discussed, it seemed to me that Sanjay was linked to the transfers of the sums of money at both locations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sanjay as a knife collector </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 To support his defence, Sanjay relied on the fact that knives were seized from his car upon his arrest.

</div> In any event, he had no knowledge of the specific transaction in question.  In my view, there was thin support for the defence that Sanjay and Boy Lai were engaged in a transaction involving knives. Even if I were to accept that Sanjay was a knife collector, this did not go very far to support Sanjay’s account that he was to collect and deliver illegal knives and possibly cigarettes.

Sanjay’s lies and evasiveness also affected his credibility. As such, I did not accept his defence.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I was unable to agree with this contention. In <span class="font-italic">Ramesh Perumal, </span>the Court of Appeal held that a person who holds a quantity of drugs with no intention of parting with them other than to return to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him does not come within the definition of possession of those drugs for the purpose of trafficking. However, should a person possess a quantity of drugs with a view to passing the drugs onwards to a third party, the intended transfer is presumptively part of the process of moving the drugs along a chain: see [110]. It was evident that Sanjay fell within the latter scenario. According to Sanjay, Boy Lai had ordered certain items from “Malaysian Boy”. Sanjay was meant to perform an onward delivery of the items ordered by Boy Lai which he collected from Dzulkarnain to Boy Lai  (see [81(e)] above). In other words, Sanjay intended to deliver the drugs along the chain to a third party. I found that Sanjay’s possession was for the purpose of trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 To summarise, I agreed with the Prosecution that it sufficed that Sanjay knew that the box contained items for delivery <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, something for delivery. </span>When Sanjay took possession of the box, he knowingly took possession of its contents for delivery purposes to a third party. It had therefore been proved that Sanjay was in possession of the drugs. Given that Sanjay was proved to be in possession of the box of drugs, by s 18(2) of the MDA, he was presumed to have known of the nature of that drug. Sanjay’s defence amounted to a mere denial of knowledge of the nature of that drug. However, I rejected Sanjay’s claim that he believed the box contained illegal knives and possibly cigarettes. Accordingly, I found that Sanjay had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. It was also clear that the possession was for the purpose of trafficking <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>delivery to a third party. I also found that the chain of custody of the cannabis was not broken. Given that the elements of the charge against Sanjay had been made out, I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 For completeness, I should add that even if I were to be wrong to conclude that the Prosecution had <span class="font-italic">proved</span> knowing possession of the drugs, it seemed to me that it could not be disputed that Sanjay was in possession of the “SKP” box containing the drugs. Therefore, s 18(1) of the MDA would have applied to presume Sanjay to be in possession of drugs. While the Prosecution did not rely on this, <span class="font-italic">in the alternative</span>, Mr Fernando clearly submitted that should s 18(1) of the MDA be engaged, based on the very same defence that Sanjay believed he was delivering illegal knives and possibly cigarettes, Sanjay had rebutted the presumption of possession.

Although the Prosecution argued that Sanjay’s use of multiple handphones meant that he was actively communicating </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">with others for the arrangement of the transaction, there were no clear messages regarding the extent of his involvement in such arrangements. Indeed, it was not disputed that Sanjay had to communicate with Dzulkarnain in order to finalise details concerning the drop-off and pick-up (which fell within the role as a courier). The Prosecution further relied on Sanjay’s payment of money to Dzulkarnain as evidence of a heightened role in the transaction. However, even if Sanjay had a role to play in the transfer of money to Dzulkarnain which I found above, without more, that did not take Sanjay out of the courier role. Regardless, the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance. As the second requirement under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA was not met, the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA was not available, I therefore imposed the mandatory death sentence on him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mark Tay, Sia Jiazheng and Gabriel Lim (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution; <br/>Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya and Johannes Hadi (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the first accused. <br/>Peter Keith Fernando (Leo Fernando) and A.
