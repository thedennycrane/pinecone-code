<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this action, Clinique Laboratories, LLC
                    (“the plaintiff”) sued two companies Clinique Suisse Pte Ltd
                    (“the first defendant”) and Healthy Glow Pte Ltd (“the
                    second defendant”) for trademark infringement. The plaintiff was
                    established in 1968 and is a subsidiary of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.
                    (“Estee Lauder”) which is one of the world’s leading
                    manufacturers and marketers of skin care, make-up, hair and fragrance products.
                    The plaintiff’s products are sold under the “CLINIQUE” Mark
                    (“the Clinique Mark”). The Clinique Mark was first used by the
                    plaintiff in 1968 and in Singapore in 1976. At all material times, the plaintiff
                    was the registered proprietor of, amongst others, the following trade marks in
                    Singapore (collectively, the “plaintiff’s Registered Trade
                    Marks”):</p>

                    of such products had actually taken place on 3 April 2009. The plaintiff
                    also sought an injunction, pursuant to s 55 of the TMA, against the
                    defendants’ use of any mark or business identifier comprising the Clinique
                    Suisse Mark or any mark or business identifier which was identical with or
                    similar to the plaintiff’s Clinique Mark in the course of trade or
                    business. Further, or in the alternative, the plaintiff claimed that either or
                    both of the defendants had or had conspired to pass off or attempt to pass off
                    goods/products not of the plaintiff’s manufacture or origin as and for the

                    company which did not operate any anti-aging clinic and/or franchise/sell goods
                    and/or provide skin care treatment or sell skin and body care products. The
                    defendants insisted that it was the second defendant, rather than the first
                    defendant, which operated the Clinique Suisse Business. Further, the defendants
                    asserted that the second defendant did not conspire or act in concert with or
                    otherwise get involved in the first defendant’s alleged commission of the
                    acts complained of by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Clinique Suisse Business, through which
                    the acts alleged by the plaintiff (see above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) were carried out, was operated under a licence, dated
                    11 April 2008, issued by the Ministry of Health to one Dr Wong Yoke
                    Meng (“Dr Wong”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Dr Wong (DW1) was the sole director of
                    the second defendant and was one of two directors of the first defendant. He was
                    also a shareholder in both defendant companies. By his own admission,
                    Dr Wong was, at all material times, the operating mind and will of both
                    defendant companies and both defendants were related companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The licence from the Ministry of Health did not
                    state whether it was issued to Dr Wong to operate the Clinique Suisse
                    Business as a sole-proprietor or on behalf of the first or second defendants.
                    However, it stated that the Clinique Suisse Business was to be operated at 290
                    Orchard Road #08-01/02 Paragon, Singapore 238859, which is the registered
                    address of the first defendant (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>
                    above). I took this as an indication that the first defendant was not a dormant
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It appeared, from the results of an IPOS
                    – Trade Marks Online Search and Enquiry<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> (“the IPOS Search Results”),
                    that the first defendant had applied, on 10 July 2007, to register the Clinique
                    Suisse Mark. That, combined with Dr Wong’s statement that he had
                    incorporated the first defendant with the intention of transferring the Clinique
                    Suisse Business from the second defendant to the first defendant (since the
                    first defendant shared the same name as the Clinique Suisse
                        Business),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> was another indication that the first
                    defendant was not a dormant company and that the first defendant intended to use
                    the Clinique Suisse Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In those circumstances, I was of the opinion
                    that the first defendant was a proper defendant to this action and that the
                    second defendant had also participated in the management of the Clinique Suisse
                    Business and the operation of the Clinique Suisse Website. I therefore held that
                    both defendants were jointly and severally liable for the claims made by the
                    plaintiff (which are dealt with below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">B.   The plaintiff’s claims under s 27 and s 55 of
                the TMA and its claim for passing-off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I ruled that the plaintiff had made out its
                    claim under s 27(2)(b) of the TMA. It had demonstrated that (1) the
                    Clinique Suisse Mark was similar to the Clinique Mark (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> below); (2) the defendants’
                    products and services were similar to the plaintiff’s products and
                    services (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> below); and (3) there was a likelihood
                    of confusion on the part of the public arising from the defendants’ use of
                    the Clinique Suisse Mark (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> below). (The word
                    “confusion” as used in the rest of this judgment refers to
                    confusion between the products and services of the plaintiff on the one hand and
                    the defendants’ products and services on the other). I also granted the
                    plaintiff an injunction under s 55(2) of the TMA for the additional reason
                    that (4) the Clinique Mark was well known in Singapore (see <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Additionally, I found that, at the very least,
                    (5) the use of the Clinique Suisse Mark in relation to the defendants’
                    products and services would indicate a connection with the plaintiff’s
                    products and services (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> below).
                    Moreover, (6) the use of the Clinique Suisse Mark by the defendants was likely
                    to damage the interests of the plaintiff (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> below). Given the finding that there
                    was a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public arising from the
                    defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark, s 55(3)(a) was also made
                    out. Since the defendants had used the Clinique Suisse Mark as a business
                    identifier to promote the products and services of Clinique Suisse Business at
                    the premises of the latter, on the packaging and labels of its products, and on
                    the Clinique Suisse Website, by extension, s 54(a) was also made out. The
                    claim for passing-off was also made out in that the plaintiff had established
                    goodwill in the Clinique brand and the Clinique Mark (see <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> below); there was a misrepresentation as
                    evidenced by the strong likelihood of confusion arising from the
                    defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> below); and there was a real tangible
                    risk of substantial damage to the plaintiff’s goodwill by the
                    defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Sections 55(3)(b) and 55(4)(b) of the TMA were
                    enacted to cater to situations where the reputation and value of a well-known
                    mark is diluted by blurring or tarnishment, even though there may not be
                    consumer confusion: (see the Second Reading speech of the Minister for Law on
                    the Trade Marks (Amendment) Bill in <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> [15 June 2004] vol 78 at col 108). The
                    plaintiff relied on s 55(3)(b) and s 55(4)(b) as an alternative to
                    ground its claim for an injunction under s 55 of the TMA. Given my findings
                    that the products and services of the plaintiff and the Clinique Suisse Business
                    were similar and that there was a likelihood of confusion such that the
                    plaintiff had already established its claim under ss 55(2), 55(3)(a) and
                    55(4)(a) of the TMA, it was not strictly necessary for this court to make a
                    finding on the plaintiff’s claims under s 55(3)(b) and
                    s 55(4)(b) of the TMA. Nevertheless, I observed that it was clear, from the
                    evidence before me, that the plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks were not
                    only well known in Singapore, but were also well known <em>to the
                        public at large</em> in Singapore (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> below). Taking into account: (i) the fact that the products
                    and services of the Clinique Suisse Business, as well as the skin care products
                    advertised on the Clinique Suisse Website, were similar or, at the very least,
                    closely related to that of the plaintiff’s goods/services; and (ii) the
                    fact that there was a strong likelihood of confusion, I also observed that the
                    use of the Clinique Suisse Mark would take unfair advantage of the distinctive
                    character of the Clinique Mark (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                    below) by riding on the coat-tails of the Clinique brand (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> below). The plaintiff was therefore
                    also entitled to restrain the use of the Clinique Suisse Mark under
                    s 55(3)(b)(ii) and s 55(4)(b)(ii) of the TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     My observations were directed at the
                    defendants’ application of the Clinique Suisse Mark and business
                    identifier, in the present case, to products and services which, as already
                    emphasised, were similar or, at the very least, related to the plaintiff’s
                    products and services and in a manner which would generate confusion. As such,
                    my finding that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction under
                    s 55(3)(b)(ii) and s 55(4)(b)(ii) in the specific circumstances of
                    this case, would not, as the defendants feared, grant the plaintiff “the
                    widest degree of protection available under the Act” and entitle the
                    plaintiff to “stop the use of the word “<em>Clinique</em>” in Singapore across all industries”
                    regardless of any similarity of goods and services and in the absence of any
                    confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1)   The Clinique Suisse Mark was similar to the Clinique
                Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Although the word “Clinique” may
                    be the French translation of the ordinary English word “clinic”,
                    the Clinique Mark has acquired a distinctive character in the cosmetics
                    industry. Through extensive use, it has acquired the ability to distinguish
                    Clinique’s skincare products and services from those of others. I agreed
                    with the observation of the Federal Commission for Appeals in Intellectual
                    Property Matters in Switzerland, in the case of <em>Unique
                        Frischkosmetik, Irmgard Schade Naturkosmetik v Clinique Laboratories
                        Inc</em>. (MA-WI 42/96), that the Clinique Mark had attained a high
                    degree of fame such that it was no longer understood as corresponding to the
                    English word “clinic” when used as a sign on a cosmetic product.
                    When used in conjunction with products and services in the classes for which the
                    plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) were registered, the Clinique Mark had become
                    distinctive of the plaintiff’s products and services. Moreover, for the
                    reasons set out below, I was of the view that the Clinique Suisse Mark was
                    visually, aurally and conceptually similar to the Clinique Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(a)   The defendants’ pending applications for the
                registration of the Clinique Suisse Mark mirrored the plaintiff’s Registered
                Trade Marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     According to the IPOS Search Results (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), the first defendant had
                    applied to register the Clinique Suisse Mark as a trade mark under Class 03 and
                    Class 44, which were the same classes in which the plaintiff’s Registered
                    Trade Marks were registered (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above).
                    The applications for registration under Class 03 and Class 44 were previously
                    treated as withdrawn but the status was updated to “Pending” on 3
                    October 2008 and 30 September 2008 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendants had submitted that there was no
                    visual, aural or conceptual similarity between the plaintiff’s Clinique
                    Mark and the Clinique Suisse Mark because the font and logo of both marks were
                    markedly different. However, contrary to the defendants’ claim that the
                    Clinique Suisse Mark differed from the plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks
                    because the “Q” in the Clinique Suisse Mark had a longer stroke,

style="height:18pt;width:150pt;"/></span>.
                    When compared to the plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above), both marks were in capital letters and
                    the fonts were almost exactly the same albeit that there was a slight
                    differential in the tail of the letter “Q”. Aurally and visually,
                    both marks were similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The words “SUISSE” and
                    “Made in Switzerland” on the Clinique Suisse Business’
                    products were merely add-ons to the “CLINIQUE” word and did not
                    distinguish the defendants’ Clinique Suisse Mark from the
                    plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks. Indeed, they gave the impression that
                    the defendants’ products or services were an extension, line or version of
                    the plaintiff’s products or services, perhaps with a Swiss
                element.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendants had submitted that the word
                    “Clinique” is the French word for “clinic” and in
                    that regard, it was consistent with the line of products and specialised medical
                    services offered by the Clinique Suisse Business which the plaintiff and its
                    staff are not qualified to provide, since the plaintiff is not a licensed
                    medical practitioner. I did not think this would make any difference to the
                    defendants’ case. The plaintiff had established the Clinique Mark as
                    representative of its allergy-tested and fragrance free cosmetics, beauty and
                    skin care products. Additionally, the plaintiff had stated that the Clinique
                    brand derived its name from its dermatological roots. At the trial, Dr Wong
                    agreed with counsel for the plaintiff that in certain situations, when a person
                    mentions “Clinique” and not “Clinic”, the image
                    conjured would be that of cosmetics and skin care.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In fact, the defendants had, in
                    the same manner as the plaintiff, used the Clinique Suisse Mark to brand the
                    Clinique Suisse Business’ beauty and skin care products and
                    services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Whilst Dr Wong claimed that he had
                    ordered the defendants’ products from one Steven Chia of One World
                    Australasia who (according to Dr Wong) had packaged the products for him
                    and informed him that the products were manufactured in Switzerland,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> the defendants did not
                    call Steven Chia to testify nor offer any reason why they did not. The court
                    therefore did not have an opportunity to question Steven Chia on the reason(s)
                    for the uncanny resemblance of the packaging of the defendants’ products
                    to the plaintiff’s products. It was also the defendants’ position
                    that the Clinique Suisse Mark was conceptualised to reflect (i) the Clinique
                    Suisse Business’ links with one Professor Ben Pfeifer based in the
                    Aeskulap Hospital in Brunnen, Switzerland; and (ii) the fact that Dr Wong
                    had previously been mentored by a French doctor. However, neither Professor
                    Pfeifer nor the French doctor were called as witnesses for the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff on the other hand had called
                    Dr Michael Treis, an Attorney at Law in Switzerland, to be a witness via
                    video-conferencing. Dr Michael Treis testified that investigations
                    conducted in Switzerland on the plaintiff’s instructions did not produce
                    any evidence that the products with the Clinique Suisse Mark originated from
                    Switzerland. Dr Michael Treis also emphasised that the use of the name
                    and/or trademark “CLINIQUE SUISSE” for skin care products or other
                    beauty products would constitute a blatant infringement of the plaintiff’s
                    Swiss trademark rights such that it would not be legally possible for the
                    defendants and/or other third parties to manufacture any skin care products in
                    Switzerland if this would entail marking such products “CLINIQUE
                    SUISSE”. The defendants had therefore not proven that the products
                    bearing the Clinique Suisse Mark were indeed manufactured in
                Switzerland.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2)   The Clinique Suisse Mark was being used in relation to goods
                or services identical with or similar to those for which the Clinique Mark was
                used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As pointed out above (at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>), the first defendant had pending trade mark
                    applications to register the Clinique Suisse Mark in the same classes (03 and
                    44) as the plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks. That indicated that the
                    products and services which the first defendant intended to target were
                    identical to the goods and services for which the plaintiff’s Registered
                    Trade Marks were registered. In any event, I found that the Clinique Suisse Mark
                    was being used in relation to goods or services similar to those for which the
                    plaintiff’s Registered Trade marks were registered –
                    <em>ie</em>, beauty and skin care products and consultation
                    services. Dr Wong admitted that the Clinique Suisse Business offered and
                    sold skin care products at its premises and via a website at
                        www.cliniquesuisse.com.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Skin care consultation and
                    treatment services (including, in particular, the service of recommending
                    appropriate skin care products to specific customers) were also provided at the
                    Clinique Suisse Business’ premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Dr Wong had agreed with counsel for the
                    plaintiff that the service of recommending appropriate skin care products had
                    been offered by the plaintiff’s consultants even before November
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He further agreed that both the plaintiff and
                    the Clinique Suisse Business offered beauty consultation services regarding the
                    selection of skin care products and the same service of giving information
                    concerning skin care products,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> although he insisted that the
                    main focus of the Clinique Suisse Business was anti-aging medicine such that
                    only a small part of the Clinique Suisse Business was related to the
                    plaintiff’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It was therefore apparent that the
                    defendants’ products and services fell within the description of the
                    classes in which the plaintiff’s Registered Trade Marks were registered. I
                    noted that a further similarity between the plaintiff’s and the Clinique
                    Suisse Business’ products and services was that they both targeted the
                    same consumers – those who were seeking to improve their skin appearance.
                    The convergence between the cosmetic skin care and medical industries which had
                    resulted in both industries competing for the same group of consumers, will be
                    elaborated upon at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> below. The
                    defendants’ claim that its products and services could be distinguished
                    from that of the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff traded in mass
                    cosmetics and skin/body care retail goods whereas the Clinique Suisse Business
                    operated a specialised and licensed medical clinic will also be dealt with at

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3)   There was a likelihood of confusion on the part of the
                public arising from the defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It was the defendants’ position that
                    there was no likelihood of confusion because: (a) the plaintiff traded in
                    cosmetics retail goods whereas the Clinique Suisse Business was a specialised
                    and licensed medical practice; (b) the plaintiff’s and the Clinique Suisse
                    Business’ channels of distribution were distinguishable and (c) the goods
                    and services provided by both parties were higher-end goods usually purchased by
                    persons of an above-average class who would easily discern the differences
                    between goods sold under the plaintiff’s Clinique Mark and those sold
                    under the Clinique Suisse Mark. I disagreed for the reasons set out
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(a)   The convergence of the cosmetic skin care and medical
                industries indicated that there was a likelihood of confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There was a likelihood of confusion due to the
                    convergence of the cosmetic skin care and pharmaceutical/medical industries in
                    the production of “cosmeceuticals”. There was a risk that the
                    public would be confused thinking there was an economic link/collaborative
                    marketing between the plaintiff and the defendants. As Dr Wong himself
                    revealed, citing the brand “Perricone MD” as an example, at the
                    time of the trial, there were already some doctors who had started their own
                    skin care line and were selling their products on a retail basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Dr Wong had also
                    admitted that, as part of his services, he offered three lines of skin care
                    products to his patients and that this ventured beyond his traditional business
                    of medical practice into the cosmetic industry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Conversely, at
                    the time of the trial, skin care products by cosmetic skin care companies were
                    also moving into doctors’ clinics. In fact, the Vice-President and Senior
                    Trademark Counsel of Estee Lauder, Ms Lesley A. Moradian
                    (“Ms Moradian”), stated that the plaintiff had entered into a
                    strategic collaboration with Allergan Inc., a leader in medical aesthetics and
                    the maker of Botox (a treatment which the Clinique Suisse Business offered to
                    its clients), to develop a line of clinically proven skin care products
                    specifically designed for patients under a physician’s care. The new skin
                    care line developed by Clinique and Allergan Inc. would be called
                    “CLINIQUE MEDICAL” and would be available exclusively through
                    physician offices.</p>

                    Registrar stated at [26] – [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[26] … There are clear differences between pharmaceutical and
                        cosmetic products… However, the evidence makes it clear that a
                        product can be both pharmaceutical and cosmetic and that in such
                        circumstances it falls under the rules and regulations governing
                        pharmaceuticals. Also from the evidence, it is clear that the gap between
                        the two sets of goods is becoming narrower with the use of pharmaceuticals
                        such as Botulinum toxin purely for cosmetic purposes and also being
                        administered on the high street in ordinary shops such as Boots. Cosmetic
                        products are also making claims to restoring, correcting or modifying
                        physiological functions. Although the term “cosmeceuticals” is
                        not recognised by the relevant drug authorities in the USA or UK its use in
                        so many journals, newspapers and magazines shows that the gap between the
                        two sets of products is narrowing…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[27] … The evidence shows that the “gap” between
                        pharmaceuticals and cosmetics is becoming increasingly blurred and that
                        there are products which are classified as both. Although not officially
                        recognised, the term cosmeceuticals has been coined for products which are
                        at the very edge of being a pharmaceutical but yet remain a cosmetic. In
                        such circumstances the specifications of the two parties could be in
                        competition or complementary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In view of the above, there was a likelihood of confusion on the part
                    of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(b)   The plaintiff’s and the Clinique Suisse
                Business’ channels of distribution were not distinguishable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Dr Wong and his staff member, one
                    Ms Lim Nee (DW3) testified that Dr Wong had instructed his staff that
                    the Clinique Suisse Business’ products could only be purchased after a
                    patient had consulted Dr Wong or Dr Wong’s employee, one
                    Dr Chan Yat Chun (“Dr Chan”), and obtained a
                    prescription for the products.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The defendants
                    therefore claimed that there was no likelihood of confusion since the channels
                    of distribution for the plaintiff’s and the Clinique Suisse
                    Business’ products were distinguishable in that the plaintiff’s
                    products could be purchased at departmental stores whilst the defendants’
                    products could only be purchased after consultation in a confidential medical
                    setting. However, the plaintiff adduced evidence of an online purchase of a
                    Clinique Suisse product from the Clinique Suisse Website by a private
                    investigator Ms Tan Poh Tiang (PW3) on 3 April 2009, which product was
                    subsequently delivered to the private investigator on 20 April 2009,
                    without the said private investigator having had to consult Dr Wong or
                    Dr Chan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     When he was confronted with the above
                    evidence, Dr Wong had agreed with counsel for the plaintiff that the
                    Clinique Suisse Website was designed such that anyone could access the website
                    and look at the Clinique Suisse products and that there was no mention on the
                    Clinique Suisse Website that Clinique Suisse skin care products would only be
                    sold to patients. However, he disagreed with the statement by counsel for the
                    plaintiff that anybody who had internet access would be able to buy the Clinique
                    Suisse products. Rather, Dr Wong claimed that sales of the Clinique Suisse
                    products on the internet were subject to terms and conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Yet, as counsel for the
                    plaintiff pointed out to Dr Wong, the terms and conditions page of the
                    Clinique Suisse Website was blank when the plaintiff’s solicitors accessed
                        it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It
                    appeared that the website www.cliniquesuisse.com was an avenue through which the
                    plaintiff’s products could be bought by members of the public without the
                    buyer having to consult a medical doctor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I did not accept Dr Wong’s position
                    that Clinique’s trained consultants are “glorified
                    salesgirls”. Whilst they may not have the medical training that
                    Dr Wong has, as the Brand General Manager of Estee Lauder, Ms Khiu Lee
                    Wah (“Ms Khiu”), had testified, they are trained to, amongst
                    other things, analyse skin to ascertain skin types, assess the needs of
                    customers and recommend suitable products following such analysis and/or
                    assessment. In the course of their career, all Clinique consultants are required
                    to undergo and pass a training programme termed “the Clinique Education
                    Programme”. Clinique promotes itself as “the last stop before the
                    dermatologist’s office and the first stop after”. The sale of
                    Clinique products is complemented by Clinique services through which customers
                    can have their skin analysed / assessed by a trained Clinique consultant who
                    would also help to address the customer’s skin concerns, recommend
                    suitable products and advise on the proper usage and application of each
                    product. In this manner, the plaintiff, much like the defendants, also offers
                    beauty consultation services before a customer purchases its products, albeit
                    that the plaintiff’s trained Clinique consultants are not qualified
                    doctors. Both the plaintiff and the defendants provide recommendation of skin
                    care products to the users of their products.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(c)   The purchasers of the plaintiff’s and the
                defendants’ products were likely to confuse between the Clinique and the
                Clinique Suisse brands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The plaintiff adduced evidence of a street
                    intercept survey conducted by Asian Strategies Pte Ltd at eight high traffic
                    areas (spread across the major retail areas that account for most of the sales
                    of premium skin care products in Singapore) on 408 interviewees, all of whom had
                    been selected on the basis that they had purchased and used one or more of
                    Clinique’s or any of 22 specified premier skin care brands in the past 12
                    months, were female, and were aged between 18 and 49 years old. 207 of the
                    interviewees were existing Clinique consumers at the time of the survey whilst
                    201 of the interviewees were potential Clinique consumers. The survey found,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>

                            plaintiff’s parent company as the operator of the Clinique Suisse
                            brand and a further 2% opined that it might be Clinique but that they

                    survey report, testified for the plaintiff. Mr Coops (PW8) explained that
                    his market research generally focused on a tight, discrete group of consumers
                    from which a random and representative sample was interviewed. According to
                    Mr Coops, he had focused his research resources on addressing the
                    plaintiff’s core target audience (<em>ie</em>,
                    females aged between 18-49 who were either existing or potential Clinique users)
                    after he had identified the characteristics of the vast majority of the
                    plaintiff’s consumers as female, relatively well-educated and
                        upscale.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In
                    other words, the survey concentrated on the most important segments of the
                    public from the plaintiff’s point of view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiff highlighted that in assessing
                    “a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public”, the average
                    consumer need not necessarily mean the general public and the Court may
                    ascertain who, precisely, the target consumers are (<em>City
                        Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 382 at [54] and [59]). Moreover, in <em>Jumbo
                        Seafood Pte Ltd and Anor v Hong Kong Jumbo Seafood Restaurant Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 878, where 40% of the interviewees
                    of a survey thought that the defendant’s restaurant was somehow associated
                    or connected with the plaintiff’s restaurant, this was construed as
                    evidence indicative of confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I was mindful of the defendants’
                    argument that the target consumers of the plaintiff were not “morons in a
                    hurry” but were discerning consumers who would exercise care when
                    choosing their skincare products. Nevertheless, I was of the opinion that such
                    consumers were still likely to confuse the plaintiff’s products with the
                    Clinique Suisse Business’ products due to the striking similarity between
                    the trade marks and the packaging of the products. The survey had focused on the
                    relevant segments of the public and the results demonstrating confusion between
                    the Clinique and Clinique Suisse brand by approximately 46% of the interviewees
                    could not be ignored. The interviewees of the survey clearly had difficulty
                    distinguishing between the plaintiff and the defendants with regards to the
                    origin of the products. This meant that there existed a likelihood of confusion
                    on the part of the plaintiff’s target consumers. There was a risk that
                    these customers might be misled into thinking that the defendants’
                    products emanated from the plaintiff. The defendants did not adduce evidence of
                    any other survey to contradict and/or cast doubts on the results of the survey
                    conducted by Asian Strategies Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4)   The Clinique Mark was well-known in Singapore and to the
                public at large in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff had/has acquired valuable
                    goodwill in the Clinique Mark when used in relation to the plaintiff’s
                    products and services. Since 1976, it has painstakingly built up the reputation
                    of the Clinique brand in Singapore as a reliable brand for cosmetic products.
                    The plaintiff had advertised and continues to advertise its products bearing the
                    Clinique Mark in a wide variety of media, including but not limited to
                    newspapers, magazines, radio and television. The advertising, promotional and
                    marketing expenditure for the plaintiff’s products sold under the Clinique
                    Mark in Singapore in the years 2004-2008 (inclusive) was in the region of $3m
                    each year. In the years 2004-2008 (inclusive), the plaintiff’s sales
                    figures in Singapore for the plaintiff’s products sold under the Clinique
                    Mark were in the region of $10m each year. Moreover, the plaintiff’s
                    worldwide advertising, promotional and marketing expenditure for the products
                    sold under the Clinique Mark for the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June
                    2008 was in excess of US$0.4 billion per year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As observed above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>, the survey conducted by Mr Coops
                    found that the Clinique brand was well-known to its target consumer group and
                    was therefore within the definition of “well known in Singapore”
                    in s 2(8) read with s 2(9) of the TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In my opinion, the Clinique brand was also
                    well-known to the public at large in Singapore in view of the long history of
                    the brand in Singapore, its extensive advertising efforts in various media
                    (which were/are circulated both in Singapore and internationally) and its
                    presence in numerous departmental stores, both locally and worldwide. Indeed, at
                    the time of the trial, Clinique products and services were offered in more than
                    13,000 sales stores/counters in over 110 countries and territories worldwide,
                    with 13 of such stores/counters being located in Singapore. In certain countries
                    (but not in Singapore), Clinique’s products could also be purchased via
                    Clinique’s website at www.clinique.com. I agreed with Ms Moradian
                    (PW9) that “most sectors of the population would have to know
                        Clinique”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(5)   The use of the Clinique Suisse Mark in relation to the
                Clinique Suisse Business’ goods and/or services would indicate a connection
                between those goods or services and the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Clinique Suisse Mark was visually, aurally
                    and conceptually similar to the Clinique Mark (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above) and both marks were displayed on
                    products which were packaged in a very similar fashion. Moreover, both the
                    defendants’ and the plaintiff’s fields of business were related (see
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above). The addition of the word
                    “SUISSE” to the word “CLINIQUE” could well be viewed
                    by the consumer as an indication of the geographical source of the product
                        (<em>ie</em>, the place where the particular product
                    was designed or manufactured) rather than as a distinguishing feature between
                    both brands. In those circumstances, the use of the Clinique Suisse Mark in
                    relation to the defendants’ goods and/or services would indicate both a
                    connection as to origin and a connection as to business with the
                    plaintiff’s goods and services. I was of the view that the
                    defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark was likely to give the
                    impression that the Clinique Suisse brand was either associated with the
                    Clinique brand or was an extension or another line of the plaintiff’s
                    Clinique products. The consumer might be misled into thinking that the plaintiff
                    and the defendants belonged to the same corporate group or that both the
                    Clinique Suisse and Clinique products were manufactured by the same
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(6)   The plaintiff’s interests were likely to be damaged by
                the defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Novelty Pte Ltd v
                        Amanresorts Ltd and another</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 216, the
                    Court of Appeal held (at [97] – [98]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">97.    There are two primary and very well-established
                            means by which goodwill can be damaged, namely, by
                            “blurring” and by “tarnishment”. Blurring
                            occurs when the plaintiff’s get-up, instead of being indicative of
                            only the plaintiff’s goods, services or business, also becomes
                            indicative of the defendant’s goods, services or business. While
                            customers may still be drawn by the attractive force of the
                            plaintiff’s get-up, they may be drawn to the business, goods or
                            services of the defendant instead of those of the plaintiff… the
                            damage manifests itself in sales being diverted from the plaintiff to
                            the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">98.    Tarnishment occurs when the business, goods or
                            services of the defendant are of a worse quality than those of the
                            plaintiff or have some other undesirable characteristic. Customers think
                            that the plaintiff is now the source of such poor quality or undesirable
                            business, goods or services. The goodwill previously attached to the
                            plaintiff’s business, goods or services loses its attractive
                            quality and may even become a liability, driving away custom rather than
                            attracting it… The plaintiff and defendant can be engaged in
                            entirely different fields of business so long as it is shown that the
                            poor quality or undesirability of the defendant’s business, goods
                            or services rebounds on the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal further held (at [234]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the tests to be adopted for the purposes of the
                        “connection” requirement and the “likely to damage the
                        [plaintiff’s] interests” requirement in s 55(3)(a) of the
                        current TMA would yield the same results as those obtained from applying the
                        corresponding tests <em>vis-à-vis</em> the …
                        claim for passing off … However, … while the tests relating to
                        misrepresentation and damage under the law of passing off are substantially
                        the same as the tests relating to, respectively, the
                        “connection” requirement and the “likely to damage the
                        [plaintiff’s] interests” requirement in s 55(3)(a) of the
                        current TMA, the two sets of tests are not identical in one respect. An
                        important distinction is that the tests relating to misrepresentation and
                        damage in passing off actions concern the plaintiff’s goodwill
                        … whereas the corresponding tests under s55(3)(a) of the current TMA
                        concern the <em>interests</em> of the plaintiff and
                            <em>not</em> its goodwill (indeed, as the
                        definition of “well known trade mark” in s 2(1) of the
                        current TMA makes clear, the plaintiff’s trade mark may be a
                        “well known trade mark” for the purposes of s 55(3)(a)
                        even if the plaintiff has no goodwill in Singapore).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, I found that the defendants’ use of the
                    Clinique Suisse Mark would damage the plaintiff’s goodwill and interests
                    by blurring and tarnishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(a)   The use of the Clinique Suisse Mark might damage the
                plaintiff’s goodwill by “blurring”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Dr Wong had agreed that an increasing
                    number of doctors who practised aesthetic medicine were able to easily encroach
                    into the field of skin care and skin treatment. The plaintiff also cited
                    Dr Georgia Lee as an example of a doctor who had ventured to sell her range
                    of skin care products in departmental stores. I formed the view that if members
                    of the public were misled into thinking that Clinique Suisse was part of the
                    Clinique range of cosmetics or that the Clinique Suisse Business was related to
                    the plaintiff’s business, the defendants would be able to ride on the
                    reputation that the plaintiff had painstakingly and successfully built up in
                    Singapore over the course of close to 40 years, for its Clinique brand through
                    extensive advertising and promotion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Clinique brand and products sold under the
                    Clinique Mark have won numerous beauty awards around the world and have been
                    featured in several international magazines. The Clinique Mark has been used in
                    Singapore since 1976 and, as noted above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>, the plaintiff has expended much effort and monies to build
                    up the goodwill in the Clinique brand. On the other hand, the use of the
                    Clinique Suisse Mark and business identifier only commenced in 2006. Whilst
                    Dr Wong claimed that the “Clinique Suisse” name was an
                    allusion to the Clinique Suisse Business’ links with a hospital in
                    Switzerland and his traineeship under a French doctor, no witnesses were called
                    to corroborate his explanation. In view of the confusing similarity of the
                    Clinique and Clinique Suisse Marks and the packaging of the plaintiff’s
                    and the Clinique Suisse Business’ products, as well as the close relation
                    between the plaintiff’s and the defendants’ products and services, I
                    found that there was a real likelihood that the defendants’ use of the
                    Clinique Suisse Mark and business identifier would blur the distinction between
                    the plaintiff’s and the Clinique Suisse Business’ products and, in
                    so doing, divert business away from the plaintiff to the defendants. Even if no
                    business would be diverted away from the plaintiff and, consequently, the
                    plaintiff’s interests would not be damaged by the use of the Clinique
                    Suisse Mark, I was of the view that the Clinique Suisse Business’
                    free-riding on the plaintiff’s coat-tails would still amount to an unfair
                    advantage taken by the defendants of the distinctive character of the
                    plaintiff’s Clinique Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(b)   The plaintiff’s reputation was likely to be tarnished
                by the defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Dr Wong had testified that whilst he read
                    up on the literature, he did not conduct safety tests or clinical trials on his
                        products.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He had formulated his products based on
                    literature research on the ingredients that should comprise his products. There
                    was therefore no assurance of quality in respect of the products of Clinique
                    Suisse Business. This raised a concern that some day, some patient of his who
                    used the Clinique Suisse Business’ products and services may develop an
                    adverse reaction. Additionally, Dr Wong admitted that he had not ensured
                    that the Clinique Suisse Business’ products complied with mandatory
                    regulatory labelling requirements for cosmetic products under the Health
                    Products Act (Cap 122D, 2008 Rev Ed). The plaintiff also pointed to
                    several newspaper articles in which Dr Wong had been accused of offering
                    questionable treatments as part of the Clinique Suisse Business and in which
                    charges were said to have been filed against Dr Wong for breaches of the
                    Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (Cap 248, 1999 Rev Ed).
                    Dr Wong admitted that these newspaper articles referred to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In view of the connection which might be drawn
                    between the Clinique Suisse brand and the Clinique brand, I was concerned that
                    the negative publicity surrounding the Clinique Suisse Business and the Clinique
                    Suisse Business’ lack of quality assurance might tarnish the
                    plaintiff’s goodwill and damage its reputation for selling clinically
                    tested, fragrance free and allergy-tested products under the clinical guidelines
                    established by the plaintiff’s founding dermatologists.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(c)   The defendants’ use of the Clinique Suisse Mark would
                restrict the plaintiff’s expansion of use of its Registered Trade
                Marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The close connection between the
                    plaintiff’s business and the Clinique Suisse Business has already been
                    established (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>). The sale of the
                    plaintiff’s products through medical doctors was an area of business which
                    the plaintiff was likely to expand into in Singapore, and for which the
                    plaintiff had already entered into a strategic collaboration with Allergan Inc.,
                    to develop a line of products that would only be sold at physicians’
                    offices. This is in line with the convergence of the cosmetic and pharmaceutical
                    industries where fierce competition for the same customer dollar has driven
                    doctors working in the field of aesthetics medicine to encroach into the
                    cosmetics industry and cosmetic companies to encroach into the medical and
                    pharmaceutical realms. The defendants’ use of the name “Clinique
                    Suisse” for the provision of beauty products, treatments and services
                    would prevent the plaintiff from expanding into the medical/pharmaceutical realm
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In the circumstances, I allowed the
                    plaintiff’s claims against both defendants. Having reviewed the exchange
                    of correspondence between the parties to negotiate a settlement of the matter
                    before proceedings commenced, I ordered costs on a standard basis to be paid to
                    the plaintiff with the exception that all disbursements incurred by the
                    plaintiff were to be paid to the plaintiff on a reimbursement
                basis.</p>
