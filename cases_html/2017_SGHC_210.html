</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 There are, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, two other relevant agreements. First, the Project Management and Technical Services Agreement dated 24 October 2011 (dated the same date as the SHA) (“the PMTSA”), which was entered into between Lime PLC and Hibiscus Oilfield Services Limited (“HOSL”). HOSL is an affiliate company of the Plaintiff’s parent company. Under the PMTSA, HOSL was appointed as a service provider for Lime PLC wherein it was tasked to prepare annual work programmes or plans and budgets (“the WPBs”) for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, MOL. The WPBs would then be submitted to Lime PLC’s board, the approval of which would represent a commitment by the Shareholders to fund specific items within the WPBs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The second relevant agreement is the Operating Services Agreement dated 22 March 2012 (“OSA”) that was entered into between Lime PLC and MOL. In 2014, the Ministry of Oil and Gas in Oman alleged that MOL had not complied with good oilfield practices with regard to the drilling of an offshore exploration well. MOL relied on this allegation to terminate the OSA by way of a letter dated 28 February 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Although Lime PLC initially owned the whole of Lime Norway, its shareholding was subsequently reduced. The Plaintiff alleged this was the result of various wrongs committed by the Defendants (“the Lime Norway Allegations”). Allegations were also made by the Plaintiff in respect of the conduct of the Defendants, their associated companies and associated persons. The Plaintiff commenced an action by way of Suit 412 of 2016 (“S 412/2016”). The Defendants sought a stay of proceedings in S 412/2016 in light of the court’s exercise of case management powers, relying on the arbitration clause in the SHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 There are or were other connected proceedings in the Isle of Man and Norway (“the foreign proceedings”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Isle of Man matter concerned a derivative  action against the directors of Lime PLC; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Norwegian proceedings apparently involved a putative action against officers of Lime Norway.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 A number of adjournments were sought and granted, particularly in light of the foreign proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision of the AR</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Before the AR, the Defendants relied on two separate bases in their application to stay proceedings in S 412/2016. First, they sought to invoke the court’s inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings for case management interests. On this basis, they submitted that the claims raised in S 412/2016 were premised on or overlapped with the alleged breaches of the disputes arising out of the SHA. As such, the claims should be referred to arbitration in accordance with the SHA and S 412/2016 should be stayed pending the arbitration. Second, they submitted that the institution of S 412/2016 was an abuse of process, which justified for a stay of the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The AR granted the Defendants’ application for stay on the first basis but found that the second basis was not made out, issuing oral grounds for his decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The AR found that on the pleadings as they stood, the legal and factual disputes in the Plaintiff’s claims overlapped and were intertwined with those concerning breaches of the SHA. The conspiracy allegations were founded on events concerning the dilution of Lime PLC’s shareholding in Lime Norway, and thus involved breaches of the SHA, though there were some issues which were technically unrelated. The claims in relation to the various subsidiaries of Lime PLC were also similarly founded on breaches of the SHA. As for the unjust enrichment, wrongful interference and inducement for breach of contract claims, these were also found to be based on breaches of the SHA. Given the significant overlap, the close relationship between the parties in the two proceedings, the duplication of witnesses, the risk of inconsistent findings, and there being no bar to the claims in S 412/2016 being pursued in arbitration in accordance with the SHA, a stay was ordered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The AR noted that the Plaintiff’s counsel wished to pursue its claims as pleaded, and there was no intention to amend its pleadings. Given this indication, the AR did not find it necessary to give the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend its pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 As for the Defendants’ argument that there was, alternatively, an abuse of process, the AR found that there was insufficient evidence of this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The current applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 29 September 2016, the Plaintiff filed an appeal against the AR’s decision to grant a stay of court proceedings (“RA 348/2016”) and subsequently applied to amend its pleadings on 3 November 2016 (“SUM 5355/2016”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Defendants then sought leave to file a further affidavit on 24 November 2016 (“SUM 5691/2016”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 After hearing the parties, I allowed the Plaintiff to amend its pleadings and consequently granted leave to the Defendants to adduce further evidence by way of an affidavit. However, I reserved my decision with regard to the stay of court proceedings in RA 348/2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiff’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In SUM 5355/2016, the Plaintiff argued that the proposed amendments to the pleadings should be permitted as no prejudice would result from them. The Plaintiff submitted that the AR had erred in not inviting an amendment, as was required by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals </span>[2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>”). With respect to SUM 5691/2016, it was argued that the Defendants should not be allowed to raise new evidence on appeal and the further affidavit should thus not be admitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Following the amendments to the pleadings by way of SUM 5355/2016, the Plaintiff submits that there is no longer any basis to order a stay. The Plaintiff argues that the amendments removed all reliance on breaches of the SHA. The SHA is thus irrelevant in respect of the amended claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Plaintiff agrees with the Defendants and the observations made in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> that the relevant question is whether the substance of the controversy is covered by the arbitration clause. On the facts however, the Plaintiff argues that the scope of the SHA does not cover the amended claims.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Plaintiff further submits that it cannot be compelled to bring arbitration proceedings against a specific party that it does not intend to sue. This approach is evident from some of the cases relied upon by the Defendants (including <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>) where the plaintiff had already initiated arbitration and/or court proceedings against a party, with whom the plaintiff has an arbitration agreement, thereby evincing an intention to bring legal proceedings against this party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Furthermore, it is significant that neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendants are parties to the PMTSA or OSA. Thus, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendants cannot invoke the arbitration clauses in either agreements to stay the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In addition, the Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants’ arguments in relation to the abuse of process and multiplicity of proceedings are not made out. According to the Plaintiff, the Lime Norway Allegations do not raise issues of abuse of process, or create multiplicity of proceedings. The appropriate standard was noted in <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another </span>[2006] 1 SLR 582 – a high threshold for abuse of process or vexatiousness is to be made out and clear evidence is required. For abuse of process to be made out, it must also be shown that unmeritorious claims are being made: see <span class="font-italic">Chua Choon Lim Robert v MN Swami and others </span>[2000] 2 SLR 589.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Plaintiff’s position is that no abuse of process arises on the facts. There is no clear evidence of abuse and the multiple suits are not intended to apply maximum pressure. The Plaintiff also highlights the differences between the proceedings in Singapore, Isle of Man and Norway. The Isle of Man proceedings concern derivative claims, and no substantive claims are being pursued there. In comparison, the present litigation in Singapore relates to injuries caused to the Plaintiff. The Norwegian proceedings can also be distinguished as they relate to an action against persons who are officers of Lime Norway and do not concern the Defendants. The foreign proceedings thus either concern different causes of action or involve action against different entities. There are hence no current proceedings in the other jurisdictions that cover the same claims as S 412/2016. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Defendants’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In SUM 5355/2016, the Defendants argued that the proposed amendment of pleadings should not be permitted. While the Defendants conceded that amendments are generally allowed on appeal, they sought to distinguish the present application on the basis that the AR below had specifically invited the Plaintiff to amend. A prior opportunity to amend was thus specifically given to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff chose not to take up the AR’s invitation, waited for the AR’s decision, and only indicated its intention to apply for an amendment on the eve of the first hearing scheduled for RA 348/2016. The Defendants went further to assert that it was in fact mischievous for the Plaintiff to criticise the AR, who could not have forced the Plaintiff to amend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 With respect to RA 348/2016, the Defendants argue that a stay of S 412/2016 should be granted because the Plaintiff has an arbitration agreement with RME under cl 25.2 of the SHA. They submit that a stay in the interests of case management may be granted even if the applicant is not directly a party to the arbitration agreement, relying on the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Danone</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pacific Holdings Pte Ltd v Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited </span>[2014] NZHC 1681 (“<span class="font-italic">Danone</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Reic</span><span class="font-italic">hhold Norway ASA v Goldman Sachs International </span>[2000] 1 WLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span>”) and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Shanghai Construction (Group) General Co Singapore Branch v Tan Poo Seng </span>[2012] SGHCR 10 (“<span class="font-italic">Shanghai Construction</span>”). In particular, the Defendants highlight that the case of <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Construction</span> was not doubted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>. The only change that came through <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> was the relevant threshold for granting a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Defendants argue that the claims made by the Plaintiff in S 412/2016, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, conspiracy, wrongful interference, and unjust enrichment, are still premised on breaches of the SHA notwithstanding the amendments made to the pleadings. They reason that one cannot just look at the cause of action pleaded, otherwise, an artful pleader would be able to circumvent the arbitration agreement. The Defendants claim that everything alleged by the Plaintiff relates to the activities of Lime PLC and its subsidiaries. In considering the characterisation and scope of an arbitration clause, a practical and commonsensical inquiry ought to be adopted. In the present case, the Defendants take the position that the arbitration clause in the SHA has a wide scope because it covers disputes arising from or in relation to the subsidiaries of Lime PLC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Citing <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the Defendants submit that the court must look at the substance of the controversy. Here, the claim is really about the relationship of the parties as the Shareholders of Lime PLC under the SHA – the allegations in S 412/2016 relate to the dilution of the Plaintiff’s indirect interest in Lime PLC. Allegations are also raised as to the management of MOL, the affairs of Lime PLC and Lime Norway. As such, the Defendants argue that the substance of the controversy is really the Shareholders’ dispute arising out of the SHA. They also claim that similar allegations were raised in the Isle of Man proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 According to the Defendants, the rectification notice dated 25 March 2015 served by the Plaintiff on RME

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> (“the Rectification Notices”), where the Plaintiff alleged breaches of the SHA arising from the same facts, are strongly suggestive that the Plaintiff itself regarded the matter as a shareholders’ dispute covered by the SHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Applying the factors considered in <span class="font-italic">Danone</span>, the Defendants submit that the Plaintiff’s claims are derived from and subsidiary to the allegations of breaches of the SHA. For example, in relation to the Lime Norway Allegations, the Plaintiff has to show breach of cll 10, 12.1.4, and 14.1 of the SHA. Similarly, as regards MOL, cll 12.1.4 and 14.1 of the SHA have to be relied on. The allegations thus arise out of and concern the affairs of Lime PLC and its subsidiaries. Properly characterised, the nub of the Plaintiff’s complaints falls within the scope of the arbitration clause in the SHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Additionally, the Defendants claim that there is a significant area of overlap between the factual and legal issues raised in the court proceedings in S 412/2016 and any future arbitration between the Plaintiff and RME under the SHA. As there is no bar to raising in arbitration matters that have already been raised in S 412/2016, a stay should be granted to prevent inconsistent findings. The Defendants also argue that it would be more appropriate to stay the whole of the court proceedings as opposed to just some of claims in S 412/2016.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Defendants highlight that the complaints in the Isle of Man proceedings were stayed because the arbitration clause was found to have applied. As for the Norwegian proceedings, the Plaintiff may now commence an action in the Norwegian district court, since the conciliation proceedings have ended there. The Defendants therefore maintain that there remains a risk of multiplicity of proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Defendants also allege that there has been an abuse of process, by relying on the email dated 9 October 2015 that was sent by Dr Kenneth Pereira (“Dr Pereira”). In the email, Dr Pereira, who was the Plaintiff’s nominated director of Lime PLC, threatened to sue everyone “at all levels”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Dan Brostorm’s 3rd Affidavit dated 3 June 2016 (Exhibit DB-08) at p 83.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> According to the Defendants, the Plaintiff’s several court actions in the different jurisdictions represent their making good of that threat.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 After the hearings, I allowed the pleadings to be amended. The amendments essentially omitted from the pleadings the portions where the Plaintiff relied on the SHA to make out its case. As a result of the amendment, I also allowed the Defendants’ application for a further affidavit to be admitted into evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I reserved my decision for the issue on stay in RA 348/2016. The present decision on whether a stay should be ordered is accordingly based on the amended pleadings. Notwithstanding the amendments made, I find that the court proceedings should be stayed on certain conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I now set out my reasons for allowing the amendment of pleadings in SUM 5355/2016 and my decision as to the stay of court proceedings in RA 348/2016. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The amendment of the pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The issue on the amendment of pleadings was whether the Plaintiff should be allowed to amend its pleadings so as to remove all references to breaches of the SHA, which contains the arbitration clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The possibility of amending pleadings to avoid a stay of court proceedings was suggested in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the plaintiff-respondent, Silica Investors Ltd (“Silica Investors”) sought relief under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) for oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct towards it as a minority shareholder of a Singapore listed company (“AMRG”). Shares in AMRG were purchased by Silica Investors from the second defendant, Lionsgate Holdings Pte Ltd (“Lionsgate”), pursuant to a share sale agreement that contained an arbitration clause. One of the allegations concerned the issuance of a large number of AMRG shares which allegedly had the effect of diluting Silica Investors’ shareholding in AMRG (“the Share Issuance Allegation”). At the hearing of the appeals in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the Court of Appeal (at [131]) gave the opportunity for Silica Investors to amend its pleadings because the pleadings for the Share Issuance Allegation, as they stood, had engaged the warranties in the share sale agreement, giving rise to considerations of whether they had been breached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In addition, Silica Investors had made another allegation (the “Management Participation Allegation”) that was also the subject of the arbitration agreement between Silica Investors and Lionsgate. The Court of Appeal held that if Silica Investors decided <span class="font-italic">not</span> to pursue the Management Participation Allegation against Lionsgate, then there would be no need for the court proceedings to be stayed in favour of arbitration (at [190]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Plaintiff argued that applying <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the Plaintiff should have been invited by the AR to amend its claims below. The Defendants counter-argued that the amendments should be disallowed, submitting that the Plaintiff had chosen not to amend when invited by the AR. It would thus be inappropriate to allow the amendment on appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It is uncontroversial that a court can grant leave for amendments to pleadings “at any stage of the proceedings”: see O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). Amendments can accordingly be allowed even <span class="font-italic">during</span><span class="font-italic"> appeals</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall</span><span class="font-italic">.com Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 502 at [101]. As pointed out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien Loong</span> [2010] 1 SLR 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span>”) at [112(c)], amendments to pleadings have been allowed even “in the course of an appeal itself” in several local cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As a general rule, amendments to pleadings ought to be allowed if they would enable the real question and/or issue in controversy between the parties to be determined (<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span> at [113], citing <span class="font-italic">Wright Norman and another v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 640 at [6]). In determining whether to grant a party leave to amend his pleadings, the court has regard to “the justice of the case” and amendments may be disallowed on appeal where any prejudice suffered is such that it cannot be compensable by an award of costs or where it would be akin to allowing the applicant a second bite at the cherry: see <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai Sin</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 173 at [12] and [18]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, I found that there was no such prejudice or an attempt to revisit decided issues. The amendments sought by the Plaintiff were to reframe its claims to avoid the outcome of a stay in favour of arbitration. Such reframing did not amount to a revisiting of a decided matter – it involved the Plaintiff giving up parts of its initial claim (for instance, it entirely abandoned its claim for inducement by the Defendants for RME’s breach of contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the SHA) so as to not run afoul of the principle laid down in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>. There was also no trial or evidential hearing, such that any changes to the pleadings would necessitate testimony and questioning to be run through again. Additionally, in <span class="font-italic">Tomoluge</span><span class="font-italic">n </span>itself, the invitation to amend was similarly made at the appellate stage. The fact that these amendments may affect the outcome of RA 348/2016 is not a material consideration – as noted above, the courts have allowed amendments on appeal provided no prejudice is caused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There thus did not appear to be much that stood in the way of allowing the amendments to be made, subject to the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I do note that the Plaintiff’s actual arguments rested on the assertion that the AR’s conduct of the matter was incorrect – he should have effectively directed or strongly invited the amendment.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> From a perusal of the notes of evidence below, it was clear that the AR had expressly asked the Plaintiff’s counsel whether the Plaintiff intended to amend its pleadings, to which the answer was that there were no present instructions from the Plaintiff to do so. Short of amending the pleadings himself, I was unable to determine what else the AR could have done in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In fact, when invited by the AR, the Plaintiff should have taken up this opportunity. This was the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> (at [131]–[132]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">131  At the hearing of these appeals, <span class="font-italic">we </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">suggested</span><span class="font-italic"> to counsel for Silica Investors</span>, Mr Paul Ong, that the manner in which the Share Issuance Allegation had been pleaded appeared to engage the warranties in the Share Sale Agreement and give rise, at least indirectly, to considerations of whether they had been breached. <span class="font-italic">Mr Ong resisted this suggestion vigorously.</span> He contended that Silica Investors was not alleging that the warranties in the Share Sale Agreement had been breached; on the contrary, it was relying on the truth of those warranties to evidence its contention that the liabilities relating to the Solar Silica Assets had already been settled by the time the Share Sale Agreement was concluded. Mr Ong further contended that there was no need for Silica Investors to rely on the Share Sale Agreement to make good its allegation that the alleged debts were fictitious and the share issuance, improper. We did not, however, think that Silica Investors’ pleadings on the Share Issuance Allegation cohered entirely with Mr Ong’s position before us, and so, at the close of the hearing, <span class="font-italic">we gave Silica Investors </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">an opportunity</span><span class="font-italic"> to amend its pleadings on that allegation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if it desired</span><span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">132  <span class="font-italic">Silica Investors took up the opportunity</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff’s own failure to amend the pleadings could not be subsequently laid at the feet of the AR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Nonetheless, the fact that the Plaintiff did not take up the invitation by the AR does not mean that they should now be precluded from doing so on appeal.

</div>
</div> this appears to be only part of the background description of the relationship between the various parties concerned. The issue of whether the Plaintiff can successfully make out its case without reliance or invocation of the SHA is a separate matter, which I address further below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Considering the state of the pleadings as they now stand after the amendments, I turn now to the important question of whether a stay of the court proceedings in S 412/2016 should be granted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stay of court proceedings in S 412/2016 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 After carefully considering the submissions made by the Plaintiff and the Defendants as well as the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, I affirm the AR’s decision for S 412/2016 to be stayed. I will however, vary the terms of the stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, the stay of S 412/2016 is granted on the following conditions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) if the tiered dispute resolution under cl 25.2 of the SHA is not triggered by any of the parties to the SHA <span class="font-weight-bold">within</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> three months </span>from the date of this judgment or an arbitration is not commenced <span class="font-weight-bold">within</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> five months </span>from the date of this judgment, the parties shall be at liberty to apply to the court to lift the stay; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Defendants be bound by the findings of fact made by the putative arbitral tribunal; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the parties shall be at liberty to pursue the court proceedings in S 412/2016 and apply to lift the stay if the putative arbitration is unduly delayed; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) following the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings, subject to any <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>issues, the parties are entitled to resume S 412/2016 against the Defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reliance by non-parties to the arbitration agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is common ground between the parties, as found in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [138], that the court has the inherent power to stay court proceedings in the interests of case management pending the resolution of a related arbitration. It is also common ground that such a stay can be granted even if the applicant is not directly a party to the arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I am satisfied that the parties’ agreed position is correct. The consideration of the matter looks not only at whether the parties involved in the court proceedings are bound to each other in arbitration, but considers broader concerns including wider case management. That much is clear from <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">188  … In this regard, we consider that the court’s discretion to stay court proceedings pending the resolution of a related arbitration, <span class="font-italic">at the request of parties who are not subject to the</span><span class="font-italic"> arbitration agreement in question</span>, can in turn be made subject to the agreement of those parties to be bound by any applicable findings that may be made by the arbitral tribunal. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Danone</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Venning J in the New Zealand High Court noted that the Arbitration Act 1996 (NZ) did not apply as the applicant in question and the defendant were not subject to an arbitration agreement between them. Nonetheless, Venning J found that the court had a discretionary power, supported by r 15.1 of the New Zealand High Court Rules, to allow a stay of proceedings instead of striking out. Venning J also found that there was an inherent power to order a stay.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Reich</span><span class="font-italic">hold</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a decision of the Queen’s Bench Division, is to the same effect. The plaintiff’s action was stayed pending an arbitration between the defendant and a third party. Moore-Bick J noted (at 46–47) that the court’s power to stay proceedings is part of its inherent jurisdiction, covering a wide range of circumstances.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Such an inherent jurisdiction was also recognised in <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Construction, </span>a pre-<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> case. In that decision, Eunice Chua AR concluded that the inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings in the absence of an arbitration agreement between the parties involved in the court proceedings would only be exercised in “rare and exceptional circumstances” (at [16]). Even though the threshold is now different given the decision in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> (see [60] below), <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Construction</span> remains valid for the proposition that a stay can be ordered in respect of court proceedings between parties who are not bound to an arbitration agreement with each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This must be correct. The power to order a case management stay is part of the court’s own inherent and immediate powers to control proceedings before it. While the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties would give strong grounds for a stay of court proceedings taken in contravention of that agreement, there are already express statutory provisions conferring the power to stay under s 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”) or s 6 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the AA”) (for domestic arbitrations). Instead, the inherent power is invoked to deal with situations without an express agreement between the relevant parties to the court proceedings. Furthermore, the jurisprudential basis for the exercise of the power to stay in the absence of an agreement is the wider need to control and manage proceedings between the parties for a fair and efficient administration of justice; it is not predicated on holding parties to any agreement – the absence of such an agreement is therefore irrelevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Accordingly, while the Defendants are not parties to the arbitration agreement with the Plaintiff, in principle, they may seek a stay of proceedings on the basis of case management, if it is established that it is necessary to “serve the ends of justice”: see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [188]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Case management</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 After a comprehensive review of foreign authorities from England and New Zealand, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> made the following observations in relation to the court’s exercise of inherent jurisdiction:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">187  We would not set the bar for the grant of a case management stay at the “rare and compelling” threshold that the English and the New Zealand courts have adopted. We recognise that a plaintiff’s right to sue whoever he wants and where he wants is a fundamental one. But, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that right is not absolute</span>. It is restrained only to a modest extent when the plaintiff’s claim is stayed temporarily pending the resolution of a related arbitration, as opposed to when the plaintiff’s claim is shut out in its entirety: <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> Norway (HC) </span>([165] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 491 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Moore-Bick J. In appropriate cases, that right may be curtailed or may even be regarded as subsidiary to holding the plaintiff to his obligation to arbitrate where he has agreed to do so.

The approach laid down by the Court of Appeal in respect of case management powers is generally applicable where the dispute engages an arbitration agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div> The abandonment of this point is explicable. Given that there is no arbitration agreement between the parties to the S 412/2016, s 6 of the IAA is not applicable and thus nothing turns on this in the present appeal. Instead, the key question is whether the court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to stay the court proceedings in S 412/2016. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Here, the Plaintiff’s claims as they stand concern unlawful means and lawful means conspiracy in relation to various entities, unjust enrichment claims and wrongful interference. In applying the approach laid out in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the essential question then is whether the SHA (which contains the arbitration clause) is engaged by these claims after the pleadings have been amended. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Plaintiff argues that as a result of the amendments to the pleadings, the SHA will not be engaged by the court proceedings in S 412/2016 and there is thus no basis to grant the stay requested by the Defendants. The Defendants on the other hand maintain that even with the amended pleadings, the allegations raised touch on matters covered by the SHA, and which thus would properly be the subject of arbitration between the Plaintiff and RME. The Defendants argue that the heart of the Plaintiff’s suit arises from the relationship between the Plaintiff and RME as shareholders of Lime PLC and that the Plaintiff seeks to circumvent the arbitration agreement by framing its claims against RME’s parent companies, who are the present Defendants.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Defendants argue that the arbitration agreement in cl 25.2 of the SHA is intended to cover disputes arising from or in relation to the subsidiaries such as disputes over their proper management and control. The Plaintiff however argues that the SHA is irrelevant in respect of the amended claims. For instance, the claim of conspiracy in respect of Lime PLC’s votes at company meetings did not invoke the obligations in the SHA, but relies instead on the general duties owed by directors. Similarly, the claims in relation to the unreasonable withholding of payments by Lime PLC from HOSL (the Plaintiff’s subsidiary) does not engage the SHA – there is nothing in the SHA to justify or support such conduct on the part of Lime PLC.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I agree with the Defendants’ submission that the arbitration agreement in cl 25.2 must be read in light of the other clauses in the SHA. On a contextual reading of cl 25.2 in light of some of the other clauses in the SHA, which shed light on the intended scope of SHA, I am satisfied that the arbitration agreement does not only cover disputes concerning the specific parties to the SHA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiff, RME, Schroder and Lime PLC, but also disputes in relation to Lime PLC’s subsidiaries, including Lime Norway and MOL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Even though the subsidiaries in question are not part of the SHA, and their affairs are also not directly dealt with in the SHA, the SHA does cover a number of matters involving the subsidiaries. One example is the ability given under cl 12.1.4 of the SHA to nominate a director directly to the board of the various subsidiaries of Lime PLC, which impacts on the oversight maintained over these subsidiaries, in terms of their activities, operations and management. Similarly, cl 14.1, which reserves certain matters to a “Supra Majority”, particularly reserves changes to concession agreements of Lime Norway, MOL, and other subsidiaries as a Board Reserve Matter (see cl 14.1(ii) of the SHA).

</div>
</div>
</div> As defined in cl 2.1 of the SHA, the “Supra Majority” references the “collective express approval of each Director nominated by [the Shareholders]”. SHA thus governs the control exerted by the Shareholders over Lime PLC’s subsidiaries. These provisions show that the Shareholders did intend to regulate their disputes pertaining to the <span class="font-italic">general business</span> of Lime PLC, <span class="font-italic">including its subsidiaries</span>, under the framework of the SHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I am however not persuaded that cl 15, which provides for consolidation of accounts, and certain obligations covering the subsidiaries, lends support to the Defendants’ argument. This is because cl 15 only concerns Lime PLC’s activities and financial reporting, <span class="font-italic">qua</span> holding company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Accordingly, the SHA itself covers:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the affairs of Lime PLC and its subsidiaries; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) majority voting and other rights and obligations of the Shareholders; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) representation on boards of subsidiaries, including Lime Norway and MOL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 This means that issues in respect of the proper administration of the subsidiaries of Lime PLC that may arise from the control exerted by any of the Shareholders, fall within the ambit of the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 On the face of it, the Plaintiff’s amended statement of claim does not <span class="font-italic">directly</span> engage the SHA. However, the reduced reference to the SHA in the pleadings is not determinative of the appeal. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the crux of the inquiry on whether to order a stay requires an examination of the “substance” of the court proceedings, and not only on how it is presented at the surface level in the pleadings (see [64] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the present case, I understand that this approach entails that each of the various categories of claims be considered separately, and its respective connection with the agreement discerned.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 To recapitulate, the amended claims may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) conspiracy (by both lawful and unlawful means) in relation to actions concerning the dilution of Lime PLC’s shares in Lime Norway, and the improper amendment of Lime Norway’s articles of association; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) conspiracy (by both lawful and unlawful means) in respect of MOL by diluting Lime PLC’s interest in MOL, improper management of MOL and its operations, as well as its ownership;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) conspiracy (by both lawful and unlawful means) in respect of Lime PLC, concerning protracted payment delays, exclusion of an officer of the Plaintiff from Lime PLC matters; bad faith withdrawal of funding commitments;  and conduct in respect of a claim made by MOL against Lime PLC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) unjust enrichment by the Defendants in gaining a higher effective interest in Lime Norway at the expense of the Plaintiff; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) wrongful interference in actions that should have been taken by Lime PLC, particularly in respect of Lime Norway.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It is true, as the Plaintiff submits, that the conspiracy claims do not directly invoke the SHA. Nonetheless, even after the amendments, these claims are still likely to involve a determination of the nature of the actions taken or omissions of various persons, including the directors and the Shareholders. In particular, the conduct of the Shareholders in this regard is a matter governed by the SHA. As submitted by the Defendants, the gravamen of the complaint by the Plaintiff is the dilution of its interests in Lime PLC and thus its say or participation in the various associated companies. In determining that essential issue, the findings of the court in the civil proceedings in S 412/2016 is likely to overlap with the various findings that may be made in the arbitration between the Plaintiff and RME in relation to the actions or omissions of the Shareholders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Further, I also agree with the Defendants’ submission that the Rectification Notices showed that the Plaintiff’s own position was that key components of its claims stemmed from alleged breaches of the SHA. For instance, with respect to the conspiracy claim in relation to Lime Norway, the Plaintiff took the position in its Rectification Notice dated 2 November 2015 that the acts of RME leading to the alleged dilution of Lime PLC’s shareholding in Lime Norway were breaches under the SHA.

</div> The same points can be made in relation to the conspiracy claims <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>Lime PLC and MOL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 At a holistic level, it is unlikely for the connections between the conspiracy claims here and the actions or omissions of the Shareholders as bound by the SHA to be untangled and separated. Furthermore, given that the risk of inconsistent findings between the arbitral tribunal and the court is a relevant consideration in determining whether stay should be granted (see [62(e)] above), another reason thus operates: there is to my mind a significant risk that there may be inconsistent findings between the court proceedings and arbitration. I am unable to find that, even after the amendments made by the Plaintiff, the significant overlap with any future arbitration has been minimised.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In particular, the conspiracy claim in respect of MOL and Lime PLC tangentially engage the PMTSA and OSA (both of which contain separate arbitration agreements to which neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendants are parties). In respect of the OSA, the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants had conspired to compromise the Plaintiff’s interest in Lime PLC by improperly and unjustifiably terminating the OSA between MOL and Lime PLC.

</div>
</div> Due to the presence of agreements other than the SHA to which neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendants are parties to, the Plaintiff argues that a stay cannot be ordered, at least in respect of these claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my view, the Plaintiff’s argument misses the point. The conspiracy claim relating to MOL concerned the affairs of MOL, which is a vehicle set up by Lime PLC and thus forms part of the business affairs between RME and the Plaintiff in Lime PLC. The complaints are thus about the running of a joint venture, which is regulated under the SHA. In fact, the PMTSA is expressly referred to in the SHA

</div>
</div> and any deviation from the PMTSA is subject to the requirement of “Supra Majority” approval under cl 14.1 of the SHA (see [75] above). Further, the Rectification Notices issued by the Plaintiff, alleging breaches of the SHA, contained references to several of these claims relating to the PMTSA and the OSA. This to my mind shows how these claims, even though they concern breaches of other related agreements, are all closely connected to the affairs of Lime PLC, which is regulated under the SHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As for the unjust enrichment and wrongful interference claims, the linkage to the shareholder relationship governed by the SHA is perhaps not as apparent as in the conspiracy claims. But I do find that the scope for overlap of facts and factual findings is nonetheless sufficiently significant so as to warrant a stay of those claims as well. The unjust enrichment claim is predicated on the alleged wrongful acts leading to the dilution of Lime PLC’s interests in Lime Norway and MOL, which are themselves components of the conspiracy claims relating to Lime Norway and MOL. It thus seeks recourse for similar injuries as is pleaded in relation to the conspiracy claims. The wrongful interference claim rests particularly on the Defendants’ alleged prevention of Lime PLC from voting against the Lime Norway proposals. This clearly overlaps with the issue as to whether there was any interference with Lime PLC’s actions in breach of the SHA. More critically, each of these claims seek to impugn the various actions of the Defendants and their associates. To my mind, it seems likely that the Defendants and their associates will point to the SHA and claim that it does not prohibit their actions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, they are likely to invoke the non-applicability of the SHA to justify their actions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Considered holistically, I find that that the primary claims made by the Plaintiff are in the nature of disputes between the Shareholders under the SHA and pertain to alleged improper actions taken at the Lime PLC level. These are, in my view, disputes arising out of the SHA given that the SHA regulates the business of Lime PLC. All in all, several factors similar to those in <span class="font-italic">Danone</span> point towards a stay being the appropriate conclusion: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there is significant overlap between the factual issues in the arbitration with those in the court proceedings; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there are bound to be common issues in both forums, namely whether the dilution of Lime PLC’s interest in Lime Norway was wrongful;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there is a sufficient risk of inconsistent findings of fact between the court proceedings and the putative arbitration given these overlapping issues; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) there is likely to be duplication of witnesses and evidence in both forums; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) there is nothing to bar the claims made in relation to the activities of the Shareholders and directors in the court proceedings from being pursued in the putative arbitration. The arbitration clause is broad enough to encompass claims arising out of the SHA and associated tortious claims. As noted below at [101], the Defendants have confirmed on affidavit that they consider these issues to arise out of the SHA and are ready and willing for all disputes arising out of the SHA to be resolved pursuant to cl 25.2 of the SHA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the findings made in the arbitration would bind the parties to the court proceedings – the Plaintiff here is also a party to the arbitration agreement. Although the Defendants are not, given their request to stay the court proceedings, I find that they ought to be bound by the findings of fact reached by the arbitral tribunal (see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [188]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I initially considered whether a stay could be refused on the imposition of a condition, namely that the SHA should not be invoked or relied upon by the Plaintiff in its case or at trial. In the end, however I do not consider this appropriate given my conclusion that the claims in the court proceedings do raise a risk of inconsistent findings. Such a risk would remain even if such conditions were imposed. In any event, it might be an artificial exercise and there is nothing to stop the Defendants from seeking refuge under the SHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I do not find that my approach here takes the position too broadly. The stay of S 412/2016 does not deprive the Plaintiff of his day in court; the resolution of matters in arbitration may instead clarify and delineate the issues, and avoid inconsistent findings. Just as in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, this is a case where there is a sole plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiff, who has contracted to arbitrate under the SHA. This obligation to arbitrate diminishes the force of any objection that its right of timely access to the courts is being compromised (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [187]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 At the end of the day, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [187]), a plaintiff’s right to proceed in the courts is not absolute. This right will not be unduly prejudiced in this case given the conditional nature of the stay, as well as the liberty of the Plaintiff to apply to court to reinstate the proceedings against the Defendants if the tiered dispute resolution under cl 25.2 of the SHA is not triggered within the specified period of three months from this judgment or a notice of arbitration is not issued within five months. Through this option, if the court proceedings are resumed, the Plaintiff is free to pursue its claims against whichever party it deems fit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 A conditional stay pending the resolution of a related arbitration also only restrains the Plaintiff’s right to sue to a limited extent. In my view, this is a case where the second and third higher order concerns in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> should take precedence over the first (see [62] above). Allowing the court proceedings to proceed in tandem may result in the court proceedings enveloping and effectively disposing of issues which are the subject matter of the arbitration or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. This clearly undermines the second and third higher order concerns. In the present case, the ends of justice would be better served by upholding the agreement to arbitrate between the Plaintiff and RME and eliminating the procedural complexities that accompany parallel proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I also find that an opportunity for further amendments need not be offered. The point of the amendment mechanism in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is to allow the possibility of proceedings continuing in a manner that avoids inconsistency and inefficiency. I do not read <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> as stipulating that there be an open-ended ability to amend. That would leave proceedings hanging indefinitely. Rather, the opportunity to amend is given as the entanglement of court proceedings with arbitration claims may indeed only be clarified through the process of a stay application. That clarification should not entail more than a limited opportunity of amendment. If any, I find that any further amendment here would not likely tease out a free-standing court claim that could proceed on its own without touching or being touched by the arbitration proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 That may not always be so across all cases. What effect any amendment of the pleadings may have will depend on the claims made in the specific case:  in some instances, such as perhaps that in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, it may be possible to carve out claims that do not conflict with the scope of the arbitration agreement. Here, however, even with the amendments, the nature of the claims that remain are such that they still entwined with the arbitration matters. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Must a matter be brought against a defendant who is party to the arbitration agreement? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 A final objection to stay that the Plaintiff makes is that a stay on the basis of case management can only be ordered if the dispute in the court proceedings has already been brought against a defendant who is a party to the arbitration agreement. This means that the dispute to be stayed must have already been brought against such defendant, whether in arbitral or court proceedings, such as to evince an intention of the plaintiff to commence legal proceedings against the particular defendant. In other words, a plaintiff cannot be compelled to bring claims against a party (even if it is a party to the arbitration agreement) when the plaintiff does not wish to even sue the party in the first place. The Plaintiff submits that this principle can be discerned from the facts of both <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> and <span class="font-italic">Danone</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In my judgment, the Plaintiff’s argument is misplaced. It adopts an unprincipled chronological sequence as to the <span class="font-italic">prior</span> existence of legal proceedings against the defendant party, with whom the plaintiff is bound to arbitrate its disputes. It would be a significant constraint on the court’s discretion if it is able to stay the court proceedings <span class="font-italic">only</span> where legal proceedings have already commenced against the defendant party. This would mean that even where legal proceedings are <span class="font-italic">imminent</span> and where the parties have expressly indicated to the court that they will commence such proceedings, a stay cannot be ordered. There is no conceivable reason why a stay cannot be ordered where there is a strong possibility of multiplicity of proceedings arising in the future as a result of one of the parties (subject to the arbitration agreement) bringing a claim against the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Although the Plaintiff is correct to observe that the factual matrix in both <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> and <span class="font-italic">Danone</span> were such that the plaintiff had already commenced legal proceedings against the defendant party, I do not read these cases as laying down such a bright-line rule. In fact, the case of <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Construction</span> (which was cited by the High Court in the <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> decision (see <span class="font-italic">Silica Investors Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and others </span>[2014] 3 SLR 815 at [133]) suggests the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Construction</span>, the plaintiff had a contractual agreement (which contained an arbitration clause) for certain building works to be performed by a construction company, Top Zone Construction &amp; Engineering Pte ltd (“Top Zone”). The defendant was a director and shareholder of Top Zone. Subsequently, when a dispute arose between the plaintiff and Top Zone, the plaintiff commenced legal proceedings against the defendant. The defendant applied for a stay of the court proceedings pending the resolution of an “intended arbitration” between the plaintiff and Top Zone. The stay was granted. It is crucial to note that at the time the stay was granted, there were no existing legal proceedings between Top Zone and the plaintiff (see <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Construction</span> at [9]). This decision makes eminent sense because if future proceedings are contemplated between the parties to the arbitration agreement, the proper recourse would be to stay the court proceedings where the factors weigh in favour of a stay as opposed to waiting until the relevant arbitration or court proceedings are commenced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 A similar outcome was reached in the decision of <span class="font-italic">Maybank</span>. In that case, the first respondent entered into a series of contract (“the CFD transactions”) with the appellant, a securities brokerage. The CFD transactions were governed by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a contract that contained an arbitration clause. The second respondent was the first respondent’s remisier for the CFD transactions under a remisier agreement containing an indemnity in favour of the appellant. When a subsequent dispute arose, the appellant then brought court proceedings against both respondents. It was common ground that the claims were governed by disparate dispute resolution mechanisms even though they were essentially for the same losses: the claim against the first respondent was subject to arbitration under the AA but the claim against the second respondent under the remisier agreement was subject to a non-exclusive jurisdiction agreement in favour of the local courts. At first instance, on an application to stay the court proceedings, the assistant registrar not only ordered the stay against the first respondent but also invoked the court’s case management powers to stay the court proceedings against the second respondent pending the outcome of the arbitration proceedings between the appellant and the first respondent. However, on appeal, the appellant was prepared to abandon its claims against the first respondent and expressed its intention to only proceed its claims against the second respondent. The observations made by Steven Chong J (as he then was) to this change in circumstances are worth quoting in full: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4  When the appeal came before me, the appellant, after some prevarication and in recognition of the difficulties in demonstrating any sufficient reason for refusing a stay under s 6 of the AA, elected to abandon the appeal against the first respondent. At the same time, the appellant’s counsel informed the court that it had no current instructions to commence any arbitration proceedings against the first respondent. This was clearly a tactical decision to aid the appellant’s argument that the claim against the second respondent, which is not subject to arbitration, should not be stayed since there will no longer be any pending arbitration proceedings between the first respondent and the appellant running in parallel with the court proceedings against the second respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5  The respondents, who had no prior notice of the appellant’s decision to drop the appeal against the first respondent, were understandably taken by surprise. After taking instructions from the respondents following this development, the respondents’ counsel informed the court that <span class="font-italic">the first respondent would initiate arbitration proceedings against the appellant under the CFD Terms and Conditions within 14 days of the hearing even if the appellant did not do so.</span> <span class="font-italic">Hence the issue of multiplicity of proceedings </span><span class="font-italic">prima facie remains alive.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Chong J then proceeded to dismiss the appeal and accordingly upheld the stay of proceedings against the second respondent pending the resolution of the related arbitration between the appellant and the first respondent. <span class="font-italic">Maybank</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>demonstrates that there is no prerequisite for an existing proceeding between the parties to the arbitration agreement before a case management stay can be ordered. More pertinently, <span class="font-italic">Maybank</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>shows that even if the plaintiff does not commence arbitration proceedings, the other party to the arbitration agreement can do so such that the issue of multiplicity of proceedings “remains alive”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the present case, the Defendants have confirmed on affidavit that the Defendants as well as RME are “ready and willing to do all things necessary to enable disputes that arise out of the SHA to be resolved expeditiously in accordance with the provisions of Clause 25 of the SHA”.

</div> Thus, even if the Plaintiff does not initiate arbitration against RME, the Defendants can move RME to do so. Where such proceedings are brought, for the reasons stated above, a conditional stay is appropriate to serve the ends of justice. However, an undefined opportunity for arbitration to be commenced would also not be in the interests of justice. The best middle ground in such a case would be to stay the proceedings but for it to be lifted if the tiered dispute resolution under cl 25.2 of the SHA is not triggered within the specified period of three months from this judgment or a notice of arbitration is not issued within five months. This approach may cause a delay in the proceedings but it is the better approach to adopt in the circumstances, for the reasons explained above. In any event, the financial consequences of any delay can be addressed by an adequate award of interest: see <span class="font-italic">Danone</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [91].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Defendants raise abuse of process as another reason to stay the court proceedings in Singapore, pointing to the multiplicity of proceedings in Norway, the Isle of Man and Singapore.

Dr Pereira’s reference to suing “at all levels” was not unqualified – he qualified this statement by referencing that legal suits will be brought against three specified entities, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Lime Norway, Lime PLC and the 1st Defendant. I see nothing wrong with a plaintiff bringing claims against multiple defendants in a situation where each of them had participated in the wrongdoing caused to the plaintiff. In any event, there was no reference made to suing the Defendants in <span class="font-italic">multiple jurisdictions</span>. Seen in this context, I fail to see how the email sent by him demonstrates that the suit brought against the Defendants in S 412/2016 is an abuse of process (in light of the foreign proceedings). It bears emphasis that the requisite threshold for staying proceedings which are an abuse of process requires “very clear evidence of such abuse” (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2285</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Sum Lye Heng (alias Lim Jessie)</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 408 at [15]). This threshold is clearly not met here based on the evidence before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Accordingly, I agree with the AR’s conclusion that there is insufficient basis shown by the Defendants for any <span class="font-italic">mala fides </span>on the part of the Plaintiff in instituting S 412/2016 and there is thus no reason to stay S 412/2016 on the basis of abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Effect of SUM 5355/2016 and SUM 5691/2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In SUM 5691/2016, an application for further evidence was made by the Defendants to have an additional affidavit to be admitted.

Given that <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was specifically cited as an authority during the proceedings below, the Plaintiff should have been prepared to make any necessary amendments at the earlier stage.
