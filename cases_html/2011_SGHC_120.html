<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff Ng Chee Weng applied to amend his
                    Statement of Claim against the defendants. Some of the amendments were dismissed
                    by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”), and the plaintiff appealed
                    against the dismissal. I affirmed the AR’s decision and set out my
                    grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 26 May 2009, when the plaintiff
                    commenced the action against the defendants, he set out the basis of his claim
                    in para 1 of the Statement of Claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiff was the beneficial owner of 50% of the shareholding in Sinco
                        Technologies Pte Ltd (the “Company”) which was held in trust
                        for the Plaintiff by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant up to
                        April 2007. The Plaintiff was therefore entitled to dividend payments made
                        whilst he was the beneficial owner of the 50% shareholding interests in the
                        Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Statement of Claim went on to state that the
                    plaintiff had sold his shares in the company to the first defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    On or about late April or May 2007, the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Defendant approached the Plaintiff
                            inquiring if the Plaintiff was interested in selling all his 50%
                            shareholding in the Company to the 1<sup>st</sup>
                            Defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant offered to
                            purchase all of the Plaintiff’s shareholding in the Company. But,
                            the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant suppressed the material
                            fact that indeed substantial dividend payments were previously made, in
                            particular, between the period 2003 and 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    The Plaintiff agreed to sell his 50% shareholding
                            in the Company to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant at the
                            price of $5,000,000.00. The Plaintiff – at that time – had
                            no inkling that dividend payments were previously paid out by the
                            Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff’s complaint was that the
                    first defendant had not accounted for and paid over to him dividend payments the
                    company paid in respect to his shares prior to the sale. He alleged that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.    Given that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                            Defendant holds 50% shareholding in the Company in trust for the
                            Plaintiff between the period of 2003 and 2007, the Plaintiff was
                            beneficially entitled to payment of dividends of $12,015,000.00 (being
                            50% of dividend payments of the Company of $24,030,000.00 for the period
                            from 2003 to 2007). However, there was a prior agreement between the
                            Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that 5% out
                            of the 50% of the Plaintiff’s beneficial entitlement to the
                            dividend payments of the Company would be paid to the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. Accordingly, the
                            Plaintiff’s rightful 45% share of the dividend payments for the
                            period 2003 to 2006 amounts to $8,880,916.67.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff concluded the Statement of Claim
                    with a claim for the dividends of $8,880,916.67.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The negotiations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Besides his entitlement to the dividends, the
                    Statement of Claim also alluded to discussions between the plaintiff and the
                    first defendant. References were made to them in several parts of the Statement
                    of Claim, mainly in:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29.    Between the period
                            from March 2009 and April 2009, the Plaintiff had various meetings
                            and/or telephone conversations with the 1<sup>st</sup>
                            Defendant [in the presence of or through one Roy] during which the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(1)    did not deny that he was holding the 45%
                                shareholding of the Company in trust for the
                            Plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    did not deny that the Plaintiff was entitled
                                to dividend payments of the Company, the shares of which was held in
                                trust for the Plaintiff by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                                Defendant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(3)    offered, first $3,500,000.00 [at the meeting
                                on 23 March 2009] and then $4,500,000 [at the meeting on 31 March
                                2009] to the Plaintiff in settlement of the dividend payments which
                                the Plaintiff was beneficially entitled to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    The particulars of
                            the relevant meetings and/or telephone conversations between the parties
                            are set out as follows:</p>

                                    1<sup>st</sup> Defendant then offered the
                                Plaintiff $4,500,000.00. The Plaintiff decided to accept this given
                                his long-standing friendship with the 1<sup>st</sup>
                                Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(4)    15 April 2009 telephone conversation between
                                the Plaintiff [through Roy Ng] and the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> Defendant – Roy Ng, on the
                                Plaintiff’s behalf, called the 1<sup>st</sup>
                                Defendant on the telephone and informed him of the Plaintiff’s
                                decision to reject the $4,500,000.00 offer and the Plaintiff’s
                                counter-proposal of $6,500,000.00 as a global sum for the settlement
                                of his share of the dividend payments. However, the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> Defendant rejected the
                                Plaintiff’s proposal; and..</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the plaintiff referred to the
                    discussions, he stopped short of alleging that there was a concluded
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The striking-out application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendants applied to strike out parts of
                    the Statement of Claim including the parts quoted in the foregoing paragraph on
                    the ground that they referred to “without prejudice”
                    communications, which were privileged from disclosure. The plaintiff resisted
                    the application and contended that the negotiations were not carried out on a
                    “without prejudice” basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The application came on for hearing before
                    Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean, who granted the application and struck out the
                    paragraphs in question. The plaintiff was not satisfied with her decision and
                    brought an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In the course of the arguments before the Court
                    of Appeal, the plaintiff put forward amendments to the Statement of Claim to
                    plead a claim to enforce a settlement agreement as an alternative claim to the
                    claim for the dividends. (I refer to these amendments, which were not
                    incorporated into any application for amendment, as the proposed amendments.)
                    The essence of the amendments is in [33]
                    of the proposal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 31 March 2009 the Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Defendant entered into another oral Settlement Agreement under which
                        agreement <em>the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                            agreed to pay the Plaintiff S$4.5 million</em> in discharge of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s liability as trustee to
                        account for dividends declared and paid by the Company to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for the period 2003-2007,
                        ....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The critical change was that the settlement negotiations became an
                    agreement to settle at $4.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendants objected to the proposed
                    amendments on the ground that if they were allowed, the plaintiff’s case
                    would be that there was a concluded settlement agreement, and the plaintiff
                    cannot have a claim for the dividends anymore. The argument found favour with
                    the Court, which disapproved the proposed amendments and dismissed the
                    plaintiff’s appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     However, the Court of Appeal went on to issue
                    an Addendum to its order that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The dismissal of the appeal should not be taken as precluding the
                        appellant from applying for leave to make such further amendments to his
                        statement of claim as he may deem fit, subject always to the right of the
                        respondent to object to the same in accordance with general principles.
                        However, any proposed amendment which is in the precise form and sequence as
                        set out in the draft enclosed in the appellant’s submission to this
                        court on 18 May 2010 should not be allowed as we have already ruled that
                        that draft was not in order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether any “without prejudice” evidence (“the
                        contested evidence”) may be permitted to be adduced in the
                        proceedings would have to be determined in accordance with the general law
                        and in the light of any future amendments to pleading (if any) as may be
                        allowed. For the avoidance of doubt we should state that the dismissal of
                        the appeal does not mean that we have ruled that the contested evidence is
                        inadmissible under any circumstances. We have only determined that the
                        contested evidence is inadmissible on the basis of the existing
                        pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application to amend</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff took heed of the Addendum and
                    applied in Summons No. 3969 of 2010 (“SUM 3969/2010”) to
                    amend the Statement of Claim. The main amendments (I refer to the amendments in
                    the application as the draft amendments) are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    The Plaintiff’s primary case is that those
                            negotiations culminated in a <em>binding oral
                                agreement</em> between himself and the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, <em>which
                                was made on 31 March 2009</em> ... by which it was agreed that
                            the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would pay the Plaintiff the
                            sum of $4,500,000 in full and final settlement of his claim in respect
                            of the dividends. ...</p>

                                asked the Plaintiff why he had turned down his offer of $3.5 million
                                and the Plaintiff said that he was entitled to much more than that.
                                He gave the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant the same
                                explanation as he had given to Roy Ng. Initially the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not react to this,
                                and discussions turned to other matters. However, towards the end of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    It is respectfully submitted that the Assistant

                            The current draft amendment does not offend any rule of law, nor does it
                            seek to re-open the matters ruled upon by the Court of Appeal, and the
                            requirements of the rules of procedure are satisfied. As will be
                            explained in more detail below, <em>the Plaintiff is not
                                seeking to run two mutually inconsistent cases</em>, in
                            circumstances where he either must elect between them or has already
                            done so, as the Defendant has suggested. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    If the Plaintiff’s claim in respect of the
                            dividends was settled, then his cause of action arises in respect of the
                            settlement agreement and the original cause of action was extinguished
                            by the settlement. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    However, the Defendants’ case is that the
                            claim was not settled. If the Court concludes that there was no binding
                            settlement agreement, the original cause of action will survive, and in
                            those circumstances the Plaintiff is still entitled to pursue it. The
                            Plaintiff cannot be required to give up his original claim (if it still
                            survives) as a condition of pursuing his claim under the settlement
                            agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendants’ response was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What the Plaintiff seeks to do by way of these amendments is to plead
                        breach of a settlement agreement as an alternative cause of action. Yet, the
                        law is clear that one cannot plead as alternatives, both the original claim
                        which was purportedly settled as well as breach of a purported settlement
                        agreement. This is because the law requires a party to elect whether he is
                        going to sue on the original claim or sue on a alleged settlement
                            agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The requirement for election the defendants
                    referred to was an election between inconsistent rights. This was explained by
                    Stephen J in <em>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd</em> (1974)
                    131 CLR 634 at 641:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The doctrine of election as between two inconsistent legal rights is well
                        established ... The doctrine only applies if the rights are inconsistent the
                        one with the other and it is this <em>concurrent existence of
                            inconsistent sets of rights</em> which explains the doctrine;
                        because they are inconsistent neither one may be enjoyed without the
                        extinction of the other ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and this exposition of the doctrine was adopted by the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Ang Sin Hock v Khoo Eng Lim</em> [2010] 3 SLR 179 at
                        [30].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the present case the right to the dividends
                    and the right to the settlement sum are <em>not</em>
                    concurrent rights because the right to the dividends existed before the right to
                    the settlement sum, and was extinguished by it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff’s submission that he was
                    not seeking to run two mutually inconsistent cases called for scrutiny. Two
                    claims were pleaded, the first for the dividends, which he claimed in trust on
                    the basis that he was the beneficial owner of the dividends and the first
                    defendant was holding them as his trustee, and the second under contract, on the
                    basis that the plaintiff and the first defendant had agreed to settle his claim
                    for the claim for dividends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     These two claims are mutually exclusive. If
                    there was a settlement agreement, it extinguished the dividends claim. If the
                    defendants did not honour the agreement, the plaintiff can sue on the agreement
                    or repudiate it. If he sues on the agreement, he cannot pursue the dividends
                    claim. If he repudiates the agreement, he cannot claim for the settlement
                    sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendants argued that when the plaintiff
                    asserted that he is entitled to the $4.5m under the settlement agreement, he
                    could not retain his claim to the dividends. The defendants’ argument was
                    that the plaintiff had elected at the time he filed his Statement of Claim. That
                    is not really correct because at that stage, the question of the election did
                    not arise since the plaintiff was only asserting one right, the claim in trust
                    for the dividends, and he was not asserting that there was a settlement
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     By the proposed amendments and the draft
                    amendments, the plaintiff changed his position and complicated matters. When he
                    presented the proposed amendments to the Court of Appeal, he put forward two
                    causes of action – one in contract and one in trust, and when he filed SUM
                    3969/2010, he was also pleading the same causes of action <em>albeit</em> in the reversed order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Professor Tan Cheng Han SC, counsel for the
                    plaintiff, argued that this did not call for election, that the plaintiff is
                    entitled to plead in the alternative, with the claim for the $4.5m as the main
                    claim and to fall back on the dividends claim if it is found at trial that there
                    was no settlement agreement. That explanation did not remove the need to elect
                    if he was allowed to plead in the alternative in the manner set out in the
                    application. When the plaintiff takes the position that he has a claim in
                    contract and another claim in trust, he is putting forward two claims. Despite
                    his apprehension that the claim on the settlement agreement may fail, he was
                    making the claim. Election arises out of the multiplicity of inconsistent
                    claims, not the strength of the claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff had to confront a basic issue,
                    whether he was entitled to plead in the alternative as set out in his
                    application. Holding the plaintiff to his case, he had compromised the dividends
                    claim by the time he commenced this action. There was one surviving claim, the
                    claim under the settlement agreement. He cannot be allowed to maintain the
                    dividends claim when his case was that the claim had been compromised. It is not
                    a question of election because election implies that the elector has two proper
                    claims between which he must choose, and there was only one claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On this ground alone, the plaintiff’s
                    appeal fails. However, there is another issue with the draft amendments. Even if
                    it is assumed that the form of the draft amendments is acceptable, the draft
                    amendments still have to conform to the rules on pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The settlement agreement amendment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The circumstances in which the plaintiff
                    presents the draft amendments on the $4.5m settlement agreement must be
                    remembered. The $4.5m figure had been mentioned in the plaintiff’s
                    pleadings and affidavits from the commencement of the action. Unfortunately, the
                    plaintiff has been of two minds over whether it was an offer or a settlement
                    agreement. In para 30(3) of the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff alleged that
                    on 31 March 2001, the first defendant offered him $4.5m, and he decided to
                    accept it. In para 30(4), the plaintiff alleged that on 15 April 2009, he
                    informed the first defendant that he decided to reject the $4.5m offer, and made
                    a counter-proposal of $6.5m, which the first defendant rejected. It was on that
                    basis that the plaintiff claimed for the dividends. The plaintiff explained in
                    his affidavit filed on 26 May 2009 in support of the claim that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My claim for $8,880,916.67 is for dividends due to me which the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant held on trust for me. He has
                        admitted that dividend payments – which were due to me – were
                        wrongfully retained by him. But he offered to repay me only $3,500,000.00 at
                        first – and later, $4,500,000.00. To settle our dispute, I offered to
                        accept $6,500,000.00 but the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                        refused to accept my offer. Hence, this lawsuit which I was reluctantly
                        compelled to commence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">But in an affidavit he deposed more than a year later on
                    23 August 2010 to support the draft amendments in SUM 3969/2010, he
                    maintained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The facts pleaded are all the same or substantially the same as what has
                        been originally pleaded and as set out by both parties in their
                        affidavits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">without acknowledging or explaining the fundamental difference between
                    a $4.5m offer and a $4.5m settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendants had drawn attention to the
                    contradictions in the plaintiff’s case. The first defendant affirmed an
                    affidavit on 30 August 2010 where he reiterated in [26] thereof that there was no concluded
                    settlement agreement. In support of his contention he exhibited an e-mail from
                    the plaintiff to him and one Terence Ng dated 21 April 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> in which he
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In fact in one morning in the early month of march [sic] it was brought
                        out in the meeting that I only sold my shares to [the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant] for sum of S$5 million in the
                        middle of year 2007 and therefore [the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Defendant] should pay me the dividends. So far <em>the
                            highest sum he offered is $4.5 million which I turned down</em>.
                        Now I am giving him time to think about it and hope he will come back
                        asap.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This e-mail squarely contradicted the assertion in the draft
                    amendments that a settlement agreement was made on 31 March
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff had responded to the first
                    defendant’s affidavit. He filed an affidavit on 31 August 2010 and
                    stated at [13]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I accepted $4.5 million offer on the spot</em>. I
                        am advised that this gave rise to a binding agreement. My unsuccessful
                        attempts to re-negotiate the terms of a settlement, I believed will not
                        affect its enforceability. The compromise with the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was a full and final
                        settlement. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">without saying anything about his e-mail of 21 April 2009. In the
                    circumstances, he is deemed to admit that he had sent the e-mail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The last word on the settlement from the
                    plaintiff was in his written submissions dated 15 October 2010 where it was
                    stated at para 12(h) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having initially accepted the offer to pay $4.5 million the Plaintiff
                        subsequently purported to “turn it down” and sought a larger
                        amount, but the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not agree to
                        pay the larger sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">again without reference to the e-mail of 21 April
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     When all the plaintiff’s narrations were
                    examined, it is clear that he has no consistent position on this issue. In fact,
                    he had taken opposite positions on it at different times with equal conviction.
                    Quite obviously, his recollection of the events cannot be relied on. Beyond his
                    recollection, however, there is one document which recorded his position on the
                    issue – the e-mail of 21 April 2009 which he had not disputed,
                    explained or retracted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the application is an abuse of process of court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Counsel for the plaintiff had explained that
                    the draft amendments were presented after the proposed amendments were rejected
                    by the Court of Appeal. The draft amendments reversed the order of the claims in
                    response to the Court of Appeal’s rejection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The draft amendments may have dealt with that
                    difficulty, but they faced other objections. When the Court of Appeal kept the
                    door open for further amendments, it made clear that any other amendments must
                    be in accordance to general rules or pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff equivocated over the
                    negotiations and the settlement since the commencement of the action in
                    May 2009. The positions he had taken are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     in the Statement of Claim filed,
                        that there were negotiations, and an offer that he accepted, but rejected
                        subsequently;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     in his e-mail of 21 April 2009, that he turned down an offer of
                        $4.5m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     in his
                        affidavit of 31 August 2010, that he accepted the $4.5m offer
                        “on the spot”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">without regard to
                    consistency and credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Serious questions arise out of the
                    plaintiff’s evolving presentation of his case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     if he believed that there was a
                        settlement agreement at $4.5m, why did he take the opposite position when he
                        filed his claim?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     why did he send the e-mail on 21 April 2009 if he had accepted the
                        $4.5m offer? and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     since he did not deny, explain or dispute that e-mail, was there any
                        evidence, by his own case, that there was a settlement agreement at
                        $4.5m?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The draft amendments must be reviewed against

                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be
                        struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the
                        action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground
                        that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case
                            may be;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be
                        entered accordingly, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the rule refers to the striking out of pleadings, the
                    reasoning employed should be extended to prohibit any amendment which comes
                    under (<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>),
                        (<em>c</em>) or (<em>d</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the reasons stated in <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> and <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> <em>supra</em>, the alternative claim for the dividends
                    disclosed no reasonable cause of action and is an abuse of the process of court,
                    and the draft amendments cannot be allowed.</p>
