<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">26<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The Adjacent Lot issue arose because there was a plot of land adjacent to Dragon Court, but smaller in area, which was also for sale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was 675.3 square metres, ie about five times smaller than Dragon Court, and was in a sharper triangular shape than Dragon Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It transpired that Limau had bought this adjacent lot for $1 million on condition that its intended purchase of Dragon Court was successful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> DTZ were also the marketing agents of the adjacent lot.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">27<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Murugaiyan ran his argument on the Adjacent Lot issue in two ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> First, if potential purchasers were informed of the availability of the adjacent lot, this might have attracted more and higher bids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Secondly, if the availability of the adjacent lot was taken into account, the value of Dragon Court would be higher ie the owners of Dragon Court would have got a better price.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">28<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> While it was true that the Grounds of the Decision of the Board did not specifically deal with either of these two arguments, this was because, as regards the first argument, Mr Murugaiyan had not advanced it at all before the Board.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">29<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Secondly, Mr Murugaiyan had not established that DTZ had omitted to inform potential purchasers of the availability of the adjacent lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The availability of the adjacent lot arose after the cross-examination of the first witness for the Majority, who was Swee Shou Fern from DTZ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Murugaiyan could and should have asked for leave to cross-examine her on this revelation so as to establish whether DTZ did or did not provide such information to potential purchasers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead, he sought to cross-examine the second witness Khoo Chin Inn, who was a director of Philando, on this point but Mr Khoo’s evidence as to whether DTZ did provide such information to potential purchasers was uncertain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At that point, Mr Murugaiyan still did not ask for Ms Swee to be re-called to give evidence as to whether DTZ did provide such information.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">30<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Even if DTZ had omitted to do so, it was not clear whether potential purchasers were unaware of this adjacent lot and, if aware, would have become more interested in Dragon Court.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">31<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> It seemed to me that any potential purchaser who was seriously interested in Dragon Court would have done his own investigation about any adjacent lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> More importantly, I was of the view that it was very unlikely that the availability of the adjacent lot would cause a potential purchaser to make a bid for Dragon Court when hitherto he was not intending to bid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The adjacent lot did not add anything significant to Dragon Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The combination of the two plots of land would still fail to qualify any development thereon with condominium status which would then have made the new units developed available to foreigners to purchase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In Mr Murugaiyan’s written submission, he also suggested that as the combined land area of the two plots was “a mere 6.3 m<sup>2</sup> shy of the land area” required to be considered suitable for condominium development, an appeal for condominium status could be made to the relevant authority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, this point was not asserted or developed by any of the witnesses and did not appear to have been taken in submissions before the Board.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">32<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Furthermore, as I have mentioned, the adjacent lot was even more sharply triangular in shape than Dragon Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would be different if the situation was the reverse ie a potential purchaser of the adjacent lot would be more likely to make a bid for it if told that Dragon Court was also for sale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As I have mentioned, Limau did enter into a contract to buy the adjacent lot but only on condition that it was successful in acquiring Dragon Court.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">33<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> As for the argument that the availability of the adjacent lot would have raised the value of Dragon Court, I found from the Notes of Evidence of the hearing before the Board that they had spent considerable time to satisfy themselves that this was not the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indeed, they spent even more time on it than Mr Murugaiyan did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore the fact that this argument was not specifically mentioned in the Board’s Grounds of Decision did not mean that the Board had failed to consider it at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It seemed to me that the Board had satisfied itself that this was not a valid argument and hence did not merit any further attention.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">34<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I would add that there was no evidence that the availability of the adjacent lot would raise the value of Dragon Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the contrary, when Mr Tan, the valuer for the Majority, was asked whether he would change his valuation of Dragon Court if he was valuing it as part of the sale of two plots of land, he said he would not (NE 124).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was not challenged by Mr Murugaiyan on this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Significantly, when Mr Lim, the valuer for Ms Koh, gave oral evidence, he was not asked by Mr Murugaiyan for his opinion on this point.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">35<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In the circumstances, Mr Murugaiyan’s emphasis on the Adjacent Lot issue before me appeared to be more of an afterthought.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">36<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Tan had valued Dragon Court at $12.9 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Lim had valued it at $16,030,000.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">37<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In order to support his valuation, Mr Lim referred to the use of Development Charge rates and in particular the relevant Development Charge rate for the Holland Road area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Development Charge rate applicable to an area represented half the average value of land in that area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">38<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On the other hand, Mr Tan used the residual method of valuation as a cross-check for his valuation.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">39<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Murugaiyan’s complaint was that the Board had made a cursory reference only to the Development Charge rates in para 68 of its Grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Paragraph 68 stated:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">68.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> RW1 also supported his valuation based on the Development Charge Rates produced by the Chief Valuer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As submitted by RW1, the DC Rates were average values of land in a particular sector and were used merely as a guide to his valuation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, the Board is of the view that for specific properties, regard must be had to the individual piece of land in question and its peculiarities, as well as its specific location within each sector.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">40<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I was of the view that the Board was correct in rejecting the Development Charge rates as being of any assistance for the reason stated by the Board.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I would add that Mr Lim himself accepted in cross-examination that there was no valuation method, as such, which relied on the Development Charge rates to value a particular property (NE 215).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">41<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> As for Mr Murugaiyan’s criticism of the residual method of valuation, this point was irrelevant because the Board did not rely on this method of valuation in reaching its conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">42<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> What the Board did was to adopt the sole or main method of valuation used by the two valuers ie the direct comparison method, although it was accepted by both valuers that there was no comparable sale within the vicinity of Dragon Court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What each of the valuers did was to take into account sales in other vicinities and make adjustments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Even then, Mr Lim had omitted to take into account a sale of property at 329 Thomson Road which was the closest in proximity to Dragon Court among the various comparables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When this sale was brought to his attention, he gave his views as to how much adjustments he would make and the reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, the point is that there was sufficient material before the Board, which it is not necessary for me to elaborate here, for them to decide ultimately whose valuation they preferred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I could not say that the Board had erred in preferring Mr Tan’s valuation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Even if I was minded to prefer Mr Lim’s, which I was not, it was not for me to substitute my views for that of the Board unless there was an error of law.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">43<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> There were two other points which Mr Murugaiyan raised in relation to the valuation by Mr Tan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> First, he submitted that this valuation was done after the amount of Limau’s bid was known and it was too much of a coincidence that the valuation amount was exactly the same figure as Limau’s bid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His other submission was that no independent valuation had been obtained prior to the tender exercise.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">44<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On the first point, Mr Tan had said in cross-examination (NE 125) that he was not told what the sale price or reserve price was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not suggested to him that he had lied.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">45<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On the second point, I accepted Mr Low’s argument that there was no requirement under the Act for an independent valuation to be obtained before a tender exercise is carried out or any sale is attempted, although this might be preferable especially if it would not cost much to obtain such a valuation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Under the Fourth Schedule to the Act, clause 1(c) provides that a notice of a proposed application under s 84D(2) must be accompanied by, inter alia, a valuation report which is “not more than 3 months old” (see clause 1(c)(iv)).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Presumably the three months is calculated from the date of the notice.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">46<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> It must also be remembered that the initial reserve price of $12.74 million had been proposed by DTZ, before it was increased to $12.81 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> According to Ms Swee, she did seek the advice of the valuation department in DTZ before suggesting that price (NE 34).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although it could perhaps be argued that DTZ’s valuation was not independent, there was no evidence that DTZ had deliberately suppressed its valuation in order to achieve the collective sale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In any event, Philando was obviously concerned that the reserve price was not too low.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hence, it suggested that the reserve price be increased to $12.81 million which was done.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">55<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In the circumstances, I was of the view that Mr Murugaiyan’s criticism (in para 33 of his written submission) that the Board had failed to even consider the possible leak of the reserve price to Limau was without basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indeed, in oral submissions, he was prepared to say that the Board was aware of such a risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accordingly, I was of the view that the Board had not erred on the Relationship issue, let alone in law.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">56<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Murugaiyan also raised another point ie that the fact that Philando’s representatives had stepped down from the Sales Committee after tenders had closed itself acknowledged the potential conflict of interest and that the Board had entirely failed to give consideration to this (paras 35 and 36 of his written submission).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> I was of the view that the stepping down did not significantly mitigate or enhance the potential conflict of interest which conflict the Board had considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hence it did not add anything significant to his submission.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">59<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Murugaiyan submitted that because the application might have been heard ex parte if there was no objection, there was a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material relationships in the SD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> According to him, anything less than full and frank disclosure would render the Board a rubber stamp (see para 41 of his written submission).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">60<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In oral submissions, Mr Murugaiyan was prepared to adopt a two-pronged approach on the SD issue:</span></p>

<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> the omissions in question were material and demonstrated that the transaction in question was not in good faith.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">61<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On the first point, Mr Murugaiyan argued that, as a matter of general principle, an SD must be rejected and the decision of the Board set aside even if the omission was brought to the attention of the Board before it renders its decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I did not agree with this argument or Mr Murugaiyan’s analogy with ex parte applications.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">62<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Ex parte applications are those in which the opposing party is not even notified of the application in the first place and hence has no opportunity to present its arguments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is different if the opposing party is notified of the application but chooses not to present its case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of course, this is not to say that an SD should be made lightly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It should contain all material facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If it does not but the Board is apprised of the material facts before making its decision, then, generally speaking, the Board should not reject the SD and throw out the entire proceedings with a view to compelling the applicant to file a fresh application with a revised SD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whether a deficient SD would suggest a lack of good faith is another matter which I now come to.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">63<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I was of the view that the omissions in the SD were not material and consequently did not demonstrate any lack of good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With respect, the fact that David Lee was a director of Limau would have had no significance but for his marriage to Michelle Liem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, Limau’s and Philando’s connection with the Liem family had already been disclosed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Likewise in respect of Mr Khoo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His directorship of Philando and Nuri would have had no significance but for his friendship with the Liem family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It seemed to me that Mr Murugaiyan was trying to find fault with the SD.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">64<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In any event, Mr Murugaiyan had already drawn the attention of the Board to Mr Khoo being a director of Philando (and Habitat) as well as Nuri and Mr David Lee being Michelle Liem’s husband in his closing submission (see para 13 thereof).</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">65<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In the circumstances, I was of the view that there was no error by the Board, let alone an error in law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It seemed to me that the real reason why Ms Koh had objected to the application was because she did not want to move out because she had intended to stay at Dragon Court for the rest of her life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While one could sympathise with such a sentiment, it was clear to me from the speeches made in Parliament and the provisions of the Act that Parliament had decided that such a sentiment should not over-ride the wishes of the Majority.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">66<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Accordingly, I dismissed Ms Koh’s appeal with costs.</span></p>
