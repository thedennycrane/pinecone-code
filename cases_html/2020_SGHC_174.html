The Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”) answered this question in the negative in DT/08/2018. Two charges, brought by the Law Society of Singapore (“Law Society”) against Mr Govindan Balan Nair (“the respondent”) premised on r 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) (“LPPR”), formed its context. The Law Society, being of the opposite view, applied under s 97 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) to review the DT’s decision. Rule 22 of the LPPR, which formed the focus of the application, concerns situations of conflict or potential conflict of interests between the interests of a legal practitioner and his client. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The complaint against the respondent had been lodged with the Law Society by the sole director of MSK Building Services Pte Ltd (“MSK”) (“the complainant”). The facts, as found by the DT, upon which the conflict of interest was said to have arisen, are briefly these. The respondent had acted for MSK in a dispute with JKC Consultant (“JKC”), MSK’s sub-contractor on a building project. JKC had served a writ and statement of claim on MSK on or around 2 August 2017 to claim the value of electrical works they had performed. The complainant had initially approached Mr Gurdaib Singh. The two men agreed that Mr Singh would find another lawyer to deal with the matter. Mr Singh then approached the respondent who agreed to do so, and the respondent filed a memorandum of appearance on behalf of MSK on 10 August 2017. By this point, the retainer relationship would have commenced between the respondent and MSK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The respondent met his client for the first time on the day MSK’s defence was due. This was on 24 August 2017. At the meeting, he failed to appraise his client of the deadline although he was himself aware of it.

</div> The respondent also advised the complainant that MSK had a good defence and counterclaim. Terms of engagement and a warrant to act were signed on this occasion. The respondent, who had been provided the necessary documents, was told to file the Defence. On his part, the respondent asked the complainant to check if he had other documents for the counterclaim. On 25 August 2017, the complainant sent an email stating that he could not find the documents for the counterclaim, and gave instructions for the Defence to be filed without the counterclaim. The Defence was not filed, and enquiries from the client went unattended.

</div> He confronted the respondent at his office on the same day, seeking an explanation for these developments. On this occasion, the respondent sought to persuade the complainant to file an affidavit stating that the Defence was filed late due to MSK’s delay in providing details to its lawyers. The complainant refused because he had given instructions timeously and had specifically instructed the respondent to file the Defence earlier. Meeting the complainant again on 21 September 2017, the respondent again did not explain how default judgment had been entered. This was despite the complainant’s repeated request for an explanation of the same.  Instead, pointing to the purported procedural defects in the default judgment, the respondent obtained the complainant’s signed consent on a letter to JKC’s solicitors. The letter communicated that the respondent had instructions to set aside the default judgment (on the basis of those procedural defects) and sought JKC’s indulgence for MSK to file its Defence and Counterclaim in the suit.

</div>
</div> This did not take his case very far. He still had an interest in avoiding any allegation of negligence. Further, the rule that an irregular judgment may be set aside as of right simply means that a court in setting it aside will not go into the actual merits of the defence; the courts would, however, continue to scrutinize the surrounding circumstances in the exercise of its discretion in deciding whether to depart from or adhere to the rule (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 907(“<span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span>”) at [73] and [76]). Finally, there were potential cost implications arising from having to set any default judgment aside, even an irregular one. The client would bear those costs if the lawyer did not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The issue in this case is whether these reasons were sufficient to found an interest “adverse” to the client. Professor Pinsler suggests in his commentary on the LPPR that the word would include any interest that could “actually or potentially compromise his duty to advance the client’s best interest in any way and to whatever extent”: Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Legal Professional (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015</span><span class="font-italic">:A Commentary</span> (Academy Publishing, 2016) at para 22.011. In considering this, I looked, first, to the ordinary meaning of the word “adverse”. In its natural meaning, “adverse” simply reflects any situation that would give rise to any disadvantage to the client. This interpretation is consistent with that offered by the Law Society. <span class="font-italic">Obiter</span> views from two cases support this interpretation. In <span class="font-italic">Law Society</span><span class="font-italic"> of Singapore v Khushvinder Singh Chopra </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 490 (“<span class="font-italic">Khushvinder</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh Chopra</span>”), Yong Pung How CJ, delivering the opinion of the court, ruled that the solicitor’s “questionable conduct in procuring the statutory declaration for the [purpose] of averting […] apprehended disciplinary proceedings” placed him in “a position of aggravated conflict of interest”: <span class="font-italic">Khushvinder</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh Chopra </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[67]. Similar sentiments can be found in <span class="font-italic">Law Society</span><span class="font-italic"> of Singapore v Chung Ting Fai </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 587 (“<span class="font-italic">Chung Ting Fai”</span>), where the High Court found that an attempt to “pre-empt legal proceedings” (though not proven on the facts of that case) would have been similarly objectionable: <span class="font-italic">Chung Ting Fai </span>at [50]. In these cases, legal or disciplinary proceedings had not yet been brought against the legal practitioner, but the remarks made by the courts suggest that an adverse interest could arise even at that stage, when the <span class="font-italic">risk</span> of such proceedings had arisen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Second, looking to the statutory provision in its context, r 22 of the LPPR, as a whole, is targeted at both actual and potential conflicts of interest. This is explained in the r 22(1) principles: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conflict, or potential conflict, between interests of client and interests of legal practitioner or law practice, in general</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(1) The following principles guide the interpretation of this rule and rules 23, 24 and 25. — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Principles</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) A legal practitioner owes duties of loyalty and confidentiality to a client of the legal practitioner, and must act prudently to avoid any compromise of the lawyer-client relationship between the legal practitioner and the client by reason of a conflict, or potential conflict, between the interests of the client and the interests of the legal practitioner.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In furtherance of that broad rationale, the specific duty is articulated in r 22(2) of the LPPR as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(2) Except as otherwise permitted by this rule, a legal practitioner or law practice must not act for a client, if there is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a conflict between —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the duty to serve the best interests of the client; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the interests of the legal practitioner or law practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This reflects that the expectation that the standard expected of the legal practitioner is to act in the best interests of the client at all times. Conflicts arise under r 22(2) once his own interests derogate from the pursuit of the best course for his client. The opening words “[e]xcept as otherwise permitted” make clear that in such a situation, he must not act for the client save as permitted in r 22(3) of the LPPR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The object of r 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), therefore, should not be considered in isolation, but within the specific context of the r 22(2) duty to serve the best interests of the client. It mandates full and frank disclosure to the client wherever a conflict or potential conflict arises between the duty to serve the best interests of the client, and the interests of the legal practitioner. The word “adverse” in r 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) must be read with the text of r 22(2) to include <span class="font-italic">any</span> reason that would detract a legal practitioner’s duty to serve the best interests of his client. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 A conflict arose in the present case because, once there was negligence and a breach of r 5 of the LPPR, the best interests of MSK would have been served by being informed of the circumstances of the legal practitioner’s negligence and breach, as well as its rights in that situation. This was the interest that was adverse to the legal practitioner’s, since giving such information and advice would expose the legal practitioner to potential liability, disciplinary action, or simply a decision by the client not to engage that legal practitioner’s services any longer. In other words, the legal practitioner would have an interest in keeping these matters from MSK and would thereby have an interest that led him away from the <span class="font-italic">client’s best interests</span>. Once this adverse interest arose, the legal practitioner should have first made full and frank disclosure to the client of the adverse interest; secondly, he ought to have advised the client to obtain independent legal advice; and thereafter, and only thereafter, should he obtain the client’s informed consent to continue acting. In absence of this process, the rule mandates that the practitioner should withdraw from acting timeously, in effect removing himself from that same relationship where his responsibility was to act in his client’s best interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I deal with the DT’s reasons for holding to the contrary. First, the DT held that the interests of the solicitor and his client were aligned in that both wanted to set aside the default judgment.

</div> In my view, because the rule is concerned with potential as well as actual adverse interests, there need not be harm caused before it is contravened. Further, in considering harm in this context, courts consider the impact of the legal practitioner’s misconduct upon (a) those directly or indirectly affected by the misconduct; (b) the public; and (c) the reputation of the legal profession: see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer</span> [2019] 4 SLR 1427 (“<span class="font-italic">Ezekiel </span><span class="font-italic">Peter Latimer</span>”) at [55]. The respondent’s failure here to adhere to the standards imposed by the LPPR had effects on his client, the reputation of the legal profession and the confidence of the public at large in the profession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Third, the DT was of the view that it would be too onerous for a solicitor to withdraw in these circumstances: “[i]t would suggest that every time a solicitor makes a minor error that can be corrected, the solicitor should refrain from further acting for the client (or withdraw from acting) until or unless the client has obtained independent legal advice. This is because short of such independent legal advice, the solicitor cannot be truly certain that his client has arrived at a fully formed consent for the solicitor to continue.”

</div> I do not agree. First, minor errors (if they are truly minor) would generally not occasion a conflict of interest. A commonsensical approach must be taken: for example, there is plainly a distinction between a typographical error and a default judgment. Second, it is full and frank disclosure that r 22(3) of the LPPR mandates, and the need for withdrawal only arises on the failure of the legal practitioner to properly disclose the interests adverse to him. The legal practitioner is certainly permitted to put any negligence in context, for example, in this case, he could well have explained that the judgment was irregular and to undertake not to charge his client for any rectification of a state of affairs caused by his omission. After he informs the client, under r 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii), the client may choose to seek independent legal advice. Alternatively, the client may choose not to, provided that the practitioner disabuses the client of any impression that he is protecting the client’s interests. The choice belongs to the client, and r 22(3) of the LPPR returns that choice to its rightful place. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Distinction from r 5 of the LPPR</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I turn to r 5 of the LPPR, which the DT thought more applicable.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The charge concerns r 22 of the LPPR because, in that context, where there was an undisputed breach of r 5 and negligence, it was then incumbent on the respondent as a legal practitioner who was well aware of the interests adverse to his client, to follow the prescription set out in r 22(3) of the LPPR. He did not. Instead, the respondent procured written consent from the complainant to set aside the Writ of Summons and the default judgment. While glossing over that which he needed to disclose, he nonetheless obtained the client’s written consent for the next course of action. Absent full disclosure, the consent was not an informed one. Hence, the DT found that there was no waiver. As Law Society pointed out in its submissions, whereas the object of the signed consent envisaged by r 22(3) was to protect the client’s interest, the signed consent obtained in this case served to diminish the client’s interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Finding and sanction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Coming to the two charges, the primary charge premised on s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA was engaged once there was a breach of the LPPR; the alternative charge was framed on the more general provision of s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>). As I was of the view that the respondent had breached LPPR r 22(3), I found the primary charge made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Turning to the sanction, I considered whether there was due cause of sufficient gravity that warranted a referral of the matter to the Court of Three Judges, and, if not, the appropriate penalty that the Council ought to consider. The Law Society proposed that the matter could be dealt with by way of a substantial fine nearer to $20,000, particularly taking into consideration the respondent’s age of 82 and his ill health.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I took reference from the framework of harm and culpability set out by the Court of Three Judges in <span class="font-italic">Ezekiel Peter Latimer</span> ([22] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) to determine the appropriate sanction for charges premised upon conflicts of interest. It was there said that in cases where a practitioner has preferred his own interests over that of the client, striking off would be the presumptive penalty because such situations often reveal an abuse of trust and reflect a serious defect of character. The specific scenarios elaborated in that judgment, however, involved the solicitor’s use of his position to pursue financial advantage or substantial gift (see <span class="font-italic">Ezekiel Peter Latimer </span>at [67]). In this case, while the respondent acted to the detriment of the client in preferring his own self-protection over his client’s best interests, there was no planned pursuit of financial gain aside from his continued representation of the client and the professional fees appurtenant. Notwithstanding conduct falling short of the expectations of the LPPR, defect of character, dereliction of a legal practitioner’s duty of loyalty and abuse of his position of trust, it was a less culpable scenario. There was also less harm caused here than in the cases envisaged in <span class="font-italic">Ezekiel Peter Latimer</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> In that regard, the DT characterised the damage as capable of correction.

</div> Although I have decided at [22] that this did not mean that there was no adverse interest, this was relevant to the harm caused. The respondent envisaged being able to rectify the issue for his client and did eventually do so, albeit furtively, when solicitors for JKC agreed to withdraw the default judgment.
