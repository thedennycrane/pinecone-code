He was a passenger in a Malaysian registered car being driven by one Chan Chun Nee (“Chan”), who was a private taxi driver.  Shafiq was sitting in the front passenger seat.  There was another passenger in the car, who was Muhammad Aidil Nizam bin Muhamad Noh (“Aidil”), a friend of Shafiq’s.  At about 12.05pm, the car was randomly stopped for a routine check by Staff Sergeant Hamdan Shah bin Abu Baker (“SSgt Hamdan”), an officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”), who was stationed at the Woodlands Checkpoint.

IO Parthiban explained in his testimony that he had miscounted the ecstacy tablets at the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) Woodlands Office because, when he counted the tablets, he had divided the tablets into batches of five, and then counted the batches, but missed out one batch when adding up the numbers (thus arriving at the figure of 100 instead of 105 tablets).

</div>  Therefore, Shafiq’s account in his investigative statements and in his testimony that he had only intended to deliver 100 ecstacy tablets must be seen in this light.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Prosecution’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Prosecution’s case, as stated in its opening statement and closing submissions, is that the elements of the offence of importation under s 7 of the MDA have been made out.  First, Shafiq knowingly possessed the drugs.  Second, he knew the nature of the drugs in his possession, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the drugs in question were methamphetamine.  Third, and this element is not in dispute, the methamphetamine has been brought into Singapore without prior authorisation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 For the first element of the offence, the Prosecution’s primary case is that the presumption of possession in s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA is satisfied in this case, as it is undisputed that Shafiq was in possession of the blue milk powder box and the orange biscuit packet that contain the methamphetamine, and that Shafiq is unable to rebut the presumption.  Alternatively, the Prosecution argues that Shafiq was wilfully blind to the existence of the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box and the orange biscuit packet.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 For the second element of the offence under s 7 of the MDA, the Prosecution’s case is that Shafiq knew the nature of the drugs in his possession, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the drugs were methamphetamine.  The Prosecution relies on the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA to establish such knowledge because they say that it has been proven or presumed that Shafiq knowingly possessed the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box and the packet of methamphetamine in the orange biscuit packet.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Defence’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Shafiq admits to having knowingly possessed and imported the small plastic packet of methamphetamine in the orange biscuit packet.  However, he denies knowing the existence of the four plastic packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  His counsel contends that he has rebutted the presumption under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA that he was in possession of the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box because, for the reasons elaborated below, he has shown that he had no knowledge that those drugs were in the blue milk powder box.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As for the Prosecution’s alternative case that he was wilfully blind to the existence of the drugs in the blue milk powder box, Shafiq’s counsel contends that he had no basis to suspect that the blue milk powder box would contain the four plastic packets of methamphetamine.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable law and issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The elements of a charge under s 7 of the MDA for the offence of drug importation are well established: the legal burden is on the Prosecution to prove that (a) the accused person was in possession of the drugs; (b) the accused person had knowledge of the nature of the drugs; and (c) the drugs were intentionally brought into Singapore without prior authorisation.  The element of possession requires both the act of physical possession and the knowledge that one is in possession of the item or “thing” in question that turns out to be a drug: <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 2 SLR 1375 (“<span class="font-italic">Beh Chew </span><span class="font-italic">Boo</span>”) at [54], reaffirming <span class="font-italic">Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) at [27] and [32].  It is <span class="font-italic">not</span> necessary to show that the accused knew that the thing was in fact a controlled drug in order to establish the element of possession: see <span class="font-italic">Adili </span>at [31].  Knowledge of the “nature of the drug” refers to knowledge of the actual controlled drug referred to in the charge: see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1156 at [24].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It is equally trite that the Prosecution may either prove the elements of possession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs beyond a reasonable doubt or rely on the statutory presumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA respectively to presume these two elements, so that the burden of proof shifts to the accused to rebut the statutory presumption on a balance of probabilities: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 67 (“<span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span>”) at [171]; <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l Avedian v</span><span class="font-italic"> Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) at [57] and [98(b)]; <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort</span>”) at [35]–[37].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Sections 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18</span>.—(1)  Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) anything containing a controlled drug; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The element of knowledge – whether for the element of possession or the element of knowledge of the nature of the drug – can be satisfied by either actual knowledge or wilful blindness.  An accused person is wilfully blind when he did not in fact know the true position but sufficiently suspected it and deliberately refused to investigate, even though he could have done so, in order to avoid confirmation of his own suspicions.  Wilful blindness is thus a mental state that, factually, falls short of actual knowledge, but which is treated as its legal equivalent: see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at [41]–[50]; <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [98(c)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The main contest between the Prosecution and the Defence is whether the element of possession is satisfied in this case.  In particular, the parties dispute whether Shafiq has successfully rebutted the s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) presumption that he knowingly possessed the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box and whether he was wilfully blind as to the existence of the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  If the element of possession is satisfied, the other issue is whether Shafiq has successfully rebutted the s 18(2) presumption that he knew the nature of the drug, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> whether he knew that the “things” in the blue milk powder box were methamphetamine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I should also add that Shafiq accepts that he knowingly imported the ecstacy tablets into Singapore.  But that is the subject of a separate charge of importation under s 7 of the MDA, which has been stood down, pending the trial of the present charge.  Shafiq also accepts that he knowingly imported the 0.97g of methamphetamine in exhibit “A1A1-A1” (the small packet of ice) in the orange biscuit packet into Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Shafiq’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Shafiq elected to give evidence in his own defence.  He explained in his evidence that the blue milk powder box, which contained the four packets of methamphetamine, belonged to one Husir Khan bin Fidah Hussein (“Husir”), whom he referred to as “Baba”, someone with whom he had been acquainted for about six months.  He had met Husir for the first time sometime in mid-2017 at a mutual friend’s flat.

He started with a gaming application called “ACE333”, but then moved on to another one called “SCR888”.  It was Husir who introduced Shafiq to “SCR888” and taught him how to use it.

He would inform the “agent” via WhatsApp that he wanted to deposit money to obtain credits.  Shafiq would then transfer money to a bank account, the details of which had been provided by the “agent” via WhatsApp.  Following this, his SCR888 account would be topped up with credits.

</div>  Shafiq and Aidil decided to accompany them.  As it turned out, the market was closed.  Rohaizat then drove them to a convenience store because he wanted to buy milk for his son.  When they arrived at the store’s location, Rohaizat and Aidil alighted and went inside to get the milk.  Shafiq and Husir remained in the car.  Shafiq then saw Rohaizat and Aidil exiting the store with a red plastic bag.  When they got into the car, Shafiq saw a blue Nestle “Lactogen” milk powder box in the red plastic bag, which looked like the one he had in his possession when he was later arrested.  However, he cannot be sure that it was the very same milk powder box because he was focused on playing jackpot while he was in the car.

Husir said that they should get in touch with each other after Shafiq arrives in Singapore so that Husir can inform Shafiq of where and how Shafiq should pass the ecstacy pills to Husir’s “friend”.  Husir did not mention if Shafiq was supposed to collect any money in exchange for the ecstacy pills.  Shafiq agreed.  Shafiq saw that the ecstacy pills were packed in a small plastic packet, which was placed in another slightly larger plastic packet.  Husir then said that he was giving Shafiq 1g of methamphetamine as his “ration” for bringing his share of the SCR888 winnings to Johor, and for helping him bring the ecstacy pills to Singapore.  This was in another small plastic packet, which Husir placed within the slightly larger plastic packet, which held the small packet of ecstacy pills.

This bag contained the blue milk powder box and the orange biscuit packet.  Shafiq asked Husir where the ecstacy pills and methamphetamine were, and Husir replied, “the things are already inside”.  By this, Shafiq understood that the ecstacy pills and methamphetamine were in the plastic bag.

</div>  In his statements to the CNB and in his oral evidence, Shafiq gave inconsistent versions as to whether he believed that the ecstacy pills and methamphetamine were inside or outside the blue milk powder box and/or the orange biscuit packet.

This luggage bag, the red plastic bag handed to him by Husir, and the rest of his and Aidil’s belongings were placed in the boot of Chan’s car.  While on the way, he asked Chan to stop at a mini-mart.  There, Shafiq bought a packet of instant noodles and a packet of biscuits.

There were three contemporaneous statements, eight long statements and three cautioned statements.  The Prosecution relies on these statements to show that Shafiq has changed his version of events along the way, as more and more incriminating evidence was presented to him.  As such, the Prosecution says that he has shown himself quite capable of lying to the CNB and is not a person who has credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Shafiq does not challenge the voluntariness of all his statements to the CNB, as explicitly stated in the Agreed Statement of Facts.

Husir told Shafiq to bring a luggage (containing Rahilme’s clothes) and the red plastic bag with “baby formula” to Singapore, and that either Rahilme or someone else would collect the red plastic bag.

Shafiq and Rahilme – who Shafiq referred to as “Abang” in the statements – went to Rahilme’s house in Johor Bahru the night prior to the offence to “slack” and play a jackpot game, and for Shafiq to pass $9,200 cash to Rahilme’s father, Husir.  Shafiq and Rahilme went to Rahilme’s house from Shafiq’s flat in Singapore at about 3am (on 14 November 2017) by a “private taxi” – driven by Chan – arranged by Husir.  Aidil also came along with Shafiq and Rahilme.  After arriving at Rahilme’s house and having some food, Rahilme left with Rahilme’s uncle, Rohaizat, to the latter’s house.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Subsequently, at about 7–8am, Shafiq and Aidil accompanied Husir and Rohaizat to a nearby Indian “mama” shop.  There, Husir asked Aidil to help buy ‘Lactogen’ milk, which was for Rohaizat’s son.  Shafiq and Husir stayed in the car while Aidil and Rohaizat went to buy milk.  They came back in about 10 minutes and Aidil was carrying a small red plastic bag with the milk box inside.  After arriving back at Rahilme’s house, Aidil put the milk box in the kitchen cabinet, and they continued to play the jackpot game.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 At about 9am, Aidil and Shafiq wanted to go back home.  While Husir tried calling for a “private taxi” again, “no one picked up”, so Shafiq called the number on the name card which Chan had given him.  Chan then called Shafiq back to make the transport arrangements.  Shafiq then saw Rahilme’s luggage “of dirty clothes” in Rahilme’s home, so Shafiq asked Husir if he could bring Rahilme’s clothes to his house in Singapore to wash.  Husir agreed but also asked Shafiq to bring the red plastic bag containing the blue milk powder box and the orange biscuit packet with him to Singapore.  Shafiq could tell that the red plastic bag was different from the red plastic bag that Aidil had before, but Shafiq “was rushing” and so “never think so much”.  Shafiq could also see the contents of the red plastic bag.  Shafiq opened the boot of the car and put the red plastic bag in the boot.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Eighth long statement on 2 June 2018</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Shafiq’s eighth long statement recorded after his admission regarding the drugs in the orange biscuit packet is critical in that it is largely consistent with his oral evidence in court outlined above.  In gist, Shafiq stated the following in this eighth long statement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Husir was the one who asked him to bring the ecstacy tablets into Singapore to pass to “someone” as a “favour”.  Husir said that he would call Shafiq and tell him who to pass them to when Shafiq reached his house in Singapore.  This was the same as what Husir told Shafiq when Shafiq brought food items for Husir on 11 November 2017.  Shafiq did not admit this in his previous investigative statements as he “was shocked” and “was really scared at that time”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Husir said that he would pack the ecstacy tablets, and Shafiq did not know or see how Husir packed them.  Husir simply passed the red plastic bag to Shafiq and informed Shafiq that “the things are already inside”.  From this, Shafiq knew that the ecstacy tablets and the 1g of ice were inside but he did not know whether “it was in the [blue] milk powder box or the [orange] biscuit packet”.  Shafiq did not open and check the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet since they were already packed by Husir.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Shafiq’s DNA was found in the packet because he “h[e]ld the packets to see what it is”.  At the time, he did not know what it was as he had never taken ecstacy tablets before.  It was Husir who told Shafiq that they were ecstacy tablets before Shafiq passed the packet back to Husir.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Husir also told Shafiq that he would give him a “gift” of 1g of ice as a reward for bringing the ecstacy tablets into Singapore and for helping him to bring his cash from Singapore to Malaysia.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Shafiq helped Husir to bring the ecstacy tablets into Singapore because he helped Shafiq with the jackpot game and taught him how to play and win money with it. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) This was “the only time” Shafiq had helped Husir import drugs into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Shafiq knew that drug importation is a “serious offence”, but he did it for Husir “as a favour as [Husir] helped [Shafiq] before”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I will deal with the inconsistencies in Shafiq’s statements and his explanations for these inconsistencies when I deal with the contested issues of fact below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Has the s 18(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) presumption been rebutted?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Requirements of s 18(1)(a)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As mentioned at [16] above, the legal burden is on the accused person<span class="font-italic"> </span>to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut the s 18(1) presumption on a balance of probabilities.  In this regard, it is well established that an accused person’s bare denial is insufficient to rebut the statutory presumptions in the MDA or cause the evidential burden to shift to the Prosecution: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo </span>at [64].  However, the “inherent difficulties of proving a negative” must also be borne in mind so that the burden of rebutting the relevant presumption “should not be made so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge”: <span class="font-italic">Harven a/l Segar v Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 771 at [2].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It is also well established that, while the legal burden remains on one party throughout, the evidential burden on any specific factual issue can shift to the opposing party once it has been discharged by the proponent. The opposing party must then call evidence or take the consequences, which may or may not be adverse.  The Prosecution’s failure to a call a material witness may mean that it had failed to discharge its evidential burden to rebut an accused person’s defence or may justify the court drawing an adverse inference against it under s 116 illustration (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”): see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 1 SLR 984 (“<span class="font-italic">Nabill</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [67]–[72].  Thus, if I find, on an assessment of Shafiq’s evidence, that his contention that he did not know that the blue milk powder box contained methamphetamine is plausible, then the evidential burden would shift to the Prosecution to rebut Shafiq’s evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It was also stressed by the majority of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 1 SLR 499 at [25], and then reaffirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span> at [172], that whether or not an accused person has rebutted the s 18(1) presumption is “a delicate and fact-sensitive inquiry”.  The “real significance” of the statutory presumption is that “it reverses the burden of proof”.  Thus, although the Prosecution has a statutory presumption operating in its favour, when it comes to assessing the evidence in order to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted, “the starting point should be neutral with no predilection for either conclusion”.  A fact that is consistent with both possibilities “is likely to be probatively neutral unlike a fact that is consistent with only one of the two possibilities”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Prosecution argues that Shafiq’s evidence that he did not know that the drugs were in the blue milk powder box is not believable.  It submits that Shafiq is not a credible witness and his explanations should thus be rejected.  Also, the Prosecution submits that Shafiq’s admitted lies in his statements to the CNB are on material issues and, as such, are corroborative of his guilt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I will consider these issues in relation to the alleged actual knowledge of Shafiq of the drugs in the blue milk powder box in turn.  I shall first consider the Prosecution’s detailed submissions that Shafiq is unable to rebut the ss 18(1) and 18(2) presumptions because he is not a credible and reliable witness.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Shafiq’s credibility as a witness        </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The crux of the Prosecution’s case against Shafiq is that he is an unreliable witness whose inconsistent, belated, and false claims should be dismissed.  The Prosecution submits that Shafiq’s denial of his knowledge of the true contents of the blue milk powder box is unbelievable because Shafiq had given materially inconsistent accounts of what he believed the blue milk powder box contained.  Shafiq had also lied in his investigative statements and had omitted to tell the truth.  The Prosecution submits that these lies and omissions concern material issues and corroborate his guilt.  The Prosecution urges me to find that Shafiq’s account in his oral evidence that he was not aware of the blue milk powder box’s contents is incredible.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Defence argues that Shafiq did not know that the blue milk powder box contained the methamphetamine in question.  For all the times that Shafiq had visited Husir’s condominium unit, he had never seen large quantities of methamphetamine.  It was only in the early hours of the day of his arrest, 14 November 2017, that he discovered that Husir consumed methamphetamine and saw that he kept a small packet of methamphetamine below his coffee table in the living room.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Also, Shafiq’s evidence is that he did not see Husir re-pack the blue milk powder box with methamphetamine that morning after the four men had returned from the mini-mart, as submitted by the Prosecution.  He was sitting on the sofa for most of the time, playing the SCR888 game on his mobile phone and consuming methamphetamine.  The sofa faces away from the dining table and the kitchen.  It was only when he was about to leave that Husir handed him the red plastic bag which contained the blue milk powder box and the orange biscuit packet.  Shafiq simply took the plastic bag without examining its contents carefully (see [57] to [59] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 As the Prosecution relies heavily on Shafiq’s purported lies and omissions in his investigative statements, it is first important to outline the relevant principles on this issue.  Section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”), which applies to cautioned statements, provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Inferences from accused’s silence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">261</span>. —(1) Where in any criminal proceeding evidence is given that the accused on<span class="font-italic"> </span>being charged with an offence, or informed by a police officer or any other person charged with the duty of investigating offences that he may be prosecuted for an offence, failed to mention any fact which he subsequently relies on in his defence, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, the court may in determining —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which the failure is material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Therefore, the effect of s 261 of the CPC is that the accused person’s omission in stating a material fact for his defence in the cautioned statement allows the court to draw an adverse inference, which in turn can be used to corroborate other evidence.  Deliberate untruths or lies may equally invite the drawing of adverse inferences: see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu </span>at [151].  While there is no equivalent statutory provision in the CPC for long statements, it is trite that a court may also, where appropriate, draw an adverse inference against an accused person for failing to state a fact in his long statement even though this fact will exculpate the accused from an offence: see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span> at [152].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It is well-established that the court’s power to draw adverse inferences is a discretionary one based on the specific facts at hand.  In determining whether lies and/or omissions of an accused person might be used to corroborate evidence of guilt, the following requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Regina v Lucas (Ruth) </span>[1981] QB 720 at 724 must be satisfied: (a) the lie told out of court is deliberate; (b) it relates to a material issue; (c) the motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and (d) the statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.  Whether something is a lie is a question of fact to be determined by the court: see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu </span>at [153]–[154].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Critically, it is important to bear in mind that lies can only be used to corroborate or strengthen <span class="font-italic">other </span>pieces of evidence relied on by the Prosecution.  Lies alone cannot be the basis of a conviction.  Lies can only amount to corroboration of evidence of guilt if they are shown to be <span class="font-italic">told out of a motive that can only be linked to his guilt</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu </span>at [156].  An accused person may lie because he is guilty.  On the other hand, an accused person who might in fact be innocent may also lie for some reason not linked to guilt.  For instance, as observed by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance </span>[2006] 2 SLR 24 (“<span class="font-italic">Constance </span><span class="font-italic">Chee</span>”) at [92], lies may be told “in a misguided attempt to support or embellish an explanation, to deflect blame, to minimise embarrassment or to conceal some other behaviour”.  Therefore, Shafiq’s lies in his investigative statements, if any, have to be carefully scrutinised with the foregoing principles in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 At this stage, I should also add that the Prosecution also makes extensive reference to the first two trips that Shafiq made to Husir’s condominium unit in Johor, what Shafiq did in Johor, and what he did on his return to Singapore for each of those two trips.  The Prosecution has expressly stated that they are <span class="font-italic">not</span> relying on Shafiq’s evidence as to the first two trips to argue that Shafiq had a “propensity to import drugs into Singapore and the Court should find, on this basis, that he knowingly imported the Drugs on 14 November 2017”.

</div>  In other words, the Prosecution is not relying on the first two trips to Johor as similar fact evidence to show propensity, which in any event is not permitted: see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Abdul Hadi bin Haron v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2021] 1 SLR 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Abdul Hadi bin Haron</span>”) at [53].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Rather, the Prosecution argues that such evidence is relevant to (a) Shafiq’s state of mind on 14 November 2017 when he brought the blue milk powder box into Singapore, and (b) the nature of Shafiq’s relationship with Husir, what Shafiq was doing in November 2017 and why he had made that fateful third trip to Johor, which eventually led to his arrest and charge.  This is permissible, as similar fact evidence may be utilised in the limited manner envisaged within a strict application<span class="font-italic"> </span>of ss 14 and 15 of the EA.  These provisions permit the admission of similar fact evidence if its probative force outweighs its prejudicial value, taking into account, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the three factors of cogency, strength of inference and relevance: see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Abdul Hadi bin Haron</span> at [53] and [55]; <span class="font-italic">Tan Meng Jee v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 at [48].

</div>  Primarily, the Prosecution refers to the fact that Shafiq had denied knowledge of having any drugs in his first 11 statements until 1 June 2018 when he first admitted to having knowledge of the packet of ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice in a cautioned statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Shafiq’s explanation for lying about knowledge of the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice is that, if he admitted to such knowledge, he was afraid that he would be charged for importing the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box as well.

</div>  The Prosecution argues that such an explanation does not hold water because Shafiq had <span class="font-italic">already</span> been charged with importing the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box on 15 November 2017, the day after he was arrested.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In my view, the Prosecution has not fully understood the general thrust of Shafiq’s explanation.

Eventually, after some probing in re-examination, this was indeed how Shafiq explained why he had not admitted to knowledge of the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice earlier in the investigations.

</div>  The Prosecution criticises this explanation as being raised in re-examination for the first time, but I find that unwarranted.  Shafiq was merely explaining what he intended to convey all along as his reason for initially denying knowledge of any drugs at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Furthermore, Shafiq had already stated during his examination-in-chief that he only made the admission in his cautioned statement of 1 June 2018 because he was “afraid that if I had admitted to the ecstacy that I would also be charged for the Ice”.

</div>
</div>  This must be understood to mean that he was initially afraid of admitting to knowledge of the ecstacy pills (as explained at [92] above), until he had no real choice but to do so.  Thus, it is not accurate that Shafiq only raised this claim belatedly for the first time in re-examination.  As explained at [101] below, during the recording of the last long statement (dated 28 May 2018) before the cautioned statement was recorded on 1 June 2018, Shafiq was informed that his DNA had been found <span class="font-italic">on the inside of exhibit </span><span class="font-italic">“A1A1-A2”</span>, which is the plastic packet that contained the packet with the ecstacy pills.  Thus, by 28 May 2018, Shafiq was confronted with objective evidence indicating his handling of the packet containing the ecstacy pills.  In that same long statement on 28 May 2018, IO Parthiban showed Shafiq the photos of the orange biscuit packet and the items contained within it, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the ten smaller individual biscuit packets (including exhibit “A1A1-A”), and the small packet of ice and the packet of ecstacy pills contained within exhibit “A1A1-A”.

</div>
</div>  In these circumstances, it is not surprising that he then felt it futile to deny his knowledge of the drugs in the orange biscuit packet.  This explains his belated admission of his knowledge of these drugs in the second cautioned statement on 1 June 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Prosecution also attacks the Defence’s submission that Shafiq had “come clean” in his cautioned statement recorded on 1 June 2018, when he was served the charge of importing the ecstacy pills, by voluntarily admitting knowledge of those pills.  The Prosecution points out that Shafiq had in fact been confronted on 1 June 2018 with the evidence that his DNA was found on the inside of exhibit “A1A1-A2”, the plastic packet containing the packet of ecstacy pills.  As such, he must have then realised that it would be difficult to deny knowledge of the ecstacy pills.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I accept the Prosecution’s point that, by this point, Shafiq might have felt it futile to deny knowledge of the ecstacy pills any further.  However, in my view, the fact that Shafiq felt that there was no point denying knowledge of the ecstacy pills any further only on 1 June 2018, has little bearing on the truth or otherwise of his explanation as to why he did not want to admit earlier to knowledge of the ecstacy pills.  To reiterate, Shafiq explained that he was afraid that, if he had admitted to importing the ecstacy pills earlier, the CNB would not believe that he did not <span class="font-italic">also</span> know about the presence of the ice in the blue milk powder box.  Furthermore, I would add that the fact that Shafiq’s DNA appeared on the inside of the plastic packet containing the packet of ecstacy pills has no connection to why he would also admit to knowledge of the small packet of ice.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I thus accept as credible Shafiq’s explanation that he did not want to admit to knowledge of those drugs (the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice) earlier because he feared the CNB would be less likely to believe that he did not also know about the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shafiq’s inconsistencies regarding the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The Prosecution relies on the inconsistences in Shafiq’s statements to the CNB.  In his first 11 statements, Shafiq had initially denied knowledge of any drugs in the blue milk powder box or the orange biscuit packet.  But eventually, in his cautioned statement, recorded on 1 June 2018, in response to a charge for importing the ecstacy pills, Shafiq admitted that he knew that the packet of ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice – exhibits “A1A1-A2A” and “A1A1-A1” respectively – were in the orange biscuit packet and that he was “supposed to pass the Ecstacy tablets to someone who will come to [his] house to pick [them] up” while the 1g of methamphetamine was given to him as a reward for helping Husir to deliver cash to him in Malaysia and for delivering the ecstacy pills.

The Prosecution points out that Shafiq stated in that long statement that he did <span class="font-italic">not</span> know whether those pills and the small packet of ice were in the blue milk powder box <span class="font-italic">or</span> the orange biscuit packet.  The Prosecution argues that this was inconsistent with Shafiq’s admission in the cautioned statement taken the day before (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> on 1 June 2018) that he knew that the ecstacy pills and the 1g of methamphetamine were in the orange biscuit packet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In his oral evidence at trial, as already mentioned, Shafiq said that he did not know whether the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice were inside the blue milk powder box <span class="font-italic">or</span> the orange biscuit packet.

This is evident from the way his admission was phrased in this cautioned statement: “I want to say that I <span class="font-italic">know about</span> the packet of 105 tablets and the 1 gram of Ice that was inside the orange biscuit packet” [emphasis added].  The important phrase to bear in mind is that Shafiq “kn[e]w <span class="font-italic">about</span>” the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice, <span class="font-italic">not </span>that Shafiq knew that the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice <span class="font-italic">had been hidden in the </span><span class="font-italic">orange biscuit packet</span>.

</div>  He then goes on to relate how Husir asked him to bring the ecstacy pills into Singapore to “pass to someone”.  Shafiq then explains in the statement: “[a]fter I pass back the packet of 105 Ecstacy tablets, I don’t know how [Husir] packed it and I also never see”.  He then also explains how Husir had said he would get “1 gram” of methamphetamine because of his help in bringing the ecstacy pills.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the next paragraph of the statement, it is significant that Shafiq states: “When [Husir] pass me the red plastic bag containing the blue colour milk powder box and orange biscuit packet, he said that the things are already inside.  From that, I know that the Ecstacy tablets and 1 gram of ‘Ice’ is inside <span class="font-italic">but I don’t know whether it was in the milk powder box or the biscuit packet</span>” [emphasis added].  And later in the statement, Shafiq stated again: “[Husir] also said that the drugs are inside so I never open and check because I thought it was only the Ecstacy tablets and the 1 g of ‘Ice’”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 This statement, which was taken the day after Shafiq was served the charge for importing the ecstacy pills and his second cautioned statement was recorded, is quite critical because it shows several things.

All Shafiq meant was that he knew “about” the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice.  IO Parthiban must have also understood this.  Otherwise, when he recorded Shafiq’s long statement on 2 June 2018, he would have questioned him as to why he was changing his account from the cautioned statement from just the day before, and Shafiq’s explanation for the change would have been recorded in the long statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Also, this long statement recorded on 2 June 2018 is significant because it records Shafiq’s admission that, while he claimed not to be involved in, or witnessed, any re-packing of the blue milk powder box or orange biscuit packet by Husir, he knew that the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice were packed into <span class="font-italic">either</span> one of these containers, <span class="font-italic">or</span> perhaps even both (see [105] above).  In this regard, I reject Shafiq’s explanation in his oral evidence that he believed that the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice were somewhere in the red plastic bag, either beneath or between the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet.

</div>  That would be an absurd way for Husir to conceal those drugs.

</div>  In my judgment, when one reads all of Shafiq’s statements in their entirety, together with Shafiq’s conduct upon arrest, it is clear that his lies in the earlier statements, before his admissions regarding the drugs in the orange biscuit packet in the cautioned statement (see [72] and [97] above), were initially because he believed that the ecstacy pills might have been hidden in the blue milk powder box, and later because of (a) surprise that there were large amounts of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box, and (b) fear of being implicated for importing this capital-amount of methamphetamine when he had thought that he was only carrying 100 ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When Shafiq was first questioned by SSgt Hamdan at the Woodlands Checkpoint, before Shafiq was arrested, Shafiq lied that he had come from his aunt’s place, that the blue milk powder box belonged to his aunt, and that his aunt had asked him to bring it home for his nephew or niece (see [3] to [5] above).  It was thus clear that Shafiq was putting up a front and lying at this stage.  This, however, does not necessarily show that Shafiq was lying because of an awareness of the capital-amount of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  Rather, Shafiq’s lie at this stage is equally consistent with his claim that he was lying so that the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice that he was carrying would not be discovered.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) After Shafiq was arrested, he was shown the <span class="font-italic">cut open </span>silver foil packet, exhibit “A1B1”, and the crystalline methamphetamine within it, and even asked what it was (see [6] above).  As a consumer of methamphetamine, Shafiq must have recognised the methamphetamine in that silver foil packet, and would have known by the time of arrest that the blue milk powder box contained packets of methamphetamine rather than milk powder, or the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice that he knew he was bringing into Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) By the next day after his arrest, Shafiq was already served with the capital charge of importing methamphetamine (see [71] above).  This would have further confirmed his initial fear that he had been sabotaged by Husir with importing a capital-amount of methamphetamine, as he stated in the cautioned statement for that capital charge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Therefore, as Shafiq testified and as the Defence submits, that was why he initially sought to distance himself from any possible drug activities – including the ecstacy pills, the small packet of ice, and Husir, who is a known drug dealer who had told Shafiq that he could not return to Singapore as he was wanted by CNB<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [27] above) – as he was worried that any association with these would reduce the credibility of his claim that he did not knowingly import the packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The foregoing is not inherently incredible.  Once Shafiq’s evidence is seen in this light, it explains why he was initially reluctant to admit that he was supposed to deliver the ecstacy pills to a person at the direction of Husir, who he knew was wanted by the CNB and was a known drug dealer.  If he had admitted that, he knew that he would not only face a charge of importing ecstacy pills into Singapore but also, critically, he feared that his claims that he did not know about the capital-amount of methamphetamine would also not be believed.  This is not an unbelievable claim.  These lies in his earlier statements do <span class="font-italic">not</span> necessarily show, as the Prosecution contends, that Shafiq knew that the true contents of the blue milk powder box were <span class="font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> four packets of methamphetamine</span>.  Applying the considerations outlined at [86] above, the lies are corroborative of his awareness that he was importing ecstacy pills, and his fear of being implicated for the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box, but not necessarily in relation to any <span class="font-italic">knowledge</span> of the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  This is the exact situation alluded to by V K Rajah J in <span class="font-italic">Constance Chee </span>(referred to at [86] above).  I accept Shafiq’s explanation that this is why he initially lied about his knowledge of the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice, the identity of the person who directed him to deliver the blue milk powder box, and the identity of the person to whom the blue milk powder box was to be delivered.  He wanted to “deflect blame” for the four packets of methamphetamine found inside the box and “to conceal some other behaviour” regarding the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the long statement recorded on 2 June 2018, Shafiq came “clean” in admitting to the importation of the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice.

</div>  He stated that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When [Husir] pass me the red plastic bag containing the blue colour milk powder box and orange biscuit packet, he said that the things are already inside. From that, I know that the Ecstacy tablets and 1 gram of ‘Ice’ is inside but I don’t know whether it was in the milk powder box or the biscuit packet. <span class="font-italic">[</span><span class="font-italic">Husir] said that he will call me and tell me who to pass to when I reach my house in Singapore</span>. This is the same as what he told me when I bring the food items for him on 11/11/2017. [emphasis added]  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In my view, it is clear that what Shafiq is saying in this statement is that he believed that the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice were either in the blue milk powder box <span class="font-italic">or</span> the orange biscuit packet, or both, and he would be told by Husir later to whom these “food items” would be delivered.  In other words, if Husir had packed the ecstacy pills in the blue milk powder box, then he would have called Shafiq later to direct that the box be delivered to the intended recipient in Singapore.  If, on the other hand, Husir had packed the ecstacy pills in the orange biscuit packet, Shafiq would have been asked to deliver the biscuit packet to the intended recipient instead.  The other “food item” that remained with Shafiq would probably contain the small packet of ice that Husir had given to him for his own personal consumption.  I find that this must have been what was in Shafiq’s mind, given what he was told by Husir.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Therefore, the fact that Shafiq had agreed to deliver the “food items” to intended recipients in Singapore can only show that he knew that one of the “food items” contained the ecstacy pills, but it cannot be conflated with showing actual knowledge on the part of Shafiq of the true contents of the blue milk powder box.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 As for Shafiq’s evidence in court that he thought that the blue milk powder box was a “dummy”, this is explicable by the simple fact that he <span class="font-italic">now</span> knew, after the investigations and the statements taken from him, that the orange biscuit packet was the one that contained the ecstacy pills which he was asked to deliver and the small packet of ice he was promised.  From that perspective, one can understand why Shafiq would think that the blue milk powder box was a “dummy”.  It is clear from the circumstances of his testimony that Shafiq did not use the word “dummy” to mean that he thought that the blue milk powder box was a “fake” milk powder box.  Rather, he thought that, while it was a real milk powder box, it was placed there by Husir to make the red plastic bag’s appearance look innocuous so that it would not raise any suspicion if there was a check by the ICA officers.  To him, this was all to facilitate the successful importation of the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice without detection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Similarly, when Shafiq said in court that he thought that the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet were “dummies”, this is because of his evidence that he thought that the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice were stored outside the “food items”, but within the red plastic bag.  As already mentioned, I reject this evidence, and I find that Shafiq knew that the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice were concealed in the “food items”, although he did not know which one contained the ecstacy and which contained his small packet of ice.  A proper understanding of his evidence is that he must have understood that one of the “food items” was a “dummy”, given that he believed that the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice could be stored <span class="font-italic">in either one of them</span>.  This is entirely consistent with the pith of his defence.  In any event, it was not explored by the Prosecution in their cross-examination of Shafiq what exactly he meant by a “dummy”, and whether, by the use of this term, he meant that the “food item” did not contain any drugs at all, or that it might have contained the small packet of ice that he had been given by Husir which was intended for his own consumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Critically, while I accept that Shafiq did try to lie in his testimony in court that he thought that the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice were in the red plastic bag but outside of the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet (see [107] above), with the latter two food items being used as “dummies”,

</div> I find that this was certainly not a lie that could lead to an inference that he knew that the blue milk powder box contained the four packets of methamphetamine.  This is because, as emphasised at [86] above, this lie has no bearing on his knowledge of the contents of the blue milk powder box, and thus cannot support an inference that Shafiq knew that the blue milk powder box contained methamphetamine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Therefore, it is clear to me that the thrust of Shafiq’s defence was that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) he did not know where the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice were in the red plastic bag because it was Husir who packed these drugs; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) thus, Shafiq initially attempted to distance himself from not only the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice but also Husir, a known drug dealer, by asserting that the recipient of the food items was intended to be Rahilme or Rahilme’s aunt;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) but, when finally confronted with the DNA evidence on exhibit “A1A1-A2”, Shafiq could no longer lie and so came clean regarding the drugs in his second cautioned statement and eighth long statement (see [72] and [73] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) because he was unsure whether the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice were in the blue milk powder box or the orange biscuit packet (or both), Shafiq’s guess was that those drugs were in one of them, and the remaining food item, whichever it was, was a “dummy”, simply to bolster the innocuous appearance of the red plastic bag and its contents.  Shafiq’s <span class="font-italic">uncertainty </span>over where the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice were explains, and is in fact consistent with, Shafiq’s loose reference to the blue milk powder box and/or the orange biscuit packet as “dummies”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Who handed Shafiq the blue milk powder box</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The next set of inconsistencies in the evidence relied upon by the Prosecution is Shafiq’s account as to who had handed him the blue milk powder box.  The Prosecution points out, as already mentioned earlier, that Shafiq told SSgt Hamdan at the Woodlands Checkpoint that the box belonged to his aunt in Malaysia.  Then, in his first contemporaneous statement recorded later on the day of his arrest, 14 November 2017, he said that the blue milk powder box had been given to him by Rahilme.  He only admitted in his subsequent statements that the blue milk powder box had been handed to him by Husir.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In my judgment, as alluded to above, the Prosecution has not fully appreciated the significance of the evidence given by Shafiq that he knew that Husir was a person who was living in Johor Bahru because he was wanted by the CNB in Singapore, and that Shafiq had assisted Husir on at least one prior occasion to bring ecstacy pills into Singapore and delivering it to “Alan”.  Not only that, by the time of the investigations, Shafiq must have known that his delivery of “food items” on 12 November 2017, after his first trip to Johor, was likely to have also contained drugs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Further, as already explained, given what he was told by Husir before he left the condominium unit on this third trip, Shafiq certainly believed that the blue milk powder box <span class="font-italic">might</span> have contained the ecstacy pills or the small packet of ice.  Further, by the time of his arrest, Shafiq would have seen that the blue milk powder box did not contain milk powder but had instead contained methamphetamine, contrary to what he thought it contained.  Since he had been given the blue milk powder box by someone who was wanted by the CNB, I find that Shafiq told lies to SSgt Hamdan and initially to IO Parthiban to distance himself from Husir.  In this regard, I noted the Prosecution’s submission that Shafiq obviously did not want to be seen as someone associating with a drug dealer.

</div>  I also accept that Shafiq gave poor explanations for these lies while being cross-examined.  However, I would emphasise that these lies do not necessarily show that Shafiq knew, <span class="font-italic">before his arrest</span>, that the blue milk powder box contained the four packets of methamphetamine rather than the ecstacy pills and/or milk powder.  I accept his evidence that he had been told by Husir that he would be bringing ecstacy pills into Singapore and the small packet of ice for his own consumption, <span class="font-italic">not</span> the four packets of methamphetamine that were eventually found in the blue milk powder box.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Packing of the blue milk powder box</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Prosecution has also submitted that I should reject Shafiq’s evidence that he was not involved in, or had not witnessed, the packing of the blue milk powder box (and the orange biscuit packet) at Husir’s condominium unit.  This is because, it is submitted, Shafiq’s account as to what transpired in the condominium unit on 14 November 2017 is incredible and implausible.  As such, the Prosecution urges me to find that Shafiq knew that the four packets of methamphetamine had been packed in the blue milk powder box.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 First, the Prosecution submits that the blue milk powder box in the red plastic bag handed over by Husir to Shafiq was the same one which had been purchased at the mini-mart by Rohaizat and Aidil on that morning of 14 November 2017.  From my analysis of the evidence, I agree with the Prosecution that it is more likely than not that the blue milk powder box indeed had been purchased that morning.  The main reason for this is that, throughout Shafiq’s statements, he had never mentioned that the blue milk powder box in the red plastic bag might <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been the one that had been purchased that morning.  It was only during his cross-examination that this issue of the box being possibly different was raised by Shafiq.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I accept that the task of removing the milk powder from the two silver foil packets in the blue milk powder box, filling these silver foil packets with the four plastic packets of ice, resealing the silver packets, placing them back into the box, and then sealing the box with glue, would have all taken place from the time the four men (Husir, Shafiq, Rohaizat and Aidil) returned from the mini-mart to the time Shafiq left the condominium unit to return to Singapore.  This was in an approximately two-hour window between 9.00am and 10.55am.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The Prosecution argues that the process above must have taken place in the “plain sight” of Shafiq.

</div>  They point out that Shafiq’s evidence was that he was at the sofa in the living room most of the time, although he did have a conversation with Husir at the dining table about the ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice.  Shafiq said Husir was in the kitchen.  Given that the condominium was a small, one-floor, “open-concept” unit, the Prosecution invites me to find that Shafiq was involved in, or at least witnessed, the packing of the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box by Husir.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I am unable to come to such a finding that Shafiq must have witnessed the packing of the drugs into the blue milk powder box.  First, it is not clear to me that Shafiq was sitting on the sofa in such a manner that he was facing the kitchen.  If his back was to the kitchen most of the time, he might not know exactly what Husir was doing there.  Second, from Shafiq’s long statement recorded on 2 June 2018, it is clear to me that he did not know whether, and if so, where and how exactly Husir had packed the blue milk powder box with the four packets of methamphetamine.  He said he “think[s]” that Husir might have done it in the kitchen.  The Prosecution criticises Shafiq for claiming under cross-examination, for the first time, that Husir might have packed the blue milk powder box in the toilet.  However, the point here is that Shafiq did not know exactly where the drugs were packed, and he was simply <span class="font-italic">speculating</span> as to where that might have happened.  This is entirely consistent with his evidence that he <span class="font-italic">did not know</span> where Husir packed the drugs in the blue milk powder box because he never saw Husir doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Rahilme, who was present at Husir’s condominium unit for a short while before going to Rohaizat’s unit to sleep, did not explicitly see Husir (or anyone else) pack any drugs.  Rahilme did say that he saw Husir and Shafiq together in the bedroom doing “hands movement” with a red plastic bag.  However, I find this evidence to be unhelpful because he left the condominium unit <span class="font-italic">before</span> the trip to the provision shop to purchase the blue milk powder box.

</div>  They argue that Shafiq could not have been playing SCR888 because there were no transfers from Haikal’s bank account to SCR888’s bank account during this period.  This was despite Shafiq’s evidence that he made such transfers when gambling on SCR888 to top up his credits in his SCR888 account.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I find the Prosecution’s submissions in this regard somewhat tenuous.  Whether or not Shafiq needed to transfer money to the SCR888’s bank account to top up his credits while gambling on the SCR888 application must depend on whether he was winning or losing.  Shafiq’s evidence is that he had sufficient credits in his account because he was winning, more often than losing, on that morning.

</div>
</div>  This is not an inherently unbelievable claim.  Even if one assumes that Shafiq had not won every game, he only had to win more than he lost to be able to carry on playing on SCR888 without the need for any top up of the credits.  My point simply is that there is no evidence before me to show that Shafiq’s evidence about his success in playing SCR888 on that morning, such that he did not need to top up his account with credits, is either incredible or implausible.  I shall elaborate on the state of the evidence on SCR888 below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In these circumstances, bearing in mind that (a) Shafiq has consistently stated in his investigative statements and at trial that he was not involved in the packing of the blue milk powder box and he gave a reasonable explanation of why he did not see Husir packing the drugs (because he was engrossed in playing the SCR888 game); (b) Shafiq’s DNA was not found on the blue milk powder box or any of the exhibits found within it; (c) and even the Prosecution’s own witness, Rahilme, did not explicitly see any packing of drugs before he left the condominium unit, I find that the evidential burden shifted to the Prosecution to prove that Shafiq did in fact see Husir pack the blue milk powder box.  The Prosecution could have either called Aidil, or adduced some evidence about how SCR888 worked and whether it was possible for Shafiq to have played it for two hours without any top up of the credits on his account (see [132] above), but they did not do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I should add that there is some inconsistency between the Prosecution’s case and the evidence of the Prosecution’s witness, Rahilme, on this issue.  On one hand, the Prosecution invites me to find that the packing of the blue milk powder box was done <span class="font-italic">by Husir</span> in the <span class="font-italic">kitchen</span> of the condominium unit in the “plain sight” of Shafiq (see [128] above).  On the other hand, the reliance by the Prosecution on Rahilme’s evidence seems to suggest that their case is that the packing was done by <span class="font-italic">both</span> Husir and Shafiq in the <span class="font-italic">bedroom</span> (see [130] above) <span class="font-italic">before</span> the blue milk powder box had even been purchased.  This inconsistency further bolsters my conclusion that it is not possible to find, on a balance of probabilities, that Shafiq’s evidence that he was neither involved in, nor saw the packing of the blue milk powder box, is incredible or implausible.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The need to call Aidil as a witness?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 There is one other issue that I must deal with in relation to the question of whether Shafiq’s denial that he was involved in, or had witnessed, the packing of the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box should be accepted.  As already alluded to earlier, that is the question of whether Aidil needed to be called as a witness, and by whom.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As explained at [76] above, the Prosecution’s failure to call a material witness may mean that it has failed to discharge its evidential burden to rebut an accused person’s defence or may justify the court drawing an adverse inference against it under s 116 illus (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the EA.  In deciding whether it is appropriate to draw such an adverse inference, “all the circumstances of the case will be considered” to see whether the failure to call the material witness “left a gap in its case” or whether such failure constituted “withholding of evidence from the court”.  The following specific principles must also be borne in mind when considering if an adverse inference should be drawn (<span class="font-italic">Nabill</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [73]–[74]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the absence or silence of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in the matter before it.  There must, however, have been some evidence, even if weak, which was adduced by the party seeking to draw the inference, on the issue in question, before the court would be entitled to draw the desired inference.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the reason for the witness’s absence or silence can be explained to the satisfaction of the court, then no adverse inference may be drawn.  An adverse inference ought not to be drawn where the failure to produce evidence is reasonably attributable to reasons other than the merits of the case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In drawing the relevant inference, the court must put its mind to the manner in which the evidence that is not produced is said to be unfavourable to the party who might reasonably have been expected to produce it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Applying the best evidence rule, an adverse inference should not be drawn unless it can be said that the evidence that is withheld is superior to the evidence already adduced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In the closing submissions for the Defence, it is argued that Aidil was present throughout the entire period of time at Husir’s condominium unit when the alleged repacking of the drugs took place.  Hence, if it indeed was the case that such repacking would be in the “plain sight” of Shafiq, then Aidil would surely have witnessed it as well.  Not only that, the Defence points out that Aidil was the one who had purchased the Nestle “Lactogen” milk powder box from the mini-mart and placed it on the kitchen cabinet.  He is thus a witness to the material events that took place that morning of 14 November 2017 at Husir’s condominium unit.  As such, the Defence, relying on <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo</span>, submits that, since the Prosecution has not called Aidil as a witness to rebut Shafiq’s evidence that he did not witness any repacking of the drugs, then it must follow that Shafiq’s evidence in this regard stands unrebutted.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 On the other hand, the Prosecution’s case is that I should reject Shafiq’s evidence that he was not involved in, or had witnessed, the repacking of the drugs on account of the inconsistencies in Shafiq’s evidence, and because his account of what happened in the condominium unit on 14 November 2017 is incredible.  In other words, according to the Prosecution, the testimony from Shafiq himself, when assessed with the objective evidence, is sufficient for the Court to reject his explanations that he had no knowledge of the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  In these circumstances, the Prosecution offered Aidil as a witness to the Defence, and it is for the Defence to call him to support Shafiq’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The present facts are not exactly analogous to <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew </span><span class="font-italic">Boo</span> as, in that case, the drugs imported by the accused were found in the motorcycle which the accused rode into Singapore, but that motorcycle belonged to someone else, one Lew Shyang Huei (“Lew”), and Lew’s DNA was also found on the imported drugs while the accused’s DNA was not: see <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo</span> at [71].  Therefore, Lew was clearly a <span class="font-italic">material </span>witness in <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo</span>.  I am hesitant to find that Aidil was such a material witness in this case.  Regardless, on the application of first principles outlined at [76] and [137] above, I have already found that the evidential burden had shifted to the Prosecution to rebut Shafiq’s claim that he did not pack or witness the packing of the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet (see [134] above).  This is primarily because Shafiq’s evidence in this regard is not incredible or implausible.  Therefore, I find that the evidential burden shifted to the Prosecution to rebut Shafiq’s claim that he did not see or was not involved in the packing of the four packets of methamphetamine in the condominium unit.  The Prosecution could have discharged this evidential burden by calling Aidil, but it did not do so.  The absence of Aidil’s evidence thus strengthens my view that the Prosecution has not rebutted Shafiq’s evidence that he did not know the true contents of the blue milk powder box.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Rahilme’s luggage bag</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The Prosecution also places emphasis on the fact that Shafiq took Rahilme’s luggage bag (with Rahilme’s clothes) with him when he left Husir’s condominium flat and returned to Singapore.  This was despite the fact that, according to Rahilme, he told Shafiq in Singapore (while waiting for Chan to arrive with his taxi) that he did not want to leave his clothes at Shafiq’s Bukit Batok flat.  According to Rahilme’s evidence, this was because he did not have clothes at home, and he wanted to wash his clothes at home before bringing them back to Singapore.

</div>  In his contemporaneous statements, he said that he had been asked by Rahilme to do so, but this was shown to be untrue by Rahilme’s evidence as outlined above.  Then, in his first long statement, Shafiq said that Rahilme had told him that the washing machine in the condominium unit was spoilt, and hence he wanted to bring Rahilme’s clothes back to his flat at Bukit Batok where they could be laundered.  This again was shown to be an untruth by Rahilme’s evidence, who testified that the washing machine at his condominium unit was working then.

Also, Shafiq had already given an excuse to Husir for Rahilme needing to come back to Singapore – that Rahilme had an interview for a job at a restaurant called “Eighteen Chefs”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I am inclined to agree with the Prosecution that Shafiq’s evidence as to the reason for having taken Rahilme’s luggage bag was a mess of inconsistencies.  It is likely that he did take the bag for the purpose as suggested by the Prosecution.  Shafiq knew that he was bringing ecstacy pills into Singapore and also the small packet of ice.  Hence, it is not unbelievable that he wanted to give a false impression that he was on a genuine holiday trip, instead of a short, hours long visit to Johor where he would be couriering ecstacy pills back to Singapore.  Obviously, he did not want to arouse any suspicion because he was carrying with him the packet of ecstacy pills and the small packet of ice.   However, while Shafiq’s conduct in relation to the luggage bag does show an awareness that he was carrying illicit drugs into Singapore, I am of the view that it still does not show that he <span class="font-italic">knew</span> the true contents of the blue milk powder box, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it does not show that Shafiq was aware that the box contained the four packets of methamphetamine.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Moneys Shafiq had handed to Husir</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The Prosecution also argues that Shafiq was not forthcoming as to the amount of moneys he had withdrawn from various bank accounts and handed to Husir.  I accept that the evidence shows that Shafiq had tried to downplay the amounts he withdrew and handed to Husir until he was confronted with the bank statements during cross-examination at trial.  Shafiq’s explanations that he had forgotten about the precise amounts are not credible because of the large disparity between what he stated in his statements and the amounts reflected in the bank statements.  In his statements, Shafiq gave figures ranging from S$3,000 to S$9,200 as amounts he had withdrawn for Husir.  But the bank statements produced at trial show that he had withdrawn a total of S$21,390 from Haikal’s bank account and S$21,200 from Husir’s bank account after the first and second trips to Johor respectively.  I do not accept that Shafiq’s memory was so poor that he could come up with a figure so starkly different from the actual figure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 What is more likely to be the case is that Shafiq lied in his statements about the amounts that he handed to Husir because he knew that the significantly larger amounts that he actually handed over to Husir would be a clear indicator that he was assisting Husir in selling drugs in Singapore, and collecting the sale proceeds and delivering the sums to Husir in Johor.  While I accept that this reflects poorly on Shafiq’s credibility as a witness, my duty is to examine the evidence carefully to determine <span class="font-italic">whether these lies demonstrate an awareness by Shafiq of the true contents of the</span><span class="font-italic"> blue milk powder box</span>.  In my judgment, for the reasons I have elaborated upon above, I do not accept that these lies show such knowledge on his part.  At most, they show that Shafiq was aware that the blue milk powder box might have contained the ecstacy pills and/or the small packet of ice.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 At this stage, I would emphasise again that Shafiq had explicitly denied knowing how much the 100 ecstacy pills could be sold for.  This is because he is not a consumer of ecstacy pills.  The Prosecution submits that Shafiq would know that 100 ecstacy pills should only cost around S$1,500 to S$3,500, and yet Shafiq withdrew around S$22,000 from Husir’s account when he was in Singapore after the second trip.  Thus, it is argued, Shafiq must have been delivering other types of drugs for Husir.  I am not able to accept this submission.  First of all, there is no evidence <span class="font-italic">f</span><span class="font-italic">rom the witnesses</span>, such as evidence from an experienced CNB officer, as to how much the ecstacy pills could be sold for in Singapore.  The submission that 100 ecstacy pills would cost around S$1,500 to S$3,500 was essentially evidence from the bar.  Second, the amounts withdrawn after the second trip might have been from the sale of <span class="font-italic">other</span> drugs by Husir on <span class="font-italic">other</span> occasions and delivered by other couriers.  Third, some portion of the S$22,000 withdrawn by Shafiq might indeed be winnings from SCR888.  In short, there is simply insufficient evidence before me to show that Shafiq knew or should have known from the amounts he withdrew that they must relate <span class="font-italic">only</span> to the 100 ecstacy tablets he delivered for Husir after the second trip, <span class="font-italic">and</span> that the amount received was well in excess of whatever the market price for 100 ecstacy tablets was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In summary, while I accept that Shafiq had deliberately lied in various parts of his investigative statements on various issues, I am unable to agree with the Prosecution that these lies were motivated by a realisation of guilt that he knew the true contents of the blue milk powder box.  I find that Shafiq lied in his statements for the purpose of trying to disassociate himself from Husir, because he knew that Husir was a drug dealer, and he was assisting Husir in what he believed were deliveries of ecstacy pills in Singapore and the collection of the sale proceeds.  His motive for lying was because he believed that, if he had confessed to being a courier of ecstacy pills for Husir, he would not be believed if he claimed that he did not know that the true contents of the blue milk powder box were the four packets of methamphetamine.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The SCR888 application and Shafiq’s “winnings”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 As has been mentioned, I find the evidence in relation to the SCR888 application to be quite unsatisfactory.  This issue has arisen because Shafiq has tried to explain the amounts of cash he had received in Haikal’s bank account – S$21,390 – from 11 to 13 November 2017 as his and Husir’s winnings from gambling on SCR888, and that he had visited Husir in Johor to pass him his share of the winnings.  On the other hand, the Prosecution’s contention is that it is not possible to win “tens of thousands of dollars” on SCR888 on a regular basis, and these “winnings” were instead the proceeds from Husir’s drug dealing, which Shafiq was helping to collect from buyers and pass to Husir in Johor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Shafiq’s evidence is that he had won “tens of thousands of dollars” from SCR888 when gambling on the application, together with Husir, during his first and second trip to Johor.  Shafiq testified in court that he was able to win such large amounts because of “hack[s]” which Husir had taught him.  Also, Shafiq claimed that he also played “live casino” games on SCR888 with Husir, and not just jackpot games.  The “live casino” games allowed him to win larger sums of money as compared to jackpot games.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The Prosecution urges me to reject Shafiq’s evidence that he won “tens of thousands of dollars” on SCR888 because such a claim was never made in his statements to the CNB.  Instead, he stated that the most he had won on SCR888 was S$3,500, which was a few months before his arrest, and that he would usually win S$300 to S$400 every two to three days.  The Prosecution points to the bank statements in evidence, which show that the inbound remittances from the SCR888 bank accounts to Haikal’s bank account in November 2017 show that Shafiq did not even win that much money while playing SCR888, let alone “tens of thousands of dollars”.                   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The Prosecution also relies on the evidence of Rohaizat, who testified that he had gambled on SCR888 for a few years, and he had lost more money than he had won.  Rohaizat also gave evidence that one could not win big sums of money every day from SCR888.  Rohaizat also said that he had not heard of any “hacks”, from Husir or anyone else, which allowed one to win moneys from SCR888 on a guaranteed basis.  The Prosecution thus urges me to reject Shafiq’s claims about winning large sums of money on SCR888 on a regular basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 As for playing “live casino” games on SCR888, the Prosecution points to the fact that Shafiq had only ever mentioned in his statements to the CNB that he played jackpot games.  They submit that Shafiq fabricated this idea of “live casino” games on SCR888, and that he had learnt “hacks” from Husir to win large sums regularly, in an attempt to explain away the amount of money that he received after the first and second trip to Johor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 It is the Prosecution who is raising the moneys in Haikal’s bank account as an issue, and Shafiq has explained that these moneys were a result of his SCR888 winnings.  Given that it is undisputed that there exists such a gambling “app”, and that Shafiq plays SCR888 regularly, his claim that he has won large sums from gambling on SCR888 is not inherently incredible.  The evidential burden has thus shifted to the Prosecution to rebut Shafiq’s claim.  However, I find the state of the evidence in relation to SCR888 to be completely unsatisfactory.  Since there is no dispute between the parties that SCR888 is a genuine “app”, the question of how SCR888 works surely is a question that can be resolved by objective evidence.  For example, the question of whether one can play “live casino” games on SCR888, and whether there are indeed “hacks” to win such games are matters which could have been determined based on objective evidence.  What I mean by this is that the Prosecution and/or CNB could have looked into Shafiq’s claims by examining the SCR888 “app” and adducing evidence of how it works.  Expert evidence could have been called as to whether Shafiq’s claims that he won “tens of thousands of dollars” on SCR888 are indeed plausible.  Instead, reliance is placed on the anecdotal evidence of Rohaizat that <span class="font-italic">he</span> knows of no such “hacks” and that <span class="font-italic">he</span> loses more than he wins on the application.  Such evidence can hardly be sufficient to show that there are no such “hacks”, or that there were no “live casino” games available on the SCR888 “app”.  I cannot accept that the Court should be made to draw inferences from such inadequate evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Having said that, I also find Shafiq’s evidence in relation to SCR888 to be wanting in several respects.  First, if it is indeed true that Shafiq did win “tens of thousands of dollars” from SCR888, there is no credible reason he would not have mentioned this in his statements to the CNB when he was asked about how much he would win from SCR888.  Shafiq’s explanation that IO Parthiban, who recorded his statements, might have misunderstood him must be rejected because IO Parthiban was not cross-examined on this point, and it is also contrary to the Agreed Statement of Facts which states that the statements were recorded accurately.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Second, the objective evidence in the form of the bank statements of Haikal’s bank accounts, which Shafiq testified was used to top up and withdraw moneys for his SCR888 gambling, do not show large sums being credited from the SCR888 bank accounts.  Instead, Haikal’s bank account was credited with large sums of money from other transferors, including cash being deposited at ATMs.  Also, Shafiq’s explanation that he received his SCR888’s winnings in his ex-girlfriend’s bank account is unsupported by any objective evidence.

</div>  As pointed out by the Prosecution, the relevant bank statements were only disclosed to the Defence after Shafiq’s investigative statements had been recorded.  Thus, these were not available during the recording of Shafiq’s investigation statements.  These bank statements showed that Shafiq had received thousands of dollars, in bank accounts he had access to, from 11 to 13 November 2017, starting from after his first trip to Johor.  I accept the Prosecution’s submission that Shafiq knew that he had to explain why he had withdrawn such large sums of money during this period from Husir’s bank account, and hence he probably came up with the story about joint winnings with Husir from the playing of “live casino” games on SCR888.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In my assessment, I find that Shafiq must have known that at least a portion of the moneys that he had withdrawn from Husir’s bank account and Haikal’s bank account from 12 to 14 November 2017 were proceeds from Husir’s sale of drugs to persons in Singapore.  This must have been clear to Shafiq from certain facts.  First, Husir was wanted by the CNB and could not return to Singapore.  Second, Husir had asked him to pass some “food items” to Husir’s friend during the first trip to Johor.  After Shafiq returned to Singapore, and after he delivered the “food items” (which was a “Coco Crunch” box, two to three milk tins, a tin of sardines and a packet of “Maggi” instant noodles) to “Roymeo”, S$14,200 was banked into Haikal’s bank account.

</div>
</div>  Third, during the second trip to Johor, Husir had asked Shafiq to bring 100 ecstacy tablets to Singapore.  Shafiq had agreed to do this and, after his return, on the evening of 13 November 2017, he handed the drugs to one “Alan”.  Shafiq then withdrew the sum of S$21,200 from Husir’s bank account in the evening of 13 November and the early hours of 14 November 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In order to distance himself from Husir’s drug dealing, and his own involvement, which was to deliver the drugs, withdraw the sales proceeds and hand the sums to Husir, I find that Shafiq did not tell the truth about SCR888 and the so-called winnings from gambling on that application.  However, the Prosecution faces the same difficulty as before.  While this evidence does indicate that Shafiq was aware that he was helping Husir sell drugs in Singapore, the most the evidence can point to is that he knew that Husir was selling ecstacy pills to customers in Singapore, since the previous sale to “Alan” was only for 100 ecstacy pills, and there is no evidence to suggest what the “food items” for “Roymeo” were.  There was no evidence before me that would suggest that Shafiq knew that the drugs he had delivered after the first and second trips to Johor were methamphetamine.  In fact, his candid admission about the importation of the ecstacy pills when he returned to Singapore after the second trip and the delivery of such pills to “Alan”, only goes to suggest that Shafiq believed that Husir was only dealing with ecstacy pills.  Shafiq’s own evidence is that he does not consume ecstacy and he is not familiar with that drug at all.  His evidence in this regard was not challenged in cross-examination.  Shafiq also gave unchallenged evidence under cross-examination that he does not know the market value for ecstacy because he has never taken ecstacy before.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Therefore, I find that Shafiq’s inconsistent explanations regarding the moneys in Haikal’s bank account is a neutral factor in this case.  The highest inference that the evidence can support is that Shafiq knew that the moneys which he received in Haikal’s bank account may be associated with Husir’s dealings with <span class="font-italic">ecstacy</span><span class="font-italic"> pills</span>, but not methamphetamine, much less an amount of methamphetamine that attracts the death penalty (“capital amount”).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Peripheral arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The Prosecution has also put forward several other arguments as to why I should find Shafiq’s account of the events to be unbelievable, but I am unable to agree that I should be driven to that conclusion.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alleged time needed to pack methamphetamine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The Prosecution points out that Shafiq called at 9.13am for the private taxi to arrive at the condominium at 10.30am, and argues that this suggests he knew that time was needed for the methamphetamine to be packed into the blue milk powder box.

</div>
</div>  I find this argument to be quite a stretch.  There are many other possible explanations for Shafiq’s arrangement, including the fact that Shafiq enjoyed spending time playing SCR888 at Husir’s condominium unit.  That was a hobby that they had in common.  Also, it must not be forgotten that Husir had offered methamphetamine for him and Aidil to consume.  Given that they both consumed methamphetamine, I would think that Husir’s offer must have been reason for them to stay a bit longer in Johor rather than to return home straight away.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shafiq’s behaviour at Woodlands Checkpoint</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The Prosecution also relies on Shafiq’s behaviour while at the inspection pit at the Woodlands Checkpoint as indicative of the fact that he knew of the four packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  In particular, the Prosecution points to the evidence that Shafiq did not appear nervous when SSgt Hamdan was checking the red plastic bag’s contents until he was shown the contents of one of the silver packets in the blue milk powder box.  The Prosecution describes Shafiq’s apparent calm as counterintuitive.  Second, the Prosecution points to the evidence of Shafiq asking why he was being arrested when he had already been shown the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  They argue that Shafiq was merely trying to give the impression that “he was innocent and knew nothing about the drugs” in the blue milk powder box.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I do not quite follow the arguments of the Prosecution in this respect.  I accept that Shafiq was putting up a front of being calm when the contents of the red plastic bag were first being searched.  This is consistent with his defence that he knew that there were ecstacy pills and a small packet of ice in either the blue milk powder box and/or the orange biscuit packet.  He must have been putting up a brave front of being unperturbed and calm while SSgt Hamdan was conducting his search.  However, his surprise when shown the contents of one of the silver packets in the blue milk powder box, and his questions as to why he was being arrested, are equally consistent with his defence that <span class="font-italic">he did not </span><span class="font-italic">know that the blue milk powder box contained large amounts of methamphetamine</span>.  If anything, I think it is more likely than not that Shafiq was genuinely surprised when he discovered the large amounts of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box.  He was expecting to see milk powder, or perhaps the ecstacy pills and/or the small packet of ice instead.  Therefore, I find that Shafiq’s surprise at seeing the large amounts of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box is in fact consistent with his defence.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unique features in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 To sum up, the mere fact that Shafiq’s admission regarding his knowledge of the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice came later and only in his second cautioned statement and eighth long statement rather than in his earlier statements does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> show that Shafiq had completely lied about his knowledge of the contents of the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet.  When Shafiq’s evidence is seen in their full and proper context, it is clear that his defence is not unbelievable, and that his account of some of the inconsistencies in his evidence is also credible, as highlighted at [96] and [121], [124], [148], and [159] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Bearing in mind the principles outlined at [75] above, I accept the submissions by the Defence that there are unique features in this case which lead me to the conclusion that Shafiq has rebutted the s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) presumption on a balance of probabilities.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Shafiq consistently denied knowing that the blue milk powder box contained methamphetamine in all of his investigative statements.  Shafiq’s undisputed contemporaneous conduct during his arrest – that of surprise at the sight of the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box – is also consistent with his denial of knowledge that the blue milk powder box contained methamphetamine.  While Shafiq did delay his admission regarding his knowledge of the ecstacy pills and small packet of ice in the orange biscuit packet, Shafiq gave an explanation for this that is not inherently incredible, as I have outlined above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Shafiq was not aware that Husir was selling methamphetamine, and, according to him, there were no large quantities of methamphetamine in Husir’s condominium unit.

</div>  This fact would have made it less likely for Shafiq to suspect that the condominium unit contained large amounts of methamphetamine.

</div>  Also, it is not the Prosecution’s case that Husir paid Shafiq for his previous delivery of drugs to “Alan”.  This is a factor weighing against a finding that Shafiq knew or even suspected that Husir had just handed him a capital-amount of methamphetamine to deliver in Singapore.  Shafiq was delivering the blue milk powder box essentially for barely any reward.  The fact that Husir did not once attempt to entice Shafiq with a large reward would not have given Shafiq any basis to infer or suspect that he would be dealing with such a large quantity of methamphetamine, instead of just the 100 ecstacy pills, as he believed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Shafiq was not involved in, and did not see, the packing of the blue milk powder box. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Shafiq’s DNA was also not found on the blue milk powder box, even though the blue milk powder box’s exterior and interior surfaces were swabbed by the HSA for DNA.

</div> While the absence of DNA is itself a neutral factor (see <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo</span> at [65]), the fact that Shafiq’s DNA was not found on both the exterior and interior of the blue milk powder box is at least consistent with his claim that he was not involved in the packing of the blue milk powder box and its contents.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) While Shafiq had withdrawn about S$22,000 after his first and second trips to Johor, which the Prosecution submits is too large a sum for it to be winnings from SCR888 and/or sales from ecstacy dealings, the critical point is that there is no objective evidence to show whether it is truly “impossible” to make large winnings from SCR888.  As already noted, Shafiq’s evidence that he did not know the market value of ecstacy tablets, as he is not himself an ecstacy consumer, was not disputed by the Prosecution.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Finally, Shafiq met Husir through a mutual friend (see [21] above).  While Shafiq and Husir would not be considered close friends, they are evidently sufficiently well acquainted that Shafiq would allow Husir’s son, Rahilme, to sleep in Shafiq’s flat in Bukit Batok when Rahilme was in Singapore.  This is not a situation whereby Shafiq would have had grounds to believe that Husir might sabotage Shafiq.  Husir had explicitly told Shafiq that he would only be delivering ecstacy pills into Singapore, and Husir even showed Shafiq the 100 pills of ecstacy.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 On this basis, I find that Shafiq has rebutted the s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) presumption on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 It is worth highlighting the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Farid bin Mohd Yusop </span>[2015] 3 SLR 16 (<span class="font-italic">“Farid”</span>), which I find to be instructive.  In that case, the respondent was arrested with two plastic bags containing not less than 386.7g of methamphetamine, which is above the weight of methamphetamine that attracts capital punishment (250g).  The respondent’s defence was that he had entered into an agreement with his supplier, Bapak, not to deliver more than 250g of methamphetamine.  Prior to his arrest, the respondent had allegedly made three other deliveries for Bapak, all of which involved quantities of less than 250g of methamphetamine per delivery.  The High Court acquitted the respondent of the capital charge and convicted him of an amended, non-capital charge of possessing 249.99g of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking (the “reduced charge”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The Court of Appeal dismissed the Prosecution’s appeal and upheld the High Court’s decision to amend the capital charge to the reduced charge.  The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s finding that the respondent had entered into an agreement with Bapak that the weight of methamphetamine for each delivery would not exceed 250g.  This was so <span class="font-italic">even though</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the respondent did not have any objective evidence to prove the agreement (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, text messages), and <span class="font-italic">even thou</span><span class="font-italic">gh </span>the respondent did not explicitly mention this alleged agreement in his investigative statements.  First, the Court of Appeal found it significant that, while the respondent’s investigative statements were silent on the alleged agreement, the statement recorder conceded that the respondent had given him the “impression” that he would only be delivering less than 250g of methamphetamine.  Second, the respondent had, in a number of his investigative statements, mentioned that the weight of the methamphetamine in his possession was 250g.  Third, the respondent was being paid a flat rate of $500 per delivery, and it would have been “odd” for the respondent to agree to be paid a flat rate of $500 for every single delivery of methamphetamine, regardless of the weight.  Again, this claim was not supported by objective evidence (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, text messages): see <span class="font-italic">Farid</span> at [25]–[29].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 While I accept that the facts of <span class="font-italic">Farid</span> are not on all fours with the present facts, <span class="font-italic">Farid</span> is useful to show that the credibility of an accused person’s claim of his knowledge of what he was carrying can be assessed by reference to the accused person’s past practice (of prior drug runs).  In <span class="font-italic">Farid</span>, the fact that the respondent always trafficked in less than 250g of methamphetamine lent support to his claim that he had an agreement with his supplier not to traffic in more than 250g of methamphetamine, and that, thus, he did not know that he would be delivering more than 250g of methamphetamine.  It was also not fatal to the respondent’s claim that he did not have objective evidence to back up his claim to have had such an agreement.  In the present case, Shafiq’s evidence is that his prior drug run for Husir only involved ecstacy pills, and he himself never saw Husir deal with large amounts of methamphetamine.  Shafiq also consistently denied in his investigative statements that he knew that there would be four large packets of methamphetamine in the red plastic bag.  This lends support to his claim that he did not know that Husir would have secretly given him a <span class="font-italic">capital </span>amount of methamphetamine to import into Singapore in the present occasion.  In these circumstances, the evidential burden clearly had shifted to the Prosecution, which, as I have explained, was not adequately rebutted by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 As such, I find that Shafiq has rebutted the s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) presumption on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was Shafiq wilfully blind as to the existence of the drugs?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The Prosecution’s alternative case on wilful blindness was in relation to the element of possession, and Shafiq’s defence was thus targeted at this submission.  The Prosecution did not run an alternative case of wilful blindness in relation to the element of knowledge of the nature of the drug.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Following the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in <span class="font-italic">Adili </span>at [51], it is now well established that there are three requirements to wilful blindness which the Prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  These three requirements are that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the accused person must have had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion of the fact to which he is said to have been wilfully blind, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Shafiq must have had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion of the fact that he was possessing not less than 334.67g of methamphetamine;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there must have been reasonable means of inquiry available to the accused person, which, if taken, would have led him to discovery of the truth, at least in the context of the fact of possession; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the accused person deliberately refused to pursue the reasonable means of inquiry available to him because he wanted to avoid such negative legal consequences as might arise in connection with his knowing that fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Given the facts at [166(b)] to [166(g)] above, I accept the submission by the Defence that Shafiq did not have a clear and targeted suspicion that the blue milk powder box contained the four packets of methamphetamine, rather than milk powder, the ecstacy pills or the small packet of ice.  It bears reiterating that the mere fact that Husir is a known drug dealer does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>ground a suspicion that Shafiq had been handed a <span class="font-italic">capital </span>amount of methamphetamine.  This is because Shafiq was barely paid anything for the transaction and Husir, an acquaintance that he was familiar with, had explicitly told<span class="font-italic"> </span>Shafiq that he was only importing ecstacy pills and 1g of methamphetamine.  This also means that, as I have found, he would only have had a suspicion that the blue milk powder box might contain the ecstacy pills and 1g of methamphetamine, <span class="font-italic">but </span><span class="font-italic">not a capital amount of methamphetamine</span>.  This also means that, even if Shafiq saw the glue stains on the top of the blue milk powder box, that would just be consistent with his suspicion that the box might contain the ecstacy pills and 1g of methamphetamine, <span class="font-italic">but not a capital amount of methamphetamine</span>.  There was thus no reason for Shafiq to personally handle the blue milk powder box, or examine it closely, like the way which SSgt Hamdan did.  Given my conclusion above, I find that the Prosecution has not shown that Shafiq was wilfully blind to the existence of the 333.7g of methamphetamine that was found in the four silver packets in the blue milk powder box.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Has the s 18(2) presumption been rebutted?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Following the foregoing analysis, I find that it has not been proven or presumed that Shafiq possessed the total quantity of 334.67g of methamphetamine that is the subject of the Capital Charge.  Thus, s 18(2) of the MDA is not triggered to presume that Shafiq knew the nature of the drug.  Shafiq thus cannot be convicted of the Capital Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 For the above reasons, I find that the Capital Charge has not been made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">An unaccounted break in the chain of custody?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 For completeness, I will deal with two remaining issues which were raised by the Defence.  The first is whether there was a break in the chain of custody of the drugs.  In this regard, it is well established law that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the drug exhibits analysed by the HSA and adduced as evidence at trial are the very drugs that were seized from the accused.  This requires the Prosecution to account for the movement of the exhibits from the point of seizure to the point of analysis: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Affandi bin Rosli v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 440 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohamed Affandi</span>”) at [39].  On the evidence before me, the Defence argues that the Prosecution has failed to prove an unbroken chain of custody of the methamphetamine which is the subject of the Capital Charge.  This is because it is alleged that there was a separate weighing of the drugs that had not been accounted for by the evidence adduced by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The Prosecution’s evidence is that there were two separate times when the drug exhibits were weighed, and no others.  The first occurred at the inspection pit at the Woodlands Checkpoint by SSSgt Ritar d/o Diayalah (“SSSgt Ritar”) at 12.35 pm on 14 November 2017, after Shafiq had been arrested.  She weighed the two silver packets in the blue milk powder box, and recorded the approximate weight as 530g (“first weighing”).  The second occasion when the drugs were weighed was at about 8.50pm that same day, when the drug exhibits were weighed by IO Parthiban (“second weighing”).  This was after SSSgt Ritar had handed custody of the drug exhibits to IO Parthiban for the photography session.  In his evidence, IO Parthiban stated that the weights of the drug exhibits were as follows:

My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 It first bears outlining what is <span class="font-italic">not</span> at issue.  The Defence does not dispute each link of the chain of custody established by the Prosecution outlined at [185] above.  In other words, the movement of the drug exhibits from the point of seizure to the point of HSA analysis has been fully accounted for, and the issue is not that there was a period of time when the drug exhibits were stored at an unknown place or by unknown persons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Furthermore, the issue here is also not that there is an unexplained difference between the gross weights of drug exhibits measured by the CNB (“CNB weights”) – 512.5g (515g minus 2.5g from exhibit A1B2B) – and those measured by the HSA (“HSA weights”) – which is 497.57g.  The latter issue would raise the question of whether the integrity or identity of the drug exhibits in question have been compromised: <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Seng v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 32 at [26].  In circumstances where the exhibits have been accounted for at every point in time, the existence of weight discrepancies cannot raise any doubt as to their identity.  Weight discrepancies are also of lesser concern where there is a uniform discrepancy between the CNB and HSA weights.  In such cases, the differences are usually attributed to a weighing scale error or the manner in which the drug exhibits were weighed.  These explanations were accepted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Parthiban Kanapathy </span>[2019] SGHC 226 at [134], where the High Court noted that the HSA weights were consistently about 1% heavier than the CNB weights.  In this case, the CNB weights of the four silver packets in the blue milk powder box are consistently about 3–4g heavier than the HSA weights, and the movement of the drug exhibits from the point of seizure to the point of HSA analysis has also been fully accounted for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The Defence’s main contention is that there was a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> weighing of the drugs that was seemingly unaccounted for, since the weight of 540g stated in the station diary is different from the weights from the first weighing (530g) and second weighing (515g) by SSSgt Ritar and IO Parthiban respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 In this case, Sgt(2) Danial’s evidence is that he received the information as to the weights he recorded in the station diary from SSSgt Ritar.  His evidence in this regard was not challenged.  That being the case, if the Defence’s contention is accepted, that would mean that SSSgt Ritar must have relinquished custody of the drug exhibits to someone else, who then weighed the drugs.  However, the Defence did <span class="font-italic">not</span> put or suggest to SSSgt Ritar that she handed the drug exhibits to anyone, while they were in her custody. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Critically, it is clear from his evidence that Sgt(2) Danial had recorded down the weight in the station diary from <span class="font-italic">the second weighing</span>.  Sgt(2) Danial himself testified that the weight in the station diary came from the weighing done by the “CNB forensic team” by IO Parthiban using the CNB digital weighing scale (see [180] above). This is clearly the truth because, as Sgt(2) Danial himself also testified (see [180] above), the figures in the station diary record a figure for the weight of the “<span class="font-italic">04 [small</span><span class="font-italic">er] packets</span> of ice” (as 540g), and not the weight of the <span class="font-italic">two </span>silver foil packets.  The four smaller packets (found within the two silver foil packets), together with the ecstacy pills, were <span class="font-italic">not</span> discovered until <span class="font-italic">after </span>SSSgt Ritar had completed the first weighing and IO Parthiban had taken over custody of all the exhibits from SSSgt Ritar (before 7.25pm on 14 November 2017 for the processing and photography of the drug exhibits).  In other words, before the photography of the drug exhibits, no CNB officer, including SSSgt Ritar, knew that there were drugs in the orange biscuit packet.

</div>  It was during this processing of the drug exhibits that IO Parthiban had opened up the orange biscuit packet, and the small biscuit packets inside, and counted (wrongly) the ecstacy pills (see [9] above).  It was also after IO Parthiban took over the drug exhibits for the photography session that the “<span class="font-italic">04 [small</span><span class="font-italic">er] packets</span> of ice” inside the two silver foil packets were extracted.  Hence, I find that the figures recorded by Sgt(2) Danial in the station diary must have arisen after IO Parthiban took over the drug exhibits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The next question is then whether IO Parthiban had carried out a separate weighing of the drug exhibits, or whether he had relinquished control of the drug exhibits to someone else who carried out a separate weighing.  However, the Defence did <span class="font-italic">not</span> put or suggest to IO Parthiban that he had given up custody of the drug exhibits to anyone, or that he himself had carried out a separate weighing of the drug exhibits.  IO Parthiban himself does not state this.  His evidence was that, after the weighing concluded, he and SSSgt Swee Leng took the drug exhibits to CNB Headquarters, where he then kept them locked in his cupboard (to which only he had access) before he submitted them to HSA for analysis on 16 November 2017.

SSSgt Ritar herself said she did not tell Sgt(2) Danial the weight of the drugs from the second weighing (see [182] above), so this itself already indicates that Sgt(2) Danial’s memory on this is hazy.  The fact that Sgt(2) Danial recorded the <span class="font-italic">total weight</span> of the four packets of methamphetamine even though IO Parthiban orally communicated the <span class="font-italic">individual weights </span>of each of the four packets of ice methamphetamine leads to the inference that Sgt(2) Danial might have made a mistake when he wrote down the weights, or in adding up the individual weights of the four packets of methamphetamine to arrive at an erroneous total weight of 540g, which he then recorded in the station diary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Given the above, the only reasonable and logical conclusion is that, after the second weighing, Sgt(2) Danial had been told the wrong individual weights by either SSSgt Ritar or IO Parthiban, or that he heard the numbers wrongly, or that there were errors in his addition of the individual weights told to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 Ultimately, as aforementioned, the Prosecution has adduced, in painstaking detail, the evidence of all the witnesses who were involved in the chain of custody of the drugs, and the totality of this evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt an unbroken chain of custody which accounts for the movement of the drug exhibits at every point from seizure to analysis.

</div>  A comparison of the gross weights measured by HSA (see [8] above) and the CNB weights (see [178] above) also shows that the CNB weights were uniformly slightly more than the HSA weights in this case (with the exception of exhibit “A1A1-A1” (which has a difference of 0.55g), the CNB weights of the four packets of methamphetamine are between 3 and 4 grams more than their HSA weights).  Applying the considerations at [177] and [189] to this case, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an unbroken chain of custody of the drug exhibits in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the Prosecution breach their </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Kadar</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> obligation?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 For completeness, I turn to the final contention raised by the Defence.  In <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>”) at [113], the Court of Appeal held that the Prosecution has a duty to disclose to the Defence (a) any unused material that is likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused, and (b) any unused material that is likely to be inadmissible, but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused.  Critically, on both the foregoing limbs, the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>obligation “will not include material which is neutral or adverse to the accused – it only includes material that tends to undermine the Prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence’s case”.  The Prosecution’s obligation of disclosure is a continuing one and only ends when the case has been completely disposed of, including any appeal.  Since then, this has been referred to almost universally by prosecutors, defence counsel and judges as the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 In this case, the Defence argues that the Prosecution was late in disclosing reports by the Technology Crime Forensic Branch (“TCFB”), Technology Crime Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (“TCFB reports”) (exhibits marked as P119, P120 and P121) without any reasonable excuse.  The three TCFB Reports are dated 26 March, 4 June and 22 July 2020.  They are in respect of (a) records extracted from Shafiq’s, Rahilme’s and Aidil’s handphones (the “Phone Records”) and (b) bank documents relating to Shafiq’s, Haikal’s and Husir’s bank accounts (the “Bank Documents”).  The Prosecution extended copies of the three TCFB Reports to the Defence on 23 July 2020.  The Defence argues that P119 and P120, which are reports dated 26 March 2020 and 4 June 2020, should have been made available to them much sooner than 23 July 2020.  They thus argue that the Prosecution has breached their <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligations and that the Defence was prejudiced because of the relatively short time they had to properly consider the TCFB Reports and “incorporate” their contents into the Defence’s case.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 I am unable to agree with the Defence’s submissions in this regard.  As emphasised at [199] above, the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligation deals with <span class="font-italic">unused material</span> that may <span class="font-italic">undermine the </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence’s case</span>.  The TCFB Reports <span class="font-italic">were used</span> by the Prosecution as part of their case.  In other words, the material was not “unused”.  Not only that, it is unclear how the content of the TCFB Reports in any way undermined the Prosecution’s case or strengthened the Defence’s case.  In many respects (as I have explained in the course of the judgment), the phone and bank records were either neutral or were <span class="font-italic">adverse</span> to Shafiq, in that they showed him to have been untruthful in his statements given to the CNB.  The <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> duty does not apply to material of such nature.  This is distinct from a material witness’s statement, which the Prosecution has a duty to disclose to the Defence, whether or not that statement was favourable, neutral, or adverse to the accused person: <span class="font-italic">Nabill </span>at [39] and [41(a)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Furthermore, in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [120]–[121], the Court of Appeal also emphasised that, even where there is a breach of the Prosecution’s <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligations, the specific consequences of such a breach depends on the specific facts of each case, including whether the late disclosure of the material amounts to a “material irregularity that occasions a failure of justice” or “renders the conviction unsafe”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">120 In our view, there is no reason why a failure by the Prosecution to discharge its duty of disclosure in a timely manner should not cause a conviction to be overturned if such an irregularity <span class="font-italic">can be considered to be a material irregularity </span><span class="font-italic">that occasions a failure of justice</span>, or, put in another way, <span class="font-italic">renders the conviction unsafe</span> … The usual rules and procedures for the adducing of fresh evidence in appellate proceedings would be applicable. It should be pointed out that not all non-disclosures will be attributable to fault on the part of the Prosecution (or a lack of <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>); nevertheless, … where such non-disclosures result in a conviction being unsafe the result will still be the overturning of that conviction. In considering whether to order a retrial, the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Beh Chai Hock</span> … should be noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When exercising its discretion whether to order a retrial, <span class="font-italic">the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case</span>. The court must also have regard to two competing principles. One is that persons who are guilty of crimes should be brought to justice and should not be allowed to escape scot-free merely because of some technical blunder by the trial judge in the course of the trial. The countervailing principle is one of fairness to the accused person. The Prosecution has the burden of proving the case against the accused person; if the Prosecution has failed to do so once, it should not ordinarily get a second chance to make good the deficiencies of its case …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">121 Where disclosure, for whatever reason, is made after the beginning of trial, the court may have to grant an adjournment of sufficient duration <span class="font-italic">to allow defence counsel time to consider the effect of the disclosed material and to incorporate it into their case if necessary</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 In this case, even assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo </span>that the Prosecution had somehow breached its <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> duty, I was doubtful as to whether there was any possible prejudice to Shafiq arising from the delay in the disclosure of P119 and P120.  As I pointed out to defence counsel at the oral closing submissions, the TCFB Reports were disclosed to the Defence 11 days before the trial began, and 19 days before Shafiq took the stand.  I also pointed out that defence counsel had not, at any stage, asked for an adjournment of the trial because of the need for more time to deal with the newly disclosed documents.  Not only that, whatever time was requested for by defence counsel to take Shafiq’s instructions in the course of the trial was not opposed by the Prosecution, and was granted by the Court.  As such, I find the submission that the Prosecution had breached their <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligations, and that this resulted in serious prejudice to the accused, to be one that is unsustainable on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion                        </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the present Capital Charge against Shafiq has not been made out.  Accordingly, Shafiq cannot be convicted of that charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 However, Shafiq also admitted to knowingly importing the drugs contained in the orange biscuit packet, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 0.97g of methamphetamine in exhibit A1A1-A1 and 10.88g of MDMA contained in exhibit A1A1-A2A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The importation of the 10.88g of MDMA is the subject of a third charge (“Third Charge”) which was stood down at the commencement of this trial.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Transcript, 4 August 2020, p 6 lines 3–10; see Prosecution’s Opening Statement dated 28 July 2020, Annex A.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  There is also another charge for drug consumption (of methamphetamine), an offence under s 8(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) read with s 8A and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA, which was stood down at the commencement of trial (“Second Charge”).  It is thus for the Prosecution to determine if it wishes to proceed with those remaining charges.  Shafiq must then decide how he wishes to plead to those remaining charges.  In this regard, I have also borne in mind the Court of Appeal’s recent guidance in <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] SGCA 44 on the doctrines of double jeopardy, issue estoppel, and, critically, abuse of process.  It is clear that none of these doctrines are at issue in this case, because the stood down charges do not raise identical issues of fact or law as the present Capital Charge.  Therefore, it would not be impermissible for the Prosecution to reinstate and proceed with the stood down Second and Third Charges, should it choose to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 As for the importation of 0.97g of methamphetamine contained in exhibit A1A1-A1 (the small packet of ice), this 0.97g of methamphetamine is a subset of the 334.67g of methamphetamine that is the subject of the Capital Charge.  Therefore, the question arises as to how this Court can amend the Capital Charge to a reduced charge of importation of 0.97g of methamphetamine under s 7 of the MDA.  For completeness, I note that s 7 of the MDA does not require the offender to have imported the controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Adnan bin Kadir </span>[2013] 3 SLR 1052 at [67] and [70]), so the fact that Shafiq imported this 0.97g of ice for his own consumption is immaterial for the purpose of an importation charge under s 7 of the MDA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 There are two possible bases for this.  The first is to amend the Capital Charge via s 139 of the CPC.  Sections 138 and 139 of the CPC provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">If it is doubtful what offence has been committed </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">138</span>. If a single act or series of acts is such that it is doubtful which of several offences the provable facts will constitute, the accused may be charged with all or any of those offences and any number of the charges may be tried at once, or he may be charged in the alternative with any one of those offences.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">A</span> is accused of an act that may amount to theft or receiving stolen property or criminal breach of trust or cheating. He may be charged with theft, receiving stolen property, criminal breach of trust and cheating, or he may be charged with having committed theft or receiving stolen property or criminal breach of trust or cheating. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">A</span> states on oath before the committing Magistrate that he saw <span class="font-italic">B</span> hit <span class="font-italic">C</span> with a club. Before the General Division of the High Court, <span class="font-italic">A</span> states on oath that <span class="font-italic">B</span> never hit <span class="font-italic">C</span>. <span class="font-italic">A</span> may be charged in the alternative and convicted of intentionally giving false evidence although it cannot be proved which of these contradictory statements was false. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">When person charged with one offence can be convicted of another</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">139</span>. If in the case mentioned in section 138 the accused is charged with one offence and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under that section, he may be convicted of the offence that he is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustration</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> <span class="font-italic">A</span> is charged with theft. In evidence it appears that he committed the offence of criminal breach of trust or of receiving stolen goods. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust or of receiving stolen goods, as the case may be, although he was not charged with that offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 These provisions were analysed and construed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wee Teong Boo and other appeal and another matter </span>[2020] 2 SLR 533 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Teong </span><span class="font-italic">Boo</span>”) at [89]–[116].  Sections 138 and 139 concern the situation where the court may convict the accused person on a charge that has not been framed.  Section 139 of the CPC is an exception to the general rule that there has to be a separate charge and trial for each offence brought against the accused person.  To invoke the power under s 139 to convict an accused person of an unframed charge, the court must be satisfied that the case comes within the ambit of s 138 of the CPC.  Section 138 applies when there is a factual base consisting of an act or a series of acts and that factual base may or may not be the entirety of the known factual substratum.  Whether s 139 is available would necessitate consideration of the following factors: (a) what the relevant factual base was; (b) what the areas of factual uncertainty were; (c) what were the potential offences that could be constituted by the provable facts as a result of the factual uncertainties; and (d) whether the unframed charge fell within those potential offences: <span class="font-italic">Wee Teong Boo</span> at [98] and [115].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Where s 139 is concerned, the court must be satisfied that there is no prejudice to the accused person and, in particular, that the same issues of fact were in fact raised and ventilated as would have been the case had the unframed charge been framed.  The primary consideration is that a conviction on an unframed charge must not cause any injustice, and it must not affect the presentation of the evidence in connection with the defence of the accused person had the unframed charge been framed in the first place: <span class="font-italic">Wee Teong Boo</span> at [98].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 The second possible way is via ss 128–129 of the CPC,  which pertain to the court’s power to substitute the charge either by amending it or framing a new charge.  These provisions provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court may alter charge or frame new charge </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">128</span>.—(1)  A court may alter a charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to the existing charge, <span class="font-italic">at any time before judgment is given</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  A new or altered charge must be read and explained to the accused. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Trial after alteration of charge or framing of new charge </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">129</span>.—(1)  If a charge is altered or a new charge framed under section 128, the court must immediately call on the accused to enter his plea and to state whether he is ready to be tried on this altered or new charge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  If the accused declares that he is not ready, the court must duly consider any reason he gives. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  If the court thinks that proceeding immediately with the trial is unlikely to prejudice the accused’s defence or the prosecutor’s conduct of the case, then it may proceed with the trial. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  If the court thinks otherwise, then it may direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for as long as necessary. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 As it is clear from the italicised text of s 128(1) above, s 128(1) may only be invoked <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the delivery of judgment.  Therefore, I find s 139 to be more appropriate in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Section 139 clearly applies in relation to Shafiq’s knowing importation of the 0.97g of methamphetamine in exhibit A1A1-A1.  It was always the Prosecution’s case from the outset until its closing submissions that Shafiq knowingly imported <span class="font-italic">all</span> the 334.67g of methamphetamine, <span class="font-italic">including </span>the 0.97g of methamphetamine, that is found in the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet.  Shafiq himself admits knowingly importing the 0.97g of methamphetamine in exhibit A1A1-A1 in the orange biscuit packet.  Therefore, this is a case whereby s 138 applies because there is a factual base consisting of an act (Shafiq importing the 334.67g of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet), and it is uncertain or “doubtful” which of several offences the provable facts will constitute (importation of the full 334.67g of methamphetamine, or only of a portion of that full quantum, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, 0.97g).  The proposed unframed charge – importation of 0.97g of methamphetamine under s 7 of the MDA – clearly falls within those potential offences.  There is certainly no injustice or unfairness to Shafiq in framing and convicting him of this unframed charge of importing 0.97g of methamphetamine, since he himself admits to it, and that was also how the Prosecution ran its case against him and how the evidence was presented.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 In sum, I convict Shafiq of the following amended charge, pursuant to s 139 of the CPC:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, Muhammad Shafiq Bin Shariff, on 14 November 2017 at about 12.05pm, at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, 1 packet containing not less than 1.45g of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.97g of methamphetamine, without authorisation under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 7 and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 The Prosecution is to indicate, in writing, to the Court and Defence Counsel its intentions regarding the remaining stood down Second and Third Charges (as highlighted at [206] above) within two weeks from the date of this judgment.
