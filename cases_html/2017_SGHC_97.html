The Development consists of two blocks: Block 51 and Block 53, Kim Keat Road, Singapore 328821. The dispute appears to have arisen around late-2008 to early-2009, and the parties have already been to the Strata Titles Board (“STB”) six times (in STB No 79 of 2009 (“STB79/2009”), No 73 of 2010, No 78 of 2011 (“STB78/2011”), No 93 of 2011 (“STB93/2011”), No 50 of 2012 (“STB50/2012”), and No 98 of 2012), as well as to court twice (in Originating Summonses No 300 of 2009 (“OS300/2009”) and No 569 of 2013 (“OS569/2013”), including to the Court of Appeal (in Civil Appeal No 110 of 2013)).

The Mok Camp thus comprises the SPs of 11 of the 19 units in MCST 1024, and therefore controls the election of the council of MCST 1024 (the “Council”). However, because the Mok Camp collectively hold only 416 share values in the Development, they can be outvoted in general meeting by the Plaintiffs’ Camp.

</div> Dr Mok ruled, probably incorrectly, that Motion 10 was “out of order”. For some strange reason, the Plaintiffs chose not to proceed with their challenge to this ruling before the learned judge in OS569/2013, although in those proceedings they included it as one of the rulings they wished to impugn. As noted, the Defendant has not taken out any application to dismiss or strike out this Suit on this basis that the Plaintiffs are not the correct parties to sue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I therefore have to deal with this preliminary objection within this rather curious state of affairs.

However subsequent cases have made clear that that proposition is one where it involves a pure question of law, or a simple point of law, and no embarrassment is caused to the other party by raising it at the last minute.

The many proceedings before the STB and the courts more than bear this out. The facts surrounding these issues have all in one way or another been put into evidence, particularly by the references made in this Suit to the records of the other proceedings. The witnesses were also cross-examined on the events in those other proceedings.

In their closing submissions, the Defendant set out at para 29(a) the question whether the Plaintiffs were entitled to maintain this action against him and claim for reliefs on behalf of MCST 1024 as one of the issues before me. It was only in the Plaintiff’s reply closing submissions that they contend that this was not a pleaded issue.

</div>
</div> While I do not think that the separate legal entity of a management corporation is illusory, there is some force in the argument that the legal personality of a management corporation is weaker, or at least somewhat different, from that of a company. As observed in Rachel PS Leow, “The legal personality of management corporations in strata title developments in Singapore” (2012) 1 Conv 75 at 77, a management corporation is comprised of its SPs collectively, has a flow-through liability structure, is subject to limited agency in the case of structural defects, and is empowered to represent its SPs in legal proceedings (see s 85(1) of the BMSMA and <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener)</span> <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">and another appeal</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">For present purposes, it suffices that there exists at a minimum a distinction between breaches of duty owed to or wrongs perpetuated on a management corporation on the one hand, and wrongs done to an individual SP in his personal capacity on the other. </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Prima facie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">claims in respect of the former are to be prosecuted by the management corporation itself, while claims in respect of the latter may be pursued by the individual SPs concerned.

Nor were they suing [Dr Mok] for wrongs allegedly done to the MC.

Such claims are properly within the remit of MCST 1024, and not the Plaintiffs, to prosecute. The very concept of a separate legal entity necessarily limits when others, even when it is its members, can bring actions on its behalf as opposed to that separate legal entity bringing its own action. Were the Plaintiffs allowed to pursue a personal action against the Defendant, the risk of double recovery – by both the Plaintiffs and MCST 1024 – in respect of his alleged breach of duty would be very real. It was put to KL Tan in cross-examination that if Motion 10 had been passed, the Defendant could have faced separate lawsuits by MCST 1024 and the Plaintiffs in respect of the same alleged breach of duty. KL Tan did not dispute the concern, and asserted only that “[w]e may withdraw our suit.”</span>

The touchstone of “replacement” is functional equivalence (see <span class="font-italic">Thoo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [4]), which necessitates a comparison of the end-product of the works with the attributes of the common property at some earlier reference point (see <span class="font-italic">Thoo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [6]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The question of what amounts to renewal, replacement, alteration or addition must be answered by a process of comparison with the position that prevailed at the earlier reference point.

The initial attributes are fixed at that time; and it is from that base that characterisation as renewal, replacement, alteration or addition is to be approached. Once any addition or alteration is made in accordance with the Act, the attributes of the common property are changed, a new reference point is identified and future questions of renewal, replacement, alteration and addition fall to be assessed by reference to the changed state at that new reference point. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">108 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In my view, these cases set out applicable guidance as to when a piece of work amounts to repair and maintenance and when it becomes an improvement.

What amounts to repair and maintenance and what amounts to improvement depends on all the facts and circumstances of the case. </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">What exactly amounts to “improvement” must be broadly interpreted as something more than just “old” for “new” or reasonable or unavoidable “betterment”. There must be an element of practicality. Any renewal or replacement will, by its very nature, involve improvement and betterment. Old will be superseded by new (see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Thoo</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [7])</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. Prescriptive rules will often be of little utility as it cannot cover all the facts and circumstances that can arise. No one factor (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">eg</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, cost</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">) or core of factors, is decisive. Replacement may also entail addition and the new or replacement item may now be different from the old. An example would be a change in drainage patterns in the broader vicinity and/or a change in long term weather patterns which necessitates installation of a sump pump in, for example, a basement or sunken areas for outdoor bathrooms, where none was necessary before. Another good example will be the replacement of 20-year-old electric bulbs and fittings or neon lights to the newer energy efficient lights which need transformers and perhaps reflective or special housing. These are undoubtedly newer; these are undoubtedly an improvement. They will initially cost a little more, but there will be a saving in its lower consumption and running costs. Few can argue that these cannot amount under any circumstances to “repair and maintenance”. Similarly, 20-year-old switches in common areas may no longer be allowed under current building and utility codes.

Even this distinction needs to be tempered with common-sense and practicality. A case in point is the burst sewer pipe that occurred here under the bathroom floor in Block 53. Few will argue that this is an emergency repair. But the old clay sewer pipes resting on haunching prevalent 20 years earlier, especially in an area where the nature of the subsoil is liable to settlement, will now have to be replaced with PVC piping and properly laid support, given the susceptibility to settlement. Can one sensibly argue that this is an improvement and needs a special resolution? Can one sensibly argue that the same 20-year-old floor tiles must be sourced and used or that only that part that was dug up to expose the sewer should be replaced with new tiles? It is unarguable (subject again to all the facts of the case and including, but not limited to, the cost and availability of tiles), especially where the toilets are not unduly large, that all the floor tiles should be changed and there is no need to have a special resolution to effect those repairs. Further, if that change of the sewer piping below the ground floor toilet necessitates corresponding changes to the stack of sewer piping to the connecting second, third and fourth floor toilets above, there can be little doubt that will fall within the phrase “repair and maintain”. On the other hand, if a concealed water pipe bursts and tiles have to be hacked to trace the breach, whether one replaces it with a pipe that is not concealed and whether those tiles or whole floors or walls have to be re-tiled can constitute borderline cases. At the other end, concrete spalling along corridors can be repaired without the need for laying tiles along the whole corridor or all the corridors for uniformity. The latter clearly requires a special resolution. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">110 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Accordingly, works that are necessary to place the Development in a state of good repair may be authorised by either the Council or MCST 1024.

I therefore find as a fact, as in <span class="font-italic">Si-Hoe Kok Chun</span>, the SPs of MCST 1024 were entitled to and did in fact adopt an informal manner of conducting the proceedings at their general meetings, including those concerning works to the development. They chose, at times, to make decisions by consensus without the formality of taking a vote. Insofar as <span class="font-italic">all</span> SPs at a general meeting had informally assented to a matter within its purview, the matter will be authorised as if a formal resolution had been passed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">121 </span>However such practices are not immutable and they can cease. This occurred here. The practice did not survive into the 25th AGM held on 5 October 2009 because, as noted above, disputes arose in the earlier part of 2009. I find that after 12 March 2009, when the SPs of units on the third and fourth floors of Block 53 commenced OS300/2009, the Council members and some, if not all, of the SPs became aware that disputes had arisen within their Development. There could have been no doubt about this after the decision in the Council meeting on 22 May 2009

Neither Sarah Tham nor CY Lim disagreed that it was a “customary practice of [MCST 1024] that a notice of the works to be carried out would be put on [its] noticeboard”.

He simply asserted that such a method of approval was “a scheme to go around the law. The law requires you to – to be voted, to be budgeted”. When it was then put to him in cross-examination that securing such approval was part of his duty as Treasurer in the Council, KL Tan simply replied “[i]t doesn’t [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] occur to me at that time”.

After all, the powers of a council derive from the management corporation (see s 58 of the BMSMA) Also, a management corporation is entitled to ratify a breach by the council of the Second Schedule of the BMSMA (see <span class="font-italic">Diora</span><span class="font-italic">-Ace Ltd and others v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3661 and another</span> [2015] 3 SLR 620 at [76]–[77] applying s 88(3) of the BMSMA).

However, as observed by Andrew Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Lang and another v Sassoon Samuel Bernard</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 522 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Lang </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span>”) at [51] in the context of collective sale orders, the procedural safeguards in the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) (the “LT(S)A”) are “not built in as absolute obstacles to be surmounted on pain of the Board being precluded from exercising jurisdiction [to sanction a collective sale] if any of the procedural requirements were not met, regardless of whether and to what extent the interests of the minority were affected.” Ang J continued (at [55]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the end of the day, each objection must be examined on its own facts and the particular requirement breached set against the overall purpose of the legislation. One should then consider whether a strict construction and the invalidation of the [proceeding] is what Parliament would have intended, taking into account any prejudice to the rights of parties and the public interest (if any).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These statements were subsequently endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Lang and another v Sassoon Samuel Bernard</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Lang (C</span><span class="font-italic">A)</span>”) at [23]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the modern approach is to consider whether it is the intention of Parliament to invalidate any act done in breach of a statutory provision.

On the facts of this case, all the SPs in MCST 1024 acquiesced in the procedural deficiencies in the meetings of the Council, and up until late-2008 to early-2009 raised no objections to the decisions made by the Council on works to the Development. None of the SPs were prejudiced by the lack of notice of the meetings of the Council; they were content to leave decision-making on works to the Development to the Council, and had no interest in attending the meetings of the Council. Accordingly, I find that the fact that the SPs were provided with inadequate notice of certain meetings of the Council did not invalidate the decisions of the Council made at those meetings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Authorisation of Annex A Works</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">134 </span>As pleaded in the SOC, the Annex A Works comprise 62 items of works that the Plaintiffs allege were undertaken without the authorisation of MCST 1024, and I set them out in a table below.

In the event, linking the Plaintiffs’ allegations (as pleaded in Annex A) to the relevant documentary evidence was in many cases a matter of some deduction and some guesswork, which is an unsatisfactory level of proof. This leaves me with little option but to resolve the issue based on the burden of proof which rests on the Plaintiffs to demonstrate that the items of works in question were unauthorised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">137 </span>The Plaintiffs’ closing submissions did not touch on the individual items in Annex A, which formed a large part of the Plaintiffs’ claims.

</div> The Plaintiffs’ reply submissions were, with respect, very inadequate. It was contained in paragraphs 61 to 65 which only took up four pages out of a 49-page, 133-paragraph reply submissions. The Plaintiffs tried to explain that various concessions made by their witnesses, particularly Sarah Tham,  had been taken out of context, and that all she had done was to concede certain items were repairs and maintenance. They claimed Sarah Tham did not know the state of the item that was being replaced or repaired before the expense was incurred to replace it and she was then asked to take that in isolation and to consider whether this could have been repair and maintenance. They also picked on an example of seven down-lights (Item 9), which had been posted in the ledgers as improvements or upgrading works to make the submission that “<span class="font-italic">all</span> these items listed in Annex A (and in the MCST’s ledges [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] as upgrading expenses) were likely to have been replaced or carried out even though they were not in disrepair or spoilt.” This is clearly not a correct proposition to make from the evidence given that some items in Annex A had been conceded in their pleadings and by Sarah Tham at trial, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, when she was shown the minutes of the 23rd AGM which noted her husband, KL Tan’s request to change the directory (Items 17 and 18); this was acceded to. Save for her rather unconvincing attempts during re-examination to claw back her concessions made during cross-examination, the reply submissions stated at paragraph 65 rather weakly that when Sarah Tham was cross-examined on Annex A, she had been on the witness stand for a long time and was tired. This again is not true as I found Sarah Tham to be quite alert during her cross-examination, which was in any case carried out quite fairly by Mr Lee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">138 </span>The Plaintiffs offered no details or correlation with the documentary evidence and instead made allegations of grossed-up works with no individual pricing that could be matched to the documentary and photographic evidence.

Another example is the Plaintiffs accepting as early as in their SOC that $65,600.00 of works on the driveway and boundary wall were approved, without bothering at any time thereafter to identify the items of Annex A Works that corresponded to that sum. I find that Sarah Tham was not confused when she made these concessions; she often paused to think before answering. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">139 </span>The 62 items of Annex A Works were compiled with a blunderbuss approach and without much thought as to where the target might be. Many of the descriptions of the works, as pleaded in the SOC, simply reproduce the titles of the invoices issued by the contractors who performed the works. Hardly any attempt was made to relate the invoices to the works pleaded in the SOC, much less to consider whether the works in question had in fact been authorised. This was reflected in three troubling aspects of the Plaintiffs’ case, which undermined the credibility of their claims:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Plaintiffs listed 62 items as the Annex A Works as works the expenses for which had been “incurred by the Defendant from June 2008 to March 2009 without approval and therefore in breach of trust”,

</div> but, as noted above, withdrew many their claims without much resistance in relation to 30 of these items when challenged by the Defendant during the course of the trial. As noted above, the lack of care with which their case was pleaded and presented is most clearly seen in relation to Items 17 and 18, (works relating to the directory of the Development). When she was shown the minutes of the 23rd AGM, Sarah Tham had no choice but to concede that these works had been approved.

I set out as an example an extract of the evidence of Sarah Tham on Items 4 and 5, which concerned additions and alterations (“A&amp;A”) work to the fifth floor toilets at Block 53:

A good example would be Items 4 and 5 which concerned A&amp;A works to the fifth floor toilets at Block 53, and were described by the Plaintiffs in the Annex of their SOC as “A&amp;A Work at 53 Kim Keat 5th floor – Male/Female Toilets” and “<span class="font-italic">Additional</span> Work at 53 Kim Keat – Male/Female Toilets” [emphasis added] respectively. Yet, Sarah Tham took the position that Item 5 was authorised while Item 4 was not, apparently on the basis that Item 4 cost $38,521.07 while Item 5 cost $4,194.40 and without considering what the items of work entailed. I retained the conceded items in the Annex A table above because this kind of inconsistency can be seen when comparing the conceded items and non-conceded items especially when one considers the Plaintiffs originally claimed that <span class="font-italic">all</span> the sixty-two items were unauthorised works. From her evidence, it is clear that Sarah Tham also considered an item as authorised or unauthorised based on whether the item had been posted to the repair and maintenance ledger or the upgrading ledger. I set out one such example:

</div> In my view, this non-objection was telling. It shows the SPs were content with the works being carried out. This is so particularly in light of KL Tan’s evidence that the way that the upgrading works had been discussed at the 23rd AGM appeared to be in accordance with the common informal practice of MCST 1024 for the approval of works at that time.

More importantly there is no record of anyone objecting or disputing to these works having been carried out without due authorisation or without their knowledge. To the contrary, the minutes show that CY Lim queried whether the third and fourth floor toilets would be upgraded as well and the Chairman explained that the toilets on these floors were not under the care of MCST 1024. This answer no doubt caused the launching of OS 300/2009 on 12 March 2009 (see [26] above) as the SPs on the third and fourth floors of Block 53 must have felt they were being unfairly left out.

</div> It was undisputed that the Plaintiffs, whose units were on the third floor of Block 53, received this circular. Indeed, the Plaintiffs in a letter to the Defendant dated 18 April 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">154 </span>Significantly, the second, third and fourth plaintiffs, whose units were on the third floor, wrote in to the Defendant under the heading “Renovation of Lift Lobby Floor at 3rd floor Mun Hean Building” on 18 April 2009, (the original typed date of 30 March 2009 had been deleted and the handwritten date of 18 April 2009 was initialled). They referred to the above 13 March 2009 notice and “request[ed] that the existing floor-tiles be kept” because they had re-tiled the third floor lobby “at [their] own expenses few years ago”, and asked that MCST 1024 instead “consider to upgrade the lift lobby wall”.

Turning to Item 16 itself, it was undisputed that in June 2008, a sewerage pipe burst in the first floor toilets of Block 53, leaving a foul smell emanating from the first floor toilets at Block 53. Waste was seen under the soil, and the SPs found the stench quite unbearable.

</div> In my view, the Council was entitled to and did in fact approve Item 16 pursuant to its duty to repair and maintain the Development. Item 16 involved hacking off the old and then installing new floors, walls, and toilet cubicles, running new pipes to the toilets, and installing new ceilings and fittings. These works were a necessary consequence in the replacement of the damaged sewer pipe. Indeed, the Plaintiffs accept in their Closing Submissions that the works to the first floor toilet at Block 53 were necessary repairs and maintenance:

As recorded on the payment voucher for Item 20, Items 20 and 22 involved respectively a 20% deposit and a 20% progress payment for “proposed toilet plumbing work for level 1–5 @ [Block] 51” for a total sum of $35,600.00.

Further, the expenditures on Items 20 and 22 amounted to only 40% of $35,600.00 expenditure on the “toilet plumbing work”.

To that end, there was no reason why KL Tan could not have raised the issue of the quotation (and what the Plaintiffs contend to be excessive expenditure) at the 24th AGM, particularly when he had vigorously resisted a proposal by the Defendant to raise the maintenance and sinking fund contributions to pay for the Annex A Works. The fact that KL Tan did not see fit to bring up this quotation at the 24th AGM suggests that he had found the works therein not to be out of the ordinary, and reinforced my view that they were not unauthorised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">176 </span><span class="font-underline">Item 61 (“Labour Work at Block 51 2nd, 4th &amp; 5th floor) for $14,190.34.</span>

</div> to contend that a member present or assembled at a meeting who does not vote on a resolution should nevertheless count as part of the corpus of participants at the meeting (from which the number of votes needed to constitute the requisite majority is calculated). However, these cases do not address the question of what it means to be “present” at a meeting. Mere physical existence at the venue a meeting cannot <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> constitute such “presence”, otherwise the question of “presence” at a meeting would simply come down to the physical boundaries of the venue. Something more is required: that of a conscious choice on the member’s part to participate in the meeting, even if he chooses to abstain from voting on a particular resolution. Although the SPs in the Plaintiffs’ Camp may have physically been in the same room as the SPs in the Mok Camp at the time of the 27th AGM, the SPs in the Plaintiffs’ Camp had chosen not to take part in the proceedings of the Mok Meeting. On the contrary, they had gathered to hold their own meeting in the same room.

Having chosen to neither participate nor cast any votes in the Mok Meeting, the SPs in the Plaintiffs Camp cannot now assert that they had in fact voted against the Ratification Resolutions.

That decision was not appealed against.

These objections should have been taken in OS569/2013, where the Plaintiffs applied to invalidate Dr Mok’s ruling out of order their motions to revoke the Ratification Resolutions. Having neglected to do so before either Chan J or the Court of Appeal, the Plaintiffs’ attempt to do so now is, in my view, an abuse of process under the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span>. A litigant will not be permitted to argue points that should have been, but were not, previously determined by a court or tribunal “because they were not brought to the attention of the court or tribunal in the earlier proceedings even though they ought properly to have been raised and argued then” (see <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (</span><span class="font-italic">nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1104 at [101] citing <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>at 381–382). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">192 </span>OS569/2013 was, in substance, an application by the Plaintiffs to revoke the Ratification Resolutions. Any deficiency in the 27th AGM Notice that had the effect of impugning the Ratification Resolutions passed at the 27th AGM was a “point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time” (see <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> at 382). Yet, as Chan J observed in <span class="font-italic">Fu Loong (HC) </span>at [51], “[t]he Plaintiffs’ affidavit [in OS569/2013] was silent on why it was necessary to revoke the approval and adoption of the audited accounts.” Moreover, the Plaintiffs raised their objections to the 27th AGM Notice for the first time only in their closing submissions, having maintained in their pleadings and at trial that the Account Adoption Resolution was not valid only because it was not passed with a requisite majority of SPs.

At the 25th AGM, the SPs did not pass the audited financial report for FY2009 because the Plaintiffs’ Camp disputed the authorisation of the Annex A Works (see [35] above).

There was no withdrawal of Item C. Nevertheless, I am also of the view that the differences between the directories at Block 53 and Block 51 do not amount to unequal treatment of the SPs in Block 53. Sarah Tham deposed that the “directory for Block 53 is a bare aluminium panel with old vinyl text”. In contrast, the “directory for Block 51 is boxed up, lighted up and comes with a display monitor”.

</div> The Plaintiffs did not offer any evidence to show that this state of affairs should have been rectified as a matter of safety or compliance with any codes, nor have they raised this in any general meeting as an item for discussion if they felt it should be remedied. Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs did not take this up in their closing and reply submissions. CY Lim and KL Tan did not give evidence on the electrical distribution boxes.

</div> The Defendant adds that MH Asia simply “continued to seamlessly perform the functions [MH Realty] had erstwhile been performing for the MCST”. He had “belatedly realized that MHR[ealty]’s winding up would affect MHR[ealty]’s charges for the services provided to the MCST” and thus “sent a letter to the [SPs] and Council Members on 5 August 2009” to “[i]nform the SPs that MH Asia would takeover MHR[ealty]’s services temporarily” and to request “interested parties to put forward some names for the provision of the same services”. When SPs in the Plaintiffs’ Camp objected to MH Asia’s appointment, the Defendant replied that their “points are noted and will be included in the forthcoming [AGM]”, to which there was no further response from the SPs.

Instead, he appointed MH Asia unilaterally, kept the Council and the SPs in the dark on MH Asia until 5 August 2009, and procured the <span class="font-italic">retrospective</span> payment of $6,000.00 to MH Asia (for work done from February to July 2009) the very next day.
