        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Surteco Pte Ltd (“the
                    company”), summarily dismissed its former employee, the defendant,
                    Mr Detlev Kurt Siebke (“Mr Siebke”), and sued him for
                    damages for breach of his employment contract. Mr Siebke, who denied having
                    breached his employment contract, counterclaimed for the payment by the company
                    of his remuneration as well as other benefits, including relocation
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The company manufactures and markets paper or
                    plastic edge bandings, synthetic resins, impregnated paper laminates or foils
                    and roller shutters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 22 January 2007, the company hired
                    Mr Siebke as its Area Sales Manager, Asia. He was in charge of sales in a
                    number of countries, including Hong Kong, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. He
                    was paid a monthly salary of $10,750, plus a monthly transport allowance of
                    $1,000. He was also provided with a laptop computer by the company. His monthly
                    salary was revised to $10,850 in April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Apparently, the company was quite dissatisfied
                    with Mr Siebke’s performance. Its managing director, Mr Hans
                    Lennart Klingeborn (“Mr Klingeborn”) contemplated the
                    termination of Mr Siebke’s employment contract between the end of
                    2007 and May 2008 but no action was taken “out of compassion” for
                    the latter’s livelihood. It was not until May 2008 that Mr Klingeborn
                    informed Mr Siebke that his employment would be terminated. Mr Siebke
                    proposed that he be redeployed to set up a warehouse and distribution point in
                    India for the company’s products. This proposal was accepted and
                    Mr Siebke went to Chennai on numerous occasions to prepare the groundwork
                    for setting up the said warehouse in India between May and November
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, the company scuttled its plans for
                    the Indian warehouse. Mr Klingeborn claimed that to make it easier for
                    Mr Siebke to find another job elsewhere, he gave the latter a retrenchment
                    letter dated 19 November 2008, which stated that he had lost his job as a
                    result of the company’s cost-cutting measures in the light of the global
                    economic situation. Mr Siebke, who was given the required notice of six
                    months, was informed that he was to work “as normal” during the
                    notice period and that references for jobs within or outside the Surteco group
                    would be available upon request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The company contended that after being
                    “retrenched”, Mr Siebke’s performance became worse. As
                    it did not want him to become a bad example to other staff, he was informed by
                    Mr Klingeborn on 25 March 2009 that he would be given “garden
                    leave” until 31 May 2009. On the same day, Mr Siebke returned
                    his laptop computer to the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After conducting checks on the laptop computer
                    returned by Mr Siebke, the company discovered from his e-mails and
                    “Skype” conversations with his friends and customers that he had
                    breached his duties to the company under his employment contract. The company
                    claimed that the information retrieved from the laptop computer showed that
                    Mr Siebke had been doing his own sideline business and had told his friend
                    that he had released the company’s confidential Customers List to an
                    outsider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The company decided to summarily dismiss him in
                    April 2009. All further payments to Mr Siebke were immediately
                    stopped.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Siebke responded by instructing M/s
                    Luther LLP to issue a letter of demand to the company for sums allegedly owed to
                    him by the company on 15 May 2009. As the company did not pay him the
                    amount claimed, Mr Siebke commenced MC Suit No 17380/2009L on 9 June
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The company instituted the present suit to
                    recover damages from him for his breach of contract and for orders compelling
                    him not to release the company’s Customers List. Mr Siebke then
                    successfully applied for an order to transfer MC Suit No 17380/2009L to the High
                    Court. By virtue of an Order of Court dated 26 November 2009, both the
                    suits in the High Court were consolidated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The company’s suit against Mr Siebke (Suit No 560 of
                2009)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The success of the company’s suit
                    against Mr Siebke hinges on whether it was entitled to dismiss
                    Mr Siebke summarily in April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In <em>Sinclair v
                        Neighbour</em> [1967] 2 QB 279, Sachs LJ pointed out at
                    289 that it is well-established law that a servant can be instantly dismissed
                    when his conduct is such that it amounts to a wrongful act inconsistent with his
                    duty towards his master or is inconsistent with the continuance of confidence
                    between them. In <em>Cowie Edward Bruce v Berger International
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 739, Warren Khoo J
                    explained at [39]-[40] the right of an employer to summarily
                    dismiss an employee in the following helpful terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In each case, it is a matter of degree whether the act complained of is of
                        the requisite gravity. It has been said that it must be so serious that it
                        strikes at the root of the contract of employment, that it destroys the
                        confidence underlying such a contract: <em>Jackson v Invicta
                            Plastics</em> Ltd [1987] BCLC 329 at 344, <em>per</em> Peter Pain J.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The relevancy and effect of any misdeed complained of must, it seems to
                        me, be judged by reference to its effect on the employer-employee
                        relationship. It also seems to me that in judging the relevancy and effect
                        of the acts complained of, account must be taken of the habits and attitude
                        of the employer at the relevant time. They cannot be judged totally in a
                        vacuum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The company asserted that it had the right to
                    dismiss Mr Siebke for a number of serious breaches. The first concerned his
                    sideline business of selling aluminium handles to his customers in Europe
                    without its approval. This breached clause XIII of Mr Siebke’s
                    employment contract, which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Employee will place his entire knowledge and work capacity at the
                        disposal of the Employer. All paid or unpaid sideline work of the Employee
                        requires the previous written approval of the Employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The data in the laptop computer used by
                    Mr Siebke revealed that he had been actively engaged in his sideline
                    business between December 2007 and March 2009. According to Mr Klingeborn,
                    Mr Siebke spent about 5% of his office hours on his private business.
                    Mr Siebke claimed that he had been given permission to “wind down
                    his personal business incrementally while at his job with [the company]”
                    because he could not abruptly cease his personal business at the material time.
                    This was vehemently denied by Mr Klingeborn, who said that Mr Siebke
                    had informed him that his sideline business was not doing very well and that it
                    would be wound up before the latter started work at the company.
                    Mr Klingeborn explained in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”) at para 10 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During my job interview of [Mr Siebke] ..., I asked [him] what he was
                        doing for a living then. I was informed by [Mr Siebke] that he was
                        running his own business of supplying Aluminium Handles to his customers in
                        Europe which he procured from suppliers in Malaysia and China. He assured me
                        personally that he would wind up and conclude this Handle business
                        completely before commencing his employment with the Plaintiffs.
                        [Mr Siebke] further told me that his personal business was not doing
                        well in any event. I also [specified] to [him] the Plaintiffs’ stand
                        that [his] own business must be completely stopped before starting with the
                        Plaintiffs and that [he] could not be running his own business while working
                        for the Plaintiffs, not even for a short overlap of time. Hence, even before
                        offering [Mr Siebke] the job with the Plaintiffs, parties had already
                        agreed that [his] own business must be completely concluded before
                        commencing work at the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I accept Mr Klingeborn’s evidence
                    that Mr Siebke was not allowed to conduct his own business after he joined
                    the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Despite a court order and repeated requests,
                    not a single document pertaining to his own business was produced for
                    inspection. Mr Siebke initially claimed that he had no such documents.
                    However, when cross-examined, he admitted that the documents could be in one of
                    the numerous boxes that he kept in Thailand, where he now works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Siebke insisted that he did not
                    conduct any sideline business but his explanations bordered on the ridiculous. A
                    couple of examples will suffice. The first concerns a Skype chat with one
                    Ms Lynna Puah on 13 November 2008, during which he stated that he had
                    made contacts with two new customers, and that one of them would meet him at the
                    Frankfurt airport in December 2008. Mr Siebke claimed that what he really
                    meant was that he was going to meet an old friend’s son as well as the
                    son’s friend after having breakfast with his old friend. This story could,
                    by no stretch of imagination, match what he had told Ms Puah during the
                    chat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The second example relates to a Skype chat
                    between Mr Siebke and one Mr Domink Fruth
                    (“Mr Fruth”) between 31 January to 1 February 2008,
                    during which the latter stated that he had just signed a contract and would send
                    a copy of the contract to Mr Siebke. Mr Fruth added that he
                    “would transfer the money after [Chinese New Year]” and that he
                    will have “a nice letterhead designed for [Mr Siebke’s]
                    company”. Mr Siebke then forwarded his bank account number to
                    Mr Fruth and specified that the “contract” was to be sent to
                    his personal email address and not to his company email account. The company
                    rightly contended that if Mr Siebke was not conducting his own business in
                    January/February 2008, which was one year after he joined it, there would have
                    been no reason for Mr Fruth to send him a contract, for money to be
                    transferred to Mr Siebke and for a letterhead to be designed for
                    Mr Siebke’s own business. Mr Siebke’s explanation for the
                    conversation with Mr Fruth was contrived and inconsistent. He testified
                    that Haefele Pte Ltd, the German company for whom Mr Fruth works, wanted to
                    do business in Vietnam and as a representative office in Vietnam was not allowed
                    to get any funds, Mr Fruth could not receive his salary. That was why he
                    wanted Mr Fruth to design a letterhead for him so that he could render an
                    invoice to the said representative office to enable him to be paid
                    Mr Fruth’s salary, after which he was to pass over the money to the
                    latter. Mr Siebke then changed his evidence and said that
                    Mr Fruth’s company has had a representative office in Vietnam for the
                    past eight years and that Mr Fruth had been controlling that office from
                    Singapore. It was thus obvious that Mr Fruth has had no problems getting
                    paid in Singapore for his work in Vietnam. Mr Siebke could not furnish a
                    proper explanation as to why Mr Fruth could not continue to receive his
                    salary in Singapore. I have no hesitation whatsoever in rejecting
                    Mr Siebke’s contrived explanation of the very plain language used in
                    his chats with Mr Fruth between 31 January and 1 February 2008,
                    which clearly revealed that he was conducting a sideline business of his own
                    while being employed by the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is also worth noting that Mr Siebke
                    stated in his Skype chat with one Mr Gerd Lentze
                    (“Mr Lentze”) on 14 August 2008 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">They once told me that I ought not/should not continue to operate my own
                        company – then I removed it from the register so that there would no
                        longer be any trace of it at the registration office in Singapore .... The
                        customers in Germany aren’t interested – I continue to use the
                        company name – that has no validity under German law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I thus find that Mr Siebke breached his
                    employment contract by continuing to run his sideline business while being
                    employed by the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Another complaint by the company is that
                    Mr Siebke breached his employment contract by distributing the
                    company’s confidential Customers List to others. Mr Klingeborn
                    explained in his AEIC at para 54 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] competitor laying their hands on the Plaintiffs’
                        complete customers list would be getting a completely confidential list of
                        very sensitive and useful information that is not possible to obtain from
                        the public domain.... With the exact internal road map against the
                        Plaintiffs, a competitor would be in the perfect position [to] pre-empt the
                        requirements and needs of the Plaintiffs’ customers when the
                        competitor approaches the customers. The competitor knows from the purchase
                        histories and details exactly what kind of edge bands any particular
                        customer needs and the quantities thereof.... The Customers List removes any
                        need for the competitor to start from scratch when attempting to win market
                        share from the Plaintiffs. This is an unfair advantage. They would then be
                        in a good position to recommend comparable edge bands and quote the
                        appropriate prices to beat the Plaintiffs, knowing the Plaintiffs’
                        specific prices at which it sells to the customer .... A competitor would
                        also be able to know the Plaintiffs’ cost prices .... These are the
                        Plaintiffs’ industrial secrets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The company asserted that Mr Siebke
                    admitted in his Skype chat with Mr Lentze on 16 March 2009 that he had
                    just given the company’s entire Customers List to a friend who sells
                    wood-processing machines. The relevant part of the transcript of this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     When cross-examined, Mr Siebke denied
                    having given the Customers List to his friend or that he had a copy of the said
                    List in his house. He said that he had talked “nonsense” with
                    Mr Lentze and that his words may be regarded as sheer
                    “bravado”. I was not convinced by this explanation. As for what he
                    meant by the words “12 years and more work the whole of South-east
                    Asia”, which appeared in the context of his reference to the Customers
                    List in his Skype chat, he claimed that this referred to his own stay in
                    Singapore and South-east Asia. This explanation made no sense. I thus find that
                    Mr Siebke breached his employment contract by handing over the Customers
                    List to an unauthorised recipient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Undoubtedly, by conducting his own sideline
                    business and by distributing the company’s Customers List to another
                    party, Mr Siebke had breached his employment contract in a manner that
                    entitled the company to dismiss him summarily when it discovered the breaches in
                    April 2009. It is thus unnecessary for me to consider whether or not the
                    company’s other assertions that he had abused his medical leave and spoken
                    ill of its top executive and its products are good grounds for the summary
                    dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The company’s remedies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Having summarily dismissed Mr Siebke, the
                    company contended that he is obliged to return 50% of the remuneration and
                    benefits paid to him during his period of employment because he had not worked
                    exclusively for it in accordance with his contract. The amount claimed was
                    $169,486.09.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Damages for breach of contract must be proven
                    by the claimant. In <em>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v
                        Ng Khim Ming Eric</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782, the Court of
                    Appeal observed (at [60]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In contract, as in tort, causation must first be proved before the issue
                        of remoteness is addressed: see <em>Chitty on
                            Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) vol 1 at
                        para 26-029. As was stated in <em>Monarch Steamship Co,
                            Limited v Karlshamns Oljefabriker (A/B)</em>
                        [1949] AC 196 ... at 225, it is established law that the claimant
                        may recover damages for a loss only where the breach of contract was the
                        “effective” or “dominant” cause of that
                        loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The court added (at [62]) that instead of
                    formal tests for causation in contract, common sense is relied on as a guide to
                    decide whether a breach of contract is a sufficiently substantial cause of the
                    claimant’s loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, Mr Siebke’s
                    sideline business did not compete with the company’s business. Even so,
                    the company wanted to claw back 50% of the remuneration paid to him because it
                    estimated that he must have wasted half his time in the office on his sideline
                    business. However, when cross-examined, Mr Klingeborn readily agreed that
                    it is not possible to quantify the time an employee spends on his official work
                    and personal work during office hours. There being no evidence that the company
                    has suffered a loss of $169,486.09 as a result of Mr Siebke’s
                    sideline business or personal chats, the claim by the company for this amount is
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As for the disclosure of the Customers List by
                    Mr Siebke, the company claimed the rather extravagant sum of $782,000.00.
                    It pointed out that its net profit for the first quarter of 2009 was lower than
                    that for the first quarter of 2008 by $518,000 while the decrease of its net
                    profit for the second quarter of 2009, when compared to the second quarter of
                    2008, was $264,000. There was no satisfactory evidence from anyone in relation
                    to the causal connection between the distribution of the Customers List and the
                    decrease in net profit for the first and second quarters of 2009. When
                    cross-examined, Mr Klingeborn testified that while he “strongly
                    believed” that there was a connection between the drop in sales and the
                    release of the Customers List, the company had no “hard evidence”
                    against Mr Siebke. That being the case, the company failed to prove that it
                    is entitled to the $782,000.00 that it claimed from
                Mr Siebke.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The company also made an excessive claim
                    against Mr Siebke for loss of profits due to Mr Siebke’s poor
                    work attitude. To begin with, it pointed out that the gross profit for the
                    markets under Mr Siebke’s charge, namely Hong Kong, Sri Lanka,
                    Pakistan and Vietnam fell by $123,289.00 in 2008. It added that in view of the
                    time expended by Mr Siebke on his personal chats and gossip during office
                    hours as well as his ill discipline and poor job attitude, he should be liable
                    for the said decrease in profits in 2008. It cannot be overlooked that the
                    company claimed that it knew quite soon after hiring Mr Siebke that his
                    performance was poor. Mr Klingeborn said that the company did not dismiss
                    Mr Siebke earlier on because of compassionate grounds. In fact, when
                    Mr Siebke’s services were no longer required in November 2008, the
                    company decided to make it easier for him to find another job by retrenching
                    instead of sacking him. He was even told that the company would furnish a
                    reference for him if he needed a reference to find a new job. In these
                    circumstances, the company is in no position to claim damages from him for his
                    poor performance. More importantly, there was no serious attempt by the company
                    to prove a causal link between Mr Siebke’s actions and its decrease
                    in profits in 2008. The company claim for loss of profits, amounting to
                    $123,289.00, is thus dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As there was no proof of the actual loss
                    sustained by the company as a result of Mr Siebke’s breaches of his
                    employment contract, I award the company nominal damages of
                $1,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The company also applied for an injunction
                    that Mr Siebke be restrained from using or disclosing to third parties
                    “confidential information/documents and/or trade secrets of [its]
                    business or any part thereof which were obtained by [him] while in [its]
                    employment, including [its] Customers List”. I hold that the company is
                    entitled to this injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Finally, I order Mr Siebke to deliver to
                    the company all copies of the latter’s Customers List that are still in
                    his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mr Siebke’s suit against the company (Suit No 1020 of
                2009)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In his suit, Mr Siebke claimed that he
                    was entitled to be paid his salary, transport allowance and other benefits until
                    May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As I have found that the company had grounds
                    to summarily dismiss Mr Siebke in April 2009, he is only entitled to be
                    paid his benefits until the day he was summarily dismissed. The company’s
                    case is that it decided to dismiss him on 20 April 2009 and that
                    Mr Siebke was only told about this decision on 29 April 2009 because
                    he was then on “garden leave” and could not be contacted.
                    Mr Siebke said that he could have been contacted. I hold that the relevant
                    date of summary dismissal is 29 April 2009, the date when Mr Siebke
                    was told about the company’s decision to dispense with his services. As
                    such, Mr Siebke is entitled to be paid until this date. However, he must
                    refund to the company $2,500, the sum paid to him as a “travel
                    advance”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As for Mr Siebke’s claim for moving
                    costs amounting to $7,050, clause XVIII(4) of the employment contract provides
                    that such costs cannot be claimed by an employee who has been dismissed as a
                    result of his breach of the said contract. As for bonuses, these are
                    discretionary and considering Mr Siebke’s conduct and the fact that
                    he was on garden leave because the company did not approve of his attitude and
                    work performance, his claim for a bonus cannot be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Finally, Mr Siebke claimed $20,000 under
                    clause XV of the employment contract, which requires the company to pay him this
                    sum within 30 days of the termination of his employment as consideration for
                    complying with the covenants contained therein for one year after the
                    termination date. The covenants restrain Mr Siebke from soliciting the
                    company’s staff and clients, having business dealings with the
                    company’s clients, interfering with the goods and services of the company
                    and being employed, engaged in or interested in a business in Asia which
                    competes with the company’s business. The company’s case was that
                    the covenants are binding on Mr Siebke but he is not entitled to the
                    $20,000 because he breached the covenants. However, there was no evidence that
                    Mr Siebke breached the covenants after the termination of the employment
                    contract on 29 April 2009. As such, Mr Siebke is entitled to the
                    $20,000.</p>
