<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This matter involves a petition for criminal
                    revision filed by Tan Lai Kiat (“the Petitioner”), who is now 58
                    years old. On 20 April 2010, I heard his petition and allowed it.
                    Consequently, I varied the original sentences which the Subordinate Courts had
                    imposed on him in respect of two charges (referred to hereafter as,
                    respectively, “MAC 11701/1998” and
                    “MAC 11702/1998”). I now give the detailed reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       More than a decade ago, on 18 September
                    1998, officers from the Gambling Suppression Branch of the Criminal
                    Investigation Department conducted a raid on a property located in Tampines,
                    where illegal gambling activities were being conducted. The Petitioner was
                    arrested during the raid. Subsequent investigations revealed that the Petitioner
                    was involved in an illegal lottery scheme. The documents seized during the raid
                    contained records of stakes amounting to approximately $22,682. A second raid
                    was conducted at about the same time on a property at Surin Lane. A number of
                    exhibits relating to the Petitioner’s illegal lottery operation were
                    seized during the second raid, including records of stakes amounting to
                    $2,918.80.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On or about 28 January 1999, the Petitioner
                    pleaded guilty to and was convicted of MAC 11701/1998 and
                    MAC 11702/1998 (collectively, “the two CGHA charges”). Both
                    of these charges were brought under s 5(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the
                    CGHA”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev
                    Ed). The Petitioner also consented to two other charges (one under
                        s 4(1)(<em>a</em>) of the CGHA and one under
                        s 4(1)(<em>b</em>) of the CGHA) being taken into
                    consideration for the purposes of sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Section 5(a) of the CGHA, which sets out
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) the offence of
                    “assist[ing] in the carrying on of a public lottery”, provides for
                    the following punishment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Assisting in carrying on a public lottery,
                            etc</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5</b>.    Any person who —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    assists in the
                                carrying on of a public lottery;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine
                        of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 and shall also be
                        punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The same sentence was imposed on the Petitioner
                    in respect of each of the two CGHA charges, <em>ie</em>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The two sentences of nine months’ imprisonment were ordered to
                    run concurrently. This resulted in an aggregate sentence of nine months’
                    imprisonment (“the 9-month imprisonment sentence”) and a
                    cumulative fine of $140,000 (“the $140,000 fine”), with a total of
                    12 months’ imprisonment in default of payment of the fine (for
                    convenience, I will hereafter refer to imprisonment of this nature –
                    <em>ie</em>, imprisonment in default of payment of a fine
                    – as “default imprisonment”). Dividing the sum of $140,000
                    by 12 months, which I took to be 360 days (rather than 365 days) so as to work
                    with a round figure, it can be seen that each day of the Petitioner’s
                    12-month default imprisonment sentence was (loosely speaking)
                    “worth” approximately $389.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Petitioner commenced serving the 9-month
                    imprisonment sentence on 22 February 1999. As a result of a remission of
                    one third of that sentence for good conduct, he completed serving the sentence
                    on 22 August 1999. In other words, the 9-month imprisonment sentence has
                    been fully served, and it is not an issue in this petition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As the Petitioner could not afford to pay the
                    $140,000 fine, he commenced serving his 12-month default imprisonment sentence
                    on 23 August 1999. At the time he started serving this default sentence, he
                    was informed by the Singapore Prison Service that his due date of discharge
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> this default sentence would be
                    22 April 2000. This date was derived on the basis that the Petitioner would
                    be entitled to a remission of one third of his 12-month default imprisonment
                    sentence for good conduct (see reg 113(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, Rg 2, 1990 Rev Ed)
                    (“the 1990 Prisons Regulations”), which was the revised edition in
                    force at the time the Petitioner commenced serving his default imprisonment
                    sentence).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After the Petitioner had served 124 days
                        (<em>ie</em>, approximately four months) of his
                    12-month default imprisonment sentence from 23 August 1999 to
                    24 December 1999, he requested Mdm Foo Tiew Jiak
                    (“Mdm Foo”), who currently shares the same address in Hougang
                    as him, to ascertain what I will term “the Outstanding Sum”
                    –
                    <em>ie</em>, the outstanding amount which the Petitioner
                    had to pay in respect of the $140,000 fine as at 24 December 1999 (after
                    taking into account the 124 days of default imprisonment already served) in
                    order to secure his immediate release from prison. According to the Petitioner,
                    he had all along been resigned to completing the balance of his 12-month default
                    imprisonment sentence if his family could not afford to pay the Outstanding Sum.
                    Mdm Foo in turn contacted the court clerk attached to Court 37 of the
                    Subordinate Courts (“the Court Clerk”) and ascertained by
                    telephone the quantum of the Outstanding Sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Later that same day, Mdm Foo and the
                    Petitioner’s daughter, Delphine Tan (“Delphine”), after
                    being informed of the amount due, proceeded to the Subordinate Courts to make
                    payment. Mdm Foo obtained a receipt dated 24 December 1999
                    (“the Receipt”) from the Court Clerk and was requested to return
                    with the Receipt after making payment at the Subordinate Courts’ payment
                    counter and getting the Receipt stamped. Upon payment of the sum of $44,306
                    (“the $44,306 payment”) by Mdm Foo, the Receipt was duly
                    stamped by the Subordinate Courts. The handwritten remarks on the Receipt
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Total fine: $140,000</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given 246 days [<em>sic</em>] rebate of $95694 at
                        $389 per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the word “therefore” in symbol] Fine: $44306</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The above handwritten remarks were in fact
                        <em>wrong</em> as the Petitioner had served only 124
                    days of his 12-month default imprisonment sentence as at 24 December 1999.
                    He should therefore have been given a rebate which was the monetary equivalent
                    of only 124 days of default imprisonment, <em>ie</em>, a
                    rebate of $48,236 (taking 124 multiplied by $389, which (as stated at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) was the approximate
                    “value” of each day of the Petitioner’s 12-month default
                    imprisonment sentence). The Outstanding Sum was thus $91,764 ($140,000 minus
                    $48,236), and not merely $44,306. This in turn meant that, after deducting
                    $44,306 from $91,764, there was in reality still a balance of $47,458
                    (“the $47,458 balance”) to be paid in respect of the $140,000
                    fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     When Mdm Foo returned to Court 37 of
                    the Subordinate Courts with the Receipt after getting it stamped, she saw
                    Delphine conversing with the Court Clerk. She cannot now remember precisely what
                    was discussed between Delphine and the Court Clerk. Nevertheless, both
                    Mdm Foo and Delphine are adamant that they were not at any point in time on
                    24 December 1999 informed that there was any amount still outstanding
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the $140,000 fine. Mdm Foo left
                    the Subordinate Courts with Delphine that day believing that the $44,306 payment
                    constituted full payment of the Outstanding Sum and sufficed to fully discharge
                    the Petitioner’s legal obligation in respect of the $140,000
                fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Later that day, an Order to Release a Prisoner
                    (“OTR”) numbered 10142 (“OTR No 10142”), which
                    was prepared by the Court Clerk and signed by a district judge (“the
                    District Judge”), was issued. It directed the Superintendent of Prisons
                    to release the Petitioner. At the bottom of this OTR was an annotation
                    (“the OTR No 10142 annotation”), the material part of which
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Paid $<b><u>44306</u></b> vide Receipt No <b><u>288681</u></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dated <b><u>24.12.99</u></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given <b><u>246</u></b> days [<em>sic</em>] rebate of $<b><u>95694</u></b> at
                            $<b><u>389</u></b> per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining in original; handwritten text in original in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The handwritten figures “44306”, “246” and
                    “95694” on this annotation were wrong for the same reason that the
                    handwritten remarks on the Receipt were wrong (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). Furthermore, this annotation was signed by the
                    Court Clerk alone. The District Judge did not sign against it, so it is unclear
                    whether she was aware of it when she signed OTR No 10142.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Oddly, an OTR numbered 10144 (“OTR
                    No 10144”), which likewise directed the Petitioner’s release
                    from prison and which bore the same date as OTR No 10142 (<em>ie</em>, 24 December 1999), was also issued. It has not
                    been made clear when OTR No 10144 was issued even though it was dated
                    24 December 1999. As in the case of OTR No 10142, OTR No 10144
                    was prepared by the Court Clerk and signed by the District Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     OTR No 10144 contained the following
                    handwritten note, which was signed by the Court Clerk:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After rebate, total amt of fine: $<font style="color:blue;"><del>91764</del></font> 92542</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Paid: $44306</p>

                        until balance is paid.</p>

                    the annotation at the bottom of OTR No 10144 (“the OTR No 10144
                    annotation”) or the handwritten note in that OTR. It is thus similarly
                    unclear whether the District Judge was aware of the presence of these two items
                    when she signed OTR No 10144.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At the hearing before me, the deputy public
                    prosecutor (“the DPP”) was unable to clarify what led to the
                    issuance of OTR No 10144. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to infer that
                    this OTR was issued in a misguided effort to rectify the error in the
                    Outstanding Sum as stated in OTR No 10142. It is also likely that OTR
                    No 10144 was issued only after the contents of OTR No 10142 had
                    already been communicated to the Superintendent of Prisons; if not, OTR
                    No 10142 could have been corrected without any attempt to supersede it by
                    issuing OTR No 10144.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Petitioner was duly released from prison
                    on 24 December 1999. It is now common ground that he was not personally
                    informed then that there was any balance of the $140,000 fine still outstanding
                    (in actual fact, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above,
                    the $47,458 balance was still outstanding as at 24 December 1999 after
                    taking into account the $44,306 payment made by Mdm Foo), or that a court
                    order had been made directing that the balance of the $140,000 fine (<em>ie</em>, the $47,458 balance) be paid by way of monthly
                    instalments (<em>cf</em> the contents of the letter dated
                    7 March 2000 from the Subordinate Courts (“the Instalment
                    Letter”) as reproduced at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    below). At the hearing before me, the Petitioner vigorously maintained that he
                    had all along believed that the $44,306 payment was sufficient to secure the
                    full discharge of his legal obligation <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the $140,000 fine. He unequivocally asserted that he would not have asked
                    Mdm Foo to make the $44,306 payment merely to reduce his 12-month default
                    imprisonment sentence by less than one third (taking the sum of $44,306 divided
                    by $389, the $44,306 payment covered only about 113 days of the
                    Petitioner’s default imprisonment term).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The DPP accepted at the hearing of this
                    petition that there had been a miscalculation of the Outstanding Sum on the part
                    of the Subordinate Courts: while the Petitioner had served only 124 days of his
                    12-month default imprisonment sentence as at 24 December 1999, both the
                    Receipt and OTR No 10142 stated that the rebate given was the monetary
                    equivalent of 246 days of default imprisonment. On the basis of that erroneous
                    calculation, the Petitioner was deemed to have discharged the $140,000 fine in
                    full. In reality, the correct rebate at that point of time should have been the
                    monetary equivalent of only 124 days of default imprisonment, <em>ie</em>, the sum of $48,236 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 7 March 2000, the Subordinate Courts
                    sent the Instalment Letter (as defined at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above) to the Petitioner. (It should be noted that the
                    Petitioner confirmed in his petition that he did receive this letter (<em>cf</em> the uncertainty as to whether he received the letters
                    of advice mentioned at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> below).) The Instalment Letter was not signed
                    by either a district judge or some other judicial officer of the Subordinate
                    Courts. Instead, it was signed by the Court Clerk, <em>ie</em>, the same clerk who had been involved in the earlier error
                    concerning the rebate to be given to the Petitioner and the quantum of the
                    Outstanding Sum (“the Error”). The Instalment Letter asserted that
                    Delphine had, on 24 December 1999, made an application to pay the $47,458
                    balance by way of instalments of $4,000 per month, and that “<em>the Court ha[d] granted</em>” [emphasis added] this
                    application. The material portions of the letter read as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As can be seen from the above quotation, the
                    Instalment Letter omitted to mention the number of days of rebate given. This is
                    curious because both the Receipt and the two OTRs prepared by the Court Clerk on
                    24 December 1999 (<em>ie</em>, OTR No 10142 and
                    OTR No 10144) mentioned this. It is also pertinent to note that, <em>contrary</em> to what was represented in the Instalment
                    Letter (a point which the DPP acknowledged at the hearing before this court),
                    there was <em>no order of court dated 24 December
                        1999</em> stipulating that part of the $140,000 fine was still
                    outstanding and that the outstanding amount (<em>viz</em>,
                    the $47,458 balance) was to be paid in instalments. Further, it bears mention
                    that no attempt was made by the Subordinate Courts to expressly draw the
                    attention of the Superintendent of Prisons to this alleged instalment scheme
                    prior to the Petitioner’s release.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Petitioner emphatically denied that either
                    Mdm Foo or Delphine had made an application for instalment payment of any
                    balance still outstanding in respect of the $140,000 fine as at 24 December
                    1999 (after taking into account the $44,306 payment made by Mdm Foo). I
                    pause to reiterate that there is no evidence to show that, when Mdm Foo
                    made the $44,306 payment, either she and/or Delphine knew that such payment was
                    not in full satisfaction of the true quantum of the Outstanding Sum, which was
                    $91,764 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). Further, there is
                    also no evidence to show that either of them made any application on the
                    Petitioner’s behalf to pay the balance of the Outstanding Sum (<em>ie</em>, the $47,458 balance) in instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Upon his release from prison, the Petitioner
                    resumed his former business of purchasing and importing sand from Southeast
                    Asian countries for reclamation works in Singapore. He continues to be in the
                    same line of business today.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Some three years after the Petitioner failed
                    to respond to the Instalment Letter, a warrant of arrest numbered WA-102708/2000
                    (“the Warrant of Arrest”) was issued against him on 11 July
                    2003 on the basis that he had failed to pay the first instalment of $4,000,
                    which had allegedly been due on 29 February 2000. The Warrant of Arrest was
                    eventually forwarded to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (“the WEU”)
                    sometime between 23 July 2003 and 30 July 2003, and was activated on
                    30 July 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The DPP contended that the first letter of
                    advice from the WEU was sent to the Petitioner on 4 August 2003. This
                    letter was not, however, produced in the course of the present proceedings. On
                    12 August 2003, the Petitioner’s sister allegedly informed the WEU
                    that the Petitioner was then overseas on business. The WEU advised the
                    Petitioner’s sister to inform the Petitioner to contact it soon. According
                    to the DPP, a year later, a second letter of advice was purportedly sent to the
                    Petitioner on 6 September 2004. This letter was likewise not
                    produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Similarly, although the DPP stated that
                    further letters of advice were sent to the Petitioner on, respectively,
                    27 October 2004, 3 February 2005, 8 March 2006, 27 April
                    2006, 13 March 2007 and 3 September 2008, these letters were not made
                    available. Further, the DPP could not confirm the address to which the various
                    letters of advice issued by the WEU to the Petitioner (collectively, “the
                    Letters of Advice”) were supposedly sent and whether all of these letters
                    were in fact delivered. In this regard, I note that the Petitioner’s
                    address changed from the address in Tampines stated in the Warrant of Arrest to
                    his present address in Hougang at some point in time. It also bears mention that
                    neither the correspondence between the Petitioner’s counsel on the one
                    hand and the Subordinate Courts and the Singapore Prison Service on the other
                    hand nor the Petitioner’s affidavit filed on 25 March 2010 made any
                    mention of the Letters of Advice. In short, there was no satisfactory evidence
                    that the Petitioner ever received those letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Petitioner was eventually arrested
                    pursuant to the Warrant of Arrest only on 21 October 2008. This, to his
                    great consternation, happened while he was at a police station making a police
                    report about a foreign worker in connection with a matter related to his
                    sand-importation business. I pause to note that the fact that the Petitioner was
                    arrested at a police station indicates that he was not making any effort to
                    evade the consequences of the Warrant of Arrest. The Petitioner was subsequently
                    released after putting up a personal bond for the sum of $1,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relief sought by the Petitioner</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In his petition, the Petitioner requested,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Warrant of Arrest be
                        quashed and that he be released unconditionally;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     that, taking into account all the
                        circumstances of the case, any balance of the $140,000 fine or any balance
                        of the 12-month default imprisonment sentence be reduced or varied in such
                        manner as this court saw fit; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     alternatively, if this court decided not to reduce or
                        vary the $140,000 fine or the 12-month default imprisonment sentence, that
                        the sum of $44,306 paid to the Subordinate Courts be refunded to him with
                        interest at such interest rate and for such period as this court deemed
                        fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DPP’s original position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At the outset of the proceedings, the DPP,
                    somewhat puzzlingly, contended that, despite the lapse of time since the Error
                    was made on 24 December 1999, no serious injustice would be occasioned if
                    the Petitioner’s default imprisonment sentence were not reduced. After
                    all, the DPP submitted, there had been no undue delay on the part of the WEU in
                    enforcing the Warrant of Arrest as assiduous efforts had been made to contact
                    the Petitioner. Any delay in enforcement had been contributed to by the
                    Petitioner, and he was now merely being called to fulfil “his <em>existing</em> penal obligations”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis added]. The DPP also insisted that, after the Petitioner was released
                    from prison on 24 December 1999, he subsequently learnt of the Error when
                    he received the Instalment Letter, but did not take any follow-up action.
                    Because of this, the DPP maintained, the Petitioner should not complain about
                    the delay in the enforcement of the Warrant of Arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I found the initial stance taken by the DPP
                    difficult to comprehend (see also <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>
                    below). The DPP’s focus should not have been on the Petitioner’s
                    failure to take steps to address the situation resulting from the Error, but,
                    rather, on the cause of this error. The right question to ask in the present
                    case was this: <em>had the Petitioner or those acting on his
                        behalf contributed in any way to the Error?</em> If neither the
                    Petitioner nor his representatives (<em>ie</em>,
                    Mdm Foo and Delphine) had a hand in that error, it would not be either
                    right or just to penalise the Petitioner for it, whether at an earlier point in
                    time or now. At the conclusion of the parties’ oral arguments, I invited
                    the DPP to reconsider his opposition to the petition, and indicated that I had
                    grave reservations about the reasonableness of his position. I also indicated
                    that I was prepared to adjourn the matter for instructions to be obtained, if
                    necessary. On hearing this, the DPP, to his credit, immediately indicated that
                    he was dropping all opposition to the petition and would instead support
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My assessment of the merits of the petition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In setting out my reasons for allowing the
                    present petition, I will first deal with the Petitioner’s inaction
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Instalment Letter and the
                    Letters of Advice, followed by the Petitioner’s alleged knowledge of the
                    Error. I will then go on to explain why, on the facts of this case, I found that
                    the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary power was justified. In the
                    process, I will also discuss the ambit of the statutory provisions on
                    remission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Irrelevance of the Petitioner’s inaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Before this court, the DPP placed great
                    emphasis on the Petitioner’s inaction in respect of the Instalment Letter
                    and the Letters of Advice. With respect, the DPP’s approach was misguided.
                    The Instalment Letter had no legal standing as there was, in the first place, no
                    court order directing that the $47,458 balance be paid by instalments. That
                    letter purported to set out a curial order when, in truth, there was no such
                    order. The Petitioner’s inaction <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    that letter is thus irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The DPP initially submitted that the Warrant
                    of Arrest was issued by the Subordinate Courts on 11 July 2003
                        “<em>as the Petitioner had failed to [make] his first
                        instalment payment</em> of $4,000 on 29 February 2000”
                    [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> However, since
                    there was, in the first place, <em>no order of court</em>
                    directing that such payment be made, it must follow that there was <em>no legal obligation</em> for the Petitioner to pay the
                    $47,458 balance by instalments. This in turn meant that the Warrant of Arrest,
                    which was issued on the basis of the Petitioner’s failure to pay the
                    instalment allegedly due on 29 February 2000, was entirely without legal
                    foundation or effect – it was, in short, a mere <em>brutum
                        fulmen</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Since the Warrant of Arrest was a nullity, the
                    Petitioner’s inaction in relation to the Letters of Advice (if those
                    letters were indeed received by the Petitioner) is entirely irrelevant. The
                    Petitioner had no legal obligation to submit to a nullity. Indeed, the DPP was
                    unable to explain how the Petitioner’s arrest on 21 October 2008
                    could ever have been justified in these circumstances. As an aside, what the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers should have done to regularise the situation
                    resulting from the Error was to make an application to set aside the two OTRs
                    dated 24 December 1999 which were issued in respect of the Petitioner
                        (<em>viz</em>, OTR No 10142 and OTR
                    No 10144). As such an application was not made, I need not comment further
                    on this point save to say that it is highly unlikely that this court would have
                    been favourably disposed towards such an application (if it had been made) for
                    all the reasons given in these grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Although the Warrant of Arrest was obviously a
                    patent nullity, I nevertheless made an order to quash it so as to ensure that
                    the Petitioner would not be inadvertently confronted at some future point in
                    time with an order of ostensible effect. The objective of a quashing order
                    (albeit in a different context) has been succinctly highlighted in Clive Lewis,
                        <em>Judicial Remedies in Public Law</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2009) at para 6-007 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of granting a quashing order is to establish invalidity and,
                        once established, to make it clear that the decision [which is the subject
                        matter of the quashing order] is devoid of legal effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I now address the crucial issue of the
                    Petitioner’s actual knowledge of the Error.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Petitioner know about the Error?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I found that the Petitioner had no actual
                    knowledge of the Error. He had sound reasons to believe, when he was released
                    from prison on 24 December 1999, that he had been accorded the benefit of a
                    one-third remission of his 12-month default imprisonment sentence and only had
                    to satisfy two thirds of that sentence (<em>ie</em>, a
                    period of eight months’ default imprisonment). Following from this, he
                    honestly believed that his release from prison on 24 December 1999 was
                    unconditional because (as he saw it) the $44,306 payment made by Mdm Foo
                    sufficed to settle in full his legal obligation <em>vis-à-vis</em> the $140,000 fine. These are my reasons for coming to
                    this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     First, the Petitioner stated that, at the
                    commencement of his 12-month default imprisonment sentence, he had been informed
                    by the Singapore Prison Service that his due date of discharge in respect of
                    that sentence, after taking into account remission for good conduct, would be
                    22 April 2000 (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above; in this
                    regard, <em>cf</em> the date stated in the Singapore Prison
                    Service’s letter dated 18 February 2010 (at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> below)). This was not disputed by the DPP. The standard
                    one-third remission granted for good conduct (see reg 113(1)(<em>a</em>) of the 1990 Prisons Regulations) would have reduced
                    the Petitioner’s 12-month default imprisonment sentence to eight months.
                    Since the Petitioner had served approximately four months of his default
                    imprisonment sentence from 23 August 1999 to 24 December 1999, he had
                    a reasonable expectation, as things stood on 24 December 1999, of having a
                    balance of about four months of default imprisonment left to serve. In this
                    regard, it is significant that the $44,306 payment made by Mdm Foo covered
                    approximately 113 days of default imprisonment (taking the sum of $44,306
                    divided by $389), which is just slightly less than four months. Viewed from this
                    perspective, it is understandable why the Petitioner thought that the 124 days
                    of default imprisonment which he had already served as at 24 December 1999,
                    coupled with the $44,306 payment, was sufficient to fully discharge his legal
                    obligation in respect of the $140,000 fine. He could not have been familiar with
                    the technical legal rules about fines, default imprisonment sentences and
                    remission (these will be discussed below at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>–<a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Second, there was no evidence to indicate that
                    the Petitioner had ever agreed or intended to procure the $44,306 payment on
                    condition that the balance of the Outstanding Sum (<em>ie</em>, the $47,458 balance) would be paid in instalments. It was
                    common ground that the Petitioner was not brought to the Subordinate Courts
                    prior to his release. Further, neither the Subordinate Courts’ records nor
                    the Singapore Prison Service’s records indicate that the Petitioner was
                    informed on 24 December 1999 that he was being released conditionally.
                    Indeed, crucially, the only document given to the Petitioner’s
                    representatives (<em>ie</em>, Mdm Foo and Delphine) on
                    that day was the Receipt (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).
                    This indicates that it was not brought to their attention at all then that the
                    $44,306 payment was, in truth, only part payment of the Outstanding Sum and that
                    a further $47,458 (<em>ie</em>, the $47,458 balance) still
                    had to be paid. As such, I accepted the contention by the Petitioner that he
                    would not have procured the $44,306 payment if he had known that it would not
                    have secured his immediate and unconditional release from prison, but would only
                    have relieved him of serving part of his 12-month default imprisonment
                    sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Third, contrary to the DPP’s assertion,
                    there was nothing in the Instalment Letter which
                        “specifically”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> pointed out that an
                    administrative error (<em>ie</em>, the Error, as defined at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above) had been made. That letter
                    merely contained a bare assertion that Delphine had made an application on
                    24 December 1999 to pay the $47,458 balance by way of instalments. On this
                    point, the DPP failed to adduce any court records or other evidence to show that
                    either Mdm Foo or Delphine had indeed made such an application. If an
                    application of that nature had indeed been made, was it made to the Court Clerk
                    or the District Judge (or some other officer of the Subordinate Courts), and who
                    granted it? The Subordinate Courts’ records are entirely silent on this.
                    While it would, of course, have been preferable if the Petitioner had, upon
                    receiving the Instalment Letter, immediately taken issue with the statement
                    therein that Delphine had applied to pay the $47,458 balance by instalments and
                    that the application had been granted, it is not altogether surprising that he
                    decided to ignore this statement on the basis that (as he saw it) it was not
                    correct and was thus of no consequence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The frame of mind of the Petitioner at the
                    time he received the Instalment Letter is now indirectly corroborated by a
                    letter dated 18 February 2010 from the Singapore Prison Service, which
                    states that, if there had been no payment at all of any part of the $140,000
                    fine, the Petitioner’s earliest date of release <em>vis-à-vis</em> the 12-month default imprisonment sentence would have
                    been 23 April 2000 (which is just one day later than the date originally
                    communicated to the Petitioner when he started serving that default imprisonment
                    sentence (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above)). This statement
                    presupposes that the Petitioner was entitled to be granted remission in respect
                    of his default imprisonment sentence. This raises an interesting legal point
                    that has not been discussed in any prior decision, <em>viz</em>: does remission apply to <em>default
                        imprisonment</em> sentences? For completeness, I will deal with this
                    issue now so as to put to rest any remaining doubts about the current legal
                    position on remission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether remission applies to default imprisonment sentences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The relevant provisions on remission of
                    imprisonment sentences are currently contained in the Prisons Regulations
                    (Cap 247, Rg 2, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the current Prisons

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It should be noted that, although it was the
                    1990 Prisons Regulations (and not the current Prisons Regulations) which applied
                    at the time the Petitioner served his 12-month default imprisonment sentence,
                    there is, for the purposes of these grounds of decision, no material difference
                    between the provisions on remission in the former (<em>viz</em>, regs 111A–119 of the 1990 Prisons Regulations)
                    and the corresponding provisions in the latter (<em>viz</em>, regs 116–124 of the current Prisons
                    Regulations). The analysis below of the provisions on remission in the current
                    Prisons Regulations is thus equally applicable to the corresponding provisions
                    in the 1990 Prisons Regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The question is whether the phrase “all
                    sentences of imprisonment” in reg 116 of the current Prisons
                    Regulations includes default imprisonment sentences. In my view, the answer is
                    “yes” in the light of reg 116 read with regs 117 and
                    118. This is because the current Prisons Regulations do not draw a distinction
                    between a term of imprisonment which is imposed by the court as the
                    “direct” (so to speak) sentence for an offence and a term of
                    imprisonment which is imposed by the court as an indirect means of enforcing the
                    “direct” sentence of a fine –
                    <em>ie</em>, it appears to be of no consequence whether the
                    offender is serving an imprisonment term as a “direct” or an
                    “indirect” punishment for his offence. One of the key objectives
                    of the current Prisons Regulations is “to [encourage] good conduct and
                    industry” (see reg 118(1) of the current Prisons Regulations) on the
                    part of offenders. From this perspective, it would be arbitrary and absurd to
                    deny remission to an offender (assuming he satisfies the requisite criteria for
                    being granted remission) on the tenuous basis that he was imprisoned for failing
                    to pay a fine, which was the “direct” punishment imposed on him by
                    the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     This view is fortified if the position of an
                    offender serving a default imprisonment sentence as the “indirect”
                    punishment for his offence is compared with that of an offender serving a
                    mandatory sentence of imprisonment as the “direct” punishment for
                    his offence. If remission does not apply to default imprisonment sentences, the
                    former will be worse off than the latter. Why, however, should that be the case?
                    Indeed, the view that remission should apply to default imprisonment sentences
                    becomes even more compelling when consideration is given to the phrase
                    “periods of imprisonment <em>of whatever
                    nature</em>” [emphasis added] in reg 117 of the current Prison
                    Regulations. Further, on a plain reading of reg 116, the phrase
                        “<em>all</em> sentences of imprisonment”
                    [emphasis added] would embrace default imprisonment sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     What I have said at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above
                    relates to the scenario where the offender serving the default imprisonment
                    sentence does not pay any part of the fine imposed on him at all. The position
                        (<em>vis-à-vis</em> whether or not remission is
                    available) is, however, quite different where the offender pays part of the fine
                        <em>in monetary form</em> and satisfies the rest of the
                    fine by serving the corresponding period of default imprisonment. This scenario
                    may take on one of two alternative factual permutations, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     the “pay later”
                        scenario, <em>ie</em>, the offender, <em>after</em> serving part of his default imprisonment sentence,
                        pays (in monetary form) the sum which corresponds to the remainder of his
                        default imprisonment sentence so that he can be released from prison
                        immediately (this scenario is analogous to that in the present case);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        “pay first” scenario, <em>ie</em>, the
                        offender, realising that he has insufficient funds to pay the entire fine in
                        monetary form, pays part of the fine in monetary form <em>and
                            then</em> “pays” the balance of the fine by serving
                        the requisite period of default imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The key
                    difference between these two scenarios is that, in the “pay later”
                    scenario, payment in monetary form of part of the fine is made <em>after</em> the offender has already served a portion of his
                    default imprisonment sentence, whereas, in the “pay first”
                    scenario, payment in monetary form of part of the fine is made <em>before</em> the offender begins serving his default
                    imprisonment sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In a “pay later” scenario, the
                    offender <em>is not</em> entitled to any remission of that
                    part of the fine which corresponds to the period of default imprisonment yet to
                    be served. For instance, if the offender, after serving a period of default
                    imprisonment which corresponds to 20% of the fine imposed on him, decides to pay
                    in monetary form the remaining 80% of the fine so that he can be released from
                    prison immediately, he must pay the sum which represents 80% of the fine
                        <em>without any discount</em>. This is implied from the
                    wording of reg 116 of the current Prisons Regulations, which refers to
                    remission of “sentences of <em>imprisonment</em>” [emphasis added] only, and not to remission of
                    any other kind of sentence such as a fine or caning –
                    <em>ie</em>, the wording of reg 116 indicates that
                    remission applies <em>only</em> to sentences of <em>imprisonment</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In contrast, in a “pay first”
                    scenario, the offender <em>is</em> entitled to be granted
                    remission when, after paying part of the fine in monetary form, he
                    “pays” the balance of the fine by serving the corresponding period
                    of default imprisonment. Varying the example given in the preceding paragraph,
                    if the offender <em>first</em> pays (in monetary form) 20%
                    of the fine imposed on him <em>and then</em>
                    “pays” the remaining 80% of the fine by serving a period of
                    default imprisonment which corresponds to that portion of the fine, he is
                    entitled to a one-third remission of the corresponding period of default
                    imprisonment (assuming he satisfies the criteria for remission). This is because
                    reg 119 of the current Prisons Regulations states that “[r]emission
                    of sentence …
                    <em>shall</em> be awarded <em>on the
                        admission of a prisoner</em>” [emphasis added]. This
                    regulation, given its wording, is wide enough to include an offender who is
                    admitted to prison to serve a period of default imprisonment as the
                    “indirect” punishment for his offence after first satisfying part
                    of his “direct” punishment (<em>viz</em>, a
                    fine) by paying in monetary form a portion of the fine imposed on
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     At first glance, the dichotomy between the
                    “pay later” scenario (where remission <em>is
                        not</em> applicable when calculating the amount to be paid (in
                    monetary form) in respect of the fine after taking into account the period of
                    default imprisonment already served) and the “pay first” scenario
                    (where remission <em>is</em> applicable when calculating
                    the period of default imprisonment which corresponds to the unpaid portion of
                    the fine) may appear to be unfair, but there is in fact a sound rationale for
                    it. Remission is a benefit which is conferred on an offender for good conduct
                    while serving a sentence of imprisonment, and it has to be <em>earned</em> (see, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    regs 120 and 123 of the current Prisons Regulations, which refer to the
                    earning of remission). In a “pay later” scenario (and taking, in
                    this regard, the example outlined at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>
                    above), the offender has served a period of default imprisonment which
                    corresponds to only 20% of the fine imposed on him. He has not served any part
                    of the period of default imprisonment which corresponds to the remaining 80% of
                    the fine, and thus, he would not have earned any remission in respect of that
                    period. It follows that, if he chooses to “serve” that period of
                    default imprisonment (<em>ie</em>, the period of default
                    imprisonment which corresponds to 80% of the fine imposed) by paying 80% of the
                    fine <em>in monetary form</em> instead, he is not entitled
                    to any discount on the quantum which represents 80% of the fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The High Court’s exercise of its revisionary power</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I now turn to my reasons for ruling that the
                    circumstances of this case warranted the exercise of the High Court’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The High Court’s revisionary power is
                    discretionary in nature and is to be exercised sparingly; not all errors by a
                    lower court should lead to a revision of that court’s decision. To warrant
                    the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary power, the threshold of
                    serious injustice must be met. This principle was stated by this court in
                        <em>Ang Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 929 (“<em>Ang Poh Chuan</em>”)
                    at [17] and subsequently affirmed in (<em>inter alia</em>)
                        <em>Yunani bin Abdul Hamid v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2008] 3 SLR(R) 383 (“<em>Yunani</em>”)
                    at [47] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The starting point in Singapore, according to Yong Pung
                        How CJ in <em>Bedico Ma Teresa Bebango v PP</em>
                        [2002] 1 SLR(R) 122, is that the High Court’s power of revision
                        is to be exercised “sparingly” (at [8]), <em>viz</em>, not all errors by a lower court should lead to a
                        revision of that court’s decision. The threshold requirement,
                        according to Yong CJ, is that of “serious injustice” (at
                        [8]). This proposition was earlier stated in <em>Ang Poh
                            Chuan</em> … at [17] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… [V]arious phrases may be used to identify the circumstances

                            they all share the common denominator that there must be some <em>serious injustice</em>. Of course there cannot be a
                            precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for
                            that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide
                            discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend
                            largely on the particular facts. <em>But generally it
                                must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision
                                that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the

                        can be described as a kind of paternal or supervisory jurisdiction. In Tan
                        Yock Lin, <em>Criminal Procedure</em> (LexisNexis,
                        Looseleaf Ed, Issue 18, December 2007), vol 2, ch XIX,
                        para 3904, the object of this jurisdiction is described as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]he revisionary jurisdiction, which otherwise functions to all
                            intents and purposes as an appeal, is a paternal jurisdiction. The High
                            Court exercises the jurisdiction as the guardian of … criminal
                            justice, anxious to right all wrongs, regardless [of] whether [they are]
                            felt to be so by an aggrieved party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Why the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary power was
                warranted in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Returning to the facts of the present case,
                    the relevant question before me was whether the circumstances of the case
                    amounted to such serious injustice as to warrant the exercise of the High
                    Court’s revisionary power. I had no doubt that this question should be
                    answered in the affirmative. In my view, this case was a textbook case that
                    unequivocally called out for this court’s intervention in favour of the
                    Petitioner because of the following factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     First, the objective evidence strongly
                    suggested that the presence of the Error was discovered only recently by the
                    Subordinate Courts and the Singapore Prison Service – apparently, only
                    after the Petitioner filed this petition. Second, the significance of there
                    being <em>two purportedly original</em> OTRs (<em>ie</em>, OTR No 10142 and OTR No 10144) was not
                    appreciated when the Warrant of Arrest was issued. The mere fact that there were
                    two OTRs which directed the release of the same offender on the same date
                        (<em>viz</em>, 24 December 1999) and which related
                    to the same charges (<em>viz</em>, the two CGHA charges)
                    ought to have immediately given rise to a reasonable suspicion that something
                    was seriously amiss. Third, the patent irregularities readily apparent from a
                    comparison of the two OTRs (had they been examined) should have been a cause for
                    real concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), the OTR No 10144 annotation
                    contained the following handwritten amendments:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given <b><u><del>246</del></u></b><b>124</b> days [<em>sic</em>]
                        rebate of $<b><u><del>95694</del></u></b><b><u>48236</u></b> at $<b><u>389</u></b> per day. [underlining in original; handwritten text and
                        deletion marks in original in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In what appeared to be a feeble attempt to brush aside the reasons for
                    the deletion of the figures “246” and “95694”, there
                    was, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above, a
                    handwritten note in OTR No 10144, which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After rebate, total amt of fine: $<font style="color:blue;"><del>91764</del></font> 92542</p>

                        until balance is paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[deletion mark in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As I pointed out earlier (at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), this handwritten note was
                    signed by the Court Clerk, but it was not countersigned by the District Judge.
                    In addition, this handwritten note and the deletion of the figures
                    “246” and “95964” in the OTR No 10144
                    annotation did not appear in the other purportedly <em>original</em> OTR, <em>ie</em>, OTR
                    No 10142. As can be seen from <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above, the material portion of the OTR No 10142 annotation read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given <b><u>246</u></b> days [<em>sic</em>] rebate of $<b><u>95694</u></b> at
                            $<b><u>389</u></b> per day. [underlining in original;
                        handwritten text in original in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Both the OTR No 10142 annotation and the
                    OTR No 10144 annotation were signed by the Court Clerk alone. There is
                    nothing to indicate whether OTR No 10142 or OTR No 10144 was issued
                    first (although it was presumably the former which was issued first for the
                    reason stated at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above) and why two
                    purportedly original OTRs were issued. Further, while the Singapore Prison
                    Service received both OTRs, it is far from clear how and when it received them.
                    It is, however, obvious that the Singapore Prison Service must have received
                    only one of these OTRs (in all likelihood, OTR No 10142) at the time the
                    Petitioner was released.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Subsequently, the Instalment Letter was sent
                    to the Petitioner requesting him to pay “the balance fine of
                    $47458” [emphasis in original omitted] by instalments. As highlighted at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above, this letter was signed
                        <em>only</em> by the Court Clerk (as opposed to a
                    district judge or some other judicial officer of the Subordinate Courts). More
                    importantly, contrary to what was represented in that letter, there was in fact
                    no order of court granting permission for the $47,458 balance (which did indeed
                    remain outstanding after the $44,306 payment was made by Mdm Foo on
                    24 December 1999) to be paid by instalments. As mentioned earlier (see
                        <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above), the Subordinate Courts
                    could not adduce any documentation to show that an application was made by
                    either Mdm Foo or Delphine on 24 December 1999 to pay the $47,458
                    balance by instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I therefore determined that an error had been
                    made by the Subordinate Courts in calculating the Outstanding Sum. Crucially, I
                    was also satisfied that neither the Petitioner nor his representatives had
                    contributed to or caused this error. When the Petitioner was released from
                    prison on 24 December 1999, he believed – with good reason –
                    that the $44,306 payment made by Mdm Foo was all that was necessary to
                    settle the Outstanding Sum in full and, in turn, secure his immediate and
                    unconditional release.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Given these circumstances, the issue before me
                    became a simple one: <em>who should take responsibility for the
                        consequences of the Error, which was made by the Subordinate
                        Courts?</em> Undeniably, a mistake was made by the Subordinate Courts
                    in sanctioning the release of the Petitioner on 24 December 1999 after
                    Mdm Foo made the $44,306 payment. This is irrefutably established on an
                    objective assessment of the Receipt, the two purportedly original OTRs
                        (<em>ie</em>, OTR No 10142 and OTR No 10144)
                    and the Instalment Letter. The cumulative effect of the administrative mistakes
                    and/or misstatements made in these documents was not only grave, but also
                    profoundly prejudiced the Petitioner. In his desperation to seek redress, the
                    Petitioner has been literally driven from pillar to post at no small cost and at
                    great inconvenience. Not only was he wrongfully arrested on 21 October
                    2008, he has also been severely embarrassed and subjected to a prolonged period
                    of anxiety, with the sword of Damocles (in the form of a further period of
                    default imprisonment) hanging precariously above him. Further, he has incurred
                    legal costs which are not insubstantial. Viewed in this context, the DPP’s
                    original stance in opposing the present petition certainly did not ameliorate
                    the Petitioner’s unfortunate predicament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In short, I found this an exceptional case
                    that went far beyond the narrow considerations of an individual’s travails
                    with legal processes gone awry. This case has brought into focus an important
                    facet of the administration of criminal justice, which is this: if serious
                    administrative lapses by the courts are left unacknowledged or unchecked or
                    – even worse – concealed, confidence in the administration of
                    justice will be corroded and eventually eroded. Fortunately, giving the
                    prevailing judicial culture in Singapore, there does not seem to me to be any
                    danger of this situation materialising here. A culture of openness has long
                    since taken firm root in our courts, with mistakes being acknowledged openly
                    rather than being papered over.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As I indicated at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above, I held that the question of whether the
                    circumstances of the present case warranted the exercise of the High
                    Court’s revisionary power should be unhesitatingly answered in the
                    affirmative. The High Court is duty bound to rectify errors of this nature made
                    by the lower courts and remedy as best as it can any prejudice suffered by an
                    aggrieved party. In this regard, the earlier observations made in <em>Yunani</em> at [49] <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary power merit
                    reiteration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t … has to be kept in mind that Parliament has conferred this
                        power [<em>ie</em>, the power of revision] on the High
                        Court so as to ensure that no potential cases of serious injustice are left
                        without a meaningful remedy or real redress. A court would fail in its
                        constitutional duty to oversee the administration of criminal justice if it
                        remains impassive and unresponsive to what may objectively appear to be a
                        potentially serious miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Turning now to the specific order which I made
                    in respect of the fines imposed for the two CGHA charges, I was of the view that
                    to send the Petitioner back to prison for another 122 days (taking the sum of
                    $47,458 divided by $389) would plainly be to perpetrate a serious injustice on
                    him. He did no wrong in arranging for Mdm Foo to make the $44,306 payment
                    on 24 December 1999 so as to secure his immediate release from prison. He
                    had a legitimate basis to believe, when he was released, that he was leaving his
                    past mistakes behind him and could begin a new phase of his life. His unhappy
                    predicament was precipitated by the Error, for which he (and, likewise,
                    Mdm Foo and Delphine) bore no responsibility. In the circumstances, no
                    public interest would be served, nor would any sentencing objective be
                    satisfied, by sending the Petitioner back to prison to serve the period of
                    default imprisonment which corresponds to the $47,458 balance. This is why, as
                    indicated at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above, I found the
                    DPP’s initial stance in opposing the present petition difficult to
                    comprehend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I therefore exercised the High Court’s
                    revisionary power and varied the fines imposed on the Petitioner in respect of
                    the two CGHA charges as follows:</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/>
<p class="Judg-1">As a result, the aggregate fine imposed on the Petitioner for the two
                    CGHA charges was reduced from $140,000 to $92,542. In making this order, my
                    reasoning was as follows: the Petitioner served 124 days of default
                    imprisonment, which was (loosely speaking) “worth” $48,236 (taking
                    124 multiplied by $389). Payment of $44,306 was also made on his behalf. This
                    meant that the Petitioner effectively “paid” a total of $92,542
                    ($48,236 plus $44,306). I thus reduced the aggregate fine for the two CGHA
                    charges to $92,542 (which translated into a fine of $46,271 for each charge),
                    such that the Petitioner would have effectively discharged in full his legal
                    obligation <em>vis-à-vis</em> the aggregate fine imposed
                    for these two charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Petitioner’s request for a refund of the $44,306
                payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Given that I allowed this petition and varied
                    the aggregate fine payable by the Petitioner as described in the preceding
                    paragraph, there was no need for me to deal with his alternative prayer for the
                    sum of $44,306 to be refunded in the event that this court did not vary the
                    $140,000 fine or reduce the 12-month default imprisonment sentence (see
                    sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above). I will
                    nevertheless address the issue of refunding paid-up fines so as to address any
                    existing doubts on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     There is no statutory provision which confers
                    on the court the power to order a refund of fines which have been paid. Neither
                    s 224 of the CPC, which sets out the provisions relating to fines, nor the
                    provisions on criminal revision in the CPC provide for such a power.
                    Furthermore, a refund of fines already paid goes against the core rationale of
                    default imprisonment sentences. As alluded to earlier (at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above), a default imprisonment sentence is,
                    in effect, an indirect means of enforcing the “direct” punishment
                        (<em>ie</em>, the fine) imposed by the court on an
                    offender. Once part of the fine is paid, the corresponding portion of the
                    offender’s default imprisonment sentence (<em>viz</em>, “the ‘paid-up’ portion of the default
                    imprisonment sentence”) is effectively served and no longer exists. This
                    is clear from s 224(<em>e</em>) of the CPC, which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Provisions as to sentence of fine</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>224</b>.    Where any fine is imposed under the
                            authority of any law for the time being in force then, in the absence of
                            any express provision relating to the fine in such law, the following
                            provisions shall apply:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>e</em>)    the imprisonment
                                which is imposed in default of payment of a fine shall <em>terminate whenever that fine is either paid</em>
                                or levied by process of law …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Once the “paid-up” portion of the default imprisonment
                    sentence ceases to exist, the offender no longer has the option of serving that
                    part of the default imprisonment sentence in lieu of paying the corresponding
                    portion of the fine (which portion has in fact already been paid by the
                    offender). That portion of the fine cannot, therefore, be refunded to the
                    offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the present case, a misguided attempt to
                    remedy the Error (on the quiet, so it appears) led to a series of unfortunate
                    events with grave consequences for the Petitioner. If the Error had been
                    acknowledged promptly and openly from the beginning, the Petitioner would not
                    have had to wait for more than ten years before that error was remedied. I
                    should, however, emphasise that I have not made any conclusive findings on the
                    motives or reasons behind the various acts (and/or omissions) leading to and
                    resulting from the Error, nor have I pinned responsibility for this unfortunate
                    sequence of events on any one single individual. A more robust system of checks
                    and balances, which I believe is now in place, would have ensured that matters
                    were not allowed to proceed as far as they eventually did. I must add that many
                    problematic questions remain unanswered because of the limited ambit of the
                    evidence presented to me. For the purposes of ruling on this petition, I drew
                    only what I considered to be permissible inferences from the context and the
                    evidence placed before me, and I drew such inferences only to the extent
                    necessary for me to decide the issues pertaining to this case. As inquiries to
                    ascertain the truth of what else might have occurred are currently afoot, more
                    facts may emerge in due course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I should add that the unfortunate events which
                    occurred in this case highlight the importance of having in place a systemised
                    and transparent process for calculating the period of remission which an
                    offender is entitled to. This is particularly important where default
                    imprisonment sentences are concerned, not least because of the dichotomy between
                    the “pay later” scenario and the “pay first”
                    scenario outlined at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>–<a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above. In cases involving default
                    imprisonment sentences, it is necessary for there to be clear communication
                    between the Subordinate Courts and the Singapore Prison Service as to:
                    (a) the period of remission which the offender is entitled to when serving
                    the period of default imprisonment that corresponds to the unpaid portion of the
                    fine (in a “pay first” scenario); and (b) the quantum of that
                    part of the fine which corresponds to the period of default imprisonment yet to
                    be served (in a “pay later” scenario).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     For the reasons given above, I allowed the
                    petition, quashed the Warrant of Arrest and reduced the Petitioner’s
                    aggregate fine for the two CGHA charges to $92,542. Both parties were given
                    liberty to apply for consequential orders.</p>
