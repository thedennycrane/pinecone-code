<span lang="EN-GB">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 17 March 2000 the body of 35-year old Leong Fook Weng, clad only in his underwear, was found in a vacant plot of land at Kheam Hock Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He suffered multiple lacerations and abrasions to his face, arms and chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He also had a stab wound to his neck and one in his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The body was discovered at 10.30am, but the pathologist, Dr. Wee Keng Poh<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> estimated that death had occurred about 12 hours before his examination of the body at 1.50pm on 17 May.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Police investigation led to the arrest of two persons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One William Ho Kah Wei, was subsequently charged under s 202 of the Penal Code for wilful failure to provide information concerning the murder of Leong Fook Weng.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Robson Tay Teik Chai was charged with having a common intention with others to commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He pleaded guilty before me and was accordingly convicted as charged.</span>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The accused has a long list of previous conviction beginning from 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only one, in 1997, concerned violence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The others included being a member of a secret society, illegal money lending, cheating, and even reckless driving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In mitigation, his counsel Mr. Singa Retnam submitted that the accused had only returned from Bangkok a few hours before meeting See Chee Keong and the rest of the gang, and that he had no intention of killing Leong Fook Weng.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was not armed and was not aware at the crucial moment when Leong Fook Weng was stabbed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was certainly not the person who wielded the weapon, and in fact, believed that no weapon was being carried by any one of the gang because he had seen Lim Teck Hin throwing a chopper away when they were still at the River Valley Road coffeeshop.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The punishment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder is imprisonment for life, or imprisonment up to ten years and also fine or caning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Various cases were cited to me by the prosecution as well as defence counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sentences imposed in those cases ranged from six years imprisonment to ten years imprisonment and caning from six to 12 strokes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Naturally, no two cases are alike and therefore it will only be helpful to examine the more outstanding aspects of the offence and mitigating circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the present case, I can take into account the fact that the accused was not the one who wielded the knife, but his role in the long and brutal assault cannot be discounted and must weigh as factors against him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the circumstances, I am of the view that a sentence of nine years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane would be appropriate, and I, therefore, sentenced him accordingly.</span></p>
