The Claimant, however, never applied to vary paragraph 6 of PO 1. Instead, it waited until <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Award had been issued, and then complained that paragraph 6 of PO 1 had infringed its right to decide how it would be represented in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Claimant’s complaints</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Claimant complained of the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that because of paragraph 6 of PO 1, R was omitted from certain e-mail communications in the days leading up to the hearing up until shortly after the hearing.

Thus, for example, “[parties’] common law right to retain whomsoever (from the category of unauthorised persons) they desire or prefer for their legal services in arbitration proceedings in Singapore has … been taken away by the [Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1985 Rev Ed) (the “LPA”)]”: <span class="font-italic">Turner (East Asia) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Builders Federal (Hong Kong) Ltd and another</span> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 281 (“<span class="font-italic">Turner</span>”) at [34]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Since <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, the LPA has been amended and there is now no legislative impediment to parties in arbitrations in Singapore being represented by whomsoever they choose. This freedom of choice is reinforced in SIAC arbitrations by rule 23.1 of the SIAC Rules, which states: “Any party may be represented by legal practitioners or any other authorised representatives.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The respondent however argued that rule 23.1 requires parties to choose between two alternatives: <span class="font-italic">either</span> to be represented by legal practitioners, <span class="font-italic">or</span> to be represented by other authorised party representatives. It argued that the rule did not give parties the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">right</span> to a team comprising legal counsel <span class="font-italic">and</span> other authorised party representatives (although the Tribunal would have the <span class="font-italic">discretion</span> to allow this). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I did not agree with the respondent on this. In my view, rule 23.1 does allow parties to choose to be represented by <span class="font-italic">both</span> legal counsel <span class="font-italic">and</span> non-legally-qualified party representatives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Rule 23.1 uses the term “legal practitioners”. That would not include legally-trained persons in the employ of a party, such as in-house counsel, who would instead be “other authorised representatives” within rule 23.1. If (as the respondent contended) rule 23.1 required a party to choose between “legal practitioners” and “other authorised representatives” (but did not allow a party to choose both), an in-house team could still be assembled comprising legally-qualified and non-legally-qualified party representatives. The SIAC Rules thus do not force a choice between legally-qualified and non-legally-qualified party representatives. If the legally-qualified party representative happens to be a “legal practitioner”, it makes no sense to then exclude all other party representatives. The inclusion of rule 23.1 in the SIAC Rules was meant to promote free choice in this regard, not to restrict it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Claimant cited two commentaries by Gary B Born (“Born”) for the proposition that a party’s right to representation in international arbitral proceedings, by lawyers or others, is of fundamental importance: Gary B Born, “Legal Representatives and Professional Responsibility in International Arbitration” in <span class="font-italic">International Arbitration: Law and Practice</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2nd Ed, 2015) (“Born, IA”) ch 14.01 at p 267 and Gary B Born, “Legal Representation and Professional Conduct in International Arbitration” in <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“Born, ICA”) ch 21.01 at p 2833.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Born goes on to say that “[m]ost institutional rules recognize the parties’ rights of representation in the arbitral proceedings, either expressly or impliedly providing that a party is entitled to be represented by persons of its own choice”.

</div> Rule 18.1 of the LCIA Rules states that “[a]ny party may be represented by legal practitioners or any other representatives”. That phrase “legal practitioners or any other representatives” is identical to that found in rule 23.1 of the SIAC Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As such, rule 23.1 of the SIAC Rules would certainly be interpreted the same way by Born, who is also the President of the SIAC Court of Arbitration. The same interpretation is adopted in Choong, Mangan and Lingard, <span class="font-italic">A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration Rules</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2018) at paragraph 9.90: “The SIAC Rules, consistent with their hallmarks of party autonomy and procedural flexibility, provide that a party is free to choose its representatives, which can <span class="font-italic">include</span> persons not qualified as lawyers” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Giving rule 23.1 of the SIAC Rules the restrictive interpretation for which the respondent contends would also go against the policy of promoting Singapore as an arbitration centre. In explaining the amendment to the LPA prompted by the <span class="font-italic">Turner</span> ([12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>case, the Minister of Law referred to the importance of giving effect to the parties’ freedom of representation to Singapore’s position as an international arbitral centre: Born, IA, ch 14.01 at p 269; see also <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(15 June 2004) vol 78 at cols 96–97 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Law). A restrictive interpretation to rule 23.1 would instead go against the promotion of SIAC arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The right to representation is, however, not an absolute one. As Born notes:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Questions would arise as to the limits of a party’s entitlement to legal counsel of its choice if its preferred counsel were supposedly unable to attend a hearing, or to complete written submissions, in accordance with the parties’ or tribunal’s procedural timetable. Although tribunals often exhibit a degree of flexibility in such circumstances, there are cases where arbitrators will order a hearing to proceed, or a submission to be filed, even if a party’s counsel claims to be unavailable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">These sorts of orders do not, absent extraordinary circumstances, deny a party its right to select counsel of its choice. As one authority reasoned:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“if a party’s first choice is not available, his second choice will still be ‘a lawyer or other person chosen by him’. The right to be represented exists but must not be abused.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nonetheless, if a party is arbitrarily subject to procedural requirements that effectively deny it the counsel of its preference, or that exclude counsel on the basis of discrimination with regard to nationality, religion, or place of qualification, the guarantee of freedom to select legal representation is implicated. Moreover, if an order is made late in the arbitral proceedings, scheduling a hearing (or other significant event in the arbitration) at a time when counsel that is familiar with the case cannot appear, a party’s right to be heard and freedom of legal representation is also implicated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Born also observes that “[a]s a practical matter, the parties’ right to select representatives of their own choosing is of fundamental significance: the quality, loyalty and vigor of a party’s representatives can have substantial consequences for the party’s opportunity to present its case, for the outcome of the arbitral process and for the parties’ perceptions regarding the fairness and legitimacy of the process”.

</div> That being said, a party’s right to present its case is not an absolute one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Natural justice requires that parties be given a “fair”, “reasonable” opportunity to be heard (on what “fairness” entails, see <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>”) at [43] and <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another</span> [2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">CMNC</span>”) at [1]; as for the meaning of “reasonable”, see <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [55], <span class="font-italic">ADG</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v ADI and another matter</span> [2014] 3 SLR 481 (“<span class="font-italic">ADG</span>”) at [112]<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Triulzi Cesare SRL v Xin</span><span class="font-italic">yi Group (Glass) Co Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 114 (“<span class="font-italic">Triulzi</span>”) at [124]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">ADG</span>, the court stated at [112]: “… the right to be heard too is not unqualified: it is subject to the standard of reasonableness. By the parties’ agreement, therefore, the Tribunal is entitled to make procedural decisions which give each party a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> right to present its case, after weighing the competing considerations. This includes the need to ensure the fair expeditious, economical and final determination of the dispute …” [emphasis in original] (see also <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span> at [97] and [104(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The phrase “fair[,] expeditious, economical and final” as used in <span class="font-italic">ADG</span> comes from rule 19.1 of the SIAC Rules, which states as follows: “The Tribunal shall conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, after consulting with the parties, to ensure the fair, expeditious, economical and final resolution of the dispute.” There is also a similar expression in rule 41.2 of the SIAC Rules, which deals with residual powers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">ADG </span>at [103], the court held that the right to be heard “… is not an unqualified right to present any and all submissions and evidence at any time of a party’s choosing no matter what the consequences”. Thus, in the example cited in Born, ICA at [22] above, should a tribunal proceed with a hearing in the absence of a party’s first choice of counsel, the right to representation will not necessarily be infringed, nor will there necessarily be a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Where a party complains that his right to choose his representation has been infringed, it is relevant to ask whether he was thereby deprived of a fair or reasonable opportunity to present his case, or, in the language of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law, whether he was “unable to present his case”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Rule 23.1 of the SIAC Rules cannot be read in isolation from the rest of the SIAC Rules, or from what the arbitral process entails. The Claimant argued that if it could not proceed with its intended co-counsel arrangement, that <span class="font-italic">per se</span> would mean “the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties” within Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law, thereby justifying the Award being set aside – <span class="font-italic">even if</span> it had been given a fair and reasonable opportunity to present its case, it was not unable to present its case, and it did not suffer any prejudice. This would however elevate the right to party representation <span class="font-italic">above</span> the right to be heard (the latter being an aspect of natural justice), which did not seem right. I will return to this when I discuss the facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The complaint about party representation was said to involve a breach of agreed procedure, and not just the denial of the right to a fair hearing. But the complaint was still about the Tribunal’s conduct of the proceedings. As such, the principles set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [98]–[105] (in the context of the right to a fair hearing) remain relevant. I highlight in particular [104(c)] and [104(d)]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) What constitutes a ‘full opportunity’ is a contextual inquiry that can only be meaningfully answered within the specific context of the particular facts and circumstances of each case. The overarching inquiry is whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was fair, and the proper approach a court should take is to ask itself if what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) In undertaking this exercise, the court must put itself in the shoes of the tribunal. This means that: (i) the tribunal’s decisions can only be assessed by reference to what was known to the tribunal at the time, and it follows from this that the alleged breach of natural justice must have been brought to the attention of the tribunal at the material time; and (ii) the court will accord a margin of deference to the tribunal in matters of procedure and will not intervene simply because it might have done things differently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Like the present case, <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) was one where the parties had agreed to an expedited arbitration. The court observed (at [143]) that this was a relevant consideration in determining what natural justice demands:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is trite that what natural justice demands turns in part on the parties’ particular agreement to arbitrate … Of course, parties do not relinquish their due process rights simply by dint of agreeing to an expedited arbitration. That said, the fact that parties agreed to an expedited arbitration will inevitably have a bearing on the expectations that parties may reasonably and fairly have as to the extent of the procedural accommodation that may be afforded to them. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Where (as in this case) the complaint is about a tribunal’s case management powers, one must bear in mind that parties who “choose to arbitrate in Singapore or under the SIAC Rules therefore and thereby agree to give the Tribunal a wide and flexible discretion to determine its own procedures and processes and to receive and evaluate competing evidence and arguments in order to arrive at its determination”: <span class="font-italic">ADG</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [111], citing <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [60]. The court’s supervisory role over a tribunal’s exercise of case management powers will be “exercised with a light hand”: <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Ting Kang Chung and another </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 287 at [42].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 With those principles in mind, I turn to examine the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Correspondence about communications with the Tribunal, and about R’s role at the hearing </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Protocol for communications with the Tribunal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Claimant complained that its party representative R was omitted from certain e-mails after the Claimant engaged legal counsel T for the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 On this, paragraph 6 of PO 1 stated: “Where a Party is represented by Counsel, communications with the Tribunal shall be with Counsel instead of the Party’s representatives.” The Claimant did not take issue with paragraph 6 when PO 1 was circulated in draft, and never applied to vary that paragraph (which the Claimant could have done pursuant to paragraph 72 of PO 1). Nor did the Claimant complain, at the time when PO 1 was issued or when R was omitted from some e-mails, that its rights had been infringed. It first complained about this only <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Award had been issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It is quite understandable that a tribunal may not wish to have multiple lines of communication with a single party: multiple representatives may send mixed signals to the tribunal, placing the tribunal in the difficult situation of having to assess what <span class="font-italic">the party</span> wished to say. Having the arbitration expedited (as in this case) heightens the need for clear lines of communication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Claimant’s complaint about paragraph 6 of PO 1 is ironic, for its own notice of arbitration (submitted by its then legal counsel (“H”)) stated this at paragraph 2.3: “The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by [H], to whom all communications for the purposes of this arbitration should be made.”

In any case, there was no agreed communications protocol in the first place.

In the same e-mail, T asked that all correspondence and notices be addressed to him, but that those still be copied to the Claimant’s two party representatives named in PO 1 (one of whom was R).

</div> That was also the last time T signed off as “Counsel for the Claimant”.

T did not copy R in his replies to those e-mails. Paragraph 6 of PO 1 did not apply to these communications as they were between counsel and not with the Tribunal.

Instead, the response from T (on 29 January 2019) to the Tribunal’s request to follow paragraph 6 of PO 1 merely stated that “[t]he Claimant takes note of [the Tribunal’s] directions and [the Tribunal’s] comments”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> There is no merit in this. R had already stated in her letter of 4 February 2019 that “[t]he Claimant intends that [R] shall participate <span class="font-italic">during the Claimant’s Opening Statement at the Hearing</span>” [emphasis added]. Moreover, the Tribunal never expressed any “understanding” that R would have no involvement at all; to the contrary, the Tribunal invited the Claimant “to clarify the role that [R] will have at the Hearing and in particular, if [R] is looking to address the Tribunal and if so, to what extent and in respect of which issue”. If the Claimant (and R in particular) had wanted R to play a more expansive “co-counsel” role, beyond what R herself had expressed in her letter of 4 February 2019, this was the time to say so. Instead, T continued in the same vein as R’s letter of 4 February 2019, expressing that R would participate during the Claimant’s opening statement at the hearing, and <span class="font-italic">solely</span> in that aspect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 On 8 February 2019, the Tribunal thanked T for the clarification, and stated that the Tribunal would accede to the Claimant’s request to have [R] address the Tribunal in part during the opening of the Claimant’s case. In so doing, the Tribunal was simply acceding to the role which the Claimant itself had said it wanted R to play. Although T’s e-mail of 1 February 2019 had conveyed that R “continues to act as counsel, in addition to [T]”, that was then qualified in the subsequent communications from T and from R herself. By the time of the Tribunal’s e-mail of 8 February 2019, all the Claimant was asking for was that R address the Tribunal during the Claimant’s opening statement. The respondent agreed to this, as did the Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [165] are directly on point:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the inevitable consequence of this final submission that [CMNC’s counsel] made to us … is that … the prospects of a fair arbitration had been irretrievably lost as a result of the Tribunal’s mismanagement of its procedure (<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or alternatively, and at the very least, that the scheduled evidentiary hearings could not proceed</span>). In his words, he said the arbitration process had become “dysfunctional”. Yet, in <span class="font-italic">none</span> of these communications did CMNC make <span class="font-italic">that point</span>. On the contrary, CMNC had, by its continued engagement as a party in the arbitration, consistently expressed its intention to forge ahead with the main evidentiary hearing and to see the arbitration through to its conclusion at the scheduled time right up to the end of June 2015, even as matters came to a head …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 At [170] of <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal went on to say:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, there is a principle to be drawn from this and it is this: if a party intends to contend that there has been a fatal failure in the process of the arbitration, then there <span class="font-italic">must</span> be fair intimation to the tribunal that the complaining party intends to take that point at the appropriate time if the tribunal insists on proceeding. This would ordinarily require that the complaining party, at the very least, seek to suspend the proceedings until the breach has been satisfactorily remedied (if indeed the breach is capable of remedy) so that the tribunal and the non-complaining party has the opportunity to consider the position. This must be so because if indeed there has been such a fatal failure against a party, then it cannot simply “reserve” its position until after the award and if the result turns out to be palatable to it, not pursue the point, or if it were otherwise to then take the point … If a party chooses to carry on in such circumstances, it does so at its own peril. The courts must not allow parties to hedge against an adverse result in the arbitration in this way.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the present case, the Claimant argued that it did the best it could in the circumstances: it was close to the hearing by the time the Claimant appointed T as counsel, and the only prudent way forward was to abide by the constraints.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 That, however, goes against the principle stated in <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) which is cited above at [68]: if the Claimant considered that there had been a fatal failure in the process of the arbitration that had caused it prejudice, it <span class="font-italic">had to</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">complain</span>. It <span class="font-italic">could not</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>simply press on with the hearing; there was no “prudent way forward”. Moreover, the Claimant itself had, in its correspondence with the Tribunal, defined the role that R would play at the hearing. The Tribunal had simply agreed to what the Claimant wanted in that regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I now return to the controversy about communications with the Tribunal. Between the Tribunal’s e-mail of 7 February 2019 (in which it decided that paragraph 6 of PO 1 should be followed) and the hearing that commenced on 11 February 2019, there is only one e-mail in the entire train of e-mail correspondence that R was not copied on (that of 7 February 2019 wherein the Tribunal made no order on the Claimant’s request for documents, which was filed out of time).

</div> The late submission of the third Redfern schedule had nothing to do with R being omitted from e-mails. Indeed, R was not omitted from any e-mails until 29 January 2019, by which time it was already past the deadline for the submission of the third Redfern schedule.

On the one hand, R claimed that her exclusion from e-mails “informed the delay to [the Claimant’s] submission of the third Redfern schedule” and that “delays were caused … in respect of the filing of the Redfern schedule … because of [her] sporadically being dropped out of email distribution lists”.

Tribunals would be reduced to passive observers, until the time came for them to render their decision. That is not how arbitration works. As I noted above, the right to be heard is not unqualified. What the parties have is the right to a “fair” or “reasonable” opportunity to be heard. In determining whether this right has been infringed, the question the court should ask is whether what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done: <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [104(c)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The question is thus not whether <span class="font-italic">the Claimant</span> had its way.

I find that a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done what the Tribunal did, which was simply to provide feedback on the Claimant’s presentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 This conclusion is reinforced by what <span class="font-italic">the Claimant</span> did (or did not do). If the Claimant considered the Tribunal’s intervention to be some breach of its rights, it ought to have objected. R (or T) could have told the Tribunal that R wished to continue addressing the Tribunal on Exhibit C72 (even though she had indicated that she had finished her presentation on Exhibit C72 by saying, “that is my presentation”). T could have revisited this in his oral closing submissions on 13 February 2019. There were further opportunities to do likewise in the written submissions made after the hearing by T on 18 February 2019, and by R on 23 February 2019 and 11 March 2019. None of this was done, and, in my view, this is fatal to the Claimant’s complaint.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There was no breach of agreed procedure or breach of natural justice when the Tribunal declined R’s request to question a witness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Claimant’s other specific complaint about the hearing was that the Tribunal had said “No”, when R had asked to question one of the Claimant’s witnesses.

The Tribunal then declined R’s request to question the witness. This was in line with what had been represented, agreed, and decided earlier as to R’s speaking role at the hearing, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, solely to address the Tribunal during the Claimant’s opening statement. That decision crystallised after the respondent’s counsel had expressed concerns about R having a larger role in the hearing, given that she was involved in the events in issue, yet was not a witness (see [55] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Tribunal was not obliged to open a discussion on whether R should play a more expansive role, particularly when the hearing was already underway, a witness was on the stand, there were just three days for the hearing, and it was an expedited arbitration. The Tribunal could, and did, simply hold the Claimant to what it had represented regarding R’s speaking role at the hearing. The Tribunal’s conduct in this regard plainly fell within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As with the earlier complaint about the Tribunal’s intervention, there was also no protest from the Claimant on this point. The Claimant could have asked the Tribunal to reconsider its decision not to allow R to question the witness. Alternatively, R could have instructed T to ask the question that she had wanted to raise; T could have sought time to take instructions from R on that; or R herself could have asked for time to speak with T. None of this happened. Instead, T proceeded to say that the Claimant had no further questions for the witness. When T said so, the Tribunal was not obliged to prompt him to reconsider asking the question which R had wanted to ask. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Notably, that witness did not file any affidavit in these proceedings. It is not possible to know what the witness’ answer would have been even if R had asked the question. Even if asked, the question might have led nowhere. It was for the Claimant to show that the Tribunal was denied material that could reasonably have made a difference to the Tribunal’s deliberations (see [94] below), and the Claimant failed to show that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 My view on this is reinforced by the fact that with some subsequent witnesses, T consulted R before ending his questioning of them. The transcripts show that in one instance, after consulting with R, T sought and obtained leave for further re-examination of the witness (which went beyond the sequence of questioning that had been contemplated). In another instance, T again consulted with R and posed a further question to the witness. In a third instance, R consulted with T who then said he had no further questions. Strikingly, on the occasion complained of, it appears that T and R just did not confer before T said, “Sir, we have no more questions.” The question R wanted to ask went unasked, but any blame for that lies squarely on the Claimant itself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether there are grounds to set aside the Award, in whole or in part</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Party representation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As the foregoing analysis shows, in respect of the above complaints, there was no breach of agreed procedure, and the Tribunal’s conduct fell within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done. The Claimant was not deprived of a fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard, and it was certainly not unable to present its case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Moreover, the matters complained of did not result in any prejudice to the Claimant. It is true that where the ground for setting aside an award is a breach of agreed procedure under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law, prejudice is not a legal requirement, but it remains a relevant consideration: see <span class="font-italic">Triulzi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [64], <span class="font-italic">Coal &amp; Oil Co LLC v GHCL Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 3 SLR 154 at [51] and <span class="font-italic">AQZ v ARA</span> [2015] 2 SLR 972 at [136]. Prejudice <span class="font-italic">is</span> a legal requirement if breach of natural justice is alleged as the grounds for setting aside an award. Section 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA reads: “a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced”: see also <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [29] and <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [86]. It was for the Claimant to show that as a result of the alleged breaches, the Tribunal was “denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to [its] deliberations” and that material withheld from the Tribunal as a result “<span class="font-italic">could reasonably</span> have made a difference” to the outcome [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 at [54], cited in <span class="font-italic">AMZ v AXX</span> [2016] 1 SLR 549 at [103]. That was not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It is, in my view, fanciful and entirely speculative for the Claimant to say that if R had participated more extensively as co-counsel, if she had questioned witnesses, and if she had continued explaining Exhibit C72, that could reasonably have made a difference to the outcome. I have already addressed the point about R questioning witnesses above, and I will elaborate on Exhibit C72 below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The Claimant also complained that, in breach of natural justice, the Tribunal had failed to consider the Claimant’s FRP claim (the “FRP Claim”) <span class="font-italic">as pleaded</span>.

The Claimant’s counsel candidly admitted that there was no such provision. His case was not that there was any contractual provision giving the FRP Invoice a particular effect apart from the components in the invoice, such as to form a basis for the Claimant’s claim for the invoiced amount.

The Claimant did not take up that invitation. As such, the Claimant took its stand on the evidence that was before the court. Although I did not have the FRP Invoice before me, I had before me what was said about it – in the arbitration pleadings, transcripts, and submissions; as well as in the affidavits and submissions in this action. Having the FRP Invoice itself in evidence would not have changed my decision that there is no viable Invoice Claim, and that no Invoice Claim was ever put forward in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The Claimant relied on <span class="font-italic">Front Row</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd </span>[2010] SGHC 80 (at [46] and [53]), where the arbitrator had mistakenly thought that part of the respondent’s case had been abandoned and thus did not deal with that part; see also <span class="font-italic">AKN</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v ALC and others and other appeals </span>[2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”) at [45]–[46].

</div>
</div> Having noted that the Claimant was not withdrawing any of its claims, the Tribunal proceeded to deal with each of the Claimant’s claims in the Award and dismissed them all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, the Court of Appeal emphasised at [47] that there is “an important distinction between, on the one hand, an arbitral tribunal’s decision to reject an argument (whether implicitly or otherwise, whether rightly or wrongly, and whether or not as a result of its failure to comprehend the argument and so to appreciate its merits), and, on the other hand, the arbitral tribunal’s failure to even consider that argument. Only the latter amounts to a breach of natural justice; the former is an error of law, not a breach of natural justice.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Here, the Claimant had not put forward an Invoice Claim. If it had, the Tribunal had necessarily rejected it: the Tribunal noted that the Claimant had issued a FRP Invoice on 10 August 2012 for US$2,317,961, went on to find that the Claimant was not entitled to each component of the FRP Invoice/FRP, and dismissed all of the Claimant’s claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 At best, the Claimant’s complaint was that the Tribunal dismissed its claims because the Tribunal failed to comprehend its Invoice Claim and had therefore failed to appreciate its merits. That, however, would be a matter for an appeal. It would not be a basis to set aside the Award. As the court noted in <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> ([120] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46], an inference that the arbitrator had acted in breach of natural justice should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be drawn if the facts are also consistent with the arbitrator simply having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Here, the Award shows that the Tribunal applied itself (meticulously) to addressing the Claimant’s FRP Invoice/FRP claim. The Claimant acknowledged that the Tribunal had examined and rejected each component of the FRP Invoice/FRP, but argued that the Tribunal had failed to consider whether the Claimant was nevertheless entitled to be paid on the FRP Invoice. There is no merit in this. The Claimant was not entitled to be paid for anything in the FRP Invoice, and so it was not entitled to be paid on the invoice. Again, this is reminiscent of the Emperor’s New Clothes. Like the assertion that the clothes exist even though no threads could be seen, the Claimant asserted that the Invoice Claim exists even though there is nothing to its component claims. But there are no threads, and no clothes! </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><div class="font-weight-bold"><br/><br/></div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 For the above reasons, I dismiss the Claimant’s setting-aside application.
