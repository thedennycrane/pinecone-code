</div> The question is therefore whether this claim is unsustainable in either sense set out at [54] above. That in turn requires setting out the circumstances in which an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty arises. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">When an </span><span class="font-weight-bold">ad hoc</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> fiduciary duty </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">arises</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Boong Hua and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span>”), the Court of Appeal explained that there is no universal definition of a “fiduciary”<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [42]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... There is no universal definition for the term [“fiduciary”], though we note that there appears to be growing judicial support for the view that a fiduciary is “someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence” .... It has also been said that “[f]iduciary duties are obligations imposed by law as a reaction to particular circumstances of responsibility assumed by one person in respect of the conduct of the affairs of another” …. The concept of a fiduciary has also been described as one that “encaptures a situation where one person is in a relationship with another which gives rise to a legitimate expectation, which equity will recognise, that the fiduciary will not utilise his or her position in such a way which is adverse to the interests of the principal” …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the earlier case of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Suan and another and other appeals</span> [2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out three important principles of fiduciary law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, “the hallmark of a fiduciary obligation is that the fiduciary is to act in the interests of another person”:<span class="font-italic"> Tan Yok Koon</span> at [192]. The core liability that this entails is a single-minded duty of loyalty to that other person. As authority for this, the Court of Appeal cited the judgment of Millett LJ (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Mothew</span> [1998] Ch 1:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular manner in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. <span class="font-italic">The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. </span><span class="font-italic">The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary.</span> This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Second, the term “fiduciary” is not a premise but is instead a label applied to a person once the court concludes that that person owes an obligation of a fiduciary character to another: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [193]. To put it another way, a person “is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; instead, it is because he is subject to such obligations and rules that he is a fiduciary”: <span class="font-italic">Turf Club </span>at [42]. Thus, whether a person owes a fiduciary duty to another depends on the nature of his conduct in relation to that other person in the circumstances of the case and not purely on the category into which his broader relationship with that person falls (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> at [43]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While there are settled categories of fiduciary relationships – such as the relationship of a trustee-beneficiary, director-company, solicitor-client, between partners – it does not mean that all such relationships are invariably fiduciary relationships. In these relationships, there is a strong, but rebuttable, presumption that fiduciary duties are owed. Equally, the categories of fiduciary relationships are not closed or limited only to the settled categories. Fiduciary duties may be owed even if the relationship between the parties is not one of the settled categories, provided that the circumstances justify the imposition of such duties ... whether the parties are in a fiduciary relationship depends, <span class="font-italic">ultimately, on the nature of their relationship and is not simply a question of whether their relationship can be shoe-horned into one of the settled categories (</span><span class="font-italic">eg, a partnership) or into a non-settled category (eg, a joint venture or quasi-partnership).</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Third, a fiduciary duty is voluntarily undertaken. It arises as a legal consequence of the fiduciary’s voluntary conduct and is not imposed by law independently of the fiduciary’s intention to engage in that conduct. But, because the obligation is a legal consequence, it can arise even if the fiduciary was not subjectively willing to undertake the obligation or to accept that legal consequence when he engaged in that conduct: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [194]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> v American Express Bank Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 at [41], the Court of Appeal suggested <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that Wilson J (dissenting) in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">Frame v Smith</span> [1987] SCR 99 (“<span class="font-italic">Frame</span>”) had set out a helpful description of the three circumstances which will give rise to a fiduciary duty owed by one person (F) to another person (B): (a) F is entitled to exercise some discretion or power; (b) F is able unilaterally to exercise that discretion or power so as to affect B’s legal or practical interests; and (c) B is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of F.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In support of this aspect of its striking out application, PNGSDP cites the later decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">Her Majesty </span><span class="font-italic">The Queen in Right of Alberta v Elder Advocates of Alberta Society and James O. Darwish, Personal representative of the Estate of Johanna H. Darwish, deceased and Attorney General of Canada and Attorney General of British Columbia as Interveners </span>[2011] 2 SCR 261 (“<span class="font-italic">Alberta</span>”). In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Alberta</span>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that Wilson J’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">Frame</span> is not a complete code for identifying when a fiduciary duty arises (at [29]). In particular, the court cited its own intervening authority which had established that vulnerability in the broad sense – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, vulnerability resulting from factors external to the relationship between F and B – is not the most relevant consideration in ascertaining whether F owes B a fiduciary duty (at [28]). The most relevant consideration is whether any vulnerability arises from the relationship between F and B itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Supreme Court of Canada therefore reformulated the elements from <span class="font-italic">Frame</span> and held (at [30]–[36]) that F owes a fiduciary duty to B if (the <span class="font-italic">“Alberta framework”</span>):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) F gives an undertaking of responsibility, express or implied, to act in B’s best interests. In other words, F must undertake “to act in accordance with the duty of loyalty reposed on” F (at [30]) and to forsake the interests of all others (including F himself) in favour of B in relation to the legal interest at stake (at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) B is vulnerable to F in the sense that F has a discretionary power over B or over the class to which B belongs (at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) F’s power may affect B’s legal interests or his substantial practical interests (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Supreme Court of Canada concluded this part of its analysis in <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> with the following summary of when an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty arises (at [36]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In summary, for an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty to arise, the claimant must show, in addition to the vulnerability arising from the relationship as described by Wilson J. in <span class="font-italic">Frame</span>: (1) an undertaking by the alleged fiduciary to act in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary or beneficiaries; (2) a defined person or class of persons vulnerable to a fiduciary’s control (the beneficiary or beneficiaries); and (3) a legal or substantial practical interest of the beneficiary or beneficiaries that stands to be adversely affected by the alleged fiduciary’s exercise of discretion or control.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I consider the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> to be consistent with the principles set out in the Court of Appeal authority which I have cited at [59]–[64] above. I therefore adopt and apply the <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> framework to analyse whether the plaintiffs’ claim that PNGSDP owes the members of the Affected Communities an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty is sustainable. In my view, the plea is plainly and obviously unsustainable because the first and third elements in the <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> framework (see [66(a)] and [66(c)] above) are absent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I address these two elements in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No undertaking to members of the Affected Communities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The first element of the <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> framework requires PNGSDP to have given an undertaking of responsibility to act in the best interests of the members of the Affected Communities.

Some 12,500 residents of Alberta’s long-term care facilities as a class sued the government, claiming that the government had breached a fiduciary duty by raising the residents’ charges beyond the actual cost of accommodation and meals in order to cross-subsidise part of the cost of their medical care.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Alberta </span>stands for a broader proposition than that advanced by the plaintiffs. That proposition is that an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty will rarely be owed to a group of persons who can be sub-divided into classes with competing interests where each sub-class has equally valid claims to the alleged fiduciary’s assistance (<span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> at [44]). <span class="font-italic">A </span><span class="font-italic">fortiori</span>, an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty will rarely be owed exclusively to any one sub-class of the group. As the Supreme Court of Canada explained in <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> (at [43]–[44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The duty is one of utmost loyalty to the beneficiary. As Finn states, the fiduciary principle’s function “<span class="font-underline">is not to mediate between interests</span>. It is to secure the paramountcy of one side’s interests . . . The beneficiary’s interests are to be protected. This is achieved through a regime designed to secure loyal service of those interests” ... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Compelling a fiduciary to put the best interests of the beneficiary before their own is thus essential to the relationship. Imposing such a burden on the Crown is inherently at odds with its duty to act in the best interests of society as a whole, and its obligation to spread limited resources among competing groups with equally valid claims to its assistance ... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span>, the government had an obligation to spread limited resources among competing groups of citizens with equally valid claims to the government’s assistance. Thus, the Supreme Court of Canada was satisfied that the government did not have to act with undivided loyalty to the plaintiffs, who, being residents of long-term care facilities, were a sub-class of the class of citizens.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 It is true that the Supreme Court of Canada formulated this proposition in the context of a fiduciary duty alleged to be owed by a government to its citizens. But I consider it equally applicable to PNGSDP. PNGSDP has undertaken contractual obligations which <span class="font-italic">oblige</span> it in certain situations to prioritise certain interests over and above the best interests of the members of the Affected Communities. Thus, PNGSDP is contractually obliged to accord the highest priority under the Program Rules to its own expenses and then to the interests of very wide class of persons whom it agreed to indemnify under BHP’s Indemnity and the State’s Indemnity. Further, PNGSDP has an unqualified contractual discretion to decide how to spread its limited resources among competing groups of Papua New Guineans. PNGSDP even has the contractual power to exclude entirely the members of the Affected Communities from its bounty. I therefore consider <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> a highly persuasive authority that PNGSDP cannot owe an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty to the members of the Affected Communities, even though <span class="font-italic">Alberta</span> was decided as between a government and its citizens.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on fiduciary duties claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The fundamental flaw in the plaintiffs’ claim is that superimposing an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty upon PNGSDP’s obligations, discretions and powers under the carefully constructed suite of contracts which PNGSDP entered into undermines the entire framework of the law of obligations. The plaintiffs’ case is that PNGSDP owes an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty to the members of the Affected Communities which arises from but prevails over PNGSDP’s contractual obligations, discretions and powers. That would elevate the members of the Affected Communities above the counterparties to PNGSDP’s suite of contracts, even though: (a) if PNGSDP were to disregard the interests of the members of the Affected Communities, at most it would simply fail to confer a gratuitous benefit upon them; (b) none of the members of the Affected Communities provided any consideration to PNGSDP; (c) none of the members of the Affected Communities are privy to any one of the suite of contracts PNGSDP entered into; (d) the members of the Affected Communities are not identified as a distinct class for the purposes of  any one of these suite of contracts; (e) ameliorating the environmental damage caused by the Mine is not identified specifically as any part of the purpose for which PNGSDP was established; and  (f) the provisions of the suite of contracts are inconsistent with the content of the <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty alleged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Further, it cannot be said that the provisions in the suite of contracts merely shape the content of PNGSDP’s <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty to the members of the Affected Communities. Those provisions directly contradict the existence of any such fiduciary duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 All of my findings on the plaintiffs’ claim for breach of fiduciary duty in this action are entirely consistent with my findings in <span class="font-italic">State v PNGSDP (HC</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>. There, I found that PNGSDP did not hold the Shares, Distributions or the Long Term Fund on any sort of a trust (<span class="font-italic">State v PNGSDP (HC) </span>at [301] to [341]). I reached that finding for a number of reasons including the effect of cll 9 and 10 of the Program Rules and the Security Arrangements. The Court of Appeal dismissed the State’s appeal and expressly upheld my finding that no trust exists (<span class="font-italic">State v PNGSDP (CA)</span> at [52]). Although that litigation quite obviously involved a different issue between different parties (as I acknowledge at [14] above), all of the reasons that justified my finding that there was no trust for the purposes of that litigation make it plainly and obviously unsustainable that PNGSDP owes any <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty to the members of the Affected Communities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 For all of these reasons, I hold that the plaintiffs’ case that PNGSDP owes an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty to the members of the Affected Communities is plainly and obviously unsustainable. It is therefore struck out. Given this holding, the plaintiffs’ claim that PNGSDP has breached its fiduciary duty must also be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedial constructive trust claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>”), the Court of Appeal discussed the remedial constructive trust (“RCT”) <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> (at [169]–[185]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>I assume in the plaintiffs’ favour, without deciding, that Singapore law recognises the RCT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The plaintiffs seek an RCT over the Long Term Fund.

In <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>, the Court of Appeal also stated that the appellant’s argument for the imposition of an RCT as a remedy was “parasitic” on the success of her unjust enrichment claim (at [169]). To be clear, the Court of Appeal did not in that case hold that an RCT was available as a remedy for unjust enrichment. On the contrary, the Court of Appeal said it would be hesitant to recognise the RCT as a remedy for a claim in unjust enrichment because the availability of the RCT depends on fault whereas liability in unjust enrichment is independent of fault (<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [182]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 A plaintiff can secure an RCT over a defendant’s property as a remedy only if it can first establish a right against the defendant arising from a cause of action known to law.

</div> “Mine Closure” as defined in cl 21.1 did not occur in 2013 and has not occurred to date. It is plain and obvious that there is no implied term in the Program Rules to the effect pleaded by the plaintiffs. It is equally plain and obvious that PNGSDP was under no contractual obligation to implement the Mine Closure Plan in 2013 and is under no such obligation today. Therefore, the failure to activate the Mine Closure Plan is indistinguishable from PNGSDP complying with its contractual obligations under the Program Rules. The failure is incapable of evidencing a predominant intention to injure the members of the Affected Communities. The plaintiffs’ case on Conspiracy A is plainly and obviously unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For completeness, I should add that Conspiracy A is wrongly pleaded as a lawful means conspiracy. The plaintiffs’ case is that PNGSDP’s and Sir Mekere’s conspiracy to breach a contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the alleged implied term) caused damage to the members of the Affected Communities. A breach of contract is an example of unlawful means for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy (<span class="font-italic">Nagas</span><span class="font-italic">e Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 at [23]).

According to Professor Peter Birks, an interceptive subtraction occurs where assets were “on their way, in fact or law, to the claimant when the defendant intercepted them” but were “never reduced to the ownership or possession of the claimant” (see Peter Birks, Unjust Enrichment (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2005) at p 75).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 PNGSDP submits that the second element cannot be made out as the members of the Affected Communities never owned the Shares or the Long Term Fund to begin with. For this reason, and because the members of the Affected Communities also lack a contractual or personal right to the Shares and to the monies in the Long Term Fund, interceptive subtraction cannot apply.

It is at this last step that interception is made on Prof Birks’s theory of interceptive subtraction. We thus note that even on Prof Birks’s theory of interceptive subtraction, certainty is still required. In our tentative view, the preferable position is that the claimant must show some form of <span class="font-italic">legal (and not merely factual)</span> entitlement to the property which is received by the recipient. However, until such issue arises squarely for determination by this court and we have had the benefit of hearing full arguments from parties, we do not take a definitive position. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Despite this, I assume in the plaintiffs’ favour, without deciding, that a factual entitlement to property suffices for interceptive subtraction. Even so, the plaintiffs’ case that it had a factual entitlement to the Shares or the Long Term Fund is plainly and obviously unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 According to Professor Birks, a plaintiff who relies on interceptive subtraction must show that “the wealth in question would <span class="font-italic">certainly</span> have arrived in the plaintiff if it had not been intercepted by the defendant <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> route</span> from the third party” [emphasis added] (Peter Birks, <span class="font-italic">An Introduction to the Law of Restitution</span> (Oxford University Press, Rev Ed, 1989) (“<span class="font-italic">Birks’s Introduction</span>”) at pp 133–134). This requirement of certainty is not without its criticisms (see Lionel D Smith, “Three-Party Restitution: A critique of Birks’s Theory of Interceptive Subtraction” (1991) 11 OJLS 481 at 486, cited in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [120]). But I have no doubt that the plaintiffs’ claim falls far short of satisfying the requirements of interceptive subtraction even on the view of certainty which is most generous to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In respect of the Shares, the factual entitlement of the members of the Affected Communities to the Shares is premised on the non-fulfilment of the Share Offload Representations.

Before Mine Closure, cl 9.2 stipulates that PNGSDP is obliged to make the high priority payments out of Distributions before applying the remainder for the benefit of Papua New Guineans in the Western Province and elsewhere in Papua New Guinea. Even then, only a third of the remainder is earmarked for “the people of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea”. The members of the Affected Communities are a subset of the people of the Western Province. It is unsustainable to allege that it was even remotely “certain” that sustainable development projects implemented out of the distributions would benefit the members of the Affected Communities. It is entirely within the discretion of PNGSDP’s Board to apply that part of the Distributions for sustainable development projects which benefit communities in the Western Province which are <span class="font-italic">not</span> Affected Communities. Furthermore, the Program Rules do not require PNGSDP to transfer the Distributions directly to the people of the Western Province, let alone to the members of the Affected Communities.

After Mine Closure, PNGSDP can draw on the Long Term Fund to pay certain high priority expenses and only 2.5% of the Long Term Fund for Sustainable Development Purposes. Further, both before and after Mine Closure, the Long Term Fund is also subject to the Security Arrangements.

If the condition is not fulfilled, the recipient must return the benefit. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The inquiry as to whether there is a failure of basis has two parts: first, what was the basis for the transfer in respect of which restitution is sought; and second, whether that basis has failed (<span class="font-italic">Benzline</span> at [46]). The plaintiffs plead that the consideration for the members of the Affected Communities, or their representatives, signing the Opt Out Forms was for OTML to procure the performance of the Share Offload Representations.

What is the benefit that the members of the Affected Communities conferred on OTML for which there has been an alleged failure of basis? This benefit could not have been the Shares, Distributions or the Long Term Fund because: (a) these assets were never the property at law or in equity of the members of the Affected Communities; (b) it was never a factual certainty that these assets were destined for the members of the Affected Communities; and (c) it defies the facts and logic to say that the Shares or Distributions are an enrichment which the members of the Affected Communities conferred upon OTML.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The benefit that the members of the Affected Communities conferred on OTML was the release of their right to sue OTML.

</div> So, even if I assume that the Share Offload Representations formed the basis of the release and that this basis failed due to non-fulfilment of the Share Offload Representations, the members of the Affected Communities would be entitled to recover only their right to sue or the value of that right. This is because restitution restores to the plaintiff only the value received by the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones 9th </span>at para 36-02). Even if a failure of consideration is made out as against OTML, an attempt to hold PNGSDP liable to account for monies that it should have applied for the benefit of the members of the Affected Communities on the basis of this unjust factor is plainly and obviously unsustainable and should be struck out.

</div> But, a closer reading of that case shows that Andrew Ang SJ was merely illustrating possible unjust factors by reference to <span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>and <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span><span class="font-italic"> 8th </span>without accepting that those unjust factors form part of Singapore law (at [143]–[145]). I have done the same at [157] above. It is unnecessary for me to determine whether exploitation of weakness as an unjust factor forms part of Singapore law because the PASOC does not even disclose exploitation in the sense described in <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 For this unjust factor, <span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>clarifies that the law is not responding to lies, as in the tort of deceit. Rather, the law seeks to protect a plaintiff who suffers from a weakness (whether mental or arising from the plaintiff’s circumstances) which is not so extreme as to constitute an incapacity (<span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> at p 300). <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> sets out three elements which must be established to succeed on this unjust factor (at p 300): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, that the claimant has a mental or circumstantial weakness [<span class="font-weight-bold">“</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the First </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Element</span><span class="font-weight-bold">”</span>]; secondly, disadvantageous terms [<span class="font-weight-bold">“</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the Second </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Element</span><span class="font-weight-bold">”</span>]; and, thirdly, although the evidential burden of proof may here be on the defendant, a lack of independent advice given to the claimant [<span class="font-weight-bold">“</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the Third Element</span><span class="font-weight-bold">”</span>]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Graham Virgo in <span class="font-italic">The Principles of the Law of Restitution </span>(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Virgo’s Restitution</span>”) at pp 278–286 and <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones 9th </span>at paras 11-59–11-65 recognise that unconscionable bargains are also an unjust factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The plaintiffs fail on all three elements of exploitation of weakness. I begin by considering whether the plaintiffs have pleaded a sustainable case of mental or circumstantial weakness so as to satisfy the First Element. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 With regard to mental weakness, <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> at p 301 identifies two categories of plaintiffs: expectant heirs and the poor and ignorant. It is readily apparent that what <span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>is describing corresponds to the narrow doctrine of unconscionability recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK and </span><span class="font-italic">another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM</span>”) at [141]–[142]. This is put beyond doubt when <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at pp 302–303 traces the origin of the “poor and ignorant” category of plaintiffs to <span class="font-italic">Fry v Lane</span> (1888) 40 Ch D 312 (“<span class="font-italic">Fry</span>”) at 322 and later <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span><span class="font-italic"> v Potter </span>[1978] 1 WLR 255 (“<span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span>") at 257. The narrow doctrine of unconscionability formulated in <span class="font-italic">BOM </span>is a modification of the requirements in <span class="font-italic">Fry </span>and <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> (<span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [141]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 It follows that if “exploitation of weakness” is an unjust factor, a plaintiff who relies on this unjust factor must be able to invoke the narrow doctrine of unconscionability as set out in <span class="font-italic">BO</span><span class="font-italic">M</span>. To do so, a plaintiff must show that she was suffering from an infirmity that the other party exploited in procuring the transaction (<span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [142]). If she does so, the burden is then cast onto the defendant to demonstrate that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable. In this regard, while successfully invoking the doctrine of unconscionability does not require a plaintiff also to establish the Second or Third Elements, these are factors which the court will invariably consider in assessing whether the transaction was improvident (<span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [142]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 As to what infirmities fall within the ambit of the narrow doctrine of unconscionability besides poverty and ignorance (which were identified in <span class="font-italic">Fry </span>and <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span>), the Court of Appeal included situations where the plaintiff is suffering from other forms of infirmities, whether physical, mental or emotional in nature (<span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [141]).

</div>
</div>
</div> This pleading does not address the meaning of “poor and ignorant”. In <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 257, Megarry J clarified that “poor and ignorant” refers to someone who is “a member of the lower income group” and “less highly educated” respectively in modern parlance. While I accept that the members of the Affected Communities are as a whole individuals who are poor and unsophisticated, the plaintiffs do not plead these circumstances as the factual basis for exploitation of weakness as an unjust factor. The gist of the plaintiffs’ case on exploitation of weakness appears instead to be an alleged misrepresentation. As <span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>highlights, misrepresentation falls outside the ambit of this unjust factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 With regard to circumstantial weakness, <span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>concedes that there “is little support in English law for setting aside transactions for this form of exploitation” (at p 306). Circumstantial weakness is a situation in which the plaintiff is merely in “difficult circumstances” (<span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>at p 306). In any case, I repeat my finding in the preceding paragraph that there are no other relevant infirmities which arise on the pleaded facts which enliven the narrow doctrine of unconscionability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 For completeness, <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> also suggests that inequality of bargaining power as described by Lord Denning in <span class="font-italic">Lloyds Bank</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Bundy</span> [1975] QB 326 at 339 may be a type of circumstantial weakness which amounts to an unjust factor (<span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>at p 306). But Lord Denning’s principle of inequality of bargaining power was squarely rejected as an ill-founded principle in <span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [133].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 In summary, the plaintiffs have pleaded no mental or circumstantial weaknesses which could conceivably establish the First Element in exploitation of weakness as an unjust factor. I am also satisfied that the PASOC fails to address the Second and Third Elements. In any event, exploitation of weakness as an unjust factor is completely at odds with the contractual obligations, discretions and powers under the suite of contracts which PNGSDP entered into.  Accordingly, I hold that a claim in unjust enrichment based on the unjust factor of exploitation of weakness is plainly and obviously unsustainable and have therefore struck it out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ignorance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Ignorance in this context is a term of art. <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones 9th</span> at paras <br/>8-02–8-03 explains that this unjust factor consists of situations of “lack of consent” or “want of authority”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where D is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">enriched at C’s expense</span> without the intermediation of any third party – as where D simply steals from C – C’s “lack of consent” is ordinarily a sufficient description of the operative ground. This is also true in many cases where D is immediately enriched as a result of the actions of a third party, X, but at C’s expense. However, the position is different if X is a party who <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">owns or controls assets subject to duties and powers to deal with them for C’s benefit</span>. Here, if X acts within his authority, then C will have no remedy; but if X acts outside his authority, his “want of authority” will itself constitute a sufficient ground for recovery by C. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In my view, the plaintiffs cannot succeed on lack of consent as an unjust factor in this case because the members of the Affected Communities never had a proprietary interest or a factual entitlement to the requisite degree of certainty in the Shares or Distributions. There was no legal or factual obligation on OTML, PNGSDP or BHP Minerals to obtain the consent of the members of the Affected Communities to the transfer the Shares from BHP Minerals to PNGSDP. Their lack of consent to the Shares and the Distributions being held on terms which falsify the Share Offload Understanding

</div> is simply legally irrelevant. It cannot satisfy the requirements of ignorance as an unjust factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 My reasons in the preceding paragraph above are sufficient to dispose of the unjust factor of lack of consent. But, in addition, it is my tentative view that lack of consent must be distinguished from vitiated intent. This distinction is another reason that a claim founded on this final unjust factor is plainly and obviously unsustainable. Where there is lack of consent, the plaintiff has <span class="font-italic">no</span> intent to enrich the defendant at all. Paradigms include a plaintiff whose property is stolen, a plaintiff who is unaware that his property is being taken from him and a plaintiff who is aware that his property is being taken from him but is powerless to prevent it (<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at paras 8-01–8-02, 8-09). In contrast, in a situation of vitiated intent, the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">does</span> intend to enrich the defendant, but his intent is vitiated or defective. The paradigm here is a mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Ignorance as an unjust factor is not concerned with vitiated intent. That falls to be considered under other unjust factors such as mistake. The plaintiffs rely on none of these other unjust factors. This distinction is drawn in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones 9th </span>at para 8-08, <span class="font-italic">Virgo’s Restitution</span> at p 131 and James Edelman and Elise Bant, <span class="font-italic">Unjust Enrichment</span> (Hart Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at p 281. Because the members of the Affected Communities <span class="font-italic">did</span> intend to release their right to sue OTML, BHP Minerals and BHP Group but now assert simply that they were ignorant that the Share Offload Understanding would be falsified when they did so, their case is one of vitiated intention, not ignorance. The plaintiffs’ case on the unjust factor of ignorance or lack of consent is plainly and obviously unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The want of authority analysis described in <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> does not assist the plaintiffs either. Want of authority was rejected as an unjust factor by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span><span class="font-italic"> Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 308<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [111]–[114].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 For the avoidance of doubt, I do not hold that ignorance (specifically, a lack of consent as described in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones 9th</span>) is an unjust factor which forms part of Singapore law. This is not a settled question: see <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [139], [166]; <span class="font-italic">AAHG, LLC v Hong Hin Kay Albert</span> [2017] 3 SLR 636 at [74], <span class="font-italic">Ong Teck Soon </span><span class="font-italic">(executor of the estate of Ong Kim Nang, deceased) v Ong Teck Seng and another</span> [2017] 4 SLR 819 at [24].

I do not accept that the law of unjust enrichment affords the members of the Affected Communities a remedy which has the effect of circumventing a contractual framework (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Ninth Supplemental Agreement, the Master Agreement, the Program Rules and the Security Arrangements) that expressly provides for the transfer of the Shares to PNGSDP and, in consideration, for PNGSDP to subject the Shares to the Security Arrangements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The plaintiffs’ claim in unjust enrichment is plainly and obviously unsustainable.

The plaintiffs appear to have approached the PASOC as a box-ticking exercise, in which to plead each of the constituent elements of each of the plaintiffs’ four claims. That approach has not been sufficient to survive striking out. In my view, it is not necessary to await a trial of this action in order to conclude that all four claims against PNGSDP are, for the reasons I have given, plainly and obviously unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Adrian Tan, Ong Pei Ching, Hari Veluri and David Aw</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mark Seah, Andrea Gan, Chua Weilin, See Kwang Guan and Ashwin Nair Vijayakumar (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Adam Muneer Yusoff Maniam and Chua Xyn Yee</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the first defendant (watching brief);</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The third to fifth defendants absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
