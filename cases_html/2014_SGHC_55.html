<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the defendants to set
                    aside the mareva injunction granted pursuant to Summons No 4333 of 2013. Summons
                    No 4333 of 2013 concerned an application by the plaintiff in this case, before
                    me on 29 August 2013, for an injunction against the defendants in this
                    case, prohibiting the disposal of their assets in Singapore up to the value of
                    US$900,000. For the first defendant, the injunction extended to monies in its
                    corporate bank accounts, whereas for the second and third defendants, the
                    injunction extended to their shares in the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Hong
                    Kong, engaged in the business of mining and trading minerals. The first
                    defendant is a trading company primarily involved in the wood and pulp business,
                    incorporated in Singapore. The second and third defendants are directors of the
                    first defendant, and are involved in the day-to-day running of the business.
                    Each of them owns 50% of the shares of the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 18 November 2009, after some negotiations,
                    the plaintiff and the first defendant signed a Memorandum of Understanding
                    (“MOU”). Under the MOU, the plaintiff was to pay US$610,000 to the
                    first defendant in exchange for the first defendant’s help to procure a
                    mining licence for the plaintiff in Laos. This sum was to be paid in stages.
                    When the first defendant accomplished a certain goal in the process of obtaining
                    the licence, a portion would be due. Altogether, the plaintiff had paid the
                    first defendant an aggregate sum of US$841,350 (including expenses). However, no
                    licence was obtained. The plaintiff and the defendants tried many times to
                    resolve their dispute through negotiations. On 25 July 2012, parties
                    arrived at a further agreement (“the Bangkok Agreement”), through
                    which the plaintiff gave the defendants two to three weeks more to obtain the
                    licence, failing which the defendants had to return the sum of US$841,350 to the
                    plaintiff. However, the licence was not obtained, nor was the plaintiff
                    repaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 20 August 2013, the plaintiff commenced Suit
                    No 750 of 2013 in the High Court. It pleaded two causes of action, namely,
                    breach of contract and the tort of deceit. On 29 August 2013, the plaintiff
                    appeared before me seeking an urgent <em>ex parte</em>
                    injunction order. I allowed the application. On 10 December 2013,
                    proceedings against the first defendant were stayed in favour of arbitration
                    – the plaintiff commenced arbitration against the first defendant and
                    filed the notice of arbitration on 11 March 2014. The plaintiff wishes to
                    continue the proceedings in Suit No 750 of 2013 against the second and
                    third defendants. As such, the plaintiff prayed for the injunction order to
                    remain in force against all three defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       5 Having now had the benefit of hearing
                    submissions from both parties, I find that the foundation on which this mareva
                    injunction was based is untenable. I am thus allowing the defendants’
                    application to set aside the injunction. When counsel appeared before me, both
                    sides seemed keen to delve into whether the elements of the test for granting a
                    mareva injunction had been made out. Both sides agreed there was a good arguable
                    case, and the contention was on whether there was a risk of dissipation. I find
                    it more appropriate, however, to review the equitable nature of a mareva
                    injunction. It is from this perspective that I am allowing the defendants’
                    application, for I have found that the plaintiff did not come to this court with
                    clean hands. I explain my decision by first highlighting the background as it
                    was presented to me by parties both in their written and oral submissions.
                    Second, I will briefly elaborate on the “clean hands”
                    doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Much revolves around the MOU, the negotiations
                    that led up to it, and the subsequent attempts at negotiation when the first
                    defendant allegedly failed to perform its side of the “bargain”.
                    Based on the facts as presented in [3], two questions arise: what was the
                    plaintiff paying the defendant for? And why did the plaintiff need the
                    defendants? The plaintiff is a company with experience in the mining industry.
                    The defendant is not – it is a trading company primarily involved in the
                    wood and pulp business. When parties appeared before me on 17 March 2014, I
                    posed these questions to counsel for the plaintiff. Counsel for the plaintiff
                    responded that the plaintiff had made the payments totalling US$841,350 with the
                    understanding that the would be used by the defendants towards paying
                    “facilitation fees” and “costs for the relevant
                    applications to liaising with the various government departments to secure the
                    licences”. The plaintiff also claimed to have relied on the defendants as
                    they represented to it that they had already established relationships with
                    relevant parties in Laos. The plaintiff made much of the fact that the MOU was
                    structured in a manner that required payments to be made in stages. This, the
                    plaintiff argued, signified the “legitimacy” of the
                    plaintiff’s involvement in the deal. For ease of reference, I set out the
                    relevant terms of the MOU:</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It is evident from the “payment
                    schedule”, even without an understanding of the abbreviations used (most
                    of which were not even defined in the MOU), that the plaintiff’s claim to
                    legitimacy is a weak one. There is no term as to the use to which the sums are
                    put, no clarification as to how the sums are arrived at, which portion is
                    directed to the defendant and which to the administrative costs (if any). The
                    payment schedule is hence neutral at best and damaging to the plaintiff’s
                    case at worst. From the casual manner and careless drafting (for example, the
                    year in the date in cl 4, is incomplete), as well as arithmetic inadequacy
                    of the schedule (the plaintiff alleges that US$841,350 had been paid to the
                    defendants, whereas the schedule only “accounts” for US$750,000),
                    it may even be taken as an attempt by the plaintiff – or both parties
                    – to obscure their conduct and create a misleading story of their venture.
                    The plaintiff’s very reliance on the schedule as a “shield of
                    legitimacy” lends further support to that possibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The schedule was relied on by the plaintiff
                    presumably as a ground for resisting the defendants’ application to set
                    aside the injunction. That approach failed. So, too, did the plaintiff’s
                    reliance on the case of <em>Solvadis Commodity Chemicals GmbH v
                        Affert Resources Pte Ltd</em> [2014] 1 SLR 174 (“<em>Solvadis</em>”) for the proposition that evidence that
                    the defendant had previously acted in a way which shows that his probity is not
                    to be relied on can constitute evidence of a risk of dissipation of the
                    defendant’s assets” (see <em>Solvadis</em> at
                    [16], citing with approval <em>Guan Chong Cocoa Manufacturer Sdn
                        Bhd v Pratiwi Shipping SA</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 157 at [18], which in
                    turn cited with approval the words of Mustil J in <em>Ninemia
                        Maritime Corporation v Trave Schiffahrtsgesellschaft mbH (The
                        Niedersachsen)</em> [1983] 1 WLR 1412 at 406). The plaintiff
                    tried to emphasise the defendants’ alleged “lack of probity”
                    to bolster its case that there was a risk of dissipation of assets. The
                    defendants had argued that the first defendant was a company worth more than
                    S$12m, that the shares in the first defendant, which were owned by the second
                    and third defendants, had always been in Singapore, and that the defendants had
                    hitherto made no attempt to sell away the the shares, or dissipate the assets by
                    any other means. In response, the plaintiff submitted that the defendants acted
                    dishonestly by their forgery of a letter allegedly from a Deputy Minister in
                    Laos. This forgery was discovered by the plaintiff on 21 June 2012.
                    Although I accept that forgery of an official document would be a fraudulent
                    act, all I have is the plaintiff’s word on this point. And although I am
                    not prepared to make a conclusive finding as to whether the document was indeed
                    forged (although, counsel for the defendants did not seem to dispute it), I note
                    that the plaintiff continued to deal with the defendants even after it was made
                    aware of the forgery – and even went so far as to sign a further agreement
                    (the Bangkok Agreement, on 25 July 2012).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       If it was not clear to the plaintiff initially
                    that it had encouraged the defendants to conduct illicit activities at the time
                    of signing the MOU (which I doubt), it must surely have been clear by
                    21 June 2012. As such, the two points raised by the plaintiff, the schedule
                    and the defendants’ alleged forgery, turned out to be its Achilles’
                    heel. The situation then seems to be a clear one: the plaintiff went into the
                    deal with the defendants with full knowledge of what the defendants had to
                    do.</p>

                        Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another</em> [2011] 1 SLR 524
                        (“<em>Beckkett</em>”) for its description
                    of the “clean hands” doctrine. I think it is useful to set it out
                    as well:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not uncommon to find broad statements that a plaintiff is not
                        granted an injunction if he does not have clean hands. Properly understood
                        these statements are correct; but they should be applied cautiously, for it
                        is by no means true that a plaintiff who has acted unconscionably is refused
                        all access to the court or that he is considered to be beyond protection for
                        all purposes. ... It has been said that the principle on which the court
                        acts is that protection is denied the plaintiff 'where the right relied on,
                        and which the court of equity is asked to protect or assist, is itself to
                        some extent brought into existence or induced by some illegal or
                        unconscionable conduct of the plaintiff', so that protection for what he
                        claims involves protection for his own wrong: 'No court of equity will aid a
                        man to derive advantage from his own wrong, and this is really the meaning
                        of the maxim.'</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Although <em>Beckkett</em> concerned an anti-suit injunction, I do not see why the
                    clean hands doctrine should be any different when it comes to mareva
                    injunctions. In this case, I am able to come to one of four findings, with
                    regard to the parties’ eligibility for equitable remedies:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     that neither party was in the
                        wrong;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the
                        defendants were in the wrong;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the plaintiff was in the wrong;
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     that both the
                        plaintiff and defendants were in the wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff’s injunction can only be
                    justified in the case of either (a) or (b). However, based on the evidence
                    presented to me, I am unable to reach the finding in either (a) or (b). With the
                    benefit of submissions from the defendants, but more so – ironically
                    – the plaintiff’s rebuttals, I am now able to better understand the
                    plaintiff’s involvement in this matter, and am more inclined towards (d).
                    The plaintiff cannot say it was not involved, let alone unaware, of the illicit
                    activities in Laos, and hence should not be allowed to avail itself to equitable
                    relief. Accordingly, I have allowed the defendants’ application to set
                    aside the mareva injunction granted on 29 August 2013. Liberty to the
                    defendants to apply for damages and costs at the end of the arbitration
                    proceedings.</p>
