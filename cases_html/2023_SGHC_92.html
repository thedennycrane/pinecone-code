The plaintiff, Amberwork Source Pte Ltd (“Amberwork”), was told that Ronald’s business, Weroc Group Pte Ltd (“Weroc”), was looking to buy goods (specifically, telecommunications/fibre optic cables and related goods) for on-sale to its customers in China but lacked the funds to do so. Amberwork was thus invited by Ronald to purchase these goods and sell them to Weroc, but on deferred payment terms. On the other side of the fence, the defendants were told by Ronald that he had (via Weroc) goods to resell to customers in Singapore but needed to sell them through a reseller that was an established enterprise in Singapore. The first defendant, QA Systems Pte Ltd (“QA”), became that enterprise, and proceeded (as Weroc’s authorised reseller) to sell goods to Amberwork. Amberwork purchased those goods and resold them to Weroc for a profit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This dispute has arisen because Amberwork has not been paid by Weroc. Amberwork sues QA as the first defendant for the sums Amberwork has paid on QA’s invoices, claiming that QA (as seller) has failed to deliver the goods it sold to Amberwork. It also sues QA’s director, the second defendant Yeo Chow Wah (“Sandra Yeo” or “Sandra”), for dishonestly assisting Weroc and/or Ronald to commit acts that amounted to a breach of trust. Sandra Yeo is a director and shareholder of QA, and also Ronald’s aunt.

Given that this was a business arrangement put in place by Ronald, and it was primarily Ronald who liaised with the other key players, following Ronald’s instructions would equally have just been good commercial and practical sense.

</div> But as highlighted above at [27], it is striking that there are no invoices from QA for these “admin fees”. Without more evidence and context on what parties regarded these fees to be, I am not prepared to place much weight on two brief references to the words “admin charge” and “admin fees”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In short, QA’s purported agency relationship with Weroc/Ronald has not been substantiated. QA’s conduct and the contemporaneous documents instead show that QA acted as principal and transacted as such with both Amberwork and Weroc. QA issued invoices as buyer (from Weroc) and seller (to QA) respectively, in its own name, and without any suggestion on their face that it was merely a billing party or payment agent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The sham transaction and unlicensed moneylending defences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The defendants raise two intertwined defences for why the Transactions are unenforceable (see [19] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) they were sham, round-tripping transactions involving fictitious goods; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) they were unlicensed moneylending transactions that contravened the MLA, involving Amberwork as the lender and Weroc as the borrower.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my judgment, both defences fail. Let me elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The sham transaction defence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On the first defence, the defendants have failed to show that the transactions were a sham. I note from the written submissions that none of the parties has developed this argument in its own right, as distinct from the MLA argument. In my view, it is important to first decide if the <span class="font-italic">legal test</span> for whether a transaction is a sham is met – only then can one go on to consider if the transaction in question was in fact something else. It is well-established that a sham transaction requires a <span class="font-italic">common</span> subjective intention between <span class="font-italic">all</span> the parties to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, create documents that are in fact not intended to create the legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance (to third parties or to a court) of creating (<span class="font-italic">Crédit Agricole Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Singapore Branch v PPT Energy Trading Co Ltd and another suit</span> [2022] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Crédit Agricole</span>”) at [120], citing the often quoted test laid down by Diplock LJ (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd</span> [1967] 2 QB 786 at 802). In this regard, “[w]hat is required for a sham is a finding the parties to the sham were dishonest in creating a pretence of a transaction in order to deceive others when there was in reality no such transaction” (<span class="font-italic">Crédit Agricole </span>at [120]). Because a finding of a sham carries with it a finding of dishonesty, there is a strong and natural presumption against holding a provision or document a sham (<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng and another (executrixes and trustees of the estate of Fock Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng Eng Chye</span> [2013] 2 SLR 715 at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the case before me, there is <span class="font-italic">no evidence</span> of any such common intention existing, whether as between Amberwork and the defendants, or as between Amberwork, the defendants and Weroc/Ronald.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In addition, the defendants’ characterisation of the transactions as a form of “round-tripping” does not take their case very far, and there are a number of reasons for this. First, round-tripping is not in and of itself illegal or fraudulent. This was explained in <span class="font-italic">Crédit Agricol</span><span class="font-italic">e </span>at [123]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">123 There was no evidence that any of the traders in the chain did not intend property to pass in the Cargo in accordance with the terms of the sale and purchase contracts which they concluded. Whether or not the parties to those transactions ever expected original shipping documents to be provided (and the evidence was that those represented in court did not: see [49] above) is nothing to the point. Trading in oil products frequently involves what amounts to little more than<span class="font-italic"> trading in documents with the product being delivered to the ultimate purchaser, with money and documents being exchanged by the intervening participants in the chain from original supplier to that ultimate purchaser</span>. <span class="font-italic">That does not make the transactions any the less genuine or mean that property in the goods does not pass. </span>Whether or not the round-tripping transactions were concluded for the purpose of securing funds for Zenrock from its sale to Shandong greater in amount and more quickly than its sale to TOTSA, and whether or not a fraud was committed by Zenrock against CACIB in the provision of the Fabricated Zenrock-TOTSA Sale Contract and the issue of the Duplicate NOAs to the two banks which financed its purchases from SOCAR and PPT, the round-tripping transactions were genuine sales and purchases under which it was intended that the Cargo should be sold, title in it should pass and payment should be made. <span class="font-italic">To label them as “financing transactions”, “sleeve transactions” or “credit sleeve transactions” does not change their character as real transactions whatever the underlying purpose of them might be, as long as the intention of the parties to them was to </span><span class="font-italic">effect a sale or purchase as the case might be. </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 <span class="font-italic">Crédit Agricole </span>is but one case in a line of cases which have recognised that round-tripping transactions are not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> illegal. These cases have recently been analysed in detail in <span class="font-italic">UniCredit Bank AG v Glencore Singapore Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2022] SGHC 263 at [34]–[74], and I see no reason to depart from that analysis.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To be sure, a different conclusion might be reached if these were round-tripping transactions involving fictitious goods. This distinction was explained in <span class="font-italic">Goodwood Associates Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Southernpec (Singapore) Shipping Pte Ltd and another suit</span> [2020] SGHC 242 at [47]–[48]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 For the purposes of the <span class="font-italic">Snook</span> test, it seems to me necessary to distinguish between circular trading transactions in which no delivery of the subject-matter commodity is contemplated and those in which no trading in any subject-matter commodity is contemplated at all. In the first scenario, the parties fully intend the legal title in the subject-matter commodity to pass through the various parties in the circular chain of transactions. The intention to be bound to the various trade contracts constituting the circular chain is therefore present. In contrast, in the second scenario, the parties do not intend to trade in any commodity at all. They do not intend to take legal title in the subject-matter commodity, and do not intend the creation of any legal obligation to pay for the trades in the subject-matter commodity. The entire circular series of transactions, therefore, is nothing more than fiction. This is, in fact, Southernpec’s characterisation of the July Arrangements.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 I should add that nothing in what I have said should be taken to be an endorsement of circular trades in fictitious commodities. In my judgment, there may be nothing uncommercial in parties seeking to make arbitrage profits or brokerage fees by exploiting the rapid and often capricious ebbs and flows of the commodities market as long as they trade in genuine commodities, albeit in a circular fashion. <span class="font-italic">It is an entirely different matter if the parties seek to manipulate their reported financial performance by purporting to trade in commodities which in fact do not exist, or which the parties know are not available for trading </span><span class="font-italic">eg commodities which are legally owned by none of the parties to the trading arrangement.</span> Accordingly, if any party to a circular trading arrangement has such knowledge at the time the relevant trades are entered into, this is, in my view, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of his knowledge of a sham trading arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics; original emphasis omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In the case before me, however, there is no pleading to the fact that the transactions involved fictitious goods or that they were in this sense not real sale and purchase contracts. The evidence also does not objectively suggest that there were no goods or that the parties were (knowingly) transacting on the basis of fictitious goods. For instance, the WhatsApp conversations between Roger and Ronald clearly implied that goods in fact existed, and there is no suggestion that these WhatsApp exchanges were themselves shams intended to create a pretence. In one exchange, a concern was raised that customers might not be able to collect the goods if paperwork was delayed. In that same exchange, a suggestion was made as to whether paperwork could be settled “[w]ithout actual [taking of] goods yet”.

</div> In his AEIC, Daniel stated that over the course of Weroc’s transactions with Amberwork, he had never seen any <span class="font-italic">physical goods</span> being transacted or delivered by Amberwork to Weroc. Furthermore, when he asked Ronald about this, Ronald represented to him that the deliveries were conducted by his counterparts in China, and that Daniel “did not have to concern [himself] with the actual transfer of goods”.

</div> In my judgment, these statements are inconclusive. The quoted statement suggests that Daniel was not involved with the actual transfer of goods. If so, it is entirely unsurprising that he had not seen any goods. As Roger explained on the stand (when discussing some earlier transactions with another Reseller), since delivery was to be ex-factory and the factory was in China, it was to be expected that Amberwork would not see the physical goods.

In their pleadings and submissions, the defendants do not appear to rely on the presumptive provision in s 3 to establish that Amberwork is a person presumed to be a moneylender. Instead, they rely on the approach set out in <span class="font-italic">GA Machinery Pte Ltd and another v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd and others</span> [2020] SGHC 264 at [18]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18     Section 2 defines a “moneylender” as a person who, whether as principal or agent, carries on or holds himself out in any way as carrying on the business of moneylending, whether or not he carries on any other business, “but does not include any excluded moneylender”.

The evidence concerning the <span class="font-italic">other</span> transactions does little to change the complexion of what were, on their face, commercial transactions in this case involving the sale and purchase of goods, structured with a view to enabling trade<span class="font-italic"> </span>financing. To begin with, the examples cited by the defendants concern only a subset of the other transactions involving Ronald, most of which were between corporate entities. In addition, some of the examples of other transactions cited by the defendants in their closing submissions (at para 112) involved Roger using his <span class="font-italic">personal</span> funds – so those examples did not even involve Amberwork at all. Yet other examples were met with an explanation. For instance, according to Sandra, Ronald had explained that certain moneys for one other transaction had to be exchanged with a moneychanger (presumably into foreign currency), and so were not to be paid directly to Weroc’s account but to Ronald’s personal account. It appears that Sandra believed this explanation and had even explained to her bank that the transaction in question was a genuine one.

That is a crucial link that needs to be made in order for the defendants to rely on s 14(2) of the MLA. Be that as it may, and having considered the submissions and evidence, I agree with Amberwork’s position that it was not a “moneylender” in the business of moneylending. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In determining whether a person is engaged in the business of moneylending, the following considerations identified in <span class="font-italic">Agus</span><span class="font-italic"> Anwar v Orion Oil Ltd </span>[2010] SGHC 6 at [9] and [11] and <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another</span> [2018] 3 SLR 617 (“<span class="font-italic">Ochroid</span>”) at [74] are germane:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there exists system and continuity, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not merely occasional loans, but an organised scheme of moneylending (based on indicators such as fixed rates, the rate of interest being dependent on a borrower’s creditworthiness, the past conduct of the borrower, and a clear and definite repayment plan); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) even if no system and continuity exists, whether the alleged moneylender is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I agree with Amberwork that neither test is satisfied in this case. I acknowledge from the authorities that a person can be carrying on the business of moneylending even if that person is selective in lending on a commercial basis to only a few or even only one trusted, regular borrower: <span class="font-italic">Ochroid </span>at [76], citing <span class="font-italic">Pankaj s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Dhirajlal v Donald McArthy Trading Pte Ltd and others</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 79 at [31]. However, in my judgment, Amberwork’s transactions lack the requisite systematicity envisaged under the “system and continuity” test. For example, as Amberwork submitted, even after Weroc had defaulted on its own 60-day credit terms, there is no evidence of any penalty interest having been imposed. Nor is there any evidence in the correspondence or transaction documents of any repayment plan or scheme for accruing interest. It is also clear that Amberwork was not lending to all and sundry, but entered into a specific arrangement with Ronald/Weroc to exploit the specific business opportunity surfaced by Ronald, Roger’s long-term business acquaintance. In short, Amberwork was first and foremost a trading business and not a moneylending business.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion on the sham transaction defence and the unlicensed moneylending defence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For these reasons, neither the sham transaction defence nor the unlicensed moneylending defence succeeds.

The defendants contend that this arrangement was commercially unnecessary, because if the goods were always ready to be collected from the factory once payment was made, and the usual course in sale and purchase agreements is for the purchaser to first make payment, then Weroc could have easily paid the factory using moneys received from its end customer. Alternatively, the Resellers could have simply agreed to accepting delayed payment from Weroc. On the defendants’ argument, either of these would have rendered Amberwork’s role nugatory.

These alternative scenarios respectively depend on end customers having in fact first made payment (instead of paying, for example, on credit in full or in part), and the Resellers being willing to accept delayed payment. In the event, neither of these has been established as being likely to occur. Instead, Roger gave evidence that based on his experience doing business in China, upfront payment, and sometimes even advance payment, was required before suppliers might be prepared to do business.

</div> In my judgment, whether there was in fact a significant risk of Weroc being undercut in this case, and whether Weroc/Ronald has in fact succeeded in structuring and implementing the arrangements in a failproof manner, are not of critical importance. After all, businesses do not all approach risks in the same manner or respond to risks with the same effectiveness. What matters is whether these concerns shape the way business may be conducted by trading companies, such that it would have been unremarkable for Weroc to adopt similar practices. In my judgment, it appears likely that those in the trading business would generally be concerned with disclosing details of their suppliers, and it was unremarkable for Ronald to have also felt the same. I would add that even in an e-mail to <span class="font-italic">QA</span> dated 1 October 2019, Ronald had stated that “[Weroc] doesn’t wants [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] you to know the exact factory location because that is a trade secret, we cannot reveal our source in case our customers approach them directly. [T]his is market practice.”

As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [63], in the context of addressing a battle of forms, “[w]hat is<span class="font-italic"> </span>required … is a less mechanistic or dogmatic application of [the concepts of offer and acceptance] and this can be achieved by having regard to the context in which the agreement was concluded” [emphasis in original omitted]. I also take guidance from the following summary by V K Rajah JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Midlink</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [52]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the final analysis, the touchstone is whether, in the established matrix of circumstances, the conduct of the parties, objectively ascertained, supports the existence of a contract. Reduced to its rudiments, it can be said that this is essentially an exercise in intuition. Legal intentions, whether articulated or unarticulated, should not be viewed in isolation but should be filtered through their factual prism. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I begin with the argument described at [61(a)] above. I reject it as Amberwork’s case on contractual formation was never based on the purchase orders. Indeed, as a matter of principle, it need not be. In this regard, the law on offer and acceptance prioritises substance over form, and in the main, does not categorically require that a party expresses his contractual assent in one particular form or other. Neither was the presentation of purchase orders fundamental <span class="font-italic">to these parties</span>, based on their objectively-ascertained intentions. If it had been, one would not have expected to see QA proceed to issue the Invoices even in the absence of purchase orders. It is relevant to note Roger’s testimony that it was not unusual for purchase orders not to be issued. Purchase orders were “good to have … to countercheck for [Amberwork’s] own in-house bookkeeping purpose”, but there could be several reasons why a purchase order would not be issued in a given transaction, for instance because pre-existing arrangements had been made on the “back-end”, or because circumstances of urgency left no time for the purchase order to be prepared.

</div> In my judgment, an artificial and rigid insistence on the prior issuance of purchase orders being a necessary formal step would be at odds with the objective intentions of parties and the commercial realities underlying how they transacted and contracted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The second form of QA’s submission (described at [61(b)] above) appears to be a more direct response to Amberwork’s pleaded case. However, I am unable to agree that the implication of Amberwork’s pleadings is that Amberwork’s contractual acceptance had to come in some <span class="font-italic">separate </span>communication <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to making payment. What Amberwork pleaded was that the Agreements were dated 10 September 2019 and 26 September 2019. In my judgment, that is consistent with the Agreements being constituted in part by the Invoices sent by QA on those dates (offer) <span class="font-italic">and</span> the payments made by Amberwork on those Invoices on those same dates (acceptance).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 There is also nothing remarkable about Amberwork describing its payments as being made “pursuant to the Agreements”. Particularly in contracts constituted in part by conduct, it is entirely logical and likely that conduct (such as the making of payment) could simultaneously represent contractual assent <span class="font-italic">and</span> contractual performance. Furthermore, in stating that the payments had been made “pursuant to the Agreements”, Amberwork’s emphasis does not appear to be on the timing of contract formation. Rather, viewed in context, its point was that the payments had been made in accordance with the Invoices’ terms – that they were of the contracted sum and made in the contractually stipulated manner. Put another way, the point was that they had been made in connection with the Agreements, and not in connection with some other arrangement or basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Pleadings aside, the contemporaneous evidence positively supports the existence of the offers in the Invoices being accepted by way of payment by Amberwork.

</div> – that the identity of the party making or taking delivery had not been made apparent in the contract – they have not shown that this would have constituted a material term without which no contract could be established. As Amberwork submitted, citing <span class="font-italic">Dukkar</span><span class="font-italic"> S.A v Thailand Integrated Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] SGHC 234 (“<span class="font-italic">Dukkar</span>”) at [6], the essential terms for any contract for the sale of goods are the identity of the parties, the price, and the specification of the goods. These were all stipulated in the Invoices. Notably, delivery was not envisaged to be carried out via delivery to a named party, but to be <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic">-factory</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, made available by the seller for collection at the factory, with the buyer making its own arrangements for collection: see <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others</span> [2017] SGHC 102 at [239].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The defendants then say that the lack of a specific address for delivery renders the contracts uncertain. They attempt to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Dukkar</span>, as the putative contracts in this case envisage not only sale but also delivery. The problem is that delivery was to be at a location unknown to both parties. As such, performance cannot be enforced and this renders the contract uncertain.

</div> In my judgment, however, this argument is entirely contrary to the parties’ arrangements. The precise location of the factory was never once a concern to the parties, and the parties were prepared to fulfil their respective ends of the bargain on that basis. This argument is, in my view, plainly an afterthought. As emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi (alias Paul Chan) v Wang Jian and other matters</span> [2022] SGHC 192 at [100]–[101], the law is generally anxious to uphold a contract and it usually takes a rather uncertain or incomplete contract for a court to make a finding of unenforceability (see similarly Andrew Phang Boon Leong <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) at para 03.206).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Likewise, to the extent that the defendants take issue with the Invoices not reflecting the “full picture”,

</div> It suffices for me to state that the present dispute was never about competing interpretations of any particular term. The rules concerning extrinsic evidence are different in the context of ascertaining the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of a contract. This was clearly explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Luna” and another appeal</span> [2021] 2 SLR 1054 at [38]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Thus, when ascertaining whether the parties intended for the Vopak BLs to have contractual effect, the court is not limited by the more restrictive approach applied to the interpretation of a contract, which includes the parol evidence rule and the <span class="font-italic">Zurich</span> <span class="font-italic">Insurance</span> ([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) principles governing the admission of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of its terms. Instead, the court is entitled to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to draw the appropriate inferences as to what the parties had objectively intended by the issuance of the Vopak BLs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether QA breached its contractual obligation to deliver the goods</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Having found that QA was contractually obliged to deliver the goods to Amberwork and that the Transactions are not void and unenforceable, the next issue is whether QA breached its obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Having carefully considered the available documentary and oral evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the goods were more likely than not taken by Weroc or its customers in China. Significantly, given the nature of the arrangements agreed to by Weroc, QA and Amberwork, delivery by Amberwork to Weroc (or its customer) ex-factory in China would <span class="font-italic">simultaneously</span> mean, in this case, that QA would also have fulfilled its delivery obligations to Amberwork under the Agreements. This is because the Transactions were essentially structured as part of back-to-back transactions where Weroc would sell to QA, QA would resell the goods to Amberwork (with payment by Amberwork immediate upon invoice issuance, by telegraphic transfer), followed by Amberwork selling the goods back to Weroc (on 60-day payment terms). Delivery in all three legs would always be ex-factory in China.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Amberwork’s recourse, then, is properly against <span class="font-italic">Weroc</span> and not QA. It is not disputed that Weroc has failed to pay Amberwork. The reason for Weroc’s non-payment is not clearly before me, but this is not an issue because as far as Amberwork’s action against QA is concerned, it is ultimately unnecessary for me to reach a conclusion on why Weroc did not pay Amberwork.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The legal burden lies on Amberwork to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that QA failed to deliver the goods to Amberwork. Amberwork focuses much of its case on QA’s inability to produce a signed delivery order on QA’s letterhead, as evidence of proof of collection.

Neither is there evidence of Amberwork chasing Weroc to sign any delivery order from Amberwork. There was therefore no factual basis, even having regard to Pauline’s expressed concerns, for Amberwork to refuse to sign the delivery order issued by QA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 If Amberwork’s point was instead not the absence of a signed delivery order from Weroc as such, but a delivery order signed specifically by Weroc’s <span class="font-italic">customer</span>, this concern was not apparent from the contemporaneous evidence. Nor was it a point mentioned in its pleadings or developed in its closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I would also note that Weroc appears to have sent a signed delivery order back to Pauline for another transaction involving a different entity (Satoo Comtech) on 26 September 2019, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the same period of time as the Transactions. While this is not conclusive to my findings in respect of the Weroc-Amberwork delivery orders, it serves to reinforce the impression that Weroc was prepared to sign on Amberwork’s delivery orders.

</div> But that is a different issue from whether <span class="font-italic">delivery </span>is contingent on or proven by delivery orders being issued. As I indicated above at [82], delivery orders merely provide a way of evidencing that delivery did occur. The court can and must consider all relevant evidence (or the absence of evidence as the case may be) to conclude whether delivery did in fact take place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In this regard, it is notable that there is no evidence of any allegation of non-delivery being made at the material time by either Weroc or Amberwork. The tone and contents of the relevant WhatsApp exchanges between Roger and Ronald, and between Ronald and Sandra, do not give any impression that Weroc or its customer had not collected the goods. The correspondence centred on Amberwork or Roger chasing for payment under Amberwork’s invoices, and Ronald responding with various reasons for requesting more time to pay.

</div>
</div> Had delivery of the goods not taken place (which, as I explained above at [77], would occur simultaneously under the QA-Amberwork leg and the Amberwork-Weroc leg), there would be no basis upon which Amberwork could have regarded itself as being entitled to chase Ronald or Weroc for payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 This is an important point to be underscored. If Amberwork took the view that it was entitled to payment from Weroc, it must be because it also took the view that it had fulfilled its delivery obligations to Weroc under its leg of the transactions. Following from that, QA must also have fulfilled its delivery obligations under its leg of the transactions to deliver the goods to Amberwork. Otherwise, if QA had not delivered, Amberwork would in turn be unable to deliver to Weroc, and it would have had no basis to seek payment from Weroc. Viewed in this light, Amberwork’s conduct was, in my judgment, ultimately more consistent with QA having fulfilled its obligations to Amberwork to deliver the goods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Ultimately, inasmuch as the first (QA-Amberwork) and second (Amberwork-Weroc) legs of the transactions involved distinct contracts, the reality remained that delivery of the goods under <span class="font-italic">both</span> legs would occur <span class="font-italic">simultaneously</span>. Amberwork knew that the goods would be collected from the factory in China almost immediately. It was in these circumstances, then, that there was no communication from Amberwork to QA asserting that QA had not delivered the goods to Amberwork under the first leg, nor any assertion by Weroc or Ronald that the goods for the Transactions had not been delivered by Amberwork in respect of the second leg. It was only on 19 March 2020, close to six months after the Transactions, that Roger e-mailed Sandra for the first time, complaining about the alleged delay in delivery of the contracted goods, and asking QA to cancel the allegedly outstanding orders. As Sandra’s reply of 21 March 2020 noted, this was the first time QA received an e-mail from Roger stating that the goods had not been delivered.

More precisely, this means that Amberwork has not met its burden of proving that the goods had <span class="font-italic">not</span> been delivered to it by QA. To be sure, the evidence from both parties has been unsatisfactory in some respects, in large part because Ronald has passed on (see [4]). Nevertheless, the legal burden is and remains on Amberwork to prove that QA breached its contractual obligations to Amberwork. In my judgment, Amberwork has failed to meet this burden.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I find that the Transactions were not shams but legitimate commercial transactions involving Amberwork extending trade financing to Weroc via back-to-back transactions with QA. While the arrangements may have involved an element of round-tripping, that does not, without more, make the Transactions shams. Neither were they devices to circumvent the MLA; there was no unlicensed moneylending in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Although I find that Amberwork has established that QA was contractually obliged as a seller to deliver the goods that formed the subject matter of the Transactions, Amberwork has failed to prove that QA breached this obligation. Amberwork’s claim for breach of contract thus fails and for this reason, the claim by Amberwork is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Given my finding that there were validly concluded contracts between Amberwork and QA, there is no need for me to decide on Amberwork’s alternative claims grounded on misrepresentation and dishonest assistance. Those claims, as framed by Amberwork in its Statement of Claim, were predicated on the court finding that there were no concluded contracts between Amberwork and QA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the light of my conclusions on Amberwork’s contract claim, it is also unnecessary for me to decide on QA’s defence of unilateral mistake. However, even if this had been necessary for my decision, this defence would have failed in any event.
