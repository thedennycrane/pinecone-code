They were also each charged with one count of unlawful stalking with the common intention to cause alarm, an offence under s 7 of POHA read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The s 6 POHA charges involved the appellants shouting vulgarities in the Hokkien dialect at a National Environment Agency (“NEA”) officer while the s 7 POHA charges alleged that the appellants, together with one Mr Chow Yong Heng (“Chow”), in furtherance of the common intention of all of them, followed in a lorry two NEA officers, who were travelling in a van (with two other men) to various places for over three hours. Lee pleaded guilty to the s 6 charge and claimed trial in respect of the s 7 charge. Tan claimed trial for both his charges. The appellants were tried jointly and conducted their own defences. Chow had pleaded guilty in earlier proceedings to his s 7 charge and was sentenced to undergo three months’ imprisonment. At the time of the hearing before us, Chow had already served his sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the State Courts, the Magistrate (“the Magistrate”) convicted the appellants on all the charges against them. Lee was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment for the s 6 charge and four months’ imprisonment for the s 7 charge. Tan was sentenced to nine days’ imprisonment and four months’ imprisonment for the corresponding charges. The Magistrate ordered the sentences for each appellant to run consecutively. Lee and Tan appealed against their convictions and sentences in respect of the s 7 charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After hearing the parties, we dismissed the appeals against conviction but allowed the appeals against sentence. We set aside the sentences of four months’ imprisonment that the Magistrate imposed for the s 7 charges and substituted them with two weeks’ imprisonment. We further ordered the sentences for the s 6 and s 7 charges to run concurrently. The result was that each appellant would serve an aggregate sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Lee and Tan were unlicensed fruit hawkers. On 6 June 2016 at about 6.45pm, they were spotted selling fruits illegally near Yew Tee MRT station by two NEA officers, Mr Mohamed Shammir s/o Thirunauc Karasu (“Shammir”) and Mr Siow Chee Tseng (“Siow”). At that time, Lee and Chow were arranging boxes of fruits near Lee’s silver Nissan lorry (“the Lorry”). Tan was issued a summons for being an unlicensed hawker. The fruits and two wooden planks that formed part of a makeshift display table were seized. After issuing the summons, the NEA team – comprising Shammir, Siow, Mr Nagalingam Chilvarajo (“Nagalingam”) who was the driver and Mr Yasothaaran Thessaruva (“Yasothaaran”) who was a CISCO auxiliary police officer (“APO”) – left in a van (“the NEA Van”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The appellants and Chow then got into the Lorry and followed the NEA Van to various destinations over the span of about three hours: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From Yew Tee MRT to Lakeside MRT where the NEA team went to collect other seized items. Along the way, Shammir observed that the Lorry appeared to be following them and instructed Nagalingam to drive into a dead-end slip road to see if the Lorry would follow. The Lorry did. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) From Lakeside MRT to a carpark near Pioneer MRT where the NEA team went to collect more seized items. Siow and Shammir decided to test again if the Lorry was deliberately following them by relocating to a different car park. The Lorry followed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) From the carpark, the Lorry followed the NEA Van to a petrol station when the NEA team went there for a toilet break. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) From the petrol station, the Lorry followed the NEA Van to the NEA North East Regional Office (“NEA office”) where the NEA Van went to dispose of all the seized items. Lee, Tan and Chow looked at the NEA team as they unloaded the seized items.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) From the NEA office to a McDonald’s restaurant where the NEA Van was driven to for the purpose of testing again whether the Lorry was following it around. The Lorry stopped along the main road when the NEA Van entered the drive-through at the McDonald’s restaurant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) From the McDonald’s restaurant to an open carpark near Seah Im food centre (“Seah Im carpark”) where the Lorry parked about two lots away from the NEA Van. Siow alighted from the NEA Van to take photographs of the Lorry. Lee, Tan and Chow then alighted from the Lorry and Lee demanded to see Siow’s warrant card. When Siow refused to produce his warrant card, Lee and Tan hurled vulgarities in the Hokkien dialect at Siow. These formed the subject matter of the s 6 charges against Lee and Tan. Shammir and Yasothaaran alighted from the NEA Van and when they and Siow tried to get back into the NEA Van, Lee stood in front of it and held onto its doors. Chow did not take part in this confrontation and hence did not face a s 6 charge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) From the Seah Im carpark back to the NEA office. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On his manager’s advice, Shammir made a police report at 10.06pm. The first information report stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I AM CALLING FROM NEA. EARLIER AT 7PM I HAD BOOKED OFFENDER AT YEW TEE MRT STATION. NOW A CAR IS FOLLOWING MY VEHICLE. I AM ON THE WAY BACK TO MY OFFICE AND WILL ARRIVE IN 10 MINUTES TIME</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The manager also advised the NEA team not to enter the office premises but to park at the car park at Sin Ming Drive. The NEA team complied. The Lorry parked along the main road just outside the car park. A police car arrived soon thereafter and the police interviewed Lee, Tan and Chow. Later, the police went into the NEA office to interview Shammir. Lee, Tan and Chow left in the Lorry. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Arguments and decision in the Magistrate’s Court</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conviction under s 7 of the POHA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Prosecution submitted that Lee and Tan were unhappy that enforcement action had been taken against their illegal hawking. They intended to cause alarm to the NEA officers, as seen from the way they followed the NEA officers from place to place. They did not conceal their presence but followed the NEA Van closely to ensure that the NEA officers knew they were being followed. Any reasonable person would have thought the appellants’ conduct would cause alarm to the NEA officers and alarm was indeed caused. Siow and Shammir testified that they were alarmed and worried for their safety, including being concerned about being followed to their homes. This caused them to inform their manager and to call the police. Finally, the appellants’ course of conduct was unreasonable. They knew they would not have been allowed to retrieve the items. They claimed that Shammir had waved at them to follow but Shammir denied doing that. The Prosecution argued that it was nonsensical for the appellants to say they were following the NEA Van in order to ask the NEA officers to call the police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The appellants admitted that they decided to follow the NEA officers. However, there was nothing sinister in their motive and they took no steps to conceal themselves. Their actions were unlikely to cause harassment, alarm or distress because there was an APO in the NEA Van who could act against the appellants if necessary. The appellants’ actions were also reasonable as they only wanted to retrieve their goods. In any case there was no course of conduct as the appellants’ actions on that single occasion were not protracted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Magistrate held that the offence of unlawful stalking was made out. It was undisputed that the appellants’ conduct of following the NEA officers was an act associated with stalking. The Magistrate held that there was a course of conduct because the stalking took place over a few hours and that the appellants intended to cause alarm to the NEA officers. She rejected their explanations for their conduct:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellants claimed that they followed the NEA Van to retrieve the seized items but this was inconsistent with their testimony that they would not be allowed to retrieve the items and their conduct of alerting the NEA officers of their presence would have been self-defeating. Lee agreed that he was following in such a manner that the NEA officers would be able to see and know that they were being followed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellants claimed that after the NEA Van arrived at the NEA office on the first occasion to off-load the seized items, Shammir waved at the Lorry to indicate that the Lorry should follow the NEA Van. However, the appellants gave no reason why Shammir would do that and they did not ask Shammir why he waved despite having had the chance to do so. In any case Shammir denied waving at them. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The appellants alleged that they followed the NEA Van because they wanted to stop the NEA officers to ask them to call the police. The Magistrate rejected this as an illogical response.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Magistrate held that the appellants’ conduct had the effect of alarming the NEA officers as seen from Siow’s and Shammir’s testimony and their conduct of informing their manager and calling the police. The allegation that Siow and Shammir could not have been alarmed because an APO was present was an afterthought as that was not put to the witnesses at trial. In any event, it could even be said that the appellants’ boldness in following the NEA Van despite the presence of an APO would give cause for alarm. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Before the Magistrate, the Prosecution sought a sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment. An outcome of four months would be reached applying Chan Seng Onn J’s framework in <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2019] 5 SLR 279 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim</span>”). Two additional considerations were parity of sentences and the need for deterrence. Chow, who was in the Lorry with Lee and Tan, was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment on 26 July 2018 on his s 7 POHA charge. Chow played a lesser role in the offence and pleaded guilty. There was also a need to deter unlawful stalking of law enforcement officers carrying out their duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In mitigation, both appellants submitted they had been candid, forthright and remorseful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Central to the Magistrate’s decision was the principle of parity of sentences. The offence-specific factors were similar as all three persons were in the Lorry, travelled to the same places and were present for the same duration. A common aggravating factor was that the stalking was carried out against NEA officers while they were executing their official duties. To avoid double counting, the Magistrate decided to disregard the appellants’ conduct at the Seah Im carpark which formed the basis of the s 6 charges. The offender-specific factors differed as Chow had pleaded guilty. Considering that a guilty plea could warrant a 25% discount, the Magistrate decided that a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment each was appropriate for Lee and Tan in contrast to Chow’s sentence of three months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The issues on appeal were: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the elements of unlawful stalking were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, in particular, whether there was a “course of conduct” although the appellants followed the NEA Van on only one occasion; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the sentences should stand in the light of what this Court determines to be the applicable sentencing framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 To assist in the determination of the legal issues raised, a Young <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">micus Curiae, </span>Ms Leong Yi-ming (“the YAC”), was appointed to address these questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When will a single occasion of offending conduct constitute protracted conduct under s 7(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the POHA so as to qualify as a “course of conduct” under s 7(2)? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether, and in what way, the victims’ identities as law enforcement officers or APOs affect the conviction and/or sentence under s 7 of the POHA?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) What is the appropriate sentencing framework for an offence under s 7 of the POHA, considering in particular <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sim Kang Wei v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2019] 5 SLR 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim Kang Wei</span>”)? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appeals against conviction </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">When is conduct on a single occasion “protracted” so as to qualify as a course of conduct under s 7(2) of the POHA? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In considering this question, it is useful to set out the entire s 7 of the POHA for context as “course of conduct” appears in several sub-sections there.

Unknown to X, the camera continuously transmits live videos of X in X’s apartment and Y watches the videos continually over several days. Y’s conduct is protracted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The YAC submitted that where there was a single occasion of offending conduct, there must be some continuity in time and it must be sustained over a period of time although this did not require complete continuity. What would be regarded as protracted depended on the facts. The course of conduct had to evince the nature and gravity of the offence of unlawful stalking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Prosecution submitted that the enquiry called first for a consideration of when an act or a series of acts constituted conduct on a single occasion as opposed to conduct on multiple occasions. This was to be done by assessing whether there was a “sufficient break in time and space” between the acts that constituted the conduct. The extent of and the reasons for the break would help to show whether the stalker “consciously disengaged”. Next, what would be regarded as an appropriate length of time for the conduct to be regarded as being protracted was not a question of numbers but depended on the nature of the conduct, in particular, its intensity and the degree of intrusiveness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In our judgment, whether conduct on one occasion is “protracted” so as to amount to a course of conduct under ss 7(2) and 7(10) of the POHA is a fact-sensitive assessment that must be made as a matter of common sense. The court must look at all the circumstances, including the type, intensity and intrusiveness of the conduct. To be protracted, conduct does not have to be continuous or uninterrupted. For instance, conduct can still be protracted even if a physical stalker pauses for lunch or for a toilet break. Similarly, where the remote surveillance stalker has to pause because he needs to re-charge the battery in his electronic device. It is invariably a matter of degree as to when seemingly innocuous behaviour turns into a course of conduct of acts or omissions associated with stalking. Generally, if the conduct on a single occasion is engaged in for longer than would reasonably be considered sensible in the circumstances, that would be a pointer towards it fulfilling the meaning of protracted conduct under s 7(10) of POHA.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The assessment of whether conduct is “protracted” under s 7(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) is essentially a qualitative rather than a purely quantitative exercise. As shown in the illustration at the end of s 7, watching the videos in question continually over several days would obviously qualify as being protracted conduct. In some cases, doing such an act or similar acts over several hours instead of days might also qualify. The court must be satisfied that there is a certain degree of persistence or continuity of purpose which is unreasonable in the particular circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Finally, too much emphasis ought not to be placed on whether conduct is better classified as happening on one or multiple occasions. As has been pointed out, “whether a conduct is protracted or whether it can actually be split up into, and considered as, separate actions on separate occasions constituting a course of conduct may be mere semantics” (Warren Chik, “Harassment through the Digital Medium A Cross-Jurisdictional Comparative Analysis on the Law on Cyberstalking” (2008) 3 JICLT 13 at fn 165). The way that s 7(10) of the POHA is worded allows the court to avoid being drawn into such semantic debates by accepting that conduct on one or two or more occasions will suffice. This contrasts with the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (c 40) (UK) which requires conduct to have occurred on at least two occasions if it pertains to a single person. The English courts have responded by characterising conduct that might be regarded more naturally as occurring on one occasion as conduct over two or more occasions. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Wass</span><span class="font-italic"> v Director of Public Prosecutions </span>(11 May 2000, Queen’s Bench Division (Office Crown List)) (England and Wales), the accused had followed the complainant continuously over the course of a day. The requirement that there be two incidents was fulfilled by separating the following of the complainant into that which happened before the complainant entered a shop and that which happened after the complainant left the shop. In the present case, it could similarly be said that the appellants followed the NEA Van on two or more occasions if the first time the NEA Van returned to the NEA office or the incident at Seah Im carpark was used as the break between “occasions”. One might even argue that following the NEA Van to each location that night constituted one occasion and that there were therefore multiple occasions of following in this case. However, such distinctions are unreal and do not accord with common sense as the entire episode that night was obviously one occasion of stalking taking place over several hours with inconsequential breaks in between. Such artificiality in approach should be avoided altogether. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Returning to the present appeals, the appellants’ conduct was protracted because they had followed the NEA Van to numerous destinations over a three-hour period. They persisted in doing so even after the NEA Van returned to the NEA office the first time and the seized goods had been unloaded. This may be contrasted with <span class="font-italic">Nadarajamoorthy</span><span class="font-italic"> v Moreton</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2003] VSC 283, which dealt with the offence of stalking under s 21A of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). That provision also requires conduct to have been engaged in on more than one occasion or conduct that is protracted. Bongiorno J found that the appellant’s conduct of tail-gating a vehicle and driving parallel to that vehicle for three or four minutes was not protracted conduct. This shows that stalking by following a victim is highly fact-dependent and so are the other forms of stalking where the perpetrator may not be even physically present or near the victim or within sight of the victim (as with cyber-stalking and electronic surveillance). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other elements under s 7 of the POHA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As was their case below, the appellants did not deny having followed the NEA Van. They maintained that they followed the NEA Van openly and that there was nothing sinister in this. They claimed that they only wished to see where the seized items would be discarded so they could be retrieved. Further, the NEA officers were not alarmed because: (a) if they were, they would not have confronted the appellants at the Seah Im carpark; and (b) there was no reason for them to feel alarmed when an APO was present to escort them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 These contentions are essentially an appeal against the Magistrate’s findings of fact, given that the Magistrate rejected all the professed reasons for following the NEA Van. We were not satisfied that the Magistrate erred in her detailed assessment of the evidence. While the appellants insisted that they followed the NEA Van without any ill intention, the fundamental point is that the NEA officers here would not know what the stalkers’ intention was. Further, the appellants’ conduct showed clearly that they intended to cause alarm to the NEA officers. As we pointed out at the hearing, alarm does not need to be fear of immediate consequences but could also be apprehension as to what could potentially follow<span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Alarm can also be fear of the unknown where the stalker makes his presence felt but does not communicate or hint at his intention. The incident in question took place over some three hours from 7pm to 10pm and the NEA officers were likely to be returning home after their duties. The officers had no way of knowing what the appellants would do after the Lorry followed the NEA Van persistently for three hours and after the appellants, particularly Lee, engaged in the brief show of aggression at the Seah Im carpark incident. The altercation at the carpark put it beyond doubt that the appellants’ intentions were anything but<span class="font-italic"> </span>innocuous or benign. As the evidence at the trial showed, the NEA officers were alarmed by the appellants’ persistent conduct in following them in the Lorry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It was an exaggeration to claim that the NEA officers were the ones who confronted the appellants when all that the NEA officers did was to take photographs of the Lorry’s identification marks. It would also be an over-statement to say that the NEA officers could not have been alarmed when they knew that an APO was with them. As mentioned earlier, alarm could also be apprehension as to what could happen subsequently and it was clear that when the NEA officers completed their duties later and made their way home, the APO would not be escorting them. It could also be said that the appellants’ conduct caused alarm or perhaps greater alarm because they persisted in brazenly tailing the NEA Van despite knowing that an APO was on board the NEA Van.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The appellants also argued in their written submissions that the Prosecution should have called the APO who was present throughout the incident. However, the APO was one of two witnesses offered by the Prosecution to the appellants during the trial. Having declined to cross-examine the APO, the appellants could not complain on appeal about the absence of the APO’s evidence or ask the Court to draw adverse inferences against the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In our opinion, the fact that alleged victims of unlawful stalking are law enforcement officers, whether on duty or off duty, does not prevent a conviction under s 7 of POHA if all the elements of the offence specified in s 7(2) are established. Even an armed law enforcement officer on duty could feel harassed or be alarmed or distressed if a person or, worse, several persons, insist on tailing him or keeping him under surveillance. Here again, we emphasise that decisions on unlawful stalking have to be commonsensical and are highly fact-dependent. We shall have more to say about victims being law enforcement officers when considering the appropriate sentence to impose for unlawful stalking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For the reasons that we have set out above, we agreed with the Magistrate that the s 7 POHA charges against Lee and Tan were proved beyond reasonable doubt. We therefore dismissed their appeals against conviction on these charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appeals against sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable sentencing framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On the issue of whether the victims’ identity as law enforcement officers should affect sentence, the YAC submitted that it should be an aggravating factor if the unlawful stalking occurred in relation to the execution of such a victim’s execution of his or her duty as a public servant or public service worker (as defined under s 6(5) of POHA for the purposes of s 6). She submitted that the starting position should be a short custodial sentence to reflect society’s opprobrium towards anti-social behaviour occurring while the public servant or the public service worker is trying to perform his or her duties and the need to deter the public from such anti-social behaviour. The Prosecution agreed with the YAC on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As for the sentencing framework and guidelines for s 7 POHA offences, the YAC submitted that the methodology used in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim </span>should not be followed, particularly in the light of the criticisms against such an approach set out in another High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Sim Kang Wei.</span> Instead, the YAC proposed a two-step framework adapted from that in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”). This considered first, the offence-specific factors (based roughly on the considerations listed in s 7(5) of the POHA) and second, the offender-specific factors. In contrast, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing framework should be modelled after that in <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span><span class="font-italic"> Vladislav v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 4 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>”) because this was in line with the courts’ preference in recent years to adopt a harm-culpability analysis. Its structured approach was also suitable for an offence like unlawful stalking which could involve very varied factual situations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Chan Seng Onn J formulated a sentencing framework for unlawful stalking offences that refined the two-step methodology in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> by introducing a points system to identify the appropriate sentencing band. In Chan J’s view, a key advantage of the <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim</span> framework was that it allowed for calibration among offence-specific factors and within each factor (at [42]). The more nuanced analysis helped to avoid the problem of congregation of sentences around three to six months’ imprisonment. However, in <span class="font-italic">Sim Kang Wei</span>, Chua Lee Ming J declined<span class="font-italic"> </span>to follow the <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim </span>framework. Chua J disagreed with the view taken in <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>. He pointed out that the points system correlated rigidly the highest aggravating weight of any given factor to the other factors and constrained the sentencing judge unduly. The points system also raised problems in relation to the imposition of the maximum sentence (<span class="font-italic">Sim Kang Wei </span>at [37]–[40]). In <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Ng Wei Long </span>[2019] SGMC 78, Magistrate Chua Wei Yuan did a comparison of the two High Court decisions and gave a detailed analysis on why he was not fully persuaded by either of the approaches in <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim </span>or <span class="font-italic">Sim Kang Wei</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In our judgment, merely analogising from precedents is unsatisfactory as the lack of structure and guidance is not conducive to building consistency across cases. On the other hand, we think that the mathematical approach in <span class="font-italic">Lim Teck Kim </span>should not be adopted. A points system in sentencing may constrain the sentencing judge unduly and raises the spectre of appeals on the allocation of points (for instance, whether a trial court ought to have allocated a higher or a lower number of points to a particular factor). We prefer a more holistic approach since sentencing is not a scientific exercise and does not demand mathematical precision, which is quite impractical in any case when dealing with human beings and the multifarious situations in the cases. We repeat the Court of Appeal’s words in the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Akebal s/o Ghulam Jilani v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2019] SGCA 81 at [20(b)]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [S]entencing guidelines are not meant to yield a mathematically perfect graph that identifies a precise point for the sentencing court to arrive at in each case.

As mentioned above and as is evident from s 7 itself, unlawful stalking can take many varied forms and each case must necessarily be decided on its particular facts. In each case, the court should: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Identify the level of harm caused by the offence (slight, moderate or severe) and level of culpability (low, medium or

They provide for doubling of the maximum punishment that the court could impose for a s 7 offence (as well as offences under other sections of POHA) where the victim is a “vulnerable person” or where the victim was or is in an intimate relationship with the perpetrator respectively. This serves to remind the sentencing court not to double count these factors in sentencing. We also note that s 8 of POHA provides for enhanced punishments for a subsequent offence under s 7 (as well as offences under other sections of POHA), again by doubling the maximum punishments for that offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In relation to factor (h) in the list of offence-specific factors that go towards culpability (see [36] above), we agreed with the YAC and the Prosecution that the fact that the victim is a public servant or public service worker (including a law enforcement officer) is an aggravating factor. However, this would only<span class="font-italic"> </span>be the case if the offender knows that the victim is a public servant or public service worker<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>who is in the course of discharging his or her duty or the unlawful stalking is precipitated by what the victim said or did while in the course of discharging his or her duty. However, we disagreed with the YAC and the Prosecution that the default starting point should be a short custodial sentence whenever this aggravating factor is present. As the YAC acknowledged, there were no statistics to show an increase in offences against this category of victims or a disproportionate number of unlawful stalking offences committed against them so as to justify a default custodial sentence for the purpose of deterrence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lee’s and Tan’s sentences </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The maximum punishments provided under s 7(6) of POHA are a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. The Prosecution submitted that the present case was one which occasioned slight harm and low culpability, considering the minimal harm caused to the victims, the unsophisticated manner of tailing the victims, the appellants’ motive and the fact that the appellants knew that the victims were public officers in the course of discharging their duties. The indicative sentencing range was thus a fine or short custodial sentence of up to two months. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As noted by the Magistrate, Lee had an antecedent for committing affray in 2009 while Tan had an antecedent of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty way back in 1986. For completeness, Chow (the third man in the Lorry who pleaded guilty to his s 7 POHA charge) had an antecedent of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means in 1993.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In our view, this case occasioned slight harm and low culpability (or perhaps the low end of medium culpability). We considered that the appropriate starting point was an imprisonment term. The custodial threshold was crossed having regard to the specific aggravating factor that the appellants knew that the victims were public officers going about their duties that night and were apparently undeterred by the presence of the APO. We also note that there was a lack of remorse as evidenced in the stance they persisted in taking even before us when it was clear that some of their attempts to justify or explain their conduct were simply not tenable. We further note that at the appeal before us, the Prosecution moderated the suggested length of sentence downwards to not less than five weeks’ imprisonment. Four months’ imprisonment in these circumstances would be manifestly excessive. In all the circumstances, we held that a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each appellant would be appropriate. As the s 6 charges (which were not the subject of any appeal) took place as an offshoot of the s 7 charges and were essentially part of the train of events that night, we think the imprisonment terms for both offences ought to run concurrently. The result was that Lee and Tan would each serve an aggregate sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment which we considered was a just punishment on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 We were aware that Chow was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment and had served his sentence already. In our opinion, it would have been more than arguable that Chow’s sentence was also manifestly excessive despite his antecedent which was more than two decades old at the material time. However, Chow did not appeal against his sentence and the Magistrate rightly took into consideration the parity principle when she considered Lee and Tan’s sentences. Nevertheless, we think that the parity principle cannot justify sustaining a subsequent manifestly excessive sentence on a co-accused if the first sentence was also manifestly excessive but not appealed against. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We therefore dismissed the appellants’ appeals against conviction but allowed their appeals against sentence to the extent explained above. Tan indicated that he was prepared to begin serving his sentence immediately after the appeal while Lee asked for a deferment of two weeks to take care of his new shop. We granted the deferment and ordered Lee to surrender himself at the State Courts on 21 February 2020 to commence serving his sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We thank the YAC, Ms Leong Yi-Ming, for her time and effort in preparing the written submissions and in attending the hearing to assist the Court with her views on the legal issues.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Decision of the Court (delivered by Tay Yong Kwang JA):</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome: Court dismisses appellants’ appeals against conviction but allows
their appeals against sentence for charges of unlawful stalking under s 7
of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“POHA”), and
substitutes their sentences of four months’ imprisonment each with two
weeks’ imprisonment each.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment:</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
· Court provides guidance on when conduct on a single occasion is
“protracted” so as to qualify as a “course of conduct” under s 7(2) of the
POHA: at <strong>[21]</strong>, <strong>[22]</strong>, and    <strong>[23]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
· Court sets out sentencing framework applicable to offences under s 7 of
the POHA: at <strong>[34] </strong>and <strong>[35]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
· Court explains the relevance of the fact that victims of unlawful
stalking are law enforcement officers to conviction and sentence: at    <strong>[29] </strong>and <strong>[39]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Background
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 The appellants, Mr Lee Shing Chan (“Lee”) and Mr Tan Ah Lai (“Tan”), were
unlicensed fruit hawkers. On 6 June 2016 at about 6.45pm, they along with
one Mr Chow Yong Heng (“Chow”) were spotted selling fruits illegally near
Yew Tee MRT station by two National Environment Agency (“NEA”) officers
(“Shammir” and “Siow”). Tan was issued a summons for being an unlicensed
hawker, and the fruits and two wooden planks that formed part of a
makeshift display table were seized. After issuing the summons, the NEA
team – comprising Shammir, Siow, their driver and a CISCO auxiliary police
officer (“APO”) – left in a van (“the NEA Van”).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 The appellants and Chow followed the NEA Van in their lorry (“the Lorry”)
to various destinations over the span of about three hours from around 7pm
to 10pm. This included following the NEA Van back to the NEA office (where
the NEA team unloaded the seized items during their shift), and
subsequently after the NEA Van departed from the NEA office. Along the way,
there was also an incident at a carpark (“the Seah Im carpark”) where both
vehicles were parked for the time being. Siow had alighted from the NEA Van
to take photographs of the Lorry. Lee, Tan and Chow then alighted from the
Lorry and Lee demanded to see Siow’s warrant card. When Siow refused to
produce his warrant card, Lee and Tan hurled vulgarities in the Hokkien
dialect at Siow. The driver and the APO alighted from the NEA Van and when
they and Siow tried to get back into the NEA Van, Lee stood in front of it
and held onto its doors. Chow did not take part in this confrontation.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 Arising from the above, Lee and Tan were each charged with one count of
using abusive words towards a public servant in relation to the execution
of his duty as such public servant, an offence under s 6 of the POHA. They
were also each charged with one count of unlawful stalking with the common
intention to cause alarm, an offence under s 7 of the POHA read with s 34
of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 Chow had pleaded guilty to the s 7 charge against him (he was not charged
under s 6 as he did not take part in the confrontation at the Seah Im
carpark) in earlier proceedings and was sentenced to undergo three months’
imprisonment. At the time of the hearing before the Court, Chow had already
served his sentence.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The decision at first instance
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 Lee pleaded guilty to the s 6 charge and claimed trial in respect of the
s 7 charge. Tan claimed trial for both his charges. The appellants were
tried jointly and conducted their own defences.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 In the State Courts, the Magistrate (“the Magistrate”) convicted the
appellants on all the charges against them. Lee was sentenced to one week’s
imprisonment for the s 6 charge and four months’ imprisonment for the s 7
charge. Tan was sentenced to nine days’ imprisonment and four months’
imprisonment for the corresponding charges. The Magistrate ordered the
sentences for each appellant to run consecutively. Lee and Tan appealed
against their convictions and sentences in respect of the s 7 charges.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Issues on appeal
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 The issues on appeal were: (a) whether the elements of unlawful stalking
were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, in particular, whether there was a
“course of conduct” although the appellants followed the NEA Van on only
one occasion; and (b) whether the sentences should stand in the light of
what this Court determined to be the applicable sentencing framework.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The Court’s decision on the appeals against conviction
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 On the question of when conduct on a single occasion is “protracted” so
as to qualify as a “course of conduct” under s 7(2) of the POHA, the Court
held that this was a fact-sensitive assessment that had to be made as a
matter of common sense. The court had to look at all the circumstances,
including the type, intensity and intrusiveness of the conduct. To be
protracted, conduct did not have to be continuous or uninterrupted. It was
invariably a matter of degree as to when seemingly innocuous behaviour
turned into a course of conduct of acts or omissions associated with
stalking. Generally, if the conduct on a single occasion was engaged in for
longer than would reasonably be considered sensible in the circumstances,
that would be a pointer towards it fulfilling the meaning of protracted
conduct under s 7(10) of the POHA. The assessment of whether conduct was
“protracted” under s 7(10)(<em>a</em>)(i) was essentially a qualitative
rather than a purely quantitative exercise. The court had to be satisfied
that there was a certain degree of persistence or continuity of purpose
which was unreasonable in the particular circumstances. To avoid
artificiality, too much emphasis ought not to be placed on whether conduct
was better classified as happening on one or multiple occasions (at    <strong>[21]</strong>, <strong>[22]</strong>, and <strong>[23]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 In the present appeals, the appellants’ conduct was protracted because
they had followed the NEA Van to numerous destinations over a three-hour
period. They persisted in doing so even after the NEA Van returned to the
NEA office during their shift and the seized goods had been unloaded. The
other elements under s 7 of the POHA were also established. The appellants
did not deny having followed the NEA Van. Their other contentions were
essentially an appeal against the Magistrate’s findings of fact, and the
Court was not satisfied that the Magistrate erred in her detailed
assessment of the evidence (at <strong>[24], [25] </strong>and    <strong>[26]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 The Court also held that the fact that the alleged victims of unlawful
stalking were law enforcement officers, whether on duty or off duty, did
not prevent a conviction under s 7 of the POHA if all the elements of the
offence specified in s 7(2) were established (at <strong>[29]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11 Accordingly, the Court found that the s 7 POHA charges against Lee and
Tan had been proved beyond reasonable doubt and dismissed their appeals
against conviction (at <strong>[30]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The Court’s decision on the appeals against sentence</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12 On the issue of the appropriate sentencing framework, the Court held
that merely analogising from precedents was unsatisfactory as the lack of
structure and guidance was not conducive to building consistency across
cases. On the other hand, the mathematical approach of a points system in    <em>Lim Teck Kim v Public Prosecutor</em> [2019] 5 SLR 279 should not be
adopted as it constrained the sentencing judge unduly and raised the
spectre of appeals on the allocation of points. A more holistic approach
based on the five-step methodology in    <em>Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecuto</em>r [2018] 4 SLR 609 was
appropriate. Therefore, in each case the court should (at    <strong>[34] </strong>and <strong>[35]</strong>):
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(a) Identify the level of harm caused by the offence (slight, moderate or
severe) and level of culpability (low, medium or high), having regard to
the offence-specific factors.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(b) Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range by reference to the
following matrix.

(c) Identify the appropriate starting point within that range, having
regard again to the offence-specific factors.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(d) Adjust the starting point based on offender-specific aggravating and
mitigating factors.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(e) Where an offender has been convicted of multiple charges, consider
whether further adjustments are necessary to take into account the totality
principle.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
13 The Court held that the fact that the victim was a public servant or
public transport worker (including a law enforcement officer) was an
offence-specific aggravating factor. However, this would only be the case
if the offender knew that the victim was a public servant or public service
worker who was in the course of discharging his or her duty or the unlawful
stalking was precipitated by what the victim said or did while in the
course of discharging his or her duty. The Court disagreed that the default
starting point should be a short custodial sentence whenever this
aggravating factor was present (at <strong>[39]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
14 Applying this framework, the present case occasioned slight harm and low
(or perhaps the low end of medium) culpability. The appropriate starting
point was an imprisonment term. The custodial threshold was crossed having
regard to the specific aggravating factor that the appellants knew that the
victims were public officers going about their duties that night and were
apparently undeterred by the presence of the APO. The Court also noted that
there was a lack of remorse on the appellants’ part. In all the
circumstances, a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each appellant
would be appropriate. As the s 6 charges (which were not the subject of any
appeal) took place as an offshoot of the s 7 charges and were essentially
part of the train of events that night, the imprisonment terms for both
offences ought to run concurrently. The result was that Lee and Tan would
each serve an aggregate sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment which the Court
considered was a just punishment on the facts of this case (at [    <strong>42]</strong>).
