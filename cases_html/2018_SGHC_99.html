These included drama or variety shows in respect of which the plaintiff held copyright licences from the Korean Broadcasters, and which it made available to its users for streaming on VIU. The five alleged flagrantly infringing online locations were DramaNice, DramaCool, MyAsianTV, KShowOnline and KissAsian (“the alleged FIOLs”). The plaintiff also obtained confirmation from the Korean Broadcasters that they had never issued copyright licences for any of these drama or variety shows to any of the owners or operators of the alleged FIOLs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 There was evidence suggesting that the volume of traffic to each of the alleged FIOLs was high.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The plaintiff further relied on the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Corporation and another v Credit Suisse </span>[1981] 3 WLR 766 (“<span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span>”). There, it was held that, notwithstanding the rule against maintenance and champerty, an assignment of a bare right of action is valid if the assignee has a genuine commercial interest in the success of the litigation (at 779) (“the <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exception”). The <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exception<span class="font-italic"> </span>had been applied in <span class="font-italic">Ma v Ma </span>[2012] OJ No 2689, where the Ontario Court of Appeal cited assignments of the right to sue for copyright infringement to performing rights societies as an example in which the assignee has a sufficient interest in the success of the litigation to come within the <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exception. The plaintiff also cited the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Microsoft Corporation and </span><span class="font-italic">others v PC Club Australia Pty Ltd and others </span>(2006) 67 IPR 262, which also applied the <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exception in finding that a right to sue in respect of undetected copyright infringements did not fall afoul of the rule against maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The plaintiff argued that it had a “genuine and substantial interest” in the success of the litigation as a licensee of the copyright in the drama and variety shows produced by the Korean Broadcasters. Thus, under the <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exception, it had been validly assigned the right to sue for copyright infringement by the Korean Broadcasters. This meant the plaintiff was “effectively” the owner of the copyright for the purpose of this application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At the hearing of this matter I suggested to learned counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Nicholas Lauw (“Mr Lauw”), that the validity of the assignment of the right to sue was a separate matter from whether such assignment (assuming it was valid) would make the plaintiff an <span class="font-italic">owner </span>of copyright for the purposes of the Act. Mr Lauw acknowledged that there is no provision within the Act which explicitly provides that an assignee of a right to sue for copyright infringement was a copyright owner. However, he pointed to ss 119(1) and 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act, which provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Actions for infringement</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">119. </span>— (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the owner of a copyright may bring an action for an infringement of the copyright.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assignments and licences in respect of copyright</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">194.</span> — (1) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) An assignment of copyright may be limited in any of the following ways, or in any combination of 2 or more of those ways:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  so as to apply to one or more, but not all, of the classes of acts which by virtue of this Act the owner of the copyright has <span class="font-italic">the exclusive right</span> to do (including any one or more classes of acts not separately designated in this Act as being restricted by the copyright, but falling within any of the classes of acts so designated);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Mr Lauw submitted that s 119(1) conferred the copyright owner with an “exclusive right” within the meaning of s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act: the right to bring any infringement action, including an action for an order under s 193DDA of the Act. As I understood it, the argument was that, read with s 119, s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) meant that an assignment of copyright may be limited so as to apply only to the right to pursue an action for infringement. The Korean Broadcasters’ act of assigning the right to bring an action for infringement to the plaintiff was a limited assignment <span class="font-italic">of copyright </span>which made the plaintiff a copyright owner.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendants’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Save for the fifth defendant, who did not participate in the proceedings, the defendants were aligned in submitting that the plaintiff did not have <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to apply for the relief in s 193DDA of the Act because it was neither an exclusive licensee nor an owner. Each of the defendants advanced slightly differing arguments in support of this position, although there were significant overlaps between the submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 All of the defendants cited <span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment Singapore Pte Ltd v Sim Kay Teck and another </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 869 (“<span class="font-italic">Alliance</span>”).

</div> In support of this position, the first defendant cited the English case of <span class="font-italic">Media C.A.T. </span><span class="font-italic">Limited v A &amp; Ors </span>[2010] EWPCC 17, as well as several cases from the US: <span class="font-italic">Righthaven</span><span class="font-italic"> LLC v Wayne Hoehn and another </span>(716 F.3d 1166) (“<span class="font-italic">Righthaven</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Silvers v Sony Pictures Entertainment </span><span class="font-italic">Inc </span>(402 F.3d 881) (“<span class="font-italic">Silvers</span>”). In oral submissions, counsel for the first defendant also maintained that the assignment agreements were of no effect because the Korean Broadcasters had purported to assign the plaintiff the right to sue for copyright infringement <span class="font-italic">only for the purposes of obtaining a site-blocking order </span>(see [9] above). While a chose in action was assignable, the remedy in s 193DDA of the Act was not a chose in action. Rather, it was a judicial remedy created by statute. The right to obtain an order under s 193DDA of the Act was therefore not assignable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The third defendant argued that a bare right to sue for infringement could not be assigned because it was “inherent in the proprietary interest” in a copyright. Thus, an assignment of a right of action was only valid where the proprietary interest in the copyright was also assigned.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The fourth defendant, too, argued that the Korean Broadcasters could not assign the plaintiff the right to sue for copyright infringement. However, its argument was based on the provisions of the Act. In direct contrast to the plaintiff (see [14]–[15] above), the fourth defendant argued that the term “exclusive right” in s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act <span class="font-italic">did not </span>include the right to bring an action for infringement. Rather, s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) should be read in light of ss 26 and 83 of the Act, which define the “exclusive rights” which comprise the copyright. Only one or more of these “exclusive rights” could be assigned by a copyright owner to a third party under s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. The right to commence an action for infringement was separately created under s 119(1) of the Act, and therefore was not an “exclusive right” which comprises the copyright in a work. Thus, s 194(2) suggested that the right to sue could not be separated and assigned to a third party by the copyright owner. Rather, that right “flows simply by virtue of being the copyright holder”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The question is whether this purported assignment has any effect in the operation of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 A site-blocking order under s 193DDA of the Act is a statutory remedy and the right to seek such a remedy is conferred by that provision upon copyright owners and exclusive licensees. In saying that it became an owner by virtue of the assignments, the plaintiff had put the cart before the horse. The issue is whether the remedy is available to a person who is neither a copyright owner or exclusive assignee but is the assignee of the copyright owner of the “right to make an application for a site blocking order”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As noted by the learned authors of Meagher, Gummow and Lehane’s <span class="font-italic">Equity: Doctrines and Remedies </span>(J D Heydon, M J Leeming and P G Turner eds) (LexisNexis Butterworths, 5th Ed, 2015) at para 6-480(g), whether a statutory cause of action is assignable depends on the terms of the statute. So in <span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span><span class="font-italic"> Trikamdas Mody and another v Sumikin Bussan International (HK) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1161 (“<span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span>”), the learned George Wei JC opined that the Official Assignee’s right to enforce ss 76 and 105 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) was personal to the Official Assignee and was incapable of assignment. Sections 76 and 105 of the Bankruptcy Act provide for a stay of proceedings against a bankrupt and/or his property upon the making of a bankruptcy order. Section 112 of the same statute sets out the Official Assignee’s powers to bring, institute or defend any action or legal proceedings relating to the property of the bankrupt. Wei JC observed that there was nothing in the wording of ss 76, 105 or 112 of the Bankruptcy Act which suggested that the power to bring an action to enforce ss 76 and 105 was intended to be assignable (at [53]). Wei JC also took note of ss 98, 99 and 103 of the Bankruptcy Act which expressly state that applications to unwind certain antecedent transactions (e.g. undervalue transactions, unfair preferences and extortionate credit transactions) had to be made by the Official Assignee (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 By the same token, s 193DDA(1) of the Act explicitly states that a site-blocking order may only be made “upon an application by the owner or exclusive licensee”. There is nothing in either s 193DDA itself or the other provisions of the Act to suggest that this right is intended to be assignable. The plaintiff in oral argument stated that there was “nothing in [the] Act that says [an owner] cannot assign the bare right to sue”. However, it was not open to this court to find that the right to seek a remedy created by statute in favour of two specific parties (owners and exclusive licensees) could be assigned to a third class of persons simply because there was no explicit prohibition of such assignment. The remarks of Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC in <span class="font-italic">Neo Corp Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(under judicial management) v Neocorp Innovations Pte Ltd and another application </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 681 at [38] (affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Neo Corp Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v </span><span class="font-italic">Neocorp Innovations Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 717), though made in relation to a rather different statutory right of action, are apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The right of action accorded to the judicial manager under s 227T (of the Companies Act) is a special statutory right. … Where <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">such a right is specially conferred by statute, it must be</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">exercised in accordance with the strict language of the provision itself</span>. As I have already pointed out above, the language of s 227T is clear: The right of action is vested in <span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">judicial manager – and no other. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A special (especially statutory) right is a privilege and should not be extended beyond its legitimate </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">boundaries. And the obvious boundaries are set by the statutory language itself. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Given the above analysis it was unnecessary for me to address the first defendant’s argument that the right to seek the remedy in s 193DDA of the Act was not assignable because it was not a <span class="font-italic">chose in action</span>. The primary reason that this right was not assignable was because the Act clearly limited that right to owners and exclusive licensees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As I have explained above, my view was that the plaintiff had put the cart before the horse. The logical approach was first to determine (a) whether the right to bring an action under s 193DDA of the Act was capable of assignment, and only if such assignment was possible, to then determine (b) whether such assignment would make the plaintiff an “owner of copyright” for the purpose of that provision. Since the first question was answered in the negative, it was unnecessary to consider the second question. That in itself was sufficient to dispose of the application. However the plaintiff submitted that this assignment made it the “effective” owner of the copyright and I turn to address this argument.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether being assigned the right to sue for infringement made the plaintiff an “owner of copyright”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The question before me is whether an assignment of <span class="font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> right to seek a remedy under s 193DDA of the Act makes the plaintiff the owner of the copyright.</span> Posed in this manner, the obvious answer is in the negative.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Copyright comprises “a bundle of legally enforceable exclusive rights in respect of certain types of products of ‘intellectual’ activity” (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Copyright in Singapore </span>at 1.1). The question was whether the right to bring an action under s 193DDA of the Act is <span class="font-italic">part of </span>the bundle of rights which constitutes a copyright, such that owning that right would make a party a “copyright owner”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As I have mentioned, the plaintiff relied on s 119 read with s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act, and contended that an assignment of copyright may be limited so as to apply only to the right to pursue an action for infringement. The plaintiff seemed to suggest that s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) implicitly equates the term “copyright” with “the classes of acts which by virtue of [the Act] the owner of the copyright has the exclusive right to do”. A copyright owner in the shoes of the Korean Broadcasters has an “exclusive right” to bring actions for infringement, thus, being assigned that right is a partial assignment of copyright which makes the plaintiff an “owner of the copyright”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, in my view, s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act was of limited assistance to the plaintiff. That provision defines how an assignment of copyright may be limited, but it does not define what exactly a copyright <span class="font-italic">is</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>or what bundle of rights it comprises. At first blush, s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) may <span class="font-italic">implicitly </span>suggest that a copyright includes any act which the owner is exclusively entitled to do under the Act. Yet the term “copyright” should not be understood in light of what s 194(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) implicitly suggests. Rather, I agreed with the fourth defendant that what a copyright comprises is explicitly defined in provisions such as ss 26 and 82–86 of the Act, which describe the <span class="font-italic">nature </span>of copyright. In the case of drama or variety shows such as those in respect of which the plaintiff is licensee, as these are cinematograph films, the nature of copyright is defined by s 83 of the Act as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Nature of copyright in cinematograph films</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">83. </span>For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, copyright, in relation to a cinematograph film, is the exclusive right to do all or any of the following acts:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to make a copy of the film;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to cause the film, insofar as it consists of visual images, to be seen in public;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to communicate the film to the public.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It follows that only an owner of <span class="font-italic">one of these rights </span>is an “owner of the copyright” in the drama or variety shows. The right to sue in respect of infringement, or the right to apply for a site-blocking order under s 193DDA of the Act, is not a copyright, but a remedy available to the owner of a copyright. Thus, even if I had taken the view that the right to seek the remedy in s 193DDA <span class="font-italic">could </span>be assigned by the Korean Broadcasters to the plaintiff via the assignment agreements, such assignment would not make the plaintiff a “copyright owner”. It follows that the plaintiff, being neither an owner nor exclusive licensee of copyright in the drama or variety shows, had no <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to bring the present application.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lauw Yu An, Nicholas Lynwood and Leow Jiamin (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Chan Kwok Chuan Jason and Ong Eu-Jin (Amica Law LLC) for the first and sixth defendants;<br/>Chua Yeow Hooi and Mervyn Lau (Robinson LLC) for the second defendant;<br/>Koh Chia Ling and Kevin Elbert (OC Queen Street LLC) for the third, seventh and eighth defendants;<br/>Lim Yee Ming and Kok Zihao (Kelvin Chia Partnership) for the fourth, ninth and tenth defendants;<br/>fifth defendant not represented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
