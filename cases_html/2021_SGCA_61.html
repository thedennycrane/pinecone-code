In particular, would an adjudication determination judgment debtor (“ADJ debtor”) be able to stave off a winding-up petition brought by an adjudication determination judgment creditor (“ADJ creditor”) by raising a cross-claim against the latter or by disputing the adjudication debt? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The appellant, Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte. Ltd (“DGE”), a subcontractor, secured an adjudication determination in its favour in respect of sums due under a payment claim, Payment Claim 17 (“PC 17”) which it promptly, (as it was perfectly entitled to), applied to enforce by way of a judgment entered under s 27(1) of the SOPA (“s 27(1) SOPA Judgment”). DGE then served a statutory demand on the contractor, Zhong Kai Construction Company Pte. Ltd (“ZK”), demanding payment of the judgment debt. When ZK failed to pay the same, DGE filed a petition to wind up ZK in HC/CWU 95/2020 (“CWU 95”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 ZK subsequently applied in HC/SUM 1577/2020 (“SUM 1577”) for the winding up petition to be stayed unconditionally or dismissed. The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) allowed ZK’s application and ordered that CWU 95 be stayed unconditionally pending the determination of a High Court suit between ZK and DGE, on the basis that ZK had raised a genuine cross-claim against the judgment debt therein. DGE appealed against the Judge’s decision. We heard the appeal on 1 February 2021 and dismissed the appeal, but varied the Judge’s order by imposing the condition that ZK pay into court the amount stated in the statutory demand made by DGE within 14 days from the date of the hearing before us for CWU 95 to be stayed. We now give our detailed grounds for our decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties and contractual matrix  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 DGE and ZK are both Singapore-incorporated companies in the building and construction industry.

</div> ZK engaged DGE as a subcontractor for the supply of materials, equipment and tools to carry out and complete the external facade aluminium cladding, blast/ballistic doors and windows, aluminium door and window works (“the Subcontract Works”) for a project  (“the Project”) valued at S$558,055. As the Project involved works at Changi Airport, further up the contractual chain, there was a main contract based upon the Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract (“PSSCOC”), with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (“CAAS”) as principal. There was also a Superintending Officer, Surbana Jurong Infrastructure Pte Ltd (“SO”), who had the final say over important matters like interim payments, variations, extensions of time, choice and approval of material, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. There are appropriate references in the Subcontract and its Annexes to the CAAS, SO and the main contract. For completeness, ZK was itself a subcontractor in the Project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Project was divided into two phases, Phase 1 (an 8-storey Equipment Building) and Phase 2A (a 2-storey Annex Building, excluding an Airport Emergency Service Watchroom). The Subcontract was expressed to commence immediately and, pursuant to cl 4 of the Subcontract, the scheduled dates for the completion of Phases 1 and 2A of the Project were to be no later than 31 July 2017 and 20 February 2017 respectively.

Clause 6 also provided that ZK was “entitled to deduct or set-off against any monies due to [DGE] under the Subcontract… or to recover such amount or amounts from the [Subcontract] as a debt; for such damages as incurred by [DGE] arising from such delay”.

It is important to note that we make no binding or final findings of fact in the following paragraphs or elsewhere in these grounds of decision. We merely record what we see in contemporaneous documents put before us and we have borne in mind that the picture is not complete. All these allegations will no doubt be fully explored during the course of the legal proceedings between the parties, and we make reference only to the details that are necessary for our purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 There is little evidence on the Project in its earlier stages. As noted above, the Subcontract provided for immediate commencement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 7 November 2016, and fairly short completion dates. Not unexpectedly, the Subcontract also provided that the Subcontract Works were to be carried out strictly in accordance with the “Master Programme” (of the main contractor). There were 16 payment certificates before PC 17, and counsel for DGE confirmed that DGE had not taken out any adjudication application to enforce interim payments until PC 17. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 However, based on the documents before us, we can surmise that the disagreements between the parties most likely began in early 2018. There is correspondence showing allegations from DGE that, from that period onwards, there were delays in its completion of the Subcontract Works because of late approvals, changes to specifications, unsigned variations and slow or inadequate payment by ZK.

There was, perhaps amongst others, an issue over the purchase of cabin glass. This is not the correct forum to go into the rights and wrongs of that issue.

The following exchanges of emails and letters evidence the breakdown and eventual termination of the Subcontract:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 30 May 2018, DGE sent a letter to ZK in response to the email of 24 April 2018 referred to at [10] above. It refuted the allegations made by ZK in relation to the cabin glass, stating that “there was no delay by DGE” and that “the SOI [ZK] enclosed [was] inapplicable”. DGE also complained that despite their progress claims, no payment had been made on an outstanding sum of S$261,006.74 in relation to variation works, and it accused ZK of refusing to approve the same. It further alleged that the Subcontract Works were almost completed and demanded payment of S$149,436.99, being the balance after deducting S$111,569.75 for the cabin glass, by 12pm on 5 June 2018, failing which DGE “[would] treat this [Subcontract] as terminated and… proceed to enforce [its] rights as [it] [saw] fit.”

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On 1 April 2020, ZK filed SUM 1577 seeking:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an order dismissing CWU 95;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) alternatively, an order that CWU 95 and all related proceedings be stayed or restrained pending the disposal of the Consolidated Suit; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) alternatively, an order that the hearing for CWU 95 be adjourned pending the disposal of the Consolidated Suit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On 24 June 2020, the Judge heard both OS 223 and SUM 1577. The Judge dismissed OS 223 but allowed ZK’s application in SUM 1577 to stay CWU 95 until the determination of the Consolidated Suit and any appeal thereof. Her brief grounds of decision (“Judgment”) are set out in a minute sheet dated the same day. For present purposes, we summarise only the Judge’s findings <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> SUM 1577. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Judge found that ZK had a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and serious cross-claim against DGE based on substantial grounds, and that the value of this cross-claim might exceed the Judgment Debt. In her view, the cross-claim raised triable issues such as (a) whether it was ZK or DG who was in repudiatory breach of the Subcontract; (b) whether ZK could rely upon cl 6 of the Subcontract to claim liquidated damages; (c) whether some of ZK’s claims even arose from the Subcontract; and (d) whether certain costs and expenses incurred by ZK could be claimed against DGE. The Judge was also of the view that ZK’s pleadings were sufficiently particularised to set out its cause of action against DGE (Judgment at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Judge further held that it could not be definitively concluded that ZK was abusing the court process by commencing S 917 and S 1282 against DGE. Although it was DGE who had first served a payment claim on ZK, ZK had commenced S 917 even before DGE commenced AA 339 (Judgment at [25]). Accordingly, the Judge found that it was appropriate to grant the stay sought by ZK. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments on appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 On appeal, DGE challenged the Judge’s decision to grant a stay of CWU 95. In this regard, DGE’s principal argument was that ZK did not have a genuine cross-claim against DGE, and that it was merely using the Consolidated Suit to avoid paying the Judgment Debt to DGE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 DGE also made the alternative argument that, even if ZK was found to have a valid cross-claim against DGE, CWU 95 ought to be stayed only on the condition that ZK first paid the sum of S$211,044 (being the value of the Judgment Debt) into court as security.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In response, ZK submitted that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) ZK’s cross-claim was serious and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>as it raised numerous triable issues; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there were no special circumstances justifying a refusal of a stay of CWU 95; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there were no valid grounds for a conditional stay for CWU 95. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The appeal before us arises only from SUM 1577 which, as stated at [23] above, is an application to dismiss CWU 95 or, alternatively, to stay or adjourn the hearing for CWU 95 pending the disposal of the Consolidated Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Before us, both parties accepted that the court is generally empowered to stay a winding-up application against a debtor on two grounds: (a) first, where the debtor <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> disputes the debt in the statutory demand on substantial grounds (see <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”) at [16]–[19]); and/or (b) secondly, where the debtor has a serious cross-claim against the creditor based on substantial grounds (see <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 at [82] (“<span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It should be noted that ZK, correctly in our view, did not attempt to dispute the debt comprised in the AD or the s 27(1) SOPA Judgment obtained thereon. It is not open to ZK to dispute that debt at this juncture before this Court because s 21(1) of the SOPA confers temporary finality on the AD and there are presently no legal proceedings afoot to invalidate the AD on legal grounds: see <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380 (“<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction</span>”) at [71]. The AD and the s 27(1) SOPA Judgment can only be challenged before an arbitral tribunal or a court seised of the final resolution and determination of all disputes between the parties in relation to this project, which usually takes place after the contract is completed or terminated as the case may be.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Accordingly, the primary question before this Court is whether ZK has a cross-claim against DGE which justifies the dismissal of CWU 95, or a stay or adjournment thereof. This question engages the following subsidiary issues: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What is the applicable standard of review for a cross-claim that is raised by a debtor to stay or dismiss a winding-up petition?  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Should the requirements for obtaining a stay of a winding-up application (including the applicable standard of review mentioned in (a) above) be modified in cases where the debt underlying the winding-up petition arises from an adjudication determination under the SOPA? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On the facts, does ZK have a cross-claim against DGE which equals or exceeds S$211,044 (being the value of the Judgment Debt) and meets the requisite standard of review? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If ZK is granted a stay of CWU 95, should that stay be conditional or unconditional in nature?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We address these issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable standard of review for a cross-claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We begin by examining the applicable standard of review for a cross-claim which is raised by a debtor to stay or dismiss a winding-up petition against it. In our view, this question merits particular attention in light of this Court’s recent pronouncement in <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v VTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Co) </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1158 (“<span class="font-italic">AnAn</span>”), which significantly altered the law in this area in so far as cross-claims or disputed debts which are the subject of arbitration agreements are concerned. Prior to <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span>, our courts have expressed varying formulations of the standard of proof to be applied in such cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">De Montfor</span><span class="font-italic">t University v Stanford Training Systems Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 218 (“<span class="font-italic">De Montfor</span><span class="font-italic">t University</span>”), disputes arose between Stanford Training Systems Pte Ltd (“STS”) and De Montfort University (“DMU”), an English university which delivered courses in Singapore through STS. DMU served a statutory demand on STS claiming that the latter owed it £91,931.28. STS responded that it would be able to raise various counterclaims, including but not limited to a claim in respect of losses suffered as a result of DMU’s failure to deliver various programmes as agreed between the parties. DMU then proceeded to file a petition to wind up STS on 17 May 2005. On 13 June 2005, STS commenced a civil action against DMU. Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) ordered a stay of the winding-up petition pending the determination of the civil action. In his decision, Tay J cited the following authorities: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Re Sanpete Builders (S) Pte Ltd </span>[1989] 1 SLR(R) 5 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Sanpete</span>”) for the rule that the mere fact that a defendant obtained leave to defend an action relating to a debt in an application under O 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) might not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> suffice to show that his defence is not a frivolous one, or that the debt is disputed on substantial grounds;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Re Great Britain Mutual Life Assurance Society </span>(1880) 16 Ch D 246, where Jessel MR said (at 253): “[I]t is not sufficient for the Respondents, upon a petition of this kind, to say ‘We dispute the claim.’ They must bring forward a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case which satisfies the Court that there is something which ought to be tried, either before the Court itself, or in an action, or by some other proceeding”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">Malayan Plant (Pte) Ltd v Moscow Narodny Bank</span> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 511, where the Privy Council said (at [18]): “There is no distinction in principle between a cross-claim of substance … and a serious dispute regarding the indebtedness imputed against a company, which has long been held to constitute a proper ground upon which to reject a winding-up petition.”            </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Having reviewed the above authorities, Tay J stated (at [28]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…I prefer the view that once unconditional leave has been granted and the order stands, either because the plaintiff decides not to appeal or because the order is affirmed on appeal, another forum should not revisit and reopen the same issues. If unconditional leave to defend has been given to a defendant in a claim on a debt, surely that means that there is a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or a genuine dispute. Of course, it does not mean that the defendant will probably succeed in his defence at the trial of the action. It merely means that his defence is not a frivolous one or, in the words of Chao JC [in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Sanpete</span>], the debt is ‘disputed on some substantial grounds’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In another first instance decision, <span class="font-italic">LKM Investment Holdings Pte Ltd v Cathay Theatres Pte Ltd </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 135 (“<span class="font-italic">LKM Investment</span>”), Judith Prakash J (as she then was) similarly ruled that the statutory presumption of insolvency could not be invoked against a company served with a statutory demand if the company <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> disputed the debt. However, it was not an abuse of process for a judgment creditor to serve a statutory demand on a judgment debtor merely because the judgment was under appeal. If enforcement of that judgment had not been stayed, the judgment creditor was entitled to take all legal steps open to him to recover the amount of the judgment debt. Prakash J also opined that once the matter had been tried at first instance and decided against the judgment debtor, the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>position was that the debtor had no defence to the claim and any further dispute over the debt would not be <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> (at [21]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Both the courts in <span class="font-italic">De Montford University</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Sanpete</span> espoused the principle that a winding-up petition should not be used as a means to enforce payment of a debt which is <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>disputed or which can potentially be extinguished by a cross-claim, and that to do so is an abuse of the process of the court. This Court later echoed the same view in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 (“<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>”), decrying the use of “a shortcut by the backdoor to try and enforce a contested claim by issuing a s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) [CA] statutory notice” and stating in no uncertain terms that had this been done in the case before them, “it would have amounted to an abuse of the court’s winding-up jurisdiction” (at [7]). This Court further opined that a court’s function in a winding-up petition is not to adjudicate on or decide a disputed claim, and held that once the recipient of a statutory notice had offered to secure the disputed debt, the issue of substantiality or insubstantiality of the dispute fell by the wayside and was no longer a relevant consideration given that the debtor was not unable to pay its debts (at [7]).     <span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>, the appellant, Metalform Asia (“MA”), owed the respondent, Holland Leedon Pte Ltd (“HL”), a sum of money for the supply of steel to MA. HL served a statutory demand on MA under s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA and MA applied for an injunction to prevent HL from presenting a winding-up petition until MA’s claim for damages against HL arising from another sale and purchase agreement had been determined. MA claimed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that it had a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> cross-claim on substantial grounds which exceeded the disputed debt. This Court held (at [87]) that the standard of proof which an applicant had to meet in order to stay a winding-up application on the basis that he had a serious cross-claim on substantial grounds was that the winding-up application was unlikely to succeed, or it was likely that the court would hold over the petition in order to allow the cross-claim to be determined first (collectively referred to hereafter as the “unlikely to succeed” standard). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The approach in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> may be juxtaposed with that in <span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Recreation</span>, where this Court held (at [23]) that the applicable standard of proof for staying a winding-up application on the basis that the applicant had a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute over the debt claimed by the petitioning creditor was “no more than that for resisting a summary judgment application, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the debtor… need only raise triable issues in order to obtain a stay or dismissal of the winding-up application” (referred to hereafter as the “triable issue” standard).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> did not clarify whether the “triable issue” standard was distinct from the “unlikely to succeed” standard which had earlier been held to apply to cross-claims in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>However, the two standards were treated as equivalent in several High Court cases that followed. In <span class="font-italic">Denmark </span><span class="font-italic">Skibstekniske Konsulenter A/S I Likvidation (formerly known as Knud E Hansen A/S) v Ultrapolis 3000 Investments Ltd (formerly known as Ultrapolis 3000 Theme Park Investments Ltd) </span>[2011] 4 SLR 997<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span>”), it was concluded at [26] (referring to <span class="font-italic">Ashworth v </span><span class="font-italic">Newnote Ltd </span>[2007] EWCA Civ 793 at [33]) that any linguistic divergence between the “triable issues” standard in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>and the “unlikely to succeed” standard in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was “a distinction without difference”.

After comprehensively reviewing the authorities in Singapore, England, Hong Kong, the Eastern Caribbean and Malaysia, this Court decided that a lower <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard of review should be applied in lieu of the “triable issue” standard in such cases. Under the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard, the winding-up proceedings would be stayed or dismissed as long as (a) there was a valid arbitration agreement between the parties; and (b) the dispute fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement, provided that the dispute was not being raised by the debtor in abuse of the court’s processes (<span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [56]). It is worth setting out the relevant passages of <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span> that explain the rationale for this approach: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">No differing standards for disputed debts and cross-claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58 Before detailing our reasons for adopting the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard of review, we pause to emphasise that the standard of review applies equally to disputed debts and cross-claims, which are the two bases that a debtor may raise to resist a winding-up application.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59 … Whether a cross-claim or disputed debt is raised, the debtor is simply asserting that the debt claimed is insufficient to prove its insolvency, and that the winding-up order ought therefore not to be granted. There is therefore no justifiable basis for applying a different standard of review to cross-claims on the one hand, and disputed debts on the other. As this court had observed in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> ([15] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [25], the “tests for both of the situations” must “necessarily mirror each other”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Coherence in the law</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">60     Adopting the lower standard of review would, in our view, promote coherence in the law concerning stay applications, so that parties to an arbitration agreement are not encouraged to present a winding-up application as a tactic to pressure an alleged debtor to make payment on a debt that is disputed or which may be extinguished by a legitimate cross-claim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)   Coherence is to be preferred to prevent abuse of winding-up proceedings</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61     In this regard, the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard has been adopted for stay applications under s 6 of both the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“AA”) and the IAA.

Hence, if a creditor claims for a debt <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> before the court, the debtor would simply have to demonstrate on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis that there is an arbitration clause and that the dispute is caught by that clause.

This was evident from the specially convened five-judge coram, as well as the court’s comprehensive review of the authorities, the policies involved and the articulated aim of coherence in the law on stay applications (<span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60], reproduced above). In arriving at its decision, this Court considered stay applications in both international and domestic arbitration, and noted that the adoption of the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard would align the law governing exclusive jurisdiction clauses, <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>and stay applications under the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) and the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) <span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">AnAn </span>at [52] and [74]).<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In our view, the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard of review should also apply in building and construction cases like the present where the cross-claim is <span class="font-italic">not</span> the subject of an arbitration agreement. It would make little sense for the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard of review to apply where the dispute comprised in the cross-claim or disputed debt is the subject of an arbitration agreement, and for the higher triable issue standard to apply where it is not. The case for a consistent approach is also compelling in building and construction cases where the winding-up proceedings in question are premised on a debt which is incurred during the project, and the final determination of disputes in relation to the whole project is subject to resolution either by arbitration or through the courts, usually at some later stage (see <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 979 (“<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>”) at [63] and <span class="font-italic">Orion-One Residential Pte Ltd v Dong Cheng Construction Pte Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">another appeal </span>[2021] 1 SLR 791 (“<span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span>”) at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Thus, an applicant debtor who seeks to stay or dismiss a winding-up petition in a case like the present only needs to show, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard, the existence of a justiciable cross-claim that is likely to equal or exceed the claim against the debtor, and provided that the said dispute or cross-claim is not being raised in an abuse of the court’s process.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having said that, we acknowledge that the foregoing statement of the rule may potentially surface a conflict in cases, like the present, which involve winding-up petitions founded on adjudication determinations under the SOPA, as the policies underpinning the SOPA, specifically the philosophy of maintaining cash flow in the construction industry, seemingly contradict an ADJ debtor’s entitlement to stave off winding-up proceedings under the insolvency regime when it refuses to pay the stipulated sum in the AD or any judgment obtained thereon. We have already explained how the temporary finality of an adjudication determination means that an ADJ debtor cannot dispute the adjudication determination, or any judgment obtained thereon (see [32] above). It follows that such a debtor also cannot dispute the same to challenge a winding-up proceeding premised on the adjudication determination. However, in the context of cross-claims, the interface between the SOPA and insolvency regimes requires a careful and principled approach, which we deal with below.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The approach to winding-up petitions founded on adjudication determinations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having established the standard of review which applies to cross-claims <span class="font-italic">in general</span>, we turn to consider the <span class="font-italic">specific</span> approach which this court should adopt when considering stays or dismissals of winding-up petitions which are founded on adjudication determinations. When or under what circumstances would an ADJ debtor be allowed to stay or dismiss a winding-up petition premised on a debt arising from the adjudication determination, by alleging a cross-claim on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis? Although the parties did not focus on this issue in their submissions, we think it necessary to address it in some detail in order to reconcile the seemingly conflicting approaches in policy underpinning the court’s winding-up jurisdiction and the SOPA. The resolution of this apparent conflict is clearly salient to the outcome of the present appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The purposes and aims of the statutory adjudication regime under the SOPA have been well-articulated in many judgments of this Court and need little rehearsing. The SOPA, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, invalidates the pernicious and hitherto prevalent pay-when-paid clauses, and facilitates cash flow to contractors, subcontractors and suppliers in building and construction industry by providing a quick, low cost adjudication system to resolve interim payment disputes in construction projects. It is well-recognised that this efficient and speedy process is necessarily “rough and ready justice” and that, given the compressed timelines and sometimes voluminous evidence and documents, adjudicators may get things wrong. However, their adjudication determinations have temporary finality. This means that unless an adjudication determination is set aside by a court on legal or technical grounds, it is final and binding on the parties to the adjudication until their differences are finally and conclusively determined or resolved by an arbitral tribunal or a court, usually after the project is at an end. If a sum is determined by an adjudicator as due from A to B, A has to make payment even if A has reason to say the adjudication determination has errors; this can be found in the pithy adage “pay now, argue later”. This promotes the SOPA’s ultimate objective of facilitating cash flow in the building and construction industry: see <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction </span>at [18] and [20]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The first key to reconciling the ostensible conflict is to remember that the concept of temporary finality is, by its very meaning, only temporary. It is not for all time. An adjudication determination can be “opened up” by the tribunal or the court finally determining all the disputes between the parties at the end of their project: see s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA. That court or tribunal has the ability, the time and the means, which are not available to adjudicators, to examine the disputes with more thorough deliberation, and with all the processes and procedures in place to define the issues and explore the evidence. If the court or tribunal disagrees with the adjudication determination, it can amend or alter the determination or certificate, revoke any part or finding or determination by the adjudicator or certifier, or even overrule the determination altogether. This is settled law (see <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> at [53], <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [63] and <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction </span>at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is clear that temporary finality ends when the arbitral tribunal or court finally determines all the parties’ disputes, rights and obligations. When that happens, any judgment previously obtained under s 27 of the SOPA to enforce that adjudication determination must also cease to have effect; as common sense dictates, the fruit must fall with the tree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 At the other end of the scale is the situation where the project is ongoing and the ADJ debtor fails to make payment. This is the classic situation SOPA was enacted to redress. Besides the remedies spelt out under SOPA and common law, the ADJ creditor is entitled to levy execution on its judgment and this includes serving a statutory demand and failing payment, proceeding to apply to wind-up the ADJ debtor. Short of having the adjudication determination set aside on legal or technical grounds, the ADJ debtor is in no position to dispute the debt comprised in the adjudication determination; it has to pay the adjudicated sum or face the consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The real difficulty comes when the project comes or is coming to an end or has been terminated, and the downstream party takes out an adjudication application and secures an adjudication determination. To readily allow the ADJ debtor to halt enforcement of the adjudication determination by alleging a cross-claim on the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard might enable upstream parties to evade their payment obligations all too easily. This would end up stifling the cash flow and frustrate the “pay now, argue later” philosophy underlying the SOPA regime. There is every likelihood that that would revert the law to its position prior to the enactment of the SOPA, wherein upstream contractors could withhold payment to downstream contractors simply by asserting a set-off or cross-claim: see <span class="font-italic">Harmonious </span><span class="font-italic">Coretrades Pte Ltd v United Integrated Services Pte Ltd </span>[2020] 1 SLR 206 at [50], citing <span class="font-italic">Civil Tech Pte Ltd v Hua Rong Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 584 at [23]–[32]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It is not surprising to see that this is not the first occasion on which this conundrum has been in issue before the Singapore courts. There are two prior High Court decisions which directly address the issue that we have highlighted above. It is to these decisions which we now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Local position  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh (alias Lim Aster) v TS Ong Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 272 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span>”), the respondent commenced an adjudication application against the appellant under the SOPA and subsequently obtained an adjudication determination in its favour. The respondent then entered judgment in the terms of the adjudication determination and issued a statutory demand against the appellant for the outstanding amount owed under the judgment debt. The issue was whether the appellant could set aside the statutory demand under r 98(2) of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) on the basis that she had a valid cross-claim against the respondent in a separate High Court suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 One of the respondent’s key contentions was that the court ought not to set aside the statutory demand, even in the face of an ostensible competing cross-claim, because this would be contrary to the “pay now, argue later” philosophy undergirding the SOPA. After considering authorities from Australia, England and New Zealand, Edmund Leow JC concluded (at [69]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]n argument (however genuine and strong) that the <span class="font-italic">adjudicated amounts were not as a matter of contractual right due and payable</span> can never be a ground for setting aside a statutory demand based on a judgment obtained on an adjudication determination… This principle also applies with equal force to <span class="font-italic">preclude the setting </span><span class="font-italic">aside of statutory demands on the basis of cross claims which seek to deny the validity of the judgment debt</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 However, Leow JC recognised that the policy of facilitating cash flow in the construction industry was not one that Parliament intended to be achieved at all costs. Leow JC considered that this was evident from the parliamentary debates which took place during the second reading of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill 2004 (No 54/2004) (“the SOP Bill”). During the debates, then-Minister of State for National Development, Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng, had clarified that the SOPA regime would not upset the existing system of creditor priorities under the insolvency regime (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (16 November 2004) vol 78 at cols 1118–1119). In response, Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan, a then-Member of Parliament, had inquired whether this limitation to the scope of the SOP Bill would jeopardise subcontractors’ legitimate interests in being paid. To this, Mr Cedric Foo replied (at col 1133): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… She [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Dr Amy Khor] also asked why insolvency is not dealt with here, although payment woes in the construction industry are indeed a form of injustice. <span class="font-italic">But in the area of insolvency, there is a higher justice that must be served</span>. There is an established priority of payments that have to be made to different parties who have suffered as a result of a party going insolvent. So this priority should not be upset just because of the payment woes in the construction industry. <span class="font-italic">So we have therefore left insolvent cases alone so as not to disrupt a process which is working well.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In Leow JC’s view, the passages cited above indicated that “to the extent that there [was] a normative conflict between the legislative policy of facilitating cash flow in the construction industry and the wider purposes of the insolvency process… [Parliament was of the view that] the former must yield to the latter” (at [73]). Thus, Leow JC concluded that a debtor was not precluded from setting aside a statutory demand on the basis that he had a valid cross-claim against a creditor which, if successful, would liquidate the debt in the statutory demand, provided that such a cross-claim did not seek to deny the validity of the adjudication judgment debt. Since the appellant’s cross-claim gave rise to triable issues, was sufficiently quantified in monetary terms and was “clearly broader in scope than the adjudication”, Leow JC held that the statutory demand could be set aside (at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the subsequent decision of <span class="font-italic">Strategic Construction</span>, the plaintiff commenced an adjudication application against the defendant for amounts due for work done in a construction project. The defendant, in turn, commenced a High Court suit against the plaintiff, claiming that it had suffered loss and damage by reason of the plaintiff’s failure to rectify certain defects. Subsequently, the plaintiff obtained an adjudication determination in its favour, which it applied to enforce by way of a judgment. When the defendant refused to pay the judgment debt, the plaintiff took out a winding-up application against the defendant. The defendant sought a stay of the winding-up petition pending the disposal of the action in the High Court suit. One of the issues before the High Court was whether it was relevant that the plaintiff’s underlying claim had arisen under the SOPA. In this regard, the plaintiff asserted that it was entitled to “simply want [its] money” since this would give effect to the SOPA’s underlying purpose of expediting cash flow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Relying on the parliamentary debates for the SOP Bill (see [56] above), Tan Siong Thye J reached the same conclusion as Leow JC that Parliament had intended for the insolvency regime to prevail over the SOPA regime in the event of a conflict between the two. He thus held (at [57]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[E]ven though the policy underlying SOPA is expeditious dispute resolution for quick cash flow, it cannot override the scheme under the Companies Act, which gives a company that is the subject of winding-up proceedings a chance to prove its cross-claims before a winding-up order is made and the attendant consequences flow, if it can show that there is a triable issue as to the cross-claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Tan J also considered that the defendant’s willingness to pay the adjudicated amount into court as security, which was a procedural prerequisite that it would have had to fulfil if it had wanted to challenge the adjudication determination in court, was significant because it meant that the defendant’s actions would not lead to a circumvention of the SOPA (at [60]). Tan J thus allowed the defendant’s application for a stay on the basis that it had established a triable issue in the form of a genuine cross-claim, the value of which exceeded the amount claimed in the statutory demand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Position in other jurisdictions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The issue of whether an ADJ debtor can resist winding-up proceedings which are founded on a judgment debt arising from an adjudication determination has also been explored in a number of foreign jurisdictions, albeit in the context of applications to set aside statutory demands (as opposed to applications to stay insolvency proceedings pending the determination of a cross-claim or a dispute against the judgment debt). We briefly consider some of the foreign authorities which are relevant for our purposes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Australian position </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In <span class="font-italic">Diploma Construction (WA) Pty Ltd v KPA Architects Pty Ltd </span>[2014] WASCA 91 (“<span class="font-italic">Diploma</span>”), the applicant debtor was issued with a statutory demand based on a judgment entered in the terms of two adjudication determinations under the Construction Contracts Act 2004 (Western Australia) (“WA CCA”). The applicant sought to aside the statutory demand on the basis that it had an offsetting claim against the petitioning creditor. The Supreme Court of Western Australia held that an adjudication determination under the WA CCA gave rise to debts which were “due and payable” and which, accordingly, could not be challenged in bankruptcy proceedings on the basis that there was a “genuine dispute” as to their validity (at [59] and [62]). However, the court held that where a debtor had “genuine” offsetting claims against the petitioning creditor “arising from transactions separate from those that gave rise to judgment debt based upon an adjudication under the [WA CCA]”, there was no doubt that the debtor could successfully apply to set aside the statutory demand (at [68]). As to the test for a “genuine” offsetting claim, the court held that this meant that the offsetting claim had to be “bona fide… [it could not be] “spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived” (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 <span class="font-italic">Diploma </span>was subsequently affirmed and applied by the New South Wales Supreme Court (Equity Division) in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Douglas Aerospace Pty Ltd </span>[2015] NSWSC 167 (“<span class="font-italic">Douglas</span>”). In that case, Bereton J affirmed the Supreme Court of Western Australia’s holdings in <span class="font-italic">Diploma</span>, which he distilled to the following three propositions: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) an argument - however genuine and strong - that the adjudicated amounts were not in truth as a matter of contractual right due and payable, cannot give rise to a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the resultant judgment debt; and (2)(a) while a statutory demand founded on such a judgment debt can be set aside or varied if the company can show that it has a genuine offsetting claim sounding in money, (b) a contention that the adjudicated amount is not in truth as a matter of right due and payable is not a genuine offsetting claim. …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Bereton J thus recognised that the existence of a “genuine” offsetting claim – being one that admitted the debt arising from the adjudication determination, but asserted that there was a countervailing liability – would justify the setting aside of a statutory demand (at [98]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The principles in <span class="font-italic">Diploma </span>and <span class="font-italic">Douglas </span>were followed and further expounded upon by the New South Wales Supreme Court (Equity Division) in <span class="font-italic">Re J Group Constructions Pty Ltd </span>[2015] NSWSC 1607 (“<span class="font-italic">J Group</span>”). In that case, the applicant debtor sought to rely on several offsetting claims to set aside a statutory demand that was, as in <span class="font-italic">Diploma </span>and <span class="font-italic">Douglas</span>, founded on a judgment enforcing an adjudication determination. One of the issues before Robb J was how the court ought to treat some of the applicant’s offsetting claims which had already been considered and rejected by the adjudicator during the adjudication. Robb J held (at [168]) that the NSW SOPA only conferred temporary finality on the adjudicated <span class="font-italic">amount</span> – it did not “clothe the adjudicator’s <span class="font-italic">reasoning </span>with any finality that must be accepted by the court” [emphasis added]. Accordingly, “[t]he apparent determination by the adjudicator that [the debtor] was not entitled to succeed on its offsetting claims did not in any way bind [the] court on an application to set aside the statutory demand” (at [171]). On the facts, the applicant’s cross-claims were genuine, and that it was therefore permitted to rely on them to set the statutory demand aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 <span class="font-italic">J Group</span> is notable for its, with respect, correct view that, allied to the concept of temporary finality and rough justice handed down within tight timelines, decisions by an adjudicator on the validity of cross-claims are not necessarily binding for all time nor on a court considering the merits of a winding-up petition.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It ought to be noted that in New South Wales, the test for determining whether a “genuine” offsetting claim exists is whether the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that a party has an offsetting claim, or that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious: see <span class="font-italic">BBB Constructions Pty Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Frankipile Australia Pty Ltd </span>[2008] NSWSC 982 at [4]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The English position</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 We now turn to consider the English authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Shaw </span><span class="font-italic">and another v MFP Foundations &amp; Piling Ltd </span>[2010] EWHC 9 (“<span class="font-italic">Shaw</span>”), the applicant debtor sought to rely on a cross-claim to set aside a statutory demand based upon an adjudication determination and ensuing judgment under the United Kingdom’s Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (“HGCRA”). The respondent argued that, in order to give effect to the HGCRA’s purpose of facilitating cash flow, the court ought to approach the application on the presumption that a debtor was not entitled to rely on a substantial and genuine cross-claim save where it would be oppressive to prevent him from so doing. Stephen Davies J rejected this approach and held (at [50]) that the HGCRA’s “pay now, argue later” philosophy did not displace the ordinary position under the corporate and personal insolvency regimes, under which the existence of a serious and genuine cross-claim could be relied upon to prevent a winding-up or bankruptcy petition from going forward. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 <span class="font-italic">Shaw </span>has been followed in <span class="font-italic">R &amp; S Fire and Security Services Limited v Fire Defence plc</span> [2013] EWHC 4222 at [13] and <span class="font-italic">Cosmur</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction (London) Limited v St Lewis Design Limited </span>[2016] EWHC 2678 at [5]. In the latter case, Christopher Nugee J defined a “genuine” offsetting claim as one that was “of substance” (citing <span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Bayoil S.A. </span>[1999] 1 WLR 147). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Our analysis and the correct approach </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Based on the discussion above, it is apparent that courts in Singapore, Australia and England have, to date, consistently adopted the position that an ADJ debtor can resist or stay winding-up proceedings by raising a genuine or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>cross-claim, notwithstanding that the debt underlying the winding-up petition is founded on an adjudication determination. Furthermore, at least in Australia, a cross-claim will ordinarily be regarded as “genuine” as long as it is not frivolous or vexatious. This appears to us to be similar in effect to the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard of review (coupled with the abuse of process control mechanism) that we have endorsed at [45] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, it remains for us to determine whether this position, though seemingly accepted in practice, is justified <span class="font-italic">in principle. </span>Specifically, does such an approach satisfactorily reconcile the apparent tension between the policy of temporary finality, created by statute to address pressing ills besetting the construction industry, and the draconian consequences of a winding-up order based upon a sum that might ultimately be met or exceeded by a cross-claim or a final tribunal setting aside or amending or reducing the adjudication determination?  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 We stated above that the first key to reconciling this conflict is an appreciation of the true nature of temporary finality under SOPA (see [49] above). The second key is an examination of the true nature of the winding-up jurisdiction of the court. In this regard, it is apposite to refer to the following observations made by this Court in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>(at [4]–[5]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The power to wind-up a company on the petition of a creditor is clearly discretionary under s 253(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CA by the use of the word “may” in that provision: “[a] company <span class="font-italic">may</span> be wound up under an order of the Court on the application of any creditor, including a contingent or prospective creditor, of the company” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The court <span class="font-italic">may</span> order the winding-up of a company under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the CA only if the latter is unable to pay its debts. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A creditor serving a statutory demand under s 254(2) of the CA utilises a statutory <span class="font-italic">presumption</span> to prove that the company is unable to pay its debts; that provision states that a company is <span class="font-italic">deemed</span> <span class="font-italic">to be unable to pay its debts</span> if such debt is more than S$10,000 and the company has for three weeks after service of the statutory notice neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">It cannot be clearer that this route involves the invocation of a presumption, which can be rebutted by proof to the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>, there were disputes over foreign exchange contracts entered into by the respondent shipyard’s director and the appellant bank (“the Bank”). The losses on these contracts were, by agreement, closed out at approximately US$50m. Upon being served by a statutory demand by the appellant bank to pay that sum, the respondent shipyard offered to place in escrow sufficient funds to meet any judgment obtained by the appellant bank on its claim. The respondent shipyard applied for and was granted an injunction to enjoin the appellant bank from commencing any winding-up proceedings. This Court firmly held that the respondent shipyard was not insolvent and that this was confirmed by its offer to secure the claim. Where an offer to secure the debt had been made, the issue of substantiality or insubstantiality of the dispute fell by the wayside; it was no longer a consideration because the debtor was not unable to pay its debts (at [7]). In such circumstances, the filing of a winding-up petition would have amounted to an abuse of the court’s winding-up jurisdiction. The court further held (citing <span class="font-italic">Mann v Goldstein </span>[1968] 1 WLR 1091 at 1098–1099) that the Bank should have commenced court proceedings instead as it was settled law that the court’s winding-up jurisdiction was not to be used for the purpose of deciding a disputed debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This Court added in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span> that there were wider public policy considerations which had to be borne in mind when creditors threatened companies with winding-up petitions in circumstances where the claims or debts were not admitted, or where there were <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> cross-claims equal to or exceeding the creditors’ claims. In support of this point, this Court referred to its earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> where it observed (at [84]) that a creditor’s winding-up petition implies insolvency and is likely to damage the company’s creditworthiness or financial standing with its other creditors or customers (<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>at [17]). This Court further elaborated that a winding-up petition might trigger cross-default clauses in the company’s own financing instruments or in other companies within the same group as the company. At the end of the day, many other economic and social interests might be affected, such as those of the company’s employees, non-petitioning creditors, the company’s suppliers, customers and shareholders (<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>at [18]–[19]). As such, in cases where a company was temporarily insolvent, the winding-up court might adjourn the hearing of a winding-up application under s 257(1) of the CA to allow the company time to resolve the issues at hand, or order an injunction of limited duration to restrain a winding-up petition from being presented if irreparable harm could flow from its presentation (<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>, this Court agreed with the appellant’s arguments that a winding-up petition was not an appropriate means of enforcing a disputed debt and that it would be an abuse of the process of court to allow a creditor to wind-up a company on a disputed debt (at [16]). This Court also agreed that a winding-up court was generally not in the best position to adjudicate on the merits of a commercial dispute without a proper ventilation of the evidential disputes through a trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having set out the true nature of the winding-up jurisdiction of the court and the principles upon which that power is exercised, we next turn to the provisions of SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 We have already examined the characteristics of an adjudication determination and the nature of its temporary finality (see [48]–[50] above). There have been numerous cases decided on the basis of the principles set out in the SOPA, the cardinal rule being that during the course of the construction project, interim payments have to be honoured and paid in order to preserve the claimant’s cash flow. If the claimant is not paid, it can suspend work (see s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPA) or take a lien on goods supplied (see s 25(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPA). Moreover, if the respondent wants to set aside the adjudication determination on legal or technical grounds, it has to pay into court the adjudicated sum or the unpaid portion pending the challenge (see s 27(5) of the SOPA). The claimant can also seek enforcement by the entry of a judgment under s 27(1) of the SOPA, whereupon the usual execution processes like garnishee orders are available avenues to recover that debt. In such an event, the ADJ debtor is bound by the temporary finality of the adjudication determination and cannot dispute the debt, which must be paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The ADJ creditor can also serve a statutory demand giving the ADJ debtor three weeks to pay the debt, failing which it may, as in this case, proceed to file a petition to wind-up the ADJ debtor. However, because the winding-up of a company is a draconian order to make, with, as acknowledged by the courts, wider economic and social ramifications (not least of all being the complete demise of the corporate entity in question), different considerations and rules come into play. As we have seen above, the courts will entertain an application for an injunction to restrain the ADJ creditor from commencing winding-up proceedings or, if the ADJ debtor is too late for that, the court will hear applications for a dismissal of the winding-up petition or a stay of the same. Needless to say, even if the winding-up application is stayed or dismissed, the other avenues to obtain satisfaction of the judgment debt still remain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Despite the court’s strong backing of the “pay now, dispute later” approach, a blind enforcement of ADs, whatever the facts of circumstances of a case may be, has never been the rule. In <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of this Court) said (at [61]–[62]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61     In <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span> ([41] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the New South Wales Court of Appeal, after finding against Brodyn (the respondent to the payment claim in that case), noted that it was not left without recourse and identified the general principle of law on granting a stay of enforcement thus (at [85] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Hodgson JA):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A court in which judgment for recovery of money has been given can stay execution of that judgment. A party against whom there was a substantial judgment could apply for a stay of execution on the grounds that it had a greater claim against the judgment creditor, for which it would shortly obtain judgment, and that, if the judgment money was paid, it would be irrecoverable; and the court could in its discretion grant a stay, on terms if it thought appropriate. I see no reason why a judgment under s 25 of the [NSW] Act could not be stayed on that kind of basis, although the policy of the [NSW] Act that progress payments be made would be a discretionary factor weighing against such relief.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62     Section 25(4)(b) of the NSW Act is, for present purposes, similar to our s 27(5), and as a general proposition, we agree with the principle stated in the above passage from <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span> that enforcement of an adjudication determination<span class="font-italic"> may</span> be stayed in appropriate circumstances. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Undoubtedly, the claimant who successfully secures an adjudication determination in his favour has a right to be paid, but there is a competing residual right on the part of the respondent to have his claims ventilated in full in court or in some other dispute resolution proceeding.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We accept that cases in which the enforcement of an adjudication determination is stayed are the exception and not the rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Once a project has commenced, the interim payment regime kicks in. The primary source for the interim payment procedure and obligations will be the contract (see <span class="font-italic">Shimizu Corp v </span><span class="font-italic">Stargood Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1338 at [2]). Where the contract is deficient or silent, the provisions of the SOPA, like ss 5–8 and ss 10–12, will apply subject to the terms of the contract. In the great majority of cases, whilst the project is on-going, interim payments are made and if necessary, enforced through adjudication applications, leading to adjudication determinations. Often, the upstream party makes payment in the interest of getting on with the project. The upstream party can, if it thinks it has the grounds to do so, challenge the adjudication determination in court proceedings on legal or technical grounds, whereupon the whole adjudication determination may be set aside, but until then it cannot dispute the amount stated in the adjudication determination. If the contract allows a party to commence arbitral proceedings before the end of the project, it may be possible for that party to issue a notice of arbitration to challenge the adjudication determination, but it will have to pay the adjudicated sum first.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The first exception to this rule has been referred to above, where the ADJ debtor applies to court to set aside or annul the adjudication determination on legal or technical grounds under s 27(6) of the SOPA. As noted above, whilst it does so, it has to pay the adjudicated sum into court (see s 27(5) of the SOPA). Not many succeed on the grounds set out under s 27(6) of the SOPA as case law has gradually ironed out the uncertainties caused by rival interpretations of those provisions. If the adjudication determination has been set aside, it follows there is no more debt arising from the adjudication determination.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The second exception occurs after the construction project has come to an end or has been terminated. In this regard, it is worth reiterating this Court’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One </span>at [53] (which we have referred to earlier at [49] above) that the parties’ rights and obligations will be conclusively determined after the termination of the contract: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is trite that an adjudication determination has only temporary finality. This makes sense in the context of the SOPA regime, which ordinarily operates while a project is underway and the contractor requires payment on a more expedited basis. Indeed, we have observed that the temporary finality conferred on an adjudication determination is a corollary of the expedited nature of its process (see [<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction</span>] at [22]). At the end of the day, however, the parties’ rights and obligations are conclusively and finally determined in substantive proceedings conducted after the project has been completed… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 We note that downstream parties are allowed to make a payment claim not later than 30 months after (a) the date on which the goods and services to which the amount in the payment claim relates were last supplied; or (b) the latest of the following: (i) the date on which the construction work to which the amount in the payment claims relates was last carried out, (ii) the issuance date of the last document, as at the time the payment claim is served, certifying completion of the construction work under contract, or (iii) the issuance date of the last temporary occupation permit as at the time the payment claim is served (see s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA). Often, however, one of the parties has already commenced arbitration or court proceedings to finally determine and resolve all issues between the parties well before that date. Once this process has been started, parties should be encouraged to conduct a cost-benefit analysis prior to pursuing the adjudication route when the disputes are already subject to a pending arbitration: see <span class="font-italic">Orion-One </span>at [4].<span class="font-italic"> </span>In that case, Steven Chong JCA (delivering the judgment of this Court) also remarked on the futility of applying for an adjudication of a payment claim more than two years following the termination of the contract, as the adjudication determination, by its nature, was not final and was in fact subject to a pending arbitration. If, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard, there are genuine cross-claims or set-offs before the arbitral tribunal or court, no court will proceed to grant the winding up petition. An almost similar situation occurs where the upstream party is about to commence an arbitration or legal proceedings to finally determine all the disputes between the parties. Failing to carry out a careful cost-benefit analysis “would only serve to introduce a further layer of costs with no apparent benefit.” (<span class="font-italic">Orion-One </span>at [4]) and we add that there may be cost consequences in appropriate cases.            </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In our view, applying the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard of review represents a practical and workable solution to the apparent opposing considerations of the winding-up jurisdiction of the court and the temporary finality of adjudication determinations, in situations where an ADJ debtor raises a cross-claim against the ADJ creditor in order to challenge a winding-up petition founded on the adjudication debt. On one hand, reviewing the cross-claim in accordance with a lower <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard acknowledges the reality that the adjudication determination will, in all likelihood, be ‘opened up’ when the contract between the parties is coming or has come to an end or  has been terminated. On the other hand, the requirement that the cross-claim or dispute (as the case may be) cannot constitute an abuse of the court’s process provides a useful check on parties trying to game the system. We have no doubt that courts will be able to sift out disputes or cross-claims that are raised merely to delay winding up those companies which, despite raising such disputes or cross-claims, are hopelessly insolvent. Thus, save for the fact that an ADJ debtor cannot dispute the adjudication determination as a ground for staying or setting aside a winding-up petition founded on that adjudication determination, there is no need to modify the general approach which we have endorsed at [45] above in building and construction cases like the present. In so far as cross-claims are concerned, the general approach continues to work well when we consider the true nature of the temporary finality under SOPA, and bear in mind that the jurisdiction of the winding-up court is not to decide cross-claims or set offs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For completeness, we state our view that we do not think that the parliamentary debates for the SOP Bill which were referred to in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh </span>(see [56] above) and <span class="font-italic">Strategic Construction</span> (see [59] above) go so far as to imply that the insolvency regime will <span class="font-italic">inevitably</span> prevail over the SOPA regime in the event of <span class="font-italic">any</span> conflict between the two. We also think it unnecessary, for present purposes, to determine whether any one regime takes precedence over the other, because the approach that we have outlined above satisfactorily reconciles the apparent tensions between the two. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether ZK has a cross-claim against DGE which justifies the stay or dismissal of CWU 95</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Having determined the approach that is to be taken towards winding-up applications that are founded on adjudication determinations, we turn to assess the evidence placed before us. To recapitulate, ZK’s cross-claim in the Consolidated Suit encompasses the following demands (see [17]–[18] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) liquidated damages amounting to S$501,800 for DGE’s alleged delay in completing the Subcontract Work; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) damages amounting to S$358,870.25 for work allegedly done to rectify work that was not properly carried out or not completed by DGE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In support of the latter claim, ZK exhibited numerous invoices

We elaborate on the reasons for this conclusion below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 DGE’s first contention was that ZK had not sufficiently particularised (a) the terms and/or specifications of the Subcontract which were allegedly breached by DGE; (b) the details of how or why DGE had failed to meet its contractual obligations under the Subcontract; and (c) when and how the alleged particulars of loss were incurred as a result of DGE’s breaches of the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 We do not find these submissions at all persuasive. In our judgment, the Statement of Claim adequately sets out the necessary elements of ZK’s action in breach of contract against DGE. DGE’s criticism that the Statement of Claim was lacking in particulars as to the specific term(s) of the Subcontract which had been breached by DGE is unfounded. The seven-page Subcontract with its 12 main clauses and annexures is not an overly complex contractual document. The provisions which support ZK’s claim are pleaded. Consequently, DGE can be in no doubt of the alleged breaches which ZK relies upon to support its claims against DGE. For instance, paragraph 10 clearly states DGE failed, refused and/or neglected to carry out the Subcontract Works satisfactorily and in accordance with the specifications and/or the requirement of the CAAS and/or the main contract, with the result that the Subcontract Works were delayed and not carried out in time and/or within the Master Schedule or any revision thereto.

</div> Paragraph 11 further pleads that sometime in early June 2018, DGE abandoned and/or deserted the balance of the Subcontract works, leaving such works incomplete and/or with poor workmanship and/or with defects unrectified. This is followed by a list of particulars setting out, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the types of additional costs and expenses which ZK has had to incur as a result of DGE’s abandonment of the Subcontract Works.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 DGE might complain that, for example, there are no particulars as to exactly what works were left incomplete or exactly what works were defective and in what respect they were defective. However, the remedy is simple. As we highlighted to DGE during the hearing, the appropriate course of action would have been for DGE to ask ZK for further and better particulars, failing which they would have been entitled to take out an application for further and better particulars under O 18 r 12(3) of the ROC. Such particulars are often dealt with during case management conferences and it is standard fare for an order to be made for the parties to draw up appropriate Scott Schedules. Having failed to adopt this course of action, DGE cannot now rely upon the absence of particulars in ZK’s claim as a basis for justifying the refusal of a stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 We also add that the sums claimed by ZK are, in our view, clearly quantified. It is apparent from the Statement of Claim that the claim for S$501,800 is premised on the rates set out under cl 6 of the Subcontract (see paragraph 19 of the Statement of Claim), and that the claim for S$380,870.25 is derived by adding up the additional costs and expenses which ZK allegedly incurred in engaging substitute sub-contractors to rectify or complete the Subcontract Works (see paragraph 14 of the Statement of Claim). Details of such claims will become clear during discovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 DGE’s second contention was that ZK had refused to pay DGE for the Subcontract Works in full and that it had thereby renounced the Subcontract pursuant to Situation 2 in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another </span><span class="font-italic">appeal </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 413. Consequently, DGE argued, there was no basis for ZK’s claim that DGE had repudiated the Subcontract by walking off the Project site and not sending workmen to the site after 6 June 2018. In response to this argument, ZK averred that there were no payments lawfully due and owing to DGE, as DGE had “cause[d] delays and defective works in the course of carrying out the Subcontract Works”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 These kinds of allegations and counter-allegations are not uncommon in construction contracts of this nature. However, this is not the correct forum to finally determine the rights and wrongs of either party. That is the function of the trial judge in the Consolidated Suit. We need only look at the objective facts to decide if there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that DGE’s cross-claim may exceed ZK’s claim comprised in its AD and the ensuing s 27(1) SOPA Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As noted at [6] above, the contract completion dates for Phases 1 and 2A of the Subcontract were 31 July 2017 and 20 February 2017 respectively. ZK’s primary contention, which it has maintained throughout these proceedings, is that DGE walked off site and did not send any workers from 6 June 2018. Importantly, DGE does not deny this as a fact, but alleges that its conduct was justified because of ZK’s repudiation of the contract by non-payment. As a proposition of building and construction law, that is not necessarily correct. There may be instances in which a persistent course of payment delays, or a protracted delay in the payment of a very substantial sum amounts to a repudiation of the contract: see for example <span class="font-italic">AL Stainless Industries Pte Ltd v Wei Sin Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2001] SGHC 243 at [194], citing Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contract Claims </span>(Longman, 2nd ed, 1993) at p 264. However, not every instance of non-payment by a contracting party will suffice to constitute repudiation. This was made clear in <span class="font-italic">Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 288 (“<span class="font-italic">Jia Min</span>”) at [55], where the court stated, citing <span class="font-italic">Lubenham</span><span class="font-italic"> Fidelities and Investments Co Ltd v South Pembrokeshire District Council </span>(1986) 33 BLR 46: “[i]t appears settled law that a contractor/subcontractor has no general right at common law to suspend work unless this is expressly agreed  upon. This is so even if payment is wrongly withheld”. The court also cited <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Law of Singapore, </span>vol 2 (LexisNexis Singapore, 2003 Reissue) at para 30.321, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Building Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed, 2001) at para 6-96 and <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</span>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th ed, 1995) at para 4-223 for the same principle. The rationale for this, the court explained, was that “the existence of such a right [to suspend work upon the other party’s failure to make payment] could create chaos within the building industry if contractors were to muscle their way through disputes with threats or actual threats or suspension instead of having their disputes adjudicated” (at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Another relevant consideration is that ZK advanced various sums of money to DGE to support DGE’s purchase of material and to pay staff and workers (see [9] above). These advances are also alluded to at paragraph 146 of the AD.

</div> On the evidence before us, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the sums that were allegedly due to DGE were liable to be offset by these advance payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 DGE’s third contention was that there was no basis for ZK’s claim for delay. In our view, on the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard of review, the documents before us do support the inference that there were delays on DGE’s part. We have referred to ZK’s emails and one letter from the SO noting delays by DGE (see [9] above), as well as ZK’s emails and letters complaining of the lack of DGE workers on site (see [11] above). Moreover, we see that DGE<span class="font-italic"> did</span> acknowledge that there had been delays to the completion of the Subcontract Works. Its primary defence was that these delays had been occasioned by ZK’s own failure to obtain approval from the relevant authorities and that ZK had in any event “agreed by conduct, if not expressly”, to the extensions of time sought by DGE.

It is also apparent to us that at least some of these invoices related specifically to cladding and glass-related works for the Project, which originally fell within the scope of DGE’s contractual obligations.

Prior to commencing court proceedings against DGE, ZK had asserted, in its letter to DGE dated 30 June 2018, that there had been delays on DGE’s part, and that some of the Subcontract Works were defective and incomplete. In respect of the latter, ZK claimed “costs incurred on site” aggregating S$42,623.50.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In our view, the discrepancies in ZK’s case do not mean that its cross-claim against DGE fails to meet the <span class="font-italic">prima</span> <span class="font-italic">facie</span> standard of review. As we commented at [13] above, notwithstanding the strange formulation of the Statement of Claim in S 917, the particulars that were pleaded therein show the  nature of ZK’s claim. ZK had changed solicitors before filing S 1282, and it was therefore only in the Statement of Claim for S 1282 and the Consolidated Suit that ZK’s claims crystallised into their current and more coherent form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The correspondence between the parties also gives us reason to believe that ZK’s cross-claim is <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. As noted at [11(a)] above, DGE had sent ZK an ultimatum on 30 May 2018, demanding payment of S$149,436.99 by 12pm on 5 June 2018 failing which it would treat the Subcontract as terminated. DGE subsequently withdrew its workmen from site from 6 June 2018 onwards. Although there was some grandstanding between the parties, DGE did not send any more workmen to the site and on 30 June 2018, ZK sent a letter to DGE, stating that since DGE had not deployed manpower on site since 6 June 2018 and its works were defective and incomplete, ZK would mobilise third parties to complete the remaining and defective works and hold DGE responsible for all consequences (see [11(d)] above). That letter could evince ZK’s acceptance of DGE’s repudiation or termination of the Subcontract as expressed in DGE’s email dated 30 May 2018. It is also significant that the key facets of ZK’s claim – comprising delay on DGE’s part, as well as incomplete and defective Subcontract Works – were raised as early as 30 June 2018, <span class="font-italic">well </span><span class="font-italic">before</span> DGE served PC 17 on ZK, some 14 months later, on 28 August 2019. In the circumstances, we find that, contrary to DGE’s assertions, there was nothing to show that ZK’s cross-claims were conjured up simply to stave off the winding-up petition. ZK’s failure to mention DGE’s alleged delay in its payment response, as well as its unsubstantiated claim for “goods sold and delivered” in the Statement of Claim for S 917, is only a factor to be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 We emphasise that we do not intend, by our decision above, to suggest that ZK’s cross-claim is likely to succeed. Some or all of ZK’s claims may well fail or be reduced in quantum. However, given the evidence that is before us, ZK has satisfied the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard of proof to be entitled to a stay. In fact, as noted above, if the standard was that of a triable issue, ZK has met that higher standard. Whether ZK eventually succeeds or fails is a matter to be determined in the Consolidated Suit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conditions of stay </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It was argued by DGE that, even if this Court were to grant a stay of CWU 95, it ought to do so only on the condition that ZK paid the Judgment Debt of S$211,044 into court as security pending the outcome of the Consolidated Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Two reasons were proffered for this contention. The first was that, pursuant to s 27(5) of the SOPA read with O 95 r 3 of the ROC, a party seeking to set aside an adjudication determination made under the SOPA had to pay the outstanding portion of the adjudicated amount into court as security. According to DGE, since the Consolidated Suit was, in effect, commenced by ZK to challenge the AD, granting an unconditional stay of CWU 95 would “defeat the legislative intent of SOPA and render the adjudication determination nugatory”.

This provision states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Powers of Court on hearing winding up application</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">257.</span>—(2)  The Court may on the winding up application coming on for hearing or at any time on the application of the person making the winding up application, the company, or any person who has given notice that he intends to appear on the hearing of the winding up application —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) give <span class="font-italic">such directions</span> as to the proceedings <span class="font-italic">as the Court thinks fit</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It cannot be made more plain by the words italicised above that the court’s discretion as to what directions it may give in relation to a winding-up proceeding is very wide, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>. as the court “thinks fit.” Indeed, our courts have previously stayed winding up proceedings on condition that the sum of the debt claimed in the statutory demand be paid into court: see for example <span class="font-italic">Strategic Construction </span>at [62].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 We note that this position is also consistent with that expressed in the bankruptcy regime: see <span class="font-italic">Mohd Zain bin Abdullah v </span><span class="font-italic">Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 446 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohd Zain</span>”) at [18], where this Court held that it was empowered to impose conditions on a stay of bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to ss 64(1), 65(4) and 65(5) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether a conditional stay ought to be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Under s 27(5) of the SOPA, an ADJ debtor who applies to court to set aside an adjudication determination or the judgment obtained for its enforcement pursuant to s 27(1) of the SOPA must pay into court the unpaid portion of the adjudicated amount as security. However, we do not think it appropriate to lay down a general rule that parties in the position of ZK should pay the adjudicated amounts into court pending the resolution of the arbitral  tribunal or the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 There may be circumstances which make this a just condition, yet there may be other circumstances where making such an order would be unjust. One example of the latter type of situation is where the project is at an end or in the defects liability phase or has been terminated, and the downstream party launches its payment claim which is, in effect, its final accounts for the project. Many adjudicators dread this scenario where they are under tremendous pressure to decide the final accounts of a project within the time strictures of SOPA, as this task is well-nigh impossible except in the simplest construction contracts. In such cases, the adjudicator’s endeavour to achieve rough and ready justice may produce an erroneous adjudication determination which may be very large in value. To make an ADJ debtor pay this sum into court may cause great financial stress; it can result in tying up large sums of money whilst the matter is arbitrated or litigated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Turning to the facts of this case, we take the view that it is appropriate to require ZK to pay the sum of the Judgment Debt into court. We have borne in mind ZK’s lack of a response to DGE’s payment claim, the strange pleadings in S 917, the failure to state a total response amount and the varying amounts of ZK’s alleged cross-claims. Some of these factors were ameliorated by the filing of S 1282 and the Consolidated Suit which placed ZK’s cross-claim on a more secure footing. We also note that the Judgment Debt was not inordinately high or crippling. Although we are of the view that the evidence before us more than meets the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> test, we consider it just to order ZK to pay the ADJ sum into court on the analogy of s 27(5) of the SOPA.  Upon ZK paying the sum of the Judgment Debt into court, there can be no justification to presume that ZK is insolvent on the basis that it is unable to pay its debts (see <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>at [7], cited at [72] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 For completeness, we clarify that we do not see any merit in DGE’s submission that ZK is at real risk of insolvency as DGE did not offer anything, apart from bare assertions, to support this claim. Clearly, the fact that ZK had a paid-up capital of S$300,000 does not in itself<span class="font-italic"> </span>demonstrate that ZK did not have enough assets to discharge its liabilities. On the contrary, ZK’s balance sheet as at 30 September 2019 shows that its total assets of S$3,156,585.31 far exceeded its total liabilities of S$356,334.17.

</div> Further, there was no evidence before us that any creditors aside from DGE had taken out winding-up applications against ZK. We thus find that this particular contention is not an appropriate reason to grant a conditional stay in the present case.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 For the reasons set out above, we varied the High Court’s decision and upheld the stay only on the condition that ZK paid the sum of S$211,044 into court within 14 days from the date of the hearing before us. As an alternative to payment into court, we allowed parties to agree on any other form of security, failing which the first order of payment into court would stand. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Woo Bih Li<br/>Judge of the Appellate Division </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Quentin Loh<br/>Judge of the Appellate Division</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Luo Ling Ling and Sharifah Nabilah binte Syed Omar (Luo Ling Ling LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kris Chew Yee Fong and Isabel Su Hongling (Zenith Law Corporation) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

The respondent complained, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that there were delays in the appellant’s completion of the Subcontract Works. The appellant asserted that these delays were caused by the respondent’s acts or omissions, and demanded payment for its work on the Project. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 On 30 May 2018, the appellant informed the respondent that it would treat the Subcontract as terminated if the respondent did not fulfill payment of certain outstanding sums. When the respondent declined to make the payment sought, the appellant withdrew its workmen from the Project site from 6 June 2018 onwards and, on 29 June 2018, sent the respondent a letter stating that it had no choice but to accept the respondent’s repudiatory breach and terminate the Subcontract. The respondent continued to refute the appellant’s claims, alleging defective and incomplete works and advances totalling $162,113 to assist the appellant purchase material.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 On 28 August 2019, more than 14 months after the appellant had withdrawn its workmen from the site, the appellant served a payment claim, Payment Claim 17 (“PC 17”) on the respondent, seeking payment for the Subcontract Works. The respondent did not certify the sums claimed in full and separately commenced a High Court suit, HC/S 917/2019 (“S 917”) against the appellant to recover sums allegedly incurred by the appellant’s breach. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 Dissatisfied, the appellant commenced an adjudication application against the respondent. The adjudicator found in the appellant’s favour. The respondent did not pay the adjudicated amount, and instead proceeded to commence a second High Court suit, HC/S 1282/2019 (“S 1282”) against the appellant. S 917 and S 1282 were consolidated into a single suit (“the Consolidated Suit”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Subsequently, the appellant obtained an order to enforce the adjudication determination (“AD”) as a judgment and issued a statutory demand against the respondent claiming the adjudicated amount, interest and the costs of adjudication (collectively, “the Judgment Debt”). When the respondent did not meet the statutory demand, the appellant commenced a winding-up petition, HC/CWU 95/2020 (“CWU 95”) against the respondent. The respondent filed HC/SUM 1577/2020 (“SUM 1577”) against the appellant seeking an order dismissing SUM 1577 or, alternatively, an order that the hearing of CWU 95 be stayed or adjourned pending the disposal of the Consolidated Suit. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The Judge held that the respondent had a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and serious cross-claim against the appellant based on substantial grounds, the value of which might exceed the Judgment Debt. Accordingly, the Judge allowed the respondent’s application in SUM 1577 and granted a stay of CWU 95 pending the determination of the Consolidated Suit and any appeal thereof.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The appellant appealed against the Judge’s decision on SUM 1577, asserting that the respondent did not have a genuine cross-claim against the appellant. In the alternative, the appellant argued that CWU 95 ought to be stayed only on the condition that the respondent first paid the value of the Judgment Debt into court as security. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision of the Court </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The Court observed that it was not open to the appellant to dispute the debt comprised in the AD as the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SOPA”) conferred temporary finality on the AD, and there were presently no legal proceedings afoot to invalidate the AD on legal grounds. Here, however, the appellant sought to stay or dismiss CWU 95 not by disputing the AD debt, but by asserting a cross-claim against the respondent: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[32]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 An ADJ debtor who sought to stay or dismiss a winding-up petition in a building and construction case like the present, where the debt underlying the winding-up petition was founded on an AD, only needed to show, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis, the existence of a justiciable cross-claim that was likely to equal or exceed the claim against the debtor, and provided that the said cross-claim was not being raised in an abuse of the court’s process: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[44]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[45]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 A careful and principled approach was required to determine when or under what circumstances an ADJ debtor ought to be allowed to stay or dismiss a winding-up petition premised on a debt arising from the AD by alleging a cross-claim on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis. This was because the policies underpinning the SOPA, specifically the philosophy of maintaining cash flow in the construction industry, seemingly contradicted an ADJ debtor’s entitlement to stave off winding-up proceedings under the insolvency regime: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[46]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[47]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Temporary finality ended when a court or an arbitral tribunal finally determined all the parties’ disputes, rights and obligations; in such cases, the AD and any judgment obtained thereon had to cease to have effect. On the other hand, where the project was ongoing, the ADJ debtor had to pay the adjudicated sum save where the AD could be set aside on legal grounds: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[50] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[51]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The real difficulty came when the downstream party secured an AD in its favour when the project came or was coming to an end or had been terminated. In such cases, an argument might be made that to readily allow the ADJ debtor to halt enforcement of the AD by alleging a cross-claim on the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard might enable upstream parties to evade their payment obligations too easily. However, the winding-up of a company was a draconian order to make with wide economic and social ramifications. Despite the court’s strong backing of the “pay now, dispute later” approach in the SOPA context, a blind enforcement of ADs, whatever the facts or circumstances of a case may be, had never been the rule: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[52]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[77]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[78]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 In cases where the project came or was coming to an end or had been terminated, applying the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard of review represented a practical and workable solution to the apparent opposing considerations of the winding-up jurisdiction of the court and the temporary finality of ADs. On one hand, reviewing the cross-claim in accordance with a lower <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard acknowledged the reality that the AD would, in all likelihood, be “opened up” when the dispute between the parties was finally determined. On the other hand, the requirement that the cross-claim could not constitute an abuse of the court’s process provided a useful check on parties trying to game the system: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[83]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 In the present case, the respondent had clearly met the required <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard to resist a winding-up order being made. The Statement of Claim for the Consolidated Suit adequately set out the necessary elements of the respondent’s action against the appellant, and the sums claimed by the respondent were clearly quantified. It could not be conclusively determined, based on the evidence before the Court, that the respondent had repudiated the Subcontract or that there had been no delay or breaches on the appellant’s part. Furthermore, there was no evidence to show that the invoices produced by the respondent in support of its claim were obviously inauthentic: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[89]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[100]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Section 257(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) empowered the Court to stay winding-up proceedings on condition that the sum of the debt claimed in the statutory demand be paid into court. It would not be appropriate to lay down a general rule that parties in the position of the respondent had to pay the adjudicated amount into court pending the resolution of the dispute by the arbitral tribunal or court. However, on the facts of this case, it was just to order the respondent to pay the Judgment Debt into court: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[108]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[110]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[111]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
