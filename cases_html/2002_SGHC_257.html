</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        At the conclusion of the

hearing, I dismissed the above Petition (the Petition) filed jointly by Deutsche Bank AG

[DB] and BNP Paribas [BNP] (hereinafter referred to collectively as the Petitioners) for

the making of a judicial management order against Asia Pulp &amp; Paper Ltd (APP),

pursuant to s 227B of the Companies Act Cap 50. As the Petitioners have appealed against

my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 95 of 2002), I shall expand upon my oral judgment

delivered on 22 August 2002, and set out in full the reasons for my decision.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The background</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        APP is a public company

incorporated in Singapore on 12 October 1994 and has its registered office in Jurong at

No. 118, Pioneer Road, Singapore 639598. The company has an authorised capital in excess

of US$3 billion with issued and paid-up shares of 1,151,653,612 comprising of preference

($1.00 each) and ordinary shares (US$0.50 each). APP's objects inter alia are as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">a. to carry on the business of investment holding and to

    transact all kinds of investment business;</p>
<p align="justify">b. to invest the monies of the company in or otherwise to acquire and

    hold shares, stock, debentures, debenture stock, scrip, loans, bonds, obligations, notes,

    securities and investments issued or guaranteed by any company or trust constituted or

    carrying on business in any part of the world.</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">APP is essentially an investment holding company which in itself does

not own any significant tangible assets or have any operations in Singapore. Its principal

business is in the pulp and paper industry located elsewhere. APP serves as the holding

company for the pulp, paper and packaging business of the Widjaja family of Indonesia, who

are its majority shareholders through another company known as APP Global Limited. Through

its subsidiaries which operate mills (in Indonesia and China) which manufacture the

group's products, APP as a group is one of the largest producers of paper in the world and

the largest in Asia, outside Japan; it claims to be one of the lowest cost producers of

pulp and paper in the world. APP has under its umbrella, more than 150 companies

incorporated in Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Mauritius, the Unites States and Singapore.

The company derives its income (in part) from the management fees it charges its operating

subsidiaries. I should point out that APP does not have direct interest as shareholders,

in the operating subsidiaries. The company's interest in these subsidiaries is through its

equity in intermediate holding companies. In Indonesia, APP has a holding company called

PT Purinusa Ekapesada (Purinusa) which has four (4) major Indonesian subsidiaries: PT

Indah Kiat, PT Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimia Tbk (Tjiwi Kimia), PT Pindo Deli Pulp &amp; Paper

Mills (Pindo Deli) and PT Lontar Papyrus Pulp &amp; Paper Industry. Indah Kiat and Tjiwi

Kimia are quoted on the stock exchanges of Surabaya and Jakarta respectively. Purinusa

however does <u>not</u> own any timber concessions or subsidiaries that supply the wood to

the foregoing four (4) subsidiaries. The timber concessions in Sumatra and Riau Island

instead belong essentially to two (2) companies PT Arara Abadi (Abadi) and PT Wirakarya

Sakti (Sakti).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        APP and its subsidiaries

are part of a larger group of companies known as the Sinar Mas group, which is one of

Indonesia's largest conglomerates, controlled by the Widjaja family. The Sinar Mas group

of companies has diversified interests in palm oil, financial services and, timber and

pulp/paper. The group even owned a bank PT Bank Internasional Indonesia Tbk, until it was

placed under the control of Indonesian authorities in 1999. Abadi and Sakti (hereinafter

referred to collectively as the wood companies) belong to the Sinar Mas group.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        DB is a foreign bank

incorporated in the Federal Republic of Germany with branches worldwide, including a

Singapore branch located at No. 6 Shenton Way #15-08, DBS Building Tower 2, Singapore

068809.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        Similarly, BNP is a

foreign bank but incorporated in France, with branches worldwide including a Singapore

branch located at No 20 Collyer Quay, Tung Centre, Singapore 049319.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        Although it is a public

company, APP is not listed on Singapore's stock exchange (the SGX). However, it does have

one subsidiary Nippecraft Limited which is listed on the SGX; it has 15 other Singapore

incorporated subsidiaries. APP was granted OHQ (operational headquarters) status by

Singapore's Economic Development Board in 1995 for five (5) years which upon expiry, was

extended for one (1) year up to 31 December 2000; the company did not apply for further

extensions thereafter. APP's American Depository shares (ADS) were listed on the New York

Stock Exchange until about 10 August 2001, when the shares were delisted after the price

fell for 30 consecutive days below the minimum of US$1.00 required by the exchange;

trading in the ADS had been suspended since 4 April 2001. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        DB is and became, a

creditor of APP in the following circumstances: APP's subsidiary APP International Finance

(BVI) Ltd (APP-IF) had entered into a Master Agreement dated 19 March 1997 (the Master

Agreement) with Bankers Trust International PLC (Bankers Trust) for currency 'swap'

transactions. The Master Agreement was guaranteed by APP by a separate agreement of the

same date (the Guarantee). The Master Agreement and the Guarantee are governed by New York

law. Bankers Trust was taken over by DB and, by a Transfer Agreement dated 28 July 2000

made between DB's London branch and Bankers Trust (with the consent of APP-IF), the Master

Agreement was novated to DB. By a separate letter also dated 28 July 2000 from Bankers

Trust to DB's London branch, the rights of the former under the Guarantee were also

assigned to DB, with APP's consent. As a result of APP-IF's failure to pay DB a sum of

US$1,877,204.98 when it fell due on 13 October 2000, DB terminated the two (2) swap

transactions dated 19 March and 8 August, 1997 under the Master Agreement. This resulted

in APP-IF and thereby APP owing DB a total of US$216,814,659.09 as at 7 November 2000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        Negotiations took place

between APP-IF, APP and DB which resulted in the signing of a Deed of Forbearance dated 22

November 2000 whereby APP-IF agreed to pay the sum owed to DB by instalments in the years

2000-2002, with such payments being guaranteed by APP. The Deed of Forbearance is governed

by English Law. APP-IF failed to comply with the instalment payment plan apart from a sum

of US$21,727,237.89 paid by a subsidiary of APP-IF (Hillside Trading Limited) on or about

22 November 2000. As at the date of filing this Petition, the sum owed to DB by APP-IF and

or APP (excluding interest) approximated US$193m.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        On 7 February 2001, DB

served (through their solicitors) a statutory notice of demand on APP for the sum of

US$28,780,253.32. Apparently no payment or satisfactory payment was made by APP pursuant

to the demand. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        BNP on its part is owed

US$20m. BNP had participated in a syndicated loan facility of US$264m which was lent in

two (2) tranches, tranche A was released to Indah Kiat International Finance Co. BV (the

finance company) and tranche B to PT Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper (Indah Kiat); BNP had

lent US$20m to the finance company. This loan was guaranteed by Indah Kiat. The term

facility of US$264m was in turn guaranteed by APP, pursuant to a Deed of Guarantee dated

30 March 2000. The loan instruments and APP's guarantee are governed by English law. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        The participating banks

in the syndicate had appointed the Singapore branch of Fuji Bank Limited as their Agent to

exercise their rights and powers etc under the facility. An event of default having arisen

under the facility, Fuji Bank Ltd by its letter dated 27 March 2001 made on behalf of the

participating banks, a demand for payment from Indah Kiat of all monies owing under the

loans made in tranches A and B. This demand was followed by a second demand from Fuji Bank

to APP (as the guarantor) on 2 April 2001, for repayment of all sums due and payable by

Indah Kiat and the finance company (including the US$20m owed to BNP).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        On 12 March 2001, APP

issued a press release through its Chief Financial Officer Hendrik Tee (the press release)

announcing a debt repayment standstill (the debt standstill); the announcement inter alia

stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">On the advice of our financial advisors, Credit Suisse

    First Boston (CSFS), we intend to immediately cease payment of interest and principal on

    all holding company debt and on debt issued by our subsidiaries and affiliates, the

    obligations of which are funded by such subsidiaries. In order to allow our operating

    subsidiaries to continue normal operations, we will be giving priority to servicing our

    suppliers and trade creditors.</p>
<p align="justify">………..we believe it is in the best long-term interest of

    the Company and its creditors and we plan to seek a consensual arrangement with our

    creditors. We understand that a number of our creditors have initiated efforts to organize

    themselves globally and also separately for the China operations. We welcome these

    efforts. We intend to discuss the standstill and the way forward separately with each of

    our China operating entities and non-China creditor groups. Appropriate approaches will

    need to be developed for the various creditor groups based upon the particulars of their

    respective situations. The Company and its financial advisor will be meeting with creditor

    representatives to discuss the restructuring process and means for conveying information

    to creditors.</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Creditors of APP (including the Petitioners) cried foul on the

company's unilateral declaration of a debt standstill. Indeed, the press release was one

of the reasons given for the presentation of this Petition. I should add that APP now has

the dubious honour of being the largest debtor (of about US$13.9 billion) in the emerging

market as well as being the biggest debt defaulter in Asia. In Singapore, it has been sued

by numerous creditors for sums approximating US$210m while two (2) creditors (Cellmark AB

and Union De Banques Arabes Et Francaises UBAF) filed Winding-Up Petitions (which were

subsequently stayed by order of court). The Sinar Mas group has not fared much better; it

is equally financial troubled and owes about US$1.3 billion alone to Indonesia's Bank

Restructuring Agency (IBRA) not to mention larger amounts to other creditors. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Petition</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        Next, I turn to the

Petitioners' grouses and the Petition. Although the press release indicated that APP would

draw up a debt restructuring proposal within one (1) month of the announcement, the

deadline was not met. Indeed, the Petitioners complained that as at the date of this

Petition (23 June 2003), APP had failed to come up with a proposal which merited serious

consideration by the company's creditors (themselves included) – the company's debt

restructuring plan dated 1 February 2002 had been rejected outright. Creditors'

counter-proposals dated 2 May 2002 were not accepted by APP save for four (4) items. There

was no agreement between APP and its creditors on even the basic principles of

restructuring. This allegation was however hotly contested by Ferry Siswojo Djongianto

(Djongianto), a member of APP's restructuring committee. In his first affidavit filed on

10 July 2002 (which I shall refer to later), Djongianto painstakingly detailed all the

meetings which had taken place with creditors, after the debt standstill and, the progress

that had been achieved since then.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        APP did appoint a host of

professional and legal advisers after the debt standstill; these included:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) to advise on a debt restructuring

    plan;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) JP Morgan to implement the disposal of assets under plan (i);</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iii) Arthur Anderson (AA) to conduct an audit and review the financial

    position of the company/group; (AA has since been replaced by Nicky Tan's company nTan

    Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd after he left AA where he was in charge of APP's brief);</p>
<p align="justify">(v) White &amp; Case LLP to act as the company's international counsel;</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) Drew &amp; Napier LLC to advise on Singapore law elements in the

    restructuring;</p>
<p align="justify">(vii) Tumbuan Pane to advise on Indonesian law elements in the

    restructuring;</p>
<p align="justify">(viii) Bank of China International as financial advisors to the Chinese

    operating subsidiaries vis a vis Chinese creditors. The Chinese creditors' legal advisors

    are Johnson Stokes &amp; Masters whilst their financial advisors are

    PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC); </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(vix) King &amp; Wood to advise on Chinese law elements in the

    restructuring. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        The company/group's

creditors were put into committees which represented their interests, these were:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) a Bondholders Steering Committee made up of public bondholders

    whose legal advisors were Bingham Dana LLP (now Bingham-McCutchen LLP) with Allen &amp;

    Gledhill as their Singapore counsel, Mochtar, Kauwin &amp; Komar as their Indonesian law

    advisors and Denton Wilde Sapte as their legal advisors on Chinese law; </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) a Combined Steering Committee (CSC) made up of banks, trading

    companies and export credit agencies whose legal advisors were Shearman &amp; Sterling

    (now Sherman &amp; Sterling Stamford) with Soewito, Suhardiman Eddy Kardono as Indonesian

    legal advisors; </p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the Umbrella Steering Committee (USC) which comprised of members

    of both the BSC and CSC and whose financial advisors are KPMG (Australia) and PT Siddharta

    Consulting. DB is a member of the USC; </p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the People's Republic of China Banks Steering Committee (the PRC

    SC) for the restructuring in China.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        Notwithstanding the

appointments set out in paras 14 and 15 above, the Petitioners accused APP/its management

of the following misdeeds:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) seriously delaying the restructuring process;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(ii) failing to co-operate with professional advisors and thereby

    hindering the review of the group's financial position;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) engaging in transactions that suggested that substantial sums of

    money were being siphoned out of APP into companies/organisations which are related to the

    Widjaja family;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) giving preference to certain creditors, despite the debt repayment

    standstill;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) failing to establish any satisfactory mechanism to control/monitor

    the operating cashflow of the group.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        It would be well nigh

impossible to elaborate on each and every one of the above complaints. Voluminous

documents were produced in court to which counsel for both parties made copious reference,

in the course of their arguments spanning seven (7) days. Heavy reliance especially, was

placed by the Petitioners inter alia on various press releases and or reports published

by, the International Financial Review (IFR), Morgan Stanley, the Asian Wall Street

Journal, Reuters, the Jakarta Post, The Business Times, Wall Street Journal, The Far

Eastern Economic Review, Bloomberg, The Financial Times and The South China Morning Post.

Consequently, I shall only focus on the more serious allegations raised by the Petitioners

in the course of this judgement. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        The Petitioners alleged

that APP had failed:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) to disclose swap contracts of the value of US$220m with DB in their

    1997 to 2000 audited accounts;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) to satisfactorily explain why Indah Kiat did not disclose the

    existence of US$199.3m deposited with BII Cook Islands, a bank owned by the Widjaja

    family, in its audited accounts for year 2000;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) to explain the qualifications put by AA on the audited accounts

    for year 2000 of Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia on the following transactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) US$261m advance made by Indah Kiat to Sinar Mas' subsidiary Abadi;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(b) provision of US$500m for doubtful debts;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) receivables of US$1 billion from five (5) trading companies

      incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the 5 BVI companies);</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iv) to explain why AA resigned as the company's auditors in November

    2001.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        There were allegations

(not denied) that class actions were commenced in August 2001 against the company (and AA)

in New York, in relation to failure to disclose the losses resulting from the swap

contracts with DB. Further, no reasons were given for the resignation in September 2001 of

Deloitte, Touche &amp; Tohmatsu, who had been appointed to investigate the company's

failure to disclose those losses.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        The Petitioners' concern

that funds from the company had been or were being siphoned out or wrongfully utilised

arose from several events; some of these were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) on 25 May 2001, the Widjaja family disclosed the existence of

    US$247m belonging to Golden-Agri Resources Ltd (a Singapore listed company belonging to

    the Sinar Mas group) being placed with BII, Cook Islands. On 17 July 2001, BII Cook

    Islands announced that it would be unable to pay the deposits of Golden Agri-Resources Ltd

    as well as those of APP amounting to US$80.3m but would do so within a five (5) year

    period;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the 5 BVI companies appeared to be related to APP and or the

    Widjaja family as, their officers were former or current employees of the company. The

    debts owed by the 5 BVI companies appeared to be based on fictitious trades. Further, in

    October 2001, APP inexplicably discontinued five (5) of the many suits it had filed

    against the 5 BVI companies in Jakarta in August 2001;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) US$504m was lent to the wood companies.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        The Petitioners alleged

that the creditors had appointed KPMG to conduct an independent audit of the company.

However, KPMG's progress had been hampered by APP's unwillingness to give the accountants

access to: information relating to the company's operations in China, inter-company debt

analysis, inter-related company transactions and accounts receivable. Consequently, KPMG

missed the completion deadline of July 2001 as well as the revised deadlines of January

and April 2002. Without the report of KPMG, the creditors/Petitioners would not be able to

assess the viability of the debt restructuring proposals put forward by the company. It

was further alleged that APP had deliberately used the ploy of disputing KPMG's fees to

prevent/delay the release of the firm's report. Relying on a report published in the 16

June issue of IFR Asia, the Petitioners alleged that Teguh Widjaja, a member of the

Widjaja family, had demanded that KPMG's draft report should be revised to delete

inaccuracies which included an allegation that funds had been siphoned out of APP by its

shareholders. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        The Petitioners alleged

that interest payments were made to rupiah-denominated bondholders for many months after

the debt standstill; they were suspended only after pressure from international creditors.

The company had also reportedly paid interest to certain Chinese creditors after March

2001. APP had also paid IBRA some US$90m to settle debts owed by the Sinar Mas group.

There was even speculation in the press that the Widjaja family was buying up its own

rupiah-denominated bonds through third parties, as a means of extracting cash from APP and

to influence creditors' votes on any proposed restructuring plan.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        The Petitioners concluded

their Petition with the belief that there was a reasonable possibility of rehabilitating

the company and the APP group as a whole, of preserving its business as a going concern,

by placing the company under judicial management instead of winding it up. Reasons for

their preference over compulsory liquidation and a scheme of arrangement under s 210, were

set out in paras 93 to 106 of the Petition; essentially it was because the Petitioners

believed the group could be rehabilitated.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        I must point out that the

Petitioners' appointees for the position of Judicial Managers were not without

controversy. The proposed judicial managers Messrs Kon Yuen Kong, Wong Kian Kok and

William Caven Hutchinson are from the accounting firm of Foo, Kon, Tan, Grant Thornton

Singapore (the firm). The firm through its ties with Grant Thornton International, are

associated with the Indonesian firm of PT Grant Thornton who are the auditors of Indah

Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia. There was some concern that there would be a conflict of interest

should the three (3) appointees of the firm be made judicial managers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        The possible conflict

between PT Grant Thornton and the firm also resulted in conflict between the associated

firms themselves. The managing-director of DB's Asia Pacific head office, Wolfgang Helmut

Topp (Topp) had, in his first affidavit stated that he had been informed by Gabriel Azedo

(the Divisional Director of Grant Thornton International) who met with James Kallman (the

President-Director of PT Grant Thornton), that it had been agreed that PT Grant Thornton

(with suitable compensation) would, at the request of Grant Thornton International's Chief

Executive Officer (David McDonnell) relinquish its role as auditor of Indah Kiat and Tjiwi

Kimia should the firm's three (3) appointees be appointed judicial managers. This was

however hotly denied by James Kallman, (according to Djongianto in his first affidavt). In

his exchange of letters with Grant Thornton International, James Kallman gave the distinct

impression that PT Grant Thornton would not resign as auditors of the two (2) listed

subsidiaries of APP. It did not help matters that Kon Yuen Kong and Gabriel Azedo joined

in the fray by affirming affidavits supporting Topp's position. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        In the light of my

refusal to put APP under judicial management, it is academic and unnecessary for me to

determine who is speaking the truth and whose version of the conversations which took

place between James Kallman, David McDonnell and Gabrial Azedo, I should accept. However,

it does show the extent of disagreement between the parties, even on the people to be

appointed as judicial managers. I should add however, that in view of the controversy

generated on this subject, it may be unwise to choose Grant Thornton International or its

associated firms in the event some petitioner, other than DB and or PNB, decide to file a

fresh petition for judicial management against APP in the future.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        The Petition concluded by

pointing out (in para 107) that the company had benefited from the well respected

regulatory and business environment provided by Singapore (including its OHQ status) which

contributed in no small measure to its ability to raise massive funds in the global

capital markets. Consequently, the Petitioners felt it was appropriate that creditors

should turn to the self-same regime for resolution of the present situation and they asked

the court to adopt a robust approach to address the concerns of financial institutions

with international repute. I will return to this argument later, referred to and

criticised by counsel for APP (Davinder Singh) as the 'Singapore card'.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">APP's case </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        In his first affidavit,

Djongianto stated that not only APP, but IBRA and other creditors particularly those in

China, opposed the appointment of judicial managers. He contended that putting APP under

judicial management would not only not achieve the objectives set out under s 227A of the

Companies Act but, would also cause irreparable harm to the company for the following

reasons:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) judicial managers will not facilitate the approval of an acceptable

    compromise or agreement between the company and its creditors nor provide for a better

    realisation of its assets;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) appointing judicial managers at the holding company level would

    cause operating subsidiaries (where actual value of the group lies) to stop paying APP

    management fees, ring-fence their own assets and enter into separate restructuring

    arrangements with their own creditors;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) because of the organisational structure of the group, judicial

    managers if appointed, will not be able to discharge their duties to take control of the

    company's assets, as they are mainly located outside Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Indeed, it was Djongianto's contention that appointing judicial

managers would sound the death knell for the company. He asserted it would jeopardise the

on-going restructuring process, lead to the disintegration of the company as, without the

up-flow of funds from its operating subsidiaries, APP's creditors would not be repaid and,

the company would ultimately be forced to wind up.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        As earlier stated (para

13 <i>supra</i>), Djongianto disagreed with the Petitioners' claim that no agreement (let

alone progress), had been achieved on the debt restructuring proposal between APP and its

creditors. He explained that the Widjaja family was pursuing a consensual restructuring

plan because it would allow monies from the company's operating subsidiaries to be

up-streamed to the company for the benefit of APP's creditors, even though this was not in

the interests of the creditors at the level of the operating subsidiaries. Such

up-streaming would immediately cease upon the appointment of judicial managers as, the

creditors of each operating subsidiary would scramble to ring-fence the assets of

individual debtor companies to protect their own claims.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        Although it is the duty

of court-appointed judicial managers to take control/custody and management of the

property to which the company is entitled, Djongianto said this exercise would either be

meaningless or impossible/impractical in this case for several reasons:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) APP's main asset is its equity in the operating subsidiaries held

    through Purinusa. Purinusa's main creditor is IBRA (to the tune of US$346m out of total

    debts of US$361m). IBRA is separately owed US$602m by the operating subsidiaries. IBRA

    holds as security a pledge over Purinusa's shares in the operating subsidiaries as well as

    mortgages over the properties owned by the subsidiaries. IBRA was unlikely to do nothing

    if the judicial managers attempted to take control of the Indonesian operating

    subsidiaries through APP's shareholdings. Instead, IBRA will move to enforce its security

    over the assets of the operating subsidiaries and, given the level of the latter's

    indebtedness to IBRA, it is unlikely that such realisation will yield any surplus for

    up-streaming to the parent company's creditors;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the judicial managers would encounter legal and practical issues

    in taking control of the boards and management of the operating subsidiaries in both

    Indonesia and China. Their attempts to do so may aggravate existing delays not to mention

    incurring additional costs at the company's expense, which could have been better utilised

    for the benefit of creditors;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) operation of the mills owned and run by the operating

    subsidiaries require specialised technical knowledge as well as sensitivity to and

    knowledge of local conditions/circumstances – judicial managers would not have any

    such knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        Djongianto cast doubt on

the efficacy of the powers of Singapore-appointed judicial managers in Indonesia and

China. He produced legal opinions (see his exhibits <b>F8</b> and <b>F9</b>) from M/s King

&amp; Wood and Tumbuan Pane respectively, to support his contention that court appointed

judicial managers would encounter great difficulties in exercising control over the

company's Chinese and Indonesian subsidiaries; the judicial managers'

appointment/authority would not be automatically recognised. There is considerable

uncertainty under PRC laws as to what rights if any, APP's judicial managers would have,

over the company's China-based operating subsidiaries (numbering 13). Indonesia law would

not recognise Singapore court-appointed judicial managers of APP as having the right to

exercise control over its subsidiaries incorporated in Indonesia. The judicial managers

would have to go through the arduous and probably lengthy process of applying separately

to the Chinese and Indonesian courts for recognition of their status.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.        Not surprisingly, the

Petitioners produced contrary opinions (see exhibits <b>JLME-6</b> and <b>JMLE-7</b> in

Joyce Lim's affidavit) from their own legal advisers in Indonesia (Remy &amp; Darus) and

China (Global Law Office). Both law firms opined that the judicial managers would be able

to exercise APP's rights as majority shareholder, in the operating subsidiaries; they

would replace the function and authority of APP's board of directors.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.        Djongianto claimed that

judicial management of APP would jeopardise the company's receipt of cheap wood supplies

(at no less than 35% discount below market prices) for its Indonesian subsidiaries from

the two wood companies. He went so far as to say (in his third affidavit) that <i>the

lifeblood of the group is the continuous (and guaranteed) supply of low cost wood from the

wood companies</i>. This 'discount' however was refuted by the Petitioners who referred to

press and other reports which suggested that <u>not only</u> were no discounts given but,

the wood companies were in fact supplying timber to APP's subsidiaries at inflated prices

and on unfavourable terms under onerous and long term contracts; I shall revert to this

subject later.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The restructuring process</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.        Djongianto asserted that

the company had acted in accordance with the debt restructuring plan of its financial

advisers CSFB (whose managing-director Raymond Davis filed a supporting affidavit to

oppose the Petition). He detailed the steps the company had taken since the debt

standstill, over and above the appointments of professional/legal advisers set out in para

14 above. Djongianto deposed that 24 or more meetings had taken place with creditors up to

8 May 2002, starting with one on 6 March 2001, which was even before the press release.

The group had spent considerable time working with KPMG in reviewing the group's financial

positions for its Indonesian operations. Contrary to the Petitioners' claims, the company

had not been uncooperative with KPMG. In fact, it had given easy access to all

documentation, made staff/accounting staff available to answer queries and, assigned in

excess of 100 staff to work with the accountants. White &amp; Case had even created a data

room for the benefit of KPMG and creditors. Djongianto rejected as unfounded the

Petitioners' claim that the company deliberately wanted to delay the release of KPMG's

report. Indeed, the USC was at fault in not monitoring the activities of KPMG and, because

KPMG had to respond to a variety of creditor demands from within the USC, the scope of the

accountants' audit had expanded beyond that of a due diligence report, resulting in

considerable delay. Further, there was a genuine dispute on the fees chargeable by KPMG

(which was however resolved subsequently) which delayed the issuance of their report. I

should point out that phase 1 of KPMG's report was finally released on or 26 July 2002

(after the first part hearing).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.        Djongianto criticised the

creditors (including DB) for rejecting the company's restructuring proposal dated 1

February 2002 (containing 75 pages) within hours of its presentation, without giving the

same due consideration. He held the creditors responsible for the subsequent delay as,

instead of negotiating with the company on its proposal, the USC chose to revert only

three (3) months later (on 2 May 2002) with mere fundamental principles (18 pages) for the

restructuring process. Criticism was also levelled at the USC which Djongianto alleged was

being driven by 29 creditors with divergent interests. Indeed, the company's expert

witness Andrew Riebe (Riebe) asserted that the company's creditors bore the lion's share

of the blame for the lack of progress in restructuring. Riebe criticised the creditors for

demanding excessive inter-creditor secrecy, for overstaffing committees with people

scattered all over the globe and opined that the USC lacked leadership. Riebe also

commented that the creditors' proposed negotiating structure appeared flawed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.        In contrast, the

consensual restructuring of the group's Chinese debts was progressing well; Chinese

domestic banks had agreed to roll-over loans on condition that the assets in China are

shielded from creditors. Such roll-over had allowed the company to complete construction

of its pulp and paper plant in Hainan Island. In mid-June 2002, the company presented a

restructuring proposal to the Chinese banks which plan is under active negotiation.

Chinese creditors who are in the PRC SC (para 15[iv] <i>supra</i>) strongly opposed the

appointment of judicial managers, as reflected in a letter dated 18 July 2002 (see exhibit

<b>FD-4</b> in Djongianto's third affidavit) addressed care of Rabobank Hong Kong to, the

China Foreign Creditors Committee from Johnson Stokes &amp; Master, solicitors for the PRC

SC. </p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">Three (3) other creditors namely, Gramecry Advisors LLC, Credit

Lyonnais and Swiss Capital Alternative Investments AG, gave letters of support to the

Petitioners (see exhibit <b>JLME-5</b> in Joyce Lim's affidavit).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.        Something more has to be

said about creditor (vi) above. Unlike the other creditors who filed brief affidavits

supporting the Petition and set out the sums owed to them by APP (either as principal

debtor or as guarantor), Centre Solutions (an insurance company) filed (by its

Vice-President Sukhdeep Singh Sandhu [Sandhu]) a 778 page affidavit (inclusive of

exhibits) alleging the massive fraud APP had perpetrated on them, arising out of a

securitization programme established pursuant to a Master Trust Agreement dated 23 October

1998 made between The Bank of New York and APP International Trading (VI) Ltd, whose

obligations were essentially guaranteed by APP. There was an additional allegation that

sales in the APP group were inflated by US$1 billion. Sandhu's affidavit (para 30) also

alleged that APP had receivables from seven (7) Hong Kong companies which had non-existent

or fictitious addresses whilst 14 other customers had the same business address. The

common address itself belonged to a company (Lucky Rock Limited) which is ultimately owned

by a subsidiary of or otherwise related to, APP.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.        APP filed an affidavit by

one Ferry Kusien (Kusien) a member of the company's legal department, to rebut Sandhu's

allegations. In addition to disputing Sandhu's allegations on their merits, APP also took

issue with Centre Solution's <i>locus standi</i>, challenging Centre Solution's right to

file affidavits to support the Petition and to make submissions, arguing that Regulations

35 to 37 made under the Companies Act Cap 50 <u>do not</u> provide for creditors who <u>suppor</u>t

Petitions for judicial management orders to file affidavits. Such creditors are only

entitled to appear at the hearing of the Petition <u>to indicate their support or

opposition</u> to judicial management orders being made (emphasis added). It was further

submitted that the Petitioners could not rely on Centre Solutions's allegations to support

their pleaded case; otherwise APP would be severely prejudiced. By supporting the

Petition, APP alleged that Centre Solutions was making good its previous threat to

publicly damage APP if the company (which had refused) did not give in to its

threats/pressure to pay more receivables into the securitization programme. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.        Ultimately, there was no

need to make a ruling on Centre Solution's <i>locus standi</i> as in the midst of the

hearing, on 16 August 2002 (see N/E198-201), their counsel (Andre Yeap) informed the court

that his clients had decided to withdraw their support for the Petition. He indicated that

Centre Solutions' change of heart was prompted by the fact that the group appeared to have

made considerable efforts to move ahead with the restructuring exercise since the filing

of the Petition. The court was further informed that APP had given fresh assurances to

Centre Solutions to honour its commitments relating to the securitization programme.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.        I would add that Centre

Solutions' perception of APP's more vigorous approach to restructuring since the filing of

the Petition, was corroborated by none other than one of the Petitioners. In his third

affidavit filed for DB, Topp stated (in paras 4 and 5):-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">In the six weeks since the Petition was filed, the

    following events have taken place:</p>
<p align="justify">(i) the long-awaited KPMG Phase 1 due diligence report (the KPMG

    report) on the company and its subsidiaries has been released (a copy of which is annexed

    hereto and marked as <b>WHT-9);</b></p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the company had apparently 'committed' to 'finalising' a

    restructuring plan (of the Indonesian operations) by September 30, 2002 and that IBRA has

    agreed to take leading role in the process;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the company has apparently agreed to opening an escrow account(s)

    to set aside cash for the benefit of the creditors and to make regular contributions to

    the account(s), but the 'details are being worked out' and the company is still haggling

    about the amount; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the company has apparently agreed to augmentation of management

    but again the details are being worked out.</p>
<p align="justify">The Petitioners are gratified at these developments, but suspect that

    the company's newly stated willingness to accede (partially) to creditors' requests is

    due, the Petitioners' believe to some extent at least to their attempt to resist the

    appointment of judicial managers.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I myself entertain no doubts that the filing of the Petition was the

impetus which prompted the company to hasten the pace of restructuring, in order to stave

off judicial management.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.        Conflicting charts were

produced by the parties showing the extent of support or opposition as the case may be,

for the Petition. What is clear however is, that neither sides' computation showed

overwhelming support for or against, the making of a judicial management order, at the APP

level. The Petitioners produced pie charts which showed 25.3% were for and 24.2% were

against, the granting of the Petition. APP's revised chart no. 6 indicated that 27% were

for and 22% were against, the Petition. At the subsidiaries' level, a more conclusive

picture emerged. The Chinese creditors were overwhelmingly against the granting of a

judicial management order while for the Indonesian creditors, the vote depended on whose

figures one accepted – APP claimed that 24% of creditors were against the Petition

being granted as opposed to 14% being in favour, while the Petitioners asserted that 30.4%

were for and 20.7% against, the Petition. Most creditors at all three (3) levels of debt

were essentially 'fence-sitters' or neutral although counsel for the Petitioners (Alvin

Yeo) took the position (V/N 149) that the silence of the majority was indicative of

implied support for the Petition and, further indicative of APP's failings in its

restructuring process.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.        What I did find

remarkable was, that holders of the same bond issue could be in opposite camps. In this

regard I refer to the bonds listed in items 5,6 and 7 of the attachment to the letter of

Bingham-McCutchen dated 10 July 2002 (see exhibit <b>JLME-3 </b>in Joyce Lim's affidavit)

addressed to White &amp; Case LLP; Bingham-McCutchen stated their clients supported the

Petition. However, holders of the same bonds in the letters dated 16 and 20 August 2002 of

Nomura Singapore Limited addressed to APP, opposed the Petition. Nomura were/are the

custodians/nominees of those bond holders whose identity they declined to reveal, when

requested by the Petitioners' solicitors. Another interesting factor is that CSFB, while

acting as APP's debt restructuring adviser, is also a creditor of the company/group to the

tune of US$405-650m, depending on whose figure one accepts; CSFB too opposed the Petition

as a creditor.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.        Accusations and cross

accusations were traded by the parties against one another, each alleging pressure was

being applied on it by the other party. On the first day of the hearing, the Petitioners

had produced another letter dated 10 July 2002 from Bingham-McCutchen to the Petitioners

(see exhibit <b>JLME-2</b> of Joyce Lim's affidavit) expressing support for the Petition;

the firm stated that their clients were owed in excess of US$1.53 billion by APP while the

company's subsidiaries owed another US$1.217 billion. Exhibit A was attached to the said

letter listing seven (7) demands the bondholders required APP to comply with before the

bondholders would withdraw their support for the Petition. Mr Davinder Singh considered

the demands (see V/N215) <i>as another weapon from the negotiating armoury of the

bondholders.</i> He described the Petitioners' allegations of fraud as a red herring which

had been dredged up for a collateral purpose. He referred to the bondholders' following

demands:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">6. No later than 19 July 2002, the APP group shall

    establish a debt restructuring task force, which shall include Mr Indra Widjaja, Mr

    Frankie Widjaja and senior officers of APP, which task force shall be responsible for

    providing information required by the USC and IBRA and for negotiating the Restructuring

    Plan. </p>
<p align="justify">7. No later than 30 September 2002, the APP group and its controlling

    shareholders shall have signed and delivered the Restructuring Plan.</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">pointing out that notwithstanding their allegations of fraud, the

bondholders had no qualms dealing with and having the Widjaja family run the show,

provided the family complied with the bondholders' demands. These included a deposit of

not less than US$100m from APP's four (4) Indonesian subsidiaries into four (4) separate

escrow accounts established with internationally reputable banks designated by the

bondholders; the monies were to be assigned absolutely for the benefit of creditors,

pursuant to the restructuring plan to be agreed by USC and IBRA.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45.        On their part, the

Petitioners accused APP of using veiled threats to garner support from creditors to oppose

the Petition. Their counsel Alvin Yeo referred to a memorandum from White &amp; Case dated

26 June 2002 to the CSC's legal advisors Shearman &amp; Sterling Stamford (and also to

Bingham Dana), which contained the following paragraphs:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Attached to this memorandum is a form of support letter

    which APP expects to receive from each entity or person participating in the Umbrella

    Steering Committee. APP asks that you send this memorandum and the form of support letter

    to those committee members whom you represent and ask that a support letter, in the

    suggested format, be delivered as soon as possible and, in any event, by no later than

    July 5, 2002. APP asks for your assistance in ensuring that committee members whom you

    represent be made aware of the contents of this memorandum, and the request that support

    letters be issued, as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p align="justify">Please note that APP is of the view that the judicial management

    Petition is not consistent with the consensual restructuring, out-of-court restructuring

    concept which has been under discussion between APP and the Umbrella Steering Committee

    for more than one year. The fact that one of the Petitioners is an Umbrella Steering

    Committee member is also a cause of concern. In the circumstances, APP expects those

    committee members which support the consensual restructuring concept to issue the

    requested letter, thereby providing tangible evidence of its support for the consensual

    process. The refusal or other failure by an Umbrella Steering Committee member to issue a

    support letter will be viewed by APP as indicating that such member does not support the

    consensual out-of-court restructuring process. Should it transpire that a material number

    of committee members fail to issue a support letter, APP is of the view that may be

    material adverse consequences for the consensual debt restructuring process.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I agree that the above paragraphs constituted a threat by APP and not a

subtle one at that. Alvin Yeo had repeatedly informed the court that the company's

creditors should not have to negotiate with a gun at their heads nor should the

restructuring process be held to ransom by what the creditors contended were threats to

withhold co-operation. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">IBRA's position</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46.        Next I turn to the not

unimportant role played by IBRA. I would not disagree with Alvin Yeo's statement that IBRA

is a state agency which has different interests from those of APP's creditors despite

which, it had been foisted with the unenviable task of leading the restructuring process.

IBRA's position was initially unclear. On the one hand, the Petitioners claimed that IBRA

did not oppose the Petition, relying on a report from Bloomberg dated 25 June 2002, which

quoted IBRA's chairman Syafruddin Temenggung as saying that it was willing to endorse

legal action against APP, when asked for his comments on the Petition. The company on the

other hand produced a letter dated 28 June 2002 from IBRA addressed to the company's board

of directors, opposing the Petition; the letter contained the following paragraph which

was in the support letter drafted by White &amp; Case:- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<font size="3"><p align="justify">It has come to our attention that certain creditors have

    over APP. In our view, this action should have been taken in conjunction with the consent

    of other creditors. Indeed, we are working towards the consensual restructuring agreement

    and will not agree with any action that may well be jeopardising the process.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It cannot be a coincidence that on 29 June 2002, APP issued a press

release stating that a day earlier, the company had paid IBRA a sum of US$90m through its

Indonesian operations, pursuant to payment arrangements reached with IBRA on the debts

owed by Sinar Mas; no doubt the payment prompted IBRA's change of heart. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The same report went on to state:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">IBRA has agreed to take a leading and proactive role in

    the consensual debt restructuring discussions currently under way between the Indonesian

    operations of APP and its creditors. IBRA's agreement to play a leading role in the

    restructuring is intended to facilitate accelerated discussions with the objective of

    agreeing the basic commercial terms of the consensual debt restructuring.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47.        In arguing that

consensual restructuring under IBRA's leadership should be given a chance, APP also

referred to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 15 June 2002 made between IBRA and

the export credit agencies (ECAs) of Germany, Japan and the United States; it provided for

resolution of IBRA's claims against the APP group and controlling shareholders of the

Sinar Mas group. Two significant principles set out in the MOU state as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">7<font size="3">. The restructuring plan shall further provide that

    IBRA shall share the benefits of all fiduciary transfers, security rights, pledges and

    guarantees that IBRA may have or may have the right to have, under the Settlement

    Agreement (collectively called 'the Security') with the other unaffiliated creditors of

    the APP group. In sharing such benefits, IBRA may retain the Security, but may enforce

    such security only for the benefit of creditors generally as shall be provided under the

    restructuring plan. The Creditors' Restructuring Outline dated 2 May 2002, as may be

    modified from time to time by agreement of IBRA and the USC, shall serve as the basis of

    the restructuring plan.</font></p>
<p align="justify">9. IBRA agrees to the principles set forth in the Creditors'

    Restructuring Outline and shall use its capacity to cause the APP group and the

    controlling shareholders of the Sinar Mas group to accept such principles and a

    restructuring plan based on those principles. More specifically, IBRA shall…cause the

    APP group…. to agree to .. </p>
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">(i) augmentation of the management of the APP group,

      including creditor representation on the boards of the relevant members of the APP group;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) control of the cash of the APP group by creditors;… .</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I should caution that the undertakings in the MOU were clearly stated

(in paras 11 and 12) to be not binding on the parties until:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the Indonesian) Financial Sector Policy Committee had issued a

    decree, endorsed by the approval of the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the respective supervisory governmental authorities of each of the

    ECAs had similarly endorsed the MOU.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Reference was also made to reports (from Reuters News Service on 5 July

2002) stating that IBRA would be putting five (5) chief financial officers into each

Indonesian subsidiary, to avoid diversion of funds.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The KPMG report </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48.        Some reference must be

made to the KPMG report before I explain why I gave APP an opportunity to continue with

the consensual restructuring process. In this regard, I should also point out that due to

objections raised by the company's counsel (principally on the ground that the KPMG report

was rendered to USC members on a confidential basis), the hearing was in camera when the

parties' arguments centred on the findings in the report. With this constraint in mind, I

will only refer to extracts from the KPMG report where they have already found their way

into the press or other publications and are in the public domain. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49.        It would be fair to say

that some findings in the KPMG report were a cause for concern. I will highlight those

which have been disclosed to the public in one way or another, by Reuters News Service and

or other agencies. The KPMG report was referred to (and exhibited) <i>in extenso</i> in

Topp's third affidavit for which reason I ordered all the court documents to be sealed to

pre-empt access by third parties not involved in these proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50.        According to reports from

the Wall Street Journal (dated 27 Jan 2002) and from the Far Eastern Economic Review issue

dated 14 February 2002, questions had arisen surrounding a purchase of a huge tract of

land (1,759 hectares) for US$170m by APP's subsidiary Pindo Deli from a Sinar Mas company.

In actual fact, the KPMG report stated that Pindo Deli as well as PT Lontar Papyrus had

paid US$181.6m (of which US$110.5m was in cash) to the controlling shareholders to

purchase additional land (between January and September 2001), at a time when both

subsidiaries were facing a cash crunch. Further, Pindo Deli already owned approximately

495 hectares of land of which only about 30% had been developed. There was therefore no

reason to, nor had APP provided any plan which necessitated, acquiring such a large piece

of land. Further, APP did not disclose the purchase until August 2001, after the debt

standstill.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51.        Yet another transaction

which caused disquiet were the advances totalling US$504/- to the wood companies, made

mainly in the fourth quarter of 2000; Indah Kiat advanced US$276m to Abadi, PT Lontar

Papyrus advanced US$75m to Sakti while Purinusa advanced US$153m to both companies.

References to these loans were made in the special report of Morgan Stanley dated 21 March

2002 (at p 13) although the loan amounts were incorrectly stated. When the creditors

demanded to look at the accounts of the wood companies, their request was denied on the

basis that the two (2) companies were outside the APP group. I note that such a legal

nicety did not stop the Widjaja family from lending out the monies in the first place. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52.        Other transactions which

made no commercial sense and which were clearly disadvantageous to APP's subsidiaries

were, fresh pulpwood purchase agreements entered into in January 2001 by Indah Kiat with

Abadi and by PT Lontar Papyrus with Sakti, even though the original agreements made on 23

May 1994 and 27 January 1995 respectively between the parties, were valid for 15 years.

The onerous terms in Indah Kiat's agreement included being charged for wood at agreed

prices, instead of the pricing being pegged to the actual cost of production. Further,

Indah Kiat could not offset the advances it had made to Abadi, against the price of wood

supplied by the latter. Far worse, both agreements provided for a penalty of US$1 billion

and waiver of all outstanding balances, if either Indah Kiat or PT Lontar Papyrus obtained

wood from sources <u>other than</u> Abadi and Sakit respectively. A brief report of Indah

Kiat's agreement appeared in The Business Times of 21 February 2002. I should mention that

one of the demands stipulated by the bondholders (represented by Bingham-McCutchen) for

withdrawal of their support for the Petition was, that the original wood supply contracts

dated 23 May 1994 and 27 January 1995 be restored and, further amendments to those

original agreements would have to be made on terms and conditions acceptable to USC and

IBRA. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53.        One other questionable

transaction (which received wide coverage in the Asian Wall Street Journal report of 28

August 2001) were the debts of US$1 billion owed to the company's Indonesian subsidiaries

by the five (5) BVI companies (see paras 18(iii)(c) and 20(ii) <i>supra</i>). Bloomberg

had also carried a report (on 27 December 2001) on the receivables. KPMG and the media

reported that the 5 BVI companies (Yale Han Trading Ltd, Red Chips International Ltd, City

Success Ltd, Lucky Clover Ltd and Shinning Armour Ltd) shared the same address in the BVI

(at P. O. Box 957, Road Town, Tortola), were registered in Singapore with four (4) being

registered on the same day (19 February 1998) and, all five (5) subsequently closed down

their businesses in Singapore on 9 February 2001. Although the company told the Asian Wall

Street Journal that the 5 BVI companies were not related to APP, officers and agents of

those companies which the journal spoke to, turned out to be APP employees. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54.        The Indonesian

subsidiaries (Indah Kiat, Tjiwi Kimia and Pindo Deli) filed 10 suits against the 5 BVI

companies in the Jakarta Central Courts for claims in excess of US$1 billion. In April

2002, Indah Kiat obtained judgments against a number of debtors for about US$242m.

However, five (5) of the suits were discontinued subsequently. What was even more

disturbing was the company's response (through Djongianto) to these events, as can be seen

from the following paragraphs in his first affidavit:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">315. The Indonesian Operating Subsidiaries chose to

    discontinue claims against five of the BVI companies because it was decided that, given

    the drain on the management and manpower resources of the subsidiaries, it was better to

    focus our efforts on the more substantial claims.</p>
<p align="justify">316. There is simply no basis for the Petitioners to allege that these

    claims are not genuine transactions.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Both explanations were highly unsatisfactory and were no answer to the

creditors/Petitioners' concerns which were well founded; the questionable nature of the 5

BVI companies and their apparent connection with the Widjaja family cried out for

explanations which were not at all forthcoming. I found it hard to believe that the cost

of manpower and other resources to be expended by APP were not commensurate with the huge

sums to be recovered from the 5 BVI companies. What was even more puzzling was, why the

company's subsidiaries chose to commence proceedings in the Jakarta courts instead of in

the companies' place of incorporation. What is the use if the judgments obtained cannot be

enforced in the British Virgin Islands and the monies thereunder recovered? Obtaining

paper judgments without more, is not enough. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55.        Other questionable

transactions included APP's selective payments to creditors in Indonesia and China after

the debt standstill. Counsel had explained that payment to rupiah-denominated bondholders

were necessary as a matter of political survival because otherwise, relatively small

Indonesian banks and Indonesian pension funds which had invested heavily in those bonds

and who depended on the fund payments for their livelihood would have been adversely

affected. In turn, APP would have felt the impact because some of these bondholders are

associated/connected with provincial governments which are important to the business

prospects of the APP group. Consequently (according to Djongianto's first affidavit), the

company had no option but to make relevant payments to rupiah-denominated investors. As

for the Petitioners' allegation that the reason for the payment was that the Widjaja

family was buying up the rupiah-denominated bonds, Djongianto's explanation (in his second

affidavit para 7) was that he had made inquiries of the family members and was told that

was not the case. I am not at all satisfied with either explanation.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56.        It would be useful to

start by looking at the provisions of ss 227A and 227B of the Companies Act Cap 50 (the

Act); the relevant portions of the sections state:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><b><p align="justify">227A</p>
</b><p align="justify">Where a company or where a creditor or creditors of a company

    consider that — </p>
<p align="justify">(a) the company is or will be unable to pay its debts; and </p>
<p align="justify">(b) there is a reasonable probability of rehabilitating the company or

    of preserving all or part of its business as a going concern or that otherwise the

    interests of creditors would be better served than by resorting to a winding up,</p>
<p align="justify">an application may be made to the Court under section 227B for an order

    that the company should be placed under the judicial management of a judicial manager.</p>
<b><p align="justify">227B</p>
</b><p align="justify">(1) Where a company or its directors (pursuant to a resolution of

    its members or the board of directors) or a creditor or creditors (including any

    contingent or prospective creditor or creditors or all or any of those parties, together

    or separately), pursuant to section 227A, make an application by way of Petition, for an

    order that the company should be placed under the judicial management of a judicial

    manager, the Court may make a judicial management order in relation to the company if, and

    the company and any such persons as are mentioned in that section;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) a more advantageous realisation of the company's assets would be

    effected than on a winding up.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It is common ground that APP is unable to pay its debts. What is in

dispute between the parties is whether the objectives under s 227B(b) of the Act would be

achieved by placing the company under judicial management; I was of the view that it would

not. Whilst I did not entirely agree with the doomsday scenario painted by the company

should judicial managers be appointed, I was also not convinced that the picture would be

as rosy as that presented by the Petitioners, should judicial managers be appointed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57.        Counsel for the

Petitioners had repeatedly stressed that, the judicial managers to be appointed fully

intended to work in tandem with IBRA and with the Chinese creditors to rehabilitate APP

and to better realise its assets, that the appointees would not adopt a confrontational

attitude. That may well be the noble intention but the more pertinent question to ask is,

would IBRA and the Chinese creditors want to work/co-operate with the judicial managers? I

think not, judging from the indications given so far by both IBRA and by the Chinese

creditor banks, through the PRS SC, as seen in the letter of Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master

dated 18 July 2002 (para 36 <i>supra</i>). Without the co-operation of IBRA and the

clients of Johnson, Stokes &amp; Master, the judicial managers would not be able to make

any headway in the discharge of their duties outside Singapore. It bears remembering that

apart from being headquartered in Singapore, APP has no or valuable assets here; its

subsidiary Nippecraft Limited cannot be considered as it is a public listed company while

no information was forthcoming from either party on the company's other Singapore

subsidiaries. I noted further that the Petitioners' claims (and the debt instruments of

other creditors whether supporting or opposing) did not provide for Singapore as the <i>forum

conveniens</i>. The transgressions complained of by the Petitioners took place outside

Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58.        Counsel had indicated

that the Petitioners intended to assume control of the APP's Indonesian and Chinese

subsidiaries by exercising the company's rights as shareholder in the subsidiaries. With

respect, I am not at all optimistic that the task can be so easily achieved by such a

route. That may well be the case under our system of law but may not be so under Chinese

and Indonesian law, given the anticipated opposition from creditors of those subsidiaries

to the judicial management order in the first place, as well as the conflict in opinions

from the parties' Indonesian and Chinese legal advisers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59.        Before I proceed further,

I wish to address the issue of what counsel for the company described as the 'Singapore

card' argument (para 27 <i>supra</i>). In response to the Petitioners' argument that

Singapore courts should grant redress to its creditors as APP is a Singapore company,

Djongianto had produced (see exhibit <b>FD-10</b>) a reply from the Monetary Authority of

Singapore to an article which appeared in Asian Business on 13 August 2001 headed

"Asia's worst deal"; MAS had stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Asia's worst deal (Asian Business, Aug 13) states that

    securities of Asia Pulp and Paper Co (APP) passed muster with regulators in Singapore and

    Washington, and that lax regulators contributed to the disaster. Although APP was

    incorporated in Singapore with limited liability, it was listed on the New York Stock

    Exchange. It was not listed on the Singapore Exchange and is therefore not subject to

    Singapore listing rules. </p>
<p align="justify">Neither APP nor its subsidiaries registered prospectuses for its

    securities issues with Singapore's authorities, because the securities were either not

    offered in Singapore or were not targeted at retail investors. This is the practice

    internationally e g in the US, Britain and Australia.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Djongianto had pointed out that the creditors of APP (including the

Petitioners) knew the risks involved in lending to APP and its subsidiaries; he exhibited

(<b>FD-13</b>) samples of the kind of prospectuses that were issued for bonds previously

offered by the group's subsidiaries; these included APP China's (in the sum of US$403m),

APP International Finance Company BV's (in the sum of US$350m), and APP Finance (VI)

Mauritius Ltd's (in the sum of US$1.25 billion) all of which were guaranteed by APP and

managed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and or Merrill Lynch, leading American bankers. The

APP group had detailed in those prospectuses the high risks involved. Yet, the hard-nosed

bankers had no qualms about lending to the company's various subsidiaries. Consequently

Djongianto had asserted, the Petitioners and their supporting creditors should not now be

heard to complain to a Singapore court suggesting otherwise; I agree.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60.        The Petitioners had inter

alia relied on <i>Re Genesis Technologies International (S) Pte Ltd </i><nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 390</nobr><i>
</i>to<i> </i>support their contention that their interests as creditors are paramount

where a debtor company is insolvent, because a company whose debts far exceeds its assets

in effect belongs to its creditors. I do not dispute that proposition of law for one

moment. With respect however, Selvam J in that case only had to deal with a local company

which had a paid-up capital (of $12,766) which was 10% of its authorised capital. In

contrast, APP is a huge conglomerate. Even if I were to apply the principles enunciated in

that case, the Petitioners' wishes do not reflect those of the majority of the creditors

(see para 42 <i>supra</i>); it is clear that the Chinese creditors overwhelmingly oppose

judicial management. The position is less clear-cut where the Indonesian creditors are

concerned. However, IBRA whose wishes cannot be ignored, has also voiced its opposition.

Indeed, at APP's level, there is no conclusive preference either way. I noted that CSFB,

although a substantial creditor of the group, opposed the Petition. So did Nicky Tan, who

was reviewing the group's financial position. Both Raymond Davis of CSFB and Nicky Tan are

experts in the field of corporate restructuring and some credence must be given to their

views.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61.        In the week that I

dismissed the Petition, the court was informed that IBRA's representatives had come to

Singapore for the purpose of holding talks with members of the USC (which would include

DB). I thought it would be a pity to scuttle IBRA's efforts (albeit made at the last

minute) to restructure the group's debts by consensus. I noted that IBRA had stated in the

MOU it signed with ECAs that it was willing to share the group's assets with other

creditors. In any case, 22 August 2002 (when I dismissed the Petition) was only five (5)

weeks away from the deadline of 30 September 2002 imposed by the USC/the CSC, for the

Widjaja family/APP to sign and deliver up a restructuring plan (one of the demands made by

Bingham-McCutchen for withdrawing support for the Petition). What possible harm could

there be in allowing the company/the Widjaja family one last opportunity to show their

sincerity to restructure the group's debts? Members of the USC should use the opportunity

to put forward their proposals for restructuring in the event they disagree with IBRA's.

They would also do well to consider the criticisms made by Riebe, the company's expert, on

the committee's lack of leadership.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62.        Whatever misdeeds the

Widjaja family had committed in the past were not going to be unravelled retrospectively

by an order for judicial management. Would such acts persist if no judicial managers were

appointed, as the Petitioners alleged would be the case? As I had indicated in my oral

judgment, that would depend very much on how the Widjaja family want the world to view

their future creditworthiness. If the family decides to let the APP group collapse under

its mountain of debts, would appointing judicial managers prevent the group's creditors

from ending up with bad debts? I think not. Would judicial managers be able to salvage any

part of the group's assets for the benefit of APP's creditors in that event? I think it

would be highly unlikely, given the extent of indebtedness at both parent and subsidiary

levels. However, if the Widjajas intend to raise funds ever again from global capital

markets (be it for themselves, APP or Sinar Mas or new conglomerates they intend to form),

then the family members would have to cease treating and spending, funds belonging to

their companies as if from their own personal piggy banks. Serious consideration must be

given to repaying creditors what the group owes. Misuse of companies' funds under any

system of law is unacceptable behaviour, even where corporate governance is less rigorous

than under Singapore law.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63.        Appointing judicial

managers at this stage would only add another layer to the costs to be borne by APP and

its subsidiaries, on top of the costs they are paying for the numerous committees

established in para 14 above. Such an expense can be better saved for payment to

creditors.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64.        Finally, I had made it

clear that dismissing the Petition may well be a temporary reprieve for APP and the

Widjajas. If in six (6) months’ time, the creditors see no visible improvement in the

consensual restructuring process, any creditor who presents a fresh petition to our courts

under s 227B of the Act, would very likely find a sympathetic judge who would be more than

willing to appoint judicial managers, notwithstanding the legal and other obstacles I

anticipate they would encounter, in the discharge of their duties overseas. A new

petitioner would not exclude Centre Solutions, who would have no difficulties in turning

their supporting affidavit into a basis for a fresh petition for judicial management.</p>
