<p>The facts</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">1. The plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore and are builders and

contractors. At the material time, they were the main contractors for a proposed sports and

recreation centre (the project) to be constructed at Jurong East Street 31, Singapore by the

Singapore Sports Council (SSC).</p>
<p align="justify">2. The defendants are an insurance company with whom the plaintiffs took out a

Contractors' All Risks policy numbered DGCRSP0045149600 (the policy) for the project for the period

13 June 1996 to 10 December 1997 naming themselves, SSC and the plaintiffs' subcontractors as the

assured; the policy also covered a maintenance period from 11 December 1997 to 10 December 1999.

Under the policy, the limit of liability for any one accident was $2m. The defendants had also

furnished to SSC, on behalf of the plaintiffs, a performance bond dated 13 June 1996 for the

project, in a sum equivalent to 10% of the contract value.</p>
<p align="justify">3. On or about 8 July 1997, while the plaintiffs were carrying out work on the

project, a part of the retaining wall collapsed and damage was caused to a canal belonging to the

Ministry of the Environment (MOE). On the same day, the plaintiffs gave the requisite notice of

claim to the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The defendants appointed loss adjusters Cunningham International Private

Limited (Cunningham) on or about 11 July 1997 to investigate the damage to the wall and canal. More

than a year later, Cunningham assessed the plaintiffs' claim at $679,065.95 (the assessed amount)

and in their letter dated 1 October 1998 to the plaintiffs' solicitors, they gave a breakdown of the

figure. Cunningham qualified their assessment with the statement that it was <i>'subject to the

approval of the insurers, policy terms, conditions and exclusion'</i>. They added that if the

plaintiffs did not object, they would proceed to forward their report to the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Not hearing from the defendants thereafter, the plaintiffs wrote to their

brokers OCW Insurance (Brokers) Pte Ltd (OCW) on 26 October 1998 requesting the latter to expedite

their claim with the defendants. From time to time, the plaintiffs' director Ong Poh Pieow (Ong)

would also telephone Douglas Ong (Douglas) of OCW to inquire as to the progress on the plaintiffs'

claim. Douglas repeatedly assured Ong he need not worry. However, as neither OCW nor the defendants

contacted the plaintiffs (who were becoming increasingly anxious), the plaintiffs themselves wrote

to the defendants on 11 November 1998 asking for payment of the assessed amount or the reasons for

the non-payment.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Pursuant to the plaintiffs' aforesaid letter and after several telephone

conversations between Ong and Douglas, the latter finally informed Ong in mid-November 1998 that the

defendants were processing the plaintiffs claim. The plaintiffs promptly wrote to the defendants

on 21 November 1998 to record what Douglas had told them and stated they expected to receive the

defendants' cheque <i>'within the next few days'</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The plaintiffs then received a copy of the defendants' letter to OCW dated 9

December 1998 (the first offer) stating they would pay the plaintiffs $523,912.68 on their claim,

subject to confirmation from the SSC that it did not object. The plaintiffs by their letter dated 18

December 1998 questioned why the defendants were paying $155,153.27 less than the assessed amount;

they requested a breakdown of the sum offered. Ong also called Douglas several times to press for

early settlement of the plaintiffs' claim. Apparently he was told that the defendants' assistant

general manager (Richard Li Zheng Ming) who was in charge of the matter was away.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Finally, on 9 March 1999, Ong with his fellow directors Eio Hock Chuar and

Michael Lim met with Richard Li (Li) and Douglas over lunch for a discussion. According to the

plaintiffs, the purpose of the meeting was to reach agreement on a figure acceptable to both parties

for the plaintiffs claim. Ong said the parties finally agreed on $553,560.98 (the compromise sum)

as a compromise in full and final settlement of the plaintiffs' claim. Contrary to the defendants'

subsequent assertion, Ong contended that no conditions were attached to the compromise sum and no

mention was made of SSC.</p>
<p align="justify">9. In their subsequent letter dated 31 March 1999 to OCW (the second offer), the

defendants stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We are pleased to advise that we agree to adjust the proportion borned by

  Insured under Section II from 30% to 20% of the loss. After adjustment, the final figure payable

  is $553,560.98.</p>
<p align="justify">We enclose herewith a discharge for your onward transmission for Insured's

  signature.</p>
<p align="justify">We thank you for your co-operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The discharge voucher addressed to the defendants stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">WE, PROJECTION PTE LTD &amp; SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL hereby acknowledge having

  received from THE TAI PING INSURANCE CO LTD, the sum of Singapore dollars FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE

  THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY AND CENTS NINETY-EIGHT ONLY, being full and final settlement of all

  claims and disbursements arising from loss or damage to properties sustained by us as a result of

  an incident of DAMAGE TO RETAINING WALL &amp; CANAL ON 08.07.97.</p>
<p align="justify">Dated this 31 MARCH 1999</p>

<p align="justify">10. The plaintiffs returned the discharge voucher to the defendants under cover

of their letter dated 8 May 1999 pointing out that SSC was only the nominee for the receipt of money

and not the claimant; therefore there was no need for SSC to sign the discharge voucher. Accordingly

only the plaintiffs signed the defendants' discharge voucher to which they had added the following

words after the last sentence:</p>
<p align="justify">This full and final settlement shall be limited to the aforesaid incident only.</p>
<p align="justify">11. Unknown to the plaintiffs (who only found out in the course of discovery for

this trial), SSC had written to the defendants separately on 19 May 1998 to request that the

defendants expedite payment to the contractors (the plaintiffs) <i>'in order for the contractors to

rectify the damaged works as soon as possible to avoid further damages to the surrounding works and

the canal lining'.</i></p>
<p align="justify">12. As they neither received payment nor a response to their letter dated 8 May

1999, the plaintiffs sent a reminder to the defendants on 8 July<i> </i>1999 with an ultimatum. At

the same time, they pressed Douglas to expedite payment from the defendants. Douglas however

apparently did nothing apart from giving oral assurances that the defendants were preparing the

cheque for payment.</p>
<p align="justify">13. Consequently, in July 1999, Ong visited Li who showed him a letter from the

defendants' solicitors advising the defendants to disclaim liability. Li then offered the plaintiffs

$300,000 as a goodwill settlement in view of the fact that they were valued clients with whom the

defendants wished to maintain a business relationship. Not unexpectedly, Ong did not accept Li's

offer and in due course these proceedings were commenced after the plaintiffs' solicitors had first

sent a letter to the defendants dated 25 August 1999 demanding the compromise sum. By a letter dated

27 September 1999 to the plaintiffs' solicitors, the defendants' solicitors withdrew any offer of

settlement previously made.</p>
<p align="justify">Â </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The pleadings</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">14. In the (amended) statement of claim, the plaintiffs alleged that there was a

compromise agreement between the parties as reflected in the defendants' second offer and the

discharge voucher enclosed therewith. Consequently, the defendants breached that agreement when they

failed to pay to the plaintiffs or to SSC the compromise sum.</p>
<p align="justify">15. In the defence, the defendants denied there was a compromise agreement. They

alleged that the plaintiffs put tremendous pressure on the defendants to settle the plaintiffs'

claim. The defendants therefore placated the plaintiffs by forwarding a discharge voucher to the

latter in anticipation of a possible settlement pending which the defendants took legal advice and

waited for the final reports from Cunningham and professional engineers Harris &amp; Sutherland (H

&amp; S). It was the parties' common assumption that any settlement would be on the premise that the

plaintiffs were entitled to be indemnified by the defendants and the defendants were obliged to

indemnify the plaintiffs, under the terms of the policy.</p>
<p align="justify">16. The defendants contended that the common assumption turned out to be untrue

and by reason thereof there was a fundamental mistake of fact which rendered any alleged agreement

to settle void. Consequently the defendants denied there was any agreement to settle. The alleged

agreement failed for want of consideration. In the alternative, the alleged second offer from the

defendants was to be accepted by the plaintiffs and SSC, as set out in the defendants' discharge

voucher sent together with the alleged second offer. The alleged second offer was not accepted in

accordance with the terms as only the plaintiffs, not SSC, signed the discharge voucher.</p>
<p align="justify">17. The defendants further denied liability on the ground that the claim did not

fall within the cover extended by the defendants. They pleaded that H &amp; S were of the view that

damage to the whole of the retaining wall (including the foundations) was due to design error. The

defendants relied on Section II (which covers third party liability) of the policy and in particular

clause (d) which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The insurers shall not be liable for.the cost of replacement.of loss or

  damage to items due tofaulty design, but this exclusion shall be limited to the items

  immediately affected and shall not be deemed to exclude loss or damage to correctly executed items

  resulting from an accident due to such .faulty design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defendants contended that the plaintiffs' claim fell under Section II for

which the defendants were liable to indemnify the plaintiffs only if it was due to accidental loss</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">.occurring in direct connection with the construction of or erection of the

  items insured under Section I and happening on or in the immediate vicinity of the site during the

  period of cover.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">They averred that faulty design cannot be considered to be something accidental.

As the faulty design was produced by Maunsell Consultants Singapore Pte Ltd (Maunsell) and it was

the direct cause of the damage to the canal belonging to the MOE, Maunsell, not the defendants, were

liable to MOE. Neither were the defendants liable to indemnify the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">Â </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The evidence</p>
<p align="justify">(i) the plaintiff's case</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">18. Ong was the plaintiffs' only witness. I have in paras 3 to 13 above,

essentially set out his evidence in chief. I now turn to the testimony adduced from him under

cross-examination.</p>
<p align="justify">19. Ong elaborated on the discussion at the meeting on 9 March 1999 which purpose

he said was to settle the sum payable to the plaintiffs. He succeeded in persuading Li to increase

the defendants' offer to $533,560.98 which was the 'maximum' sum Li said the defendants could pay.

However, he denied he was shown Cunningham's letter to the defendants dated 2 December 1998 (see

AB242) which showed that $523,912.68 was the recommended sum after adjustment. Ong also denied that

Li had told him at the meeting that there could be no decision on a settlement without the final

report from Cunningham (which was dated 20 August 1999 and showed that the plaintiffs' claim had

been further reduced to $107,132.63). He agreed that Li did say that the defendants required a

letter of authorisation from SSC to make payment to the plaintiffs. Ong admitted that SSC did not

know about the meeting or the settlement but added it was not necessary to inform SSC as, it left it

to the plaintiffs to resolve the claim with the defendants. In any case, SSC had confirmed to the

plaintiffs by letter dated 22 October 1999 (AB45), that it had been fully informed of the

settlement. However, Ong acknowledged that SSC was the party to whom the claim was payable under the

'Loss Payee' clause even though SSC had requested the defendants to expedite payment to the

plaintiffs by its letter dated 19 May 1998 (AB24). Ong however would not commit himself on whether

SSC had to sign the defendants' discharge voucher before it could receive payment under the policy.</p>
<p align="justify">20. In an earlier affidavit filed (on 15 September 1999) for the plaintiffs'

unsuccessful O 14 application, Ong had deposed (in para 10) that the defendants had agreed to pay

the plaintiffs the compromise sum on 31 March 1999. He explained that was because the defendants'

discharge voucher and second offer bore that date. He agreed that both the offer and discharge

voucher must be read together. Ong also admitted that after he had returned the signed discharge

voucher to the defendants, he was informed by Douglas that Li insisted on SSC signing the discharge

voucher as otherwise SSC may turn around and make another claim on the defendants for the same

incident. However, Ong denied he was told by Li (soon after the report of H &amp; S dated July 1999)

that the plaintiffs' claim was not payable.</p>
<p align="justify">21. In his evidence in chief (as well as under cross-examination), Ong had

asserted that the compromise agreement was reached at the meeting on 9 March 1999. If indeed there

was an oral agreement reached on 9 March 1999, counsel for the defendants questioned Ong why the

plaintiffs did not press for payment of the compromise sum as, their conduct showed that they were

pressing the defendants repeatedly through OCW to expedite their claim; yet, they did nothing in the

three (3) week interval before they received the defendants' second offer. Ong was also questioned

on the time lapse between the defendants' second offer and the plaintiffs' reply dated 8 May 1999.

He explained it was because he had approached SSC to endorse the discharge voucher but SSC declined

to do so; they left it to the plaintiffs to settle with the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">22. Although Douglas was the plaintiffs' insurance agent/broker and had attended

the crucial meeting on 9 March 1999, he was not called by them to testify. The court and counsel for

the defendants inquired as to the reason; we were told that Douglas refused to be a witness and had

even indicated to counsel that if called, he would give testimony which would be unfavourable to the

plaintiffs. I should also add that although counsel for the defendants indicated he would subpoena

Douglas to appear as the defendants' witness, that intention did not materialise either. Without

Douglas, the court was in no position to verify the statements attributed to him by both Ong and Li.

Curiously, the plaintiffs chose not to call Eio Hock Chuar or Michael Lim to testify either even

though they could or should have corroborated Ong's version of what transpired at the meeting on 9

March 1999, in the absence of Douglas as a witness.</p>
<p align="justify">Â </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(ii the defendants' case</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">23. I turn next to the testimony adduced from Li. As was to be expected, his

version of what transpired at the meeting on 9 March 1999 greatly differed from Ong's. Li contended

that the alleged compromise agreement failed for want of consideration. Further, the 'Loss Payee'

clause under the Schedule of the policy states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Singapore Sports Council are interested in any moneys which.would be payable

  to the Insured.in respect of loss or damage to the Insured works. Such moneys shall be paid to

  Singapore Sports Council.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs through Douglas had also informed him that any payment under the

policy had to be made to SSC. Accordingly, the discharge voucher signed by the plaintiffs alone and

with the wording altered by the plaintiffs was not in accordance with the defendants' second offer.</p>
<p align="justify">24. Li denied that the defendants' second offer (of which he was the maker) was a

record of the compromise agreement he had reached with the plaintiffs. If indeed an agreement had

been reached, there was no need for Ong to have visited him in July 1999 to inquire about the

plaintiffs' claim. He alleged that both the plaintiffs and Douglas resorted to threatening him with

the possibility of the defendants being called upon to make payment of the sum ($3,686,822.55) under

the plaintiffs performance bond, unless the plaintiffs were paid.</p>
<p align="justify">25. As for the meeting on 9 March 1999, Li confirmed that the discussion centred

on the quantum of the plaintiffs' claim, in relation to the assessed amount and the defendants'

first offer. In his written testimony, Li had exhibited a hand-written note (AB5) which he said he

had prepared that day after the meeting. In that note, it was recorded that Ong had requested Li to

improve on the defendants' offer to which Li's response was, that he would try to reduce the

proportion of liability of the plaintiffs under Section II of the policy. Li recorded he had

explained the defendants' position -- as the matter was so technical, the defendants had to wait for

the final reports from Cunningham. However, because he wanted to maintain the defendants' cordial

relationship with the plaintiffs, he recorded that he placated them by making the first offer back

in December 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">26. Li said he had made known to the plaintiffs at the meeting that his offer to

settle was subject to the final reports of Cunningham and H &amp; S and, to the terms and conditions

of the policy although this was not stated in his two letters of offer. He disagreed with counsel's

suggestion that once the plaintiffs had confirmed the first offer and had given SSC's letter of

authority, the defendants were obliged to pay $523,912.68. Li contended that even though it was not

stated in his letter, it was 'understood' by people in the insurance industry that settlement of

insurance claims was subject to receipt of final reports from the insurers' adjusters/experts and to

the terms and conditions of the policy concerned. In any case, the plaintiffs well knew as it was

also made clear in Cunningham's letter dated 1 October 1998 to their solicitors. He added that

before the March meeting, he had requested for a representative from SSC to be present but he did

not insist when Douglas told him it was not necessary. He explained that when the defendants made

their first offer to the plaintiffs in December 1998, he had already heard that SSC had deducted the

plaintiffs' payments, the defendants were therefore worried that new disputes may arise concerning

this claim; hence Li wanted SSC's participation. He had also told the plaintiffs to discuss with SSC

the issue of payment when he was informed that the plaintiffs could not receive the money. However

these two discussions were inadvertently omitted from his note (probably because he did not think

they were important) as well as from his written testimony and his earlier affidavits filed to

oppose the plaintiffs' application for summary judgment. Li said he only recollected the two (2)

matters when he read the plaintiffs' affidavits before the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">27. After his March meeting with the plaintiffs, Li contacted Cunningham to

inquire whether he could compromise on the percentage (30%) of loss to be borne by the plaintiffs

under Section II; Cunningham indicated that decision was for the defendants to make. He did make the

decision; hence his second offer wherein he offered to reduce the percentage of loss to be borne by

the plaintiffs under Section II from 30% to 20%.</p>
<p align="justify">28. Contrary to the plaintiffs' contention, Li said that although he was the

assistant manager of the defendants in charge of claims, he could not settle large claims without

approval from his superiors. Further, the defendants were the regional office for Thailand,

Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand and he had additional duties arising therefrom. Because of the

regional crisis in 1988, he was extremely busy and hard-pressed at the material time. Even so, while

waiting for the final reports from Cunningham, Li said he was prepared to accommodate the plaintiffs

by negotiating with them first so as to expedite their claim since, Cunningham had already given a

tentative figure and the defendants knew that Bakau piles were then the only item excluded from the

plaintiffs' claim but, they were uncertain as to the cause of the damage. Li revealed that at the

time of negotiation with the plaintiffs, he was aware from correspondence between H &amp; S and

Cunningham, that design fault was a possible cause of the damage but, he did not inform the

plaintiffs. In any case he believed they knew of this possibility since it was their project and the

plaintiffs had their own site engineer who should know the reasons for the collapse of the wall. The

defendants were prepared to negotiate on quantum first and put aside liability until such time as

they received Cunningham's final report because OCW was the defendants' biggest broker (whose

Douglas kept chasing him for payment) and the defendants considered the plaintiffs their valued

clients; the plaintiffs had taken out policies with the defendants all along. Moreover, in 1998

alone, the defendants paid out more than $9m on performance bonds and they did not want the

plaintiffs' performance bond to be called upon. Questioned what would happen if the final figure for

the plaintiffs' claim turned out to be less than Cunningham's initial assessment of $525,912.68, Li

said the defendants would then renegotiate with the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">29. Li revealed that after he received the amended discharge voucher from the

plaintiffs under cover of their letter dated 8 May 1999, he telephoned Douglas pointing out that the

plaintiffs had not complied with the terms of the defendants' second offer. Before receipt of the

plaintiffs' said letter, he had received several telephone calls from Douglas requesting that the

defendants dispense with SSC's signature in the discharge voucher which request Li refused pointing

out that without SSC's signature, it meant the plaintiffs were making a counter-offer to the

defendants' offer. In any event, by then he had seen SSC's letter dated 19 May 1998 requesting the

defendants to expedite payment to the plaintiffs -- there was therefore no reason why SSC would not

sign the discharge voucher. When the defendants made the first offer, the plaintiffs requested that

they be paid for which Li said he required a letter of authority from SSC. However, before the

defendants made the second offer, the plaintiffs requested that SSC be paid instead. As time had

lapsed between SSC's aforesaid letter and the defendants' first offer, Li said he wanted

confirmation as to who should receive the payment bearing in mind that the 'Loss Payee' clause

required the defendants to pay to SSC. If no letter of authorisation came from SSC, it meant that

the defendants could not pay the plaintiffs. Li disagreed with counsel's suggestion that the

discharge voucher only served as a record of settlement and the plaintiffs' amendment of its wording

did not change its nature.</p>
<p align="justify">30. Besides Li, the defendants also called two (2) representatives from H &amp; S

to testify. Tan Teck Cheng and Philip Jones testified that their company was appointed by Cunningham

on the defendants' behalf to investigate a slope failure at the site of the project and to report on

the cause. They confirmed that the collapse was due to the design of the retaining wall done by

Maunsell. Consequently, the claim fell outside the cover provided under the policy. In their final

submissions, the plaintiffs dealt with the testimony of H &amp; S at considerable length. With

respect, the evidence from H &amp; S has no bearing on the only issue which required my

determination in this case -- was there or was there not a compromise agreement reached between the

parties on 9 March alternatively on 31 March, 1999?; the dispute did not touch on whether the

plaintiffs' claim came within the ambit of the policy. Although their assessment of the plaintiffs'

claim featured prominently in this litigation, the defendants surprisingly chose not to call anyone

from Cunningham to testify.</p>
<p align="justify">Â </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The findings</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">31. Considerable time was also spent by counsel in cross-examining Li on the

extent of his authority to settle claims on behalf of the defendants. Again, the extent of Li's

mandate from the defendants does not help to determine the issue in question. What needs to be

resolved is, what is the purport of the defendants' two offer letters to OCW dated 9 December 1998

and 31 March 1999? To answer that question, it is necessary to consider the basic principles as to

when an offer is said to be accepted and an agreement concluded. In this regard, I refer to the

following extracts from <i>Chitty</i> on Contracts (28 ed vol 1 at pp 89, 90 and 100):-</p>
<b>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">2-001 General principles. </p></blockquote></b>There may be said to be three basic essentials to

  the creation of a contract: agreement, contractual intention and consideration.

<p align="justify">The normal test for determining whether the parties have reached agreement is to

ask whether an offer has been made by one party and accepted by the other</p>
<p align="justify">In deciding whether the parties have reached agreement, the courts normally apply

the objective test, which is further discussed in  2-002 below.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2-002 Offer defined. </p></b>The offer is an expression of willingness to contract

made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it is to become binding on the person making it as

soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed. Under the objective test of agreement,

an apparent intention to be bound may suffice <i>i.e</i>. the alleged offeror may be bound if his

words or conduct are such as to induce a reasonable person to believe that he intends to be bound,

even though in fact he has no such intention.<b>
<p align="justify">2-024 Acceptance defined</p></b>. An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression

of assent to the terms of an offer. The objective test of agreement applies to an acceptance no less

than to an offer. On this test the mere acknowledgement of an offer would not be an acceptance; nor

is there an acceptance where a person who has received an offer to sell goods merely replies that it

is his 'intention to place an order.'



<p align="justify">32. Turning next to the defendants' first offer in the sum of $523,912.68 Li had

written as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We will make payment to the insured Projection Pte Ltd. However considering the

  Loss Payee clauses in the schedule, before we release our Draft, we need a letter from Singapore

  Sports Council to confirm that they have no objection to this payment arrangement</p>
<p align="justify">Please convey the same to Projection Pte Ltd and let us have their confirmation

  of the payment so that we are able to effect our payment</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs' reply by their letter dated 18 December 1998 inter alia stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We are therefore surprised to note your letter preparing to pay us only

  $523,912.68 a shortfall of $155,153.27 from that assessed by your appointed professional loss

  adjuster.</p>
<p align="justify">Please provide us within the next 7 days, with detailed breakdown of your

  assessment of $523,912.68 and identify the items (or amounts) recommended by the loss adjuster

  that you have rejected..</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Nothing could be clearer from the above extract of the plaintiffs' reply than

that the defendants' offer of $523,912.68 had been rejected.</p>
<p align="justify">33. Now for the second offer which full text I have already set out in para 9

above. Li had said (with which I fully agree), that this letter represented a fresh offer from the

defendants. All that was needed by the plaintiffs by way of acceptance was, to sign (together with

SSC) the discharge voucher enclosed therewith and return the latter document to the defendants in

order to obtain payment of $553,560.98. This they failed to do because: firstly, the plaintiffs did

not obtain SSC's requisite signature and secondly, they took it upon themselves to unilaterally

amend the text of the discharge voucher. Again, applying the basic principle that there must be <i>consensus

ad idem</i> before an offer and acceptance can culminate in a contract, the defendants' second offer

had been impliedly rejected by the plaintiffs. Consequently, the plaintiffs' contention that the

second offer from the defendants reflected a compromise agreement having been reached between the

parties, cannot be sustained.</p>
<p align="justify">34. It bears remembering that Ong had admitted under cross-examination (as Li

testified) that Douglas had indeed informed him that the defendants insisted on having SSC's

signature on the discharge voucher as the latter was the 'Loss Payee' under the terms of the policy.

In this regard the plaintiffs' subsequent attempt to overcome the lack of consent by obtaining SSC's

letter dated 21 October 1999 stating it was willing to receive payment under the 'Loss Payee' clause

came a little too late as, the writ of summons had by then been filed (on 3 September 1999).</p>
<p align="justify">35. At this juncture I need to revert to the fateful meeting of 9 March 1999 to

ascertain whether a compromise agreement had been concluded then, as Ong asserted in his written and

oral testimony. Incidentally this was a departure from the plaintiffs' pleaded case that the

compromise agreement was evidenced in the defendants' letter dated 31 March 1999; no mention was

made of the meeting. It is common ground that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss and

negotiate on the defendants' then offer of $523,912.68. Other than that however, the parties

differed in their versions of what was said by Li to Ong and vice versa. The only record of what

transpired at that meeting was Li's handwritten note which counsel for the plaintiffs roundly

assailed as having been manufactured for purposes of this trial since, it was not disclosed at the O

14 proceedings or earlier but only in the course of discovery for this trial. While I am mindful

that the document emanated from the defendants and can be considered to be self-serving in that

sense, it is significant that Li's note of what transpired at the meeting is consistent with the

defendants' second offer. Li had testified that in the course of the discussion, he had raised the

possibility of reducing the plaintiffs' portion of liability under Section II of the policy in

response to Ong's request that the defendants improve on their offer of $523,912.68; the second

offer proved that he made the adjustment.</p>
<p align="justify">36. Earlier (see para 22) I had alluded to the plaintiffs' omission to call

Douglas as their witness because the latter had made it clear that he was reluctant to get involved

and if forced to testify, he would be a hostile witness. Counsel for the defendants conveyed the

same message when he informed the court he had changed his mind about issuing a subpoena to compel

Douglas to attend court. Under the circumstances, it would be unfair to draw an adverse inference

against the plaintiffs for not calling Douglas as their witness as counsel for the defendants

suggested.</p>
<p align="justify">37. However, the absence from court of Ong's fellow directors Eio Hock Chuar and

Michael Lim merit different considerations altogether. Ong had testified that they accompanied him

to the lunch meeting and this was confirmed by Li's handwritten note. In the absence of Douglas, one

would have thought that the plaintiffs would call either or both these persons to buttress Ong's

testimony that a compromise agreement was reached at the meeting. The plaintiffs' failure to do so

coupled with the lack of any explanation from their counsel and or Ong is a telling omission from

which I must necessarily draw an adverse inference -- if called to testify, they would not have

corroborated Ong's testimony.</p>
<p align="justify">38. I am fortified in my view that no compromise agreement was reached on 9 March

1999 by another significant omission on the part of the plaintiffs. In his written testimony, Ong

had deposed (se para 6 above) that when he was told by Douglas that the defendants were processing

the plaintiffs' claim, he had written to the defendants promptly on 21 November 1998 to record what

was told to him. Yet, if his testimony is to believed, he did not do the same when the parties

reached a compromise agreement on 9 March 1999. The omission to write is so completely out of

character with the plaintiffs' conduct, especially when the plaintiffs had been pressing the

defendants repeatedly since October 1998 for payment, that the only conclusion one can draw

therefrom is, that no compromise or any agreement at all was reached on 9 March 1999. In addition,

Li had testified and which was not challenged, if indeed there had been a compromise agreement

reached in March 1999, why would Ong still visit him four (4) months later (in July 1999) to inquire

about the plaintiffs' claim?</p>
<p align="justify">39. What happened was (and which Ong admitted as much under cross-examination),

the plaintiffs met with the obstacle of SSC being unwilling to sign the discharge voucher when they

intended to accept the defendants' second offer dated 31 March 1999. Ong admitted that (as conveyed

to him by Douglas from Li) the defendants on their part were unwilling to make payment without SSC's

signature. This problem would not have arisen in the first place had the plaintiffs adhered to the

terms of the policy and allowed the defendants to pay SSC as the 'Loss Payee' instead of requesting

payment to themselves direct. I can only speculate that one reason why they did not want SSC to be

paid was because the plaintiffs were afraid SSC may retain the monies to set-off claims SSC had

against them. The plaintiffs' problem was compounded by the fact that they decided to amend the

wording of the discharge voucher to protect themselves against compromising future claims under the

policy. Unfortunately, this resulted in the plaintiffs making a counter-offer to the defendants'

second offer. I can only surmise that realising the legal quandary they had got themselves into, the

plaintiffs then changed tack and in Ong's testimony, claimed that a compromise agreement had already

been reached on 9 March 1999 -- therefore their rejection of the defendants' second offer did not

affect their pre-existing rights. Apart from the cryptic assertions that the plaintiffs' case was

not restricted to the compromise agreement being reached on 9 March 1999 but it was reached between

the parties <i>sometime in March 1999</i>, the plaintiffs did not elaborate on paras 1 and 2 of

their written submissions.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Â </p>
<p align="justify">The law</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">40. It would be appropriate at this juncture to look at the requirements at law

for a valid compromise to come into being; I refer to the textbook <i>The Law and Practice of

Compromise</i> (4 ed 1996) which was cited by the defendants. At para 3-01 (p 14) the learned author

had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Since a compromise is merely a contract, the ordinary principles of contract

  law apply with as much force as in other contractual contexts. Under the ordinary law, a contract

  will not be found to have arisen unless:</p>
<p align="justify">(i) consideration;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) an agreement can be identified which is complete and certain;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the parties intend to create legal relations and;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) in some cases, certain formalities have been observed..</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">At para 3-03 (at p 15) the learned author continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In compromise, consideration is often furnished by the promised or actual

  forbearance of one party to pursue a claim against another in return for some promised or actual

  act by the other. Such act may constitute a benefit to the claimant or a detriment to the

  performer or indeed both. The promised or actual forbearance may be for a specified time or, where

  no time is specified, for a reasonable time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">41. With the above extracts in mind, I turn to paras 5 to 7 of the (amended)

statement of claim which pleaded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">5. By a letter dated 31 March 1999, the defendants recorded their agreement to

  the sum of $553,560.98 as payable to the plaintiffs in respect of the said claim and/or said

  damage. A discharge voucher dated 31 March 1999 (the Discharge Voucher) was enclosed with the said

  letter for the plaintiffs' signature.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The Discharge Voucher was duly executed by the plaintiffs and returned to

  the defendants some time on 8 May 1999. The plaintiffs will rely on the discharge voucher for its

  full purport and effect at trial.</p>
<p align="justify">7. In the premises, there is a compromise agreement (the Agreement) between the

  parties for the said claim and/or said damage in that the defendants have agreed to pay the sum of

  $553,560.98 as full and final settlement of the said claim and/or said damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">No particulars were furnished for the above paragraphs in particular for para 7

as to when the compromise agreement was made, the reasons therefor and the terms thereof. Above all,

nothing was pleaded on the issue of consideration; nor was it elaborated on in para 99 of the

plaintiffs' submissions as to what constituted good consideration for this case. All that counsel

for the plaintiffs did was, to refer to an extract from <i>Cheshire Fifoot &amp; Furmston's</i> Law

of Contract (1998) which included a comment that the compromise of a doubtful claim was upheld by

the courts. I consider the paucity of the plaintiffs' pleadings and submission on this very

essential ingredient for a compromise agreement as another indication of its non-existence as at

March 1999, particularly when the issue of want of consideration was specifically pleaded in the

defence. As an aside, I would add that it was wrong of the plaintiffs to include in the Agreed

Bundle (at AB40) as well as make reference to it in their final submissions (para 86) the without

prejudice letter from the defendants dated 31 August 1999 offering to pay them $322,649.14, even

if counsel for the defendants raised his objections late in the day.</p>
<p align="justify">Â </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The conclusion</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">42. In the light of my findings, there is no necessity for me to determine the

alternative defence put forward by the defendants -- that there was a fundamental mistake which

rendered any alleged agreement to settle void. I would only venture to say that the evidence

suggests that such a defence would be difficult to succeed. I therefore dismiss the plaintiffs'

claim with costs to the defendants.</p>
