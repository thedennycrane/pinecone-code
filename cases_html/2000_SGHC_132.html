<font color="#3322AA" face="Times New Roman" size="4">JUDGMENT:</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font><b><u></u></b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. This is a claim by the plaintiff

("Mr Lee") for damages for breach of certain terms of an agreement in writing

dated 10 August 1993 and also for wrongful repudiation of the agreement by reason of those

breaches. There is an alternative claim for a <i>quantum meruit</i>. The claims are denied

by the defendant ("Beng Tiong") which counterclaims a sum paid as an advance in

pursuance of the agreement. At the conclusion of the trial I dismissed the claims and gave

judgment for Beng Tiong on its counterclaim. Mr Lee has given notice of appeal and applied

for directions with a view to expediting the appeal and I understand that directions have

been given to dispense with compliance with the rule for grounds of judgment to be

certified. These are nevertheless my written grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The agreement dated 10 August 1993

("agency agreement") recited that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(a) The estate of [Shaik Ahmad]

  (hereafter referred to as ‘the Estate’) is well possessed of and entitled to the

  lands and premises described in the Schedule hereto (hereinafter referred to as ‘the

  Properties’).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) [Mr Lee] has been in contact with the

  beneficiaries of the Estate of the deceased (which expression ‘the

  beneficiaries’ shall mean and include the beneficiaries identified in the Will of the

  abovenamed deceased and if not surviving at the date of this Agreement their heirs in

  title including their duly appointed legal personal representatives and/or duly appointed

  attorneys) and [Beng Tiong] expects to enter into Agreement for Sale of the Properties by

  the Estate upon the Estate’s successful application in Originating Summons No 489 of

  1993 for substitution of the trustees of the Estate of the abovenamed deceased.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) [Beng Tiong] wishes to seek the

  assistance of [Mr Lee] in working with the legal personal representatives of the Estate

  and [Mr Lee] has agreed so to do for the securing of [Beng Tiong’s] purchase of the

  Properties on the terms hereinafter appearing."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. The will identified the beneficiaries

as "the persons or person who would at [the testator’s] death have been entitled

according to Mohamedan Law to [the testator’s] estate and effects if [the testator]

had died intestate". There were 14 beneficiaries at the date of the testator’s

death and they were his widow, 11 sons and two daughters. The testator Shaik Ahmad died on

15 July 1953 and probate of the will was granted to one of the four named executors leave

being reserved to the others to prove the same but they have not done so. At the date of

the agency agreement the Public Trustee was the trustee of the trusts of the will and all

the properties were vested in him. The application by Originating Summons No 489 of 1993

was an application to appoint Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff ("Syed Ali") and Robert Ng

Jer Leong ("Mr Ng") to be trustees in place of the Public Trustee. The

expression "beneficiaries" as used in the agency agreement included the 14

immediate beneficiaries and the "heirs" and representatives of those immediate

beneficiaries who had died. To avoid confusion I shall use the expression with the same

meaning except where the context shows otherwise.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. Clause 1.1 of the agency agreement

provides:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"In pursuance of the said agreement

  and in consideration of the sum of Dollars Four Million Six Hundred and Forty Thousand

  ($4,640,000.00) in the manner herein provided [Mr Lee] hereby agrees to work with and

  provide all necessary links and contacts with the legal personal representatives of the

  Estate in the manner herein provided and for the securing of the contract for sale of the

  Properties by the Estate to [Beng Tiong] for the sale price of Dollars Eight Million Two

  Hundred and Sixty Thousand ($8,260,000.00)."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">There were in fact no <i>legal personal

representatives </i>as the properties were already vested in the Public Trustee upon the

trusts of the will but I assume in favour of Mr Lee (without deciding the point which was

not taken by Beng Tiong) that the expression included or meant the persons in whom the

properties were vested. Beng Tiong was willing to pay $12.9m for the properties but the

estate or the trustees would only receive $8.26m. Mr Lee would receive $4.64m for his

services.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. The $4.64m was to be paid as provided

by cl 1.2:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(a) immediately on the signing of

  [the agency agreement] the sum of $250,000.00 ...;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the balance of the agreed

  consideration $4,390,000.00 less any advances made by [Beng Tiong] to [Mr Lee] under

  Clause 2.3 herein to be paid on completion as provided in Clause 2.4 herein."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. Clauses 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 provide:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"[Beng Tiong] undertakes:-</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2.2 that [Beng Tiong], including [Beng

  Tiong’s] agents and employees, shall not interact with any of the beneficiaries or

  the legal personal representatives of the Estate or the Solicitors of the Estate without

  first obtaining the prior consent of [Mr Lee];</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2.3 if [Mr Lee] requests in writing

  (strictly for purpose of enabling [Mr Lee] to ensure the sale of the Properties to [Beng

  Tiong] ) to make advances to [Mr Lee] up to the maximum limit of Dollars One Hundred and

  Fifty Thousand ($150,000.00) within the period after 1st day of November 1993 and before

  15th day of July 1994;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2.4 to instruct [Beng Tiong’s]

  on the day of completion of the sale of the Properties by the legal personal

  representatives of the Estate to [Beng Tiong] or the assigns of [Beng Tiong];"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. Clause 3.8 provides:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"[Mr Lee] undertakes:-</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3.8 to secure the Estate’s execution

  agreed sale price $8,260,000.00 not later than the 15th day of July 1994 (hereinafter

  referred to as ‘the deadline’) failing which [the agency agreement] shall become

  null and void and [Mr Lee] shall refund within fourteen (14) days after the sale of the

  Properties to [Beng Tiong] is aborted all monies that have been paid by [Beng Tiong] to

  [Mr Lee] under the provisions of [the agency agreement]; ...."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The statement of claim alleges the

agency agreement and refers to these and other terms and also alleges that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"It was an implied term of the

  [agency agreement] that [Beng Tiong] would pay to [Mr Lee] a reasonable sum for the work

  done by [Mr Lee] pursuant to the Agent’s Work Term in the event of [Beng

  Tiong’s] breach of the [agency agreement] (‘the Reasonable Sum Term’).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Particulars</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The term is implied by law as it is

  necessary in order to give the [agency agreement] business efficacy."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The "Agent’s Work Term"

refers to the several provisions of cl 3 which describe in some detail the obligations of

Mr Lee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. When the agency agreement was signed

Beng Tiong paid $250,000 to Mr Lee as an advance under cl 1.2 and subsequently a further

sum of $110,000 was paid as an advance under cl 2.3. By letters dated 3 November 1993 and

14 January 1994 Mr Lee requested an advance of another $40,000 and if this is paid to him

then the amount advanced under cl 2.3 would be $150,000 which is the stipulated limit. It

is alleged in the statement of claim that in breach of the term under cl 2.3 Beng Tiong

failed, refused or otherwise neglected to effect payment of the balance of $40,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. Paragraph 8 of the statement of claim

states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"In breach of the Non-Interaction

  Term, [Beng Tiong] interacted with the Beneficiaries and the legal personal

  representatives of the Estate without first obtaining the prior consent of [Mr Lee]."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The "Non-Interaction Term"

refers to the provisions of cl 2.2. The particulars given in the statement of claim allege

(1) that Beng Tiong’s managing director Ms Chiang had met some of the beneficiaries

in or about November 1993 and that Ms Chiang had admitted to this to Mr Lee also in or

about November 1993 and (2) that Beng Tiong had instituted proceedings in Suit No 1255 of

1996 against the beneficiaries "on the basis of a written agreement dated 12 August

1993 with the beneficiaries".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. The "agreement" dated 12

August 1993 is a document signed by 12 of the beneficiaries expressing their consent to

the sale of the properties by Syed Ali and Mr Ng to Beng Tiong for $8.26m on the terms of

a draft agreement annexed to it. It is not disputed that after it had been signed it was

left with the Indonesian <i>Notaris</i> in whose presence it appears to have been signed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. The statement of claim goes on to

allege that the breaches of the two terms constituted repudiatory breaches of the agency

agreement and that Mr Lee "on 28 January 1995 accepted the aforesaid Repudiatory

Breaches ... and elected to terminate" the agency agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. Finally it is alleged that: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Further or in the alternative, at

  all material times after the [agency agreement], [Mr Lee] carried out various work and/or

  performed various services for [Beng Tiong] pursuant to the Agent’s Works Term."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">I assume in Mr Lee’s favour that the

"Agent’s Works Term" refers to the provisions of cl 3 previously referred

to as the "Agent’s Work Term". Particulars of the work done are given. Mr

Lee claims a reasonable sum for his work which he puts at $2,900,571.40.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. In its defence Beng Tiong admits the

agency agreement and its terms. It denies the implied term alleged as regards the payment

of a reasonable sum in the event of Beng Tiong’s breach of the agency agreement and

says that even if there was a breach of the agency agreement (which it denies) the agency

agreement precluded payment of such sum.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. Beng Tiong admits the request for the

advance of $40,000 by the letters dated 3 November 1993 and 14 January 1994 but alleges

that on a true construction of cl 2.3 or "alternatively, that it is implied from

clause 2.3 that [Mr Lee] must satisfy [Beng Tiong] that any advance of moneys sought under

clause 2.3 must be strictly to ensure the sale of the properties to [Beng Tiong] before

[it] is obliged to disburse the same". Beng Tiong’s defence is that the

condition had not been satisfied and it was not obliged to advance the $40,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. Beng Tiong admits to Ms Chiang having

met some of the beneficiaries over a meal at an Indonesian restaurant in Singapore towards

the end of 1993 but denies that it acted in breach of the agency agreement as alleged. It

says in the alternative that even if there was a breach Mr Lee has suffered no damage or

loss. It admits the proceedings in Suit No 1255 of 1996 but denies any breach of the

agency agreement. Beng Tiong denies any repudiatory breach and says alternatively that Mr

Lee has suffered no damage or loss.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. In his defence to the counterclaim for

the return of the advances made Mr Lee says that he was hindered and prevented from

securing the estate’s execution of the agreement for sale of the properties to Beng

Tiong at the agreed price of $8.26m by reason of the breaches alleged and Beng Tiong was

not entitled to take advantage of its own "(repudiatory) breach(es) ... to rely on,

or enforce, clause 3.8 of the [agency agreement]".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Repudiatory breach</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. I think it is convenient that I deal

with this claim first. It is alleged in the statement of claim that by cl 3.8 of the

agency agreement Mr Lee undertook to secure the execution by the estate of the agreement

for sale of the properties to Beng Tiong not later than 15 July 1994 failing which the

agency agreement was to become null and void. It is clear from the statement of claim that

by that date Mr Lee had not secured the execution of the sale agreement by the estate.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. It is established law that where a

party has repudiated a contract by breach the aggrieved party has an election to accept

the repudiation or to affirm the contract. See <i>Vitol SA v Norelf Ltd, The Santa Clara </i>[1996] AC 800 at p 810. The alleged breach by interacting with the beneficiaries took place in

November 1993 and Mr Lee knew about it then. If this was a repudiatory breach then he was

entitled to put an end to the agency agreement and at once treat himself as discharged

from further performance. He must do so before the time for performance or further

performance on his part expires.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. Mr Lee requested an advance in

November 1993 and again in January 1994. He did this with the knowledge that Beng Tiong

had as he alleged interacted with the beneficiaries in repudiatory breach of the agency

agreement. Far from accepting the alleged repudiation he was quite clearly affirming the

agency agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. It is also alleged that by cl 2.3 Beng

Tiong would make advances of up to $150,000 within the period 1 November 1993 and 15 July

1994. The alleged repudiatory breach by not making the advance would have occurred at the

latest when the period expired which is also the same time by which Mr Lee himself was to

perform or complete performance of his part of the agency agreement. In these

circumstances he should have accepted the repudiation then.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. It is alleged in the particulars of

the work carried out and services performed by Mr Lee pursuant to the agency agreement

that he instituted legal proceedings against certain parties in Suit No 1550 of 1994. This

action was commenced by writ issued on 22 September 1994 and judgment in default of

appearance was entered against all but one of the defendants on 28 January 1995. By

carrying out the work and performing the services pursuant to the agency agreement as

alleged Mr Lee could not have accepted the alleged repudiation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. Although as pleaded time for

performance on Mr Lee’s part expired on 15 July 1994 it was nevertheless put to him

under cross-examination that it was extended to 31 December 1994 and he agreed. There was

no application to amend the pleadings but even if the pleadings are amended to allege this

then quite clearly by carrying out the work and performing the services as alleged Mr Lee

has affirmed the agency agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. In my judgment the statement of claim

discloses no reasonable or probable cause of action in respect of the repudiatory breaches

alleged whether the breaches are considered severally or cumulatively.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Advances</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. On 3 November 1993 Mr Lee wrote to

Beng Tiong:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"This is the written request pursuant

  to clause 2.3 of the agreement between us dated 10th August 1993. In order to enable me to

  perform work and pay expenses to ensure the sale of the Properties referred to in the

  agreement to your Company, please pay to me the balance of the advances referred therein.

  As you have already advanced to me the sum of $110,000, the balance of the advances which

  is the subject of this request is $40,000."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It is not disputed that Beng Tiong had

advanced $110,000 and that there was a balance of $40,000 to be advanced under cl 2.3.

Beng Tiong did not respond to this request.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. On 14 January 1994 Mr Lee wrote to

Beng Tiong:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I refer to my letter dated 3rd

  November 1993 and note that you have, to date, not responded to my request to pay to me

  the balance of the advance requested.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This letter is to request and demand that

  you comply with the provisions of clause 2.3 of our agreement dated 10th August 1993 and

  pay the balance of the advance stipulated in the agreement to me within a period of seven

  days from the date of this letter."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It is not disputed that no part of the

$40,000 requested was advanced in response to either of these letters or at all.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27. What cl 2.3 provides is an undertaking

by Beng Tiong to make the advance "if [Mr Lee] requests in writing (strictly for

purpose of enabling [Mr Lee] to ensure the sale of the Properties to [Beng Tiong]".

The only condition for the advance is Mr Lee’s written request. The defence is that

Mr Lee must <i>satisfy</i> Beng Tiong as to the purpose <i>before</i> Beng Tiong was

obliged to make any advance. That is quite simply not what cl 2.3 provides. Mr Lee has

made a written request for the advance under cl 2.3. He specifically referred to this

clause. He went on to say what the purpose was and the purpose was well within the terms

of cl 2.3.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28. I see no reason to construe cl 2.3 in

the way pleaded in Beng Tiong’s defence. No mention is made anywhere in the agency

agreement as to any requirement to satisfy Beng Tiong as to the purpose of the advance and

to do so before it was obliged to make the advance. I see no reason to imply such a term.

The agency agreement will not be unworkable without it. Such a term is contrary to the

express provisions of cl 2.3.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29. In my judgment Beng Tiong failed,

refused or otherwise neglected to effect payment of the balance of $40,000 as an advance

in breach of cl 2.3 of the agency agreement as alleged in the statement of claim.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Under cross-examination she said she met

Mr Quresh and another person whose name she did not know. She said she only met two of the

beneficiaries and what she said in her affidavit about having met <i>some</i> of the

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Neither Ms Lim nor Mr Chua was called to

give any evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33. "To interact" is to act

reciprocally or to act on each other. Ms Chiang invited Mr Quresh and another beneficiary

to a meal at a restaurant in a public place. She made no secret of it. Mr Chua and Ms Lim

were present. Upon that occasion Mr Quresh told her that the beneficiaries or the majority

had no intention of agreeing to sell the properties to Beng Tiong. I think Ms Chiang did

act on Mr Quresh and the other beneficiary whom she invited to the restaurant. I think it

was the occasion that prompted Mr Quresh to say what he did.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34. Ms Chiang went on to say under

cross-examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: After receiving what you did?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A: Contacted plaintiff.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A: Said he needed this money so that he

  could liaise with beneficiaries."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Ms Chiang had paid $110,000. She had also

paid $250,000 when the agency agreement was signed. Until she received the request for

another $40,000 there is no evidence that she thought Mr Lee had done nothing. I think

when Ms Chiang told him that she had by then met Mr Quresh in Singapore. She would have

been influenced by what Mr Quresh had told her when she told Mr Lee that he had done

nothing.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35. I think Ms Chiang did interact with Mr

Quresh and I find accordingly. She did not obtain Mr Lee’s prior consent to do so. In

my judgment Beng Tiong has by its managing director as its agent or employee interacted

with Mr Quresh and another beneficiary in breach of cl 2.2 of the agency agreement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Damages</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36. There is no allegation in the

statement of claim that Mr Lee has suffered any loss or incurred any expense as a

consequence of the breach of cl 2.2 or cl 2.3. However there is a claim for damages apart

from a claim for damages for repudiatory breaches.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37. Mr Lee’s primary obligation was

to secure the execution by the estate of Shaik Ahmad of the agreement for the sale of the

properties to Beng Tiong. See cl 3.8 of the agency agreement. Although cl 3.8 refers to

the estate it is not disputed that the agreement would have to be signed by the persons in

whom the properties were vested whether as legal personal representatives or as trustees.

When the agency agreement was signed the properties were vested in the Public Trustee but

it is clear that the intention of the parties as appears from the agency agreement was

that the agreement for sale of the properties was to be signed by new trustees.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38. As recited in the agency agreement the

agreement for the sale of the properties by the estate was to be signed "upon the

Estate’s successful application in Originating Summons No 489 of 1993 for

substitution of the trustees of the Estate". As noted above that was an application

to appoint Syed Ali and Mr Ng to be trustees in place of the Public Trustee. Unless these

two new trustees were appointed in place of the Public Trustee there would be no agreement

for sale of the properties to Beng Tiong to be secured by Mr Lee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39. The proceedings in Originating Summons

No 489 of 1993 have not been produced before me but Mr Lee said under cross-examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Q: Lee (2). Para 42. By time you

  asked for $40,000 true beneficiaries already turned hostile to whole deal?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: True by then application OS 489 of 1993

  to appoint new trustees unsuccessful? By time you first asked for $40,000?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A: To best of my recollection, no. Believe

  application withdrawn between 3/11/93 and 14/1/94.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: True application withdrawn due to

  opposition by some beneficiaries? </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A: True. By two beneficiaries who did not

  sign agreement."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The "agreement" which two of the

beneficiaries did not sign is the document dated 12 August 1993 signed by 12 of the

beneficiaries expressing their consent to the sale of the properties by the proposed new

trustees to Beng Tiong. Mr Lee’s evidence here is that the application was withdrawn

between 3 November 1993 and 14 January 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40. In his affidavit filed on 4 April 1995

in Suit No 1550 of 1994 he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"On or about September 1993, Quraisj

  [also spelt ‘Quresh’] and four of the defendants: Harits, Abu Bakar, Ishak and

  Abdul Azis began taking various steps to cancel the appointment of the Attorneys, the

  proposed Trustees and withdraw Originating Summons No 489 of 1993. Quraisj also wrote a

  letter dated 14 August 1993 dismissing the appointment of [Mr Ng] and [Syed Ali]."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The evidence in this affidavit appears to

be that in or about September 1993 Mr Quresh and four of the defendants had begun taking

steps to withdraw the application.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41. In the same affidavit Mr Lee also

said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"On 3 August 1994, Quraisj on behalf

  of the defendants, instituted proceedings by way of Originating Summons No 745 of 1994

  seeking inter alia to appoint the 6th, 7th, 8th and 10th defendants as proposed new

  trustees of the Will of the Testator in place of the Public Trustee ...."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">There were 11 defendants in the action and

all of them including the four proposed new trustees were 11 of the 12 beneficiaries who

had signed the document dated 12 August 1993. Mr Quresh was one of the defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42. In Originating Summons No 745 of 1994

Ms Animah bte A Gani said in her affidavit filed on 19 October 1994:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The [Public Trustee] would agree to

  relinquish its duty as trustee of the Testator’s estate only upon the following:-</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">a. Grant of Letters of Administration must

  be taken out for the estates of the deceased immediate beneficiaries of the Testator.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b. The duly appointed administrators of

  the estates of the deceased immediate beneficiaries of the Testator to obtain the consent

  of all the beneficiaries that they are in agreement to the appointment of new trustees for

  the estate of the Testator."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">She pointed out in her affidavit that

eight of the immediate beneficiaries had died and letters of administration had been

granted in respect of the estates of only two of them but the grant had not been extracted

and in respect of the estates of five no application had been made for a grant of

representation and in the case of the remaining one a limited grant had been made to Syed

Ali as attorney but his appointment as attorney had been revoked.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43. I come back now to Originating Summons

No 489 of 1993 for the appointment of Syed Ali and Mr Ng in place of the Public Trustee.

By the time the agency agreement was signed the application was not going to be

successful. It was not only opposed by the two beneficiaries who had not signed the

document dated 12 August 1993. Eleven of those who had signed the document had supported

the application to appoint four of themselves as trustees in place of the Public Trustee

in Originating Summons No 745 of 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44. There is no evidence that anything had

been done to have legal personal representatives in place in respect of the eight deceased

immediate beneficiaries of Shaikh Ahmad. There is no evidence that anything had been done

to identify the ultimate beneficiaries upon the death of the eight deceased immediate

beneficiaries. An inquiry may well be required to ascertain these later beneficiaries and

there may well be minority interests. There is no evidence that anything had been done to

satisfy the Public Trustee’s conditions. If Originating Summons No 489 of 1993 was

proceeded with the Public Trustee would have taken the same position.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45. On 14 August 1993 all the 11

beneficiaries who were the defendants in Suit No 1550 of 1994 wrote to the Public Trustee.

They referred to documents signed by them and another beneficiary for the appointment of

Syed Ali and Mr Ng as trustees and said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"We hereby certify that all

  statements of PROXY / TRUSTEE APPOINTMENT, dated April 30, 1993 (the real date is February

  8, 1993), therewith all the documents relating to such appointed, are CANCELLED and VOID;

  commencing from Saturday, August 14, 1993. We also herewith dismiss and revoke, commencing

  from August 14, 1993, all prior statements, one and others related to the aforesaid

  private trusteeship."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">There were documents consenting to the

appointment of Syed Ali and Mr Ng as trustees signed prior to 12 August 1993.

Notwithstanding the difficulty with the language of the letter I think it is clear that

all documents consenting to the appointment of Syed Ali and Mr Ng signed prior to 14

August 1993 were "cancelled" and "void".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46. The letter continued:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"After due consideration, eleven (11)

  of us, the heirs of the deceased, REQUEST that anything dealing with the estate of the

  deceased [SHAIK AHMAD], for the time being is still held by the PUBLIC TRUSTEE, NOT TO BE

  assigned to other people (private trustee), prior to our new, clear, and affirmed

  statement."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Copies of the letter appear to have been

sent to this court and to several persons including Syed Ali and Mr Ng.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47. The application in Originating Summons

No 489 of 1993 was opposed. The Public Trustee would have raised the same concerns as were

raised in a similar application filed later. It was an application that was doomed to

failure from the moment it was filed and certainly by 14 August 1993. It may or may not

have been withdrawn only "between 3 November 1993 and 14 January 1994" as Mr Lee

said under cross-examination but what is relevant is that the court has not appointed

either Syed Ali or Mr Ng to be a trustee or trustees together with or without any other

person and whether in Originating Summons No 489 of 1993 or in any other application. The

failure occurred before the breaches of the agency agreement by Beng Tiong and not in

consequence of any such breach.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48. The document dated 12 August 1993 has

attached to it a draft agreement for sale of the properties. The draft agreement contains

this term:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The sale herein is conditional upon

  the Trustees having obtained approval from the High Court of the Republic of Singapore to

  the appointment of the Trustees as the legal personal representatives of the Estate

  (hereinafter referred to as ‘the said Order of Court’).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">PROVIDED ALWAYS that the Trustees shall do

  all in their means and powers to obtain the same and in the event that such approval are

  not obtained then this Agreement shall be null and void and of no effect and each party

  shall have no claim against the other. All monies paid to account of the sale herein shall

  be refunded to the Purchaser herein free from interest."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The "Trustees" are Syed Ali and

Mr Ng. Even if the agreement for sale had been "secured" it would have failed as

it was bound to and it would have been "null and void". There appears to be a

confusion as the application to court is for the appointment of trustees and not legal

personal representatives but the result would have been the same in any case. Neither Syed

Ali nor Mr Ng would have acquired any right to sell the properties. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49. The sale would have to be sanctioned

by the court if the sellers are selling as legal personal representatives of Shaikh Ahmad

who died more than six years ago. If the sellers are selling as trustees upon trust for

sale and one or more of the beneficiaries opposes the sale or is otherwise not competent

to express his consent to it then an application to court would have to be made. In either

case evidence of the value of the properties at the date of the hearing would have to be

adduced and I cannot see that an order can be obtained either to sanction the sale or to

empower the trustees to sell the properties to Beng Tiong for $8.26m when Beng Tiong is

willing to pay that price and another $4.64m to Mr Lee to buy these properties.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50. In my judgment Mr Lee has not suffered

any loss or incurred any expense in consequence of any of the breaches of the agency

agreement by Beng Tiong or any loss or expense in respect of which he is entitled to

damages. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Quantum meruit</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51. Paragraph 12 of the statement of claim

states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Alternatively to paragraphs 9 and 10

  herein, notwithstanding the work done and services performed by [Mr Lee] pursuant to the

  Agent’s Works Term as particularized in paragraph 11 herein, [Beng Tiong] [has]

  failed and refused to pay [Mr Lee] a reasonable sum or any sum at all. In the premises,

  [Beng Tiong] [is] in breach of the Reasonable Sum Term."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The "Reasonable Sum Term" is

alleged in para 5. Paragraphs 9 and 10 contain allegations as to repudiatory breaches and

their acceptance which have already been considered.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52. Counsel included in the bundle of

authorities <i>Gold Coin Ltd v Tay Kim Wee </i><nobr>[1986] SLR 68</nobr>. I heard no submissions on it

but in that case the <i>quantum meruit</i> claim was contractual in nature. See at p 72.

Lai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) referred to <i>Way v

Latilla</i> [1973] 3 All ER 759 and cited this passage from the speech of Lord Atkin at p

763:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"But, while there is, therefore, no

  concluded contract as to the remuneration, it is plain that there existed between the

  parties a contract of employment under which Mr Way was engaged to do work for Mr Latilla

  in circumstances which clearly indicated that the work was not to be gratuitous. Mr Way,

  therefore, is entitled to a reasonable remuneration on the implied contract to pay him

  quantum meruit."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>quantum meruit</i> claim as pleaded

is of a different nature. It is alleged to arise upon repudiatory breaches which have been

accepted so that the agency agreement has been put at an end. See <i>Luxor (Eastbourne) Ld

v Cooper </i>[1941] AC 108. Lord Wright said at p 141:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Such a claim is in the nature of a

  quasi-contractual claim. It is properly made in cases of contracts for work and labour and

  the like, where the employer, <i>who has got the benefit of part performance but before

  full completion has repudiated the contract </i>(emphasis added), may be sued either for

  damages for breach or for restitution in respect of the value of the part performance

  which he has received."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The claim as pleaded is of this nature.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53. What Beng Tiong contracted to get

under the agency agreement was an agreement for the purchase of the properties. It is

plainly stated in para (b) of the recitals that Beng Tiong <i>expected </i>to enter into

the agreement. Even if it has repudiated the agency agreement and the repudiation has been

accepted it has not in the circumstances of this case got any benefit from any partial

performance by Mr Lee. But as I have found Mr Lee affirmed the agency agreement and

allowed time to expire without "securing" the agreement for sale and purchase of

the properties.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54. Mr Lee has attempted to plead the

claim as a contractual claim founded upon an implied term. I see no ground for implying

such a term. The agency agreement is not unworkable without it. There is nothing in the

agency agreement pointing to any obligation to pay Mr Lee anything other than the agreed

fee for securing the agreement for sale and purchase of the properties. In my judgment

there was no implied term as alleged and Beng Tiong was not in breach of any such term.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Counterclaim</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55. The counterclaim is for the return of

the money advanced. It is not in dispute that Mr Lee has received from Beng Tiong a total

of $360,000. Clause 3.8 clearly provides that Mr Lee was to secure the execution by the

estate of the agreement for sale of the properties to Beng Tiong not later than 15 July

1994 failing which the agency agreement was to be null and void and he should refund to

Beng Tiong all moneys paid to him under the agency agreement. It is alleged that time was

extended to 31 December 1994. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56. Mr Lee’s defence is that by

reason of the breach of the terms as to advances and non-interaction he was "hindered

and prevented" from securing the execution of the agreement by the estate for sale of

the properties. I have found that the failure to secure the execution of the sale

agreement was not caused by or consequent upon any such breach but by the failure of the

application to appoint Syed Ali and Mr Ng as trustees in place of the Public Trustee and

other circumstances before any such breach.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57. The defence also alleges that Beng

Tiong cannot take advantage of its own repudiatory breaches. These are the same breaches

of the terms as to advances and non-interaction but as characterised it appears that a

distinct defence may have been intended. However I have found that the repudiation was not

accepted and as noted above the breaches did not cause the failure to secure the execution

of the sale agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58. In my judgment the defence fails and

Beng Tiong is entitled to recover the money it has advanced to Mr Lee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59. For these reasons I dismissed Mr

Lee’s claim and gave judgment for Beng Tiong on its counterclaim.</font></p>
