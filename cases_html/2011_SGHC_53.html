<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a rehearing of ancillary matters
                    between O’Connor Rosamund Monica (“the Wife”) and Derek John
                    Potter (“the Husband”). The parties were married on 19 September
                    1986. They have no children. Their first matrimonial home was at No. 47B Block
                    H, Jalan Arnap Singapore 249356 (“Kim Lin Mansion”). This was
                    purchased by the Wife and her sister, before the parties’ marriage. It
                    became the parties’ first matrimonial home when the Wife’s sister
                    moved out. After selling Kim Lin Mansion and renting two flats for 3 years, the
                    couple purchased No.79, Farrer Drive, Sommerville Park #05-03
                    (“Sommerville Park”) as their second matrimonial
                home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties divorced on 14 October 2008
                    following a separation period of 4 years. On 22 September 2009, the parties
                    appeared before this court for the first time (“the first
                    hearing”) wherein the following orders were made (“the first
                    order”); see <em>O’Connor Rosamund Monica v Potter
                        Derek John</em> [2009] SGHC 258:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Wife and the Husband were to hold
                        shares in Sommerville Park in the proportion of two-thirds and one-third
                        respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
                        the event the Wife chose to buy over the Husband’s share in
                        Sommerville Park, the Wife was to give notice of her election to the
                        Husband’s solicitors within ten days from 22 September 2009 and
                        the sale of the Husband’s one-third share should be completed within
                        90 days of 22 September 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     The purchase price to be paid by the Wife was to be
                        determined by a valuation to be conducted by Knight Frank Pte Ltd as of
                        22 September 2009 with the costs and expense of the valuation and the
                        transfer to be borne equally by both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Husband was not to occupy Sommerville Park
                        after 22 September 2009 but was at liberty to have his personal
                        possessions remain in Sommerville Park until the day of completion after
                        which he was to remove them.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Husband was to pay the Wife a lump sum of $50,000 by
                        way of maintenance. This amount was to be deducted from the Husband’s
                        one-third share in the sale of Sommerville Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Husband was to refund the Wife a
                        sum of $10,000 for her contribution towards his purchase of the Tanglin Club
                        membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
                        parties were to retain all other assets in their respective
                    names.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_h"></a>(h)     Costs of the
                        High Court proceedings up to 31 August 2009 were awarded to the Husband on a
                        party and party basis. Thereafter the Husband would have his costs on an
                        indemnity basis. Both sets of costs were to be taxed unless otherwise
                        agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dissatisfied with the first order, the Wife
                    appealed to the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 132 of 2009 (“the
                    Appeal”) in relation to (a) and (b) under the first order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The crux of the Appeal was that in dividing the
                    matrimonial assets, this court had overvalued the Wife’s assets. Her
                    counsel accepted responsibility for this error. He explained that he had
                    mistakenly submitted at the first hearing that cash gifts that the Wife had
                    received from her mother and grandmother were in addition to, and not part of,
                    her total assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appeal was heard on 6 April 2010. The
                    issues before the Court of Appeal were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether it was correct to award only
                        two-thirds of Sommerville Park to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the order for lump sum maintenance of
                        $50,000 was fair and reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Was this court justified in estimating past maintenance at
                        $400 per month and future maintenance at $500 per month with a multiplier of
                        6 when calculating the lump sum award of $50,000?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After hearing the parties, the Court of Appeal
                    made the following orders:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The action was remitted back to this court for
                            further hearing.</div>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     The value of immoveable properties
                        owned by the Wife and the Husband was to be fixed, and the assets of the
                        parties involving foreign currencies were to be converted into Singapore
                        currency, as at a date one month prior to the further hearing before this
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Wife
                        was to pay the Husband costs fixed at $12,000 inclusive of disbursements for
                        the first hearing. The costs of the Appeal would be determined by the Court
                        of Appeal after the conclusion of the further hearing before this
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal decided that the Husband
                    should also have the right to request further discovery from the
                Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 10 January 2011, pursuant to prayer (a)
                    granted by the Court of Appeal, the ancillary matters came on again for hearing
                    before this court (“the second hearing”). This court varied the
                    first order as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sommerville Park was to be sold in
                        the open market within 90 days with the Husband having conduct of the sale.
                        The net sale proceeds less sales commission and other incidental expenses
                        were to be divided equally between the parties. The Wife was to have the
                        first right of refusal to purchase the Husband’s 50% share in the
                        property. If she exercised the option, the value of the matrimonial property
                        was to be fixed at $3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Prayer (e) of the first order (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) awarding lump sum maintenance of $50,000 to the
                        Wife was rescinded.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Husband was entitled to set off and deduct from the Wife’s
                        share of the sale proceeds of Sommerville Park the costs of $12,000 awarded
                        to him by the Court of Appeal for the first hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the event the Wife exercised the
                        option to purchase the Husband’s 50% share in Sommerville Park, she
                        would also have to pay him the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       costs of the second
                            hearing;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       costs if awarded by the Court of Appeal (for the
                        Appeal);</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">the costs of $12,000 for the first
                                hearing;</div>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       costs ordered under
                            Summonses Nos. 2940/2010 and 4132/2010 by the courts below (for the
                            Husband’s applications for discovery); and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_v"></a>(v)       notional rent of $1,500 per
                            month for the duration that the Husband had not occupied Sommerville
                            Park since 30 September 2009 until completion of its
                    sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        Husband was awarded indemnity costs of $18,000, excluding disbursements,
                        which would be on a reimbursement basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As the Wife has appealed against the second
                    order (in Civil Appeal No 13 of 2011), I shall now set out my
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There were several salient issues raised at the
                    second hearing. In relation to the division of Sommerville Park, it had to be
                    decided whether the Wife’s disclosed assets included the monetary gifts
                    she had received from her mother and grandmother. In addition, new evidence had
                    been unearthed from the discovery process the Court of Appeal had ordered. In
                    the light of those considerations, this court had to reassess the Wife’s
                    contributions towards the purchase of Sommerville Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On the issue of maintenance, this court was also
                    required to re-evaluate the various statutory factors in view of the findings
                    this court made in relation to the Wife’s assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sommerville Park</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable Law on the Division of Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The starting point for the division of
                    matrimonial assets is s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009
                    Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a
                        judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order
                        the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any
                        such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale
                        of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and
                        equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The court’s discretion in deciding a
                    division of matrimonial assets is guided by various factors listed in
                    s 112(2) <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party
                            in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining
                            the matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or
                            undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of
                            any child of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party
                            to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring
                            for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either
                            party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to
                            the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in
                            contemplation of divorce;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other
                            benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of
                            the other party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party
                            to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the
                            giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the
                            carrying on of his or her occupation of business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    the matters referred to in s 114(1) so far as
                            they are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The parties’ contributions to
                    Sommerville Park were a particularly significant factor in this case. It is
                    therefore useful to refer to <em>NK v NL</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 743 at [22] –
                    [29] (“<em>NK v
                        NL</em>”) where Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA enunciated the
                    principles governing the division of the matrimonial home:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, he rejected the traditional
                        approach, as illustrated by <em>Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum
                            Yong</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 605 at [47], which regarded direct contributions
                        as a <em>prima facie</em> starting point before making
                        adjustments to reflect the non-financial contribution of the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, he
                        stressed the importance of the courts not engaging in a minute scrutiny of
                        the conduct and efforts of both spouses, since it may disadvantage the
                        spouse whose efforts were difficult to evaluate in financial terms
                            (<em>NK v NL</em>at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, at [29],
                        Phang JA wrote,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...it is paramount that courts do not focus merely on a direct and
                        indirect contributions dichotomy in arriving at a just and equitable
                        division of matrimonial assets... At the end of the day, no one factor
                        should be determinative as the court’s mandate is to come to a just
                        and equitable division of the matrimonial assets having regard to all the
                        circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Another important factor in the present case
                    was the parties’ non-financial contributions. Dealing with this was tricky
                    albeit necessary. As LP Thean JA noted in <em>Lim Choon Lai
                        v Chew Him Keng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 at [14] (“<em>Lim Choon
                        Lai</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for the non-financial contributions, they also play an important role,
                        and depending on the circumstances of the case, they can be just as
                        important. At the end of the day, taking into account both the financial and
                        non-financial contributions, the court would adopt a broad-brush approach to
                        the issue and make a determination on the basis of what the court considers
                        as a ‘just and equitable’ division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Phang JA in <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock
                        Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 at [39] (“<em>Lock Yeng
                        Fun</em>”) adopted the same position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our examination of the case law shows that the courts might not have given
                        sufficient recognition to the value of factors like homemaking, parenting
                        and husbandry when attributing to them a financial value in the division of
                        matrimonial assets. This ought not to be the case. It is true that, by their
                        very nature, such kinds of contributions to the marriage are, as pointed out
                        in the quotation above, difficult to measure because they are,
                        intrinsically, incapable of being measured in precise financial terms (we
                        assume that this is what the authors meant when they said that such
                        contributions were impossible to measure). Difficulty in measuring the
                        financial value of such contributions has never been – and ought never
                        to be – an obstacle to giving the spouse concerned his or her just and
                        equitable share of the matrimonial assets that is commensurate with his or
                        her contributions, taking into account (of course) the other relevant
                        contributions and factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There are two main methodologies in
                    attributing the parties’ indirect contributions in a marriage: the global
                    assessment methodology and the classification methodology. In <em>NK v NL</em> at [33],
                    Phang JA noted that both methodologies are consistent with s 112 and
                    that neither of them is superior to the other. The court should apply whichever
                    methodology allows it to ensure a just and equitable division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     When considering the abovementioned factors in
                    striving for a just and equitable division, the court is to exercise its
                    discretion in broad strokes rather than unrealistically engaging in a
                    nit-picking exercise (<em>Lock Yeng Fun</em> at [33].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Further, the judge must bear in mind that
                    equality of division should not be the default position when determining a just
                    and equitable result. Phang JA in <em>Lock Yeng
                        Fun</em> at [55] made this
                    very clear:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would also like to add that the experience of the courts in dealing
                        with division of matrimonial assets shows that equality of division is
                            <em>not</em> the norm (see above at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>); indeed, in the large majority of the
                        cases decided by the courts, equality of division was not achievable on the
                        facts. This is not surprising given the current social conditions in
                        Singapore, notwithstanding the fact that more and more women work and there
                        is generally more equality in the workplace. We emphasise, however, that the
                        focus of the court is always on the attainment of a <em>just
                            and equitable</em> division of matrimonial assets (as required
                        under s 112(1) of the Act). We have, consistent with this aim, in fact
                        emphasised (at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above) the
                        importance of giving the <em>fullest</em> effect to the
                        non-financial contributions of the spouse concerned. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Earlier in his judgment, at [50], Phang JA said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The decision in the present appeal is one of the occasions when this court
                        has decided that an equal division of matrimonial assets is just and
                        equitable on the facts of the case (the others being <em>Lim
                            Choon Lai</em> (<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> <em>supra</em>), <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen
                            Kai Buan</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659

                        3 SLR(R) 647  ). This was the <em>end
                            point</em> of our deliberations in this case, and not the starting
                        point. However, it appears that the contrary proposition (to the effect that
                        an equal division of matrimonial assets should be the starting point or
                        presumption or norm) is still being advocated in academic circles: see, for
                        example, <em>Halsbury's Laws of Singapore</em>
                            (<a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> <em>supra</em> at paras 130.817-130.821) and, by the
                        same author, "The Just and Equitable Division of Gains between Equal Former
                        Partners in Marriage" [2000] Sing JLS 208 as well as "The Laws in Singapore
                        and England Affecting Spouses' Property on Divorce" [2001] Sing JLS 19
                            (<em>contra</em>, Debbie Ong Siew Ling &amp;
                        Valerie Thean, "Family Law" (2001) 2 SAL Ann Rev 226 at para 13.31). Such a
                        proposition cannot, with respect, be accepted, as the legislative framework
                        set out in s 112 of the Act neither expresses nor implies the idea of
                        equality of division as a starting point or presumption or norm from which
                        either spouse can either chip away or bolster the division in his or her
                        favour. In the past, some judges have leaned towards the idea of equality as
                        a starting point (see, for example, <em>Soh Chan Soon v Tan
                            Choon Yock</em> [1998] SGHC 204   and <em>Louis Pius Gilbert v Louis Anne Lise</em> [1999]
                        3 SLR(R) 402  ), but these decisions are outnumbered by
                        those which have decided otherwise (see, for example, <em>Lau
                            Loon Seng v Sia Peck Eng</em> [1999]

                            Rosaline</em> (<em>supra</em>) and, most
                        importantly, this court's decision in <em>Lim Choon

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It bears remembering that the court’s
                    discretion to divide the parties’ assets is subject to the assets in
                    question being matrimonial assets. Section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter
                    defines a matrimonial asset as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    any asset acquired
                            before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage
                            –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or
                                one or more of their children while the parties are residing
                                together for shelter or transportation or for household, education,
                                recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   which has been substantially improved during
                                the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    any other asset of any nature acquired during the
                            marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has
                        been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has
                        not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by
                        both parties to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee
                        Guan</em> (<em>Wong Yong Yee, co-respondent)</em>
                    [2006] 4 SLR(R) 605 (“<em>Chen Siew
                        Hwee</em>”), Phang J considered the qualifying words in
                    s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. At [37], he ruled that the qualifying words excluding gifts applied
                    to both paragraphs (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) of s 112(10). The approach set out in the
                    qualifying words had to apply to all situations where an asset by way of gift or
                    inheritance had been conferred by the donor on one of the parties to the
                    marriage, regardless of whether or not that asset was conferred before or during
                    the marriage. To adopt a contrary approach was to embrace a distinction which
                    would be arbitrary, unjust and unfair. This therefore meant that if one party
                    receives a gift during the marriage from a third party that gift cannot be
                    divided as a matrimonial asset upon divorce unless it is the matrimonial home or
                    has been improved upon by the other party or both. The owner of the gifted asset
                    would have to show that it originated from the generosity of a third party in
                    order to prevent it from being divided upon divorce. For the time being it
                    appears that the matrimonial partnership stops short of extending to gifts
                    received by either party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on the matrimonial home</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At the first hearing, the Wife wanted
                    Sommerville Park to be awarded to her entirely. The Husband had then argued for
                    a half share in the property. The parties submitted the same arguments on
                    Sommerville Park at the second hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the first order, this court awarded the
                    Wife and the Husband shares in at two-thirds and one-third respectively. At the
                    second hearing, this court ordered that each party would have an equal half
                    share in Sommerville Park. This court varied its first order for two main
                    reasons. First, it only emerged at the second hearing that the Wife’s
                    contributions to Sommerville Park were not as substantial as she had
                    represented. Second, this court drew an adverse inference that the Wife had more
                    assets than she had disclosed. The two reasons are elaborated
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Wife’s contributions to Sommerville Park had been
                exaggerated</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Her direct financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The parties purchased Sommerville Park for
                    $1.1m in November 2003. The purchase was financed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     proceeds from the sale of Kim Lin
                        Mansions;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     initial Payments; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As the proceeds from the sale of Kim Lin
                    Mansion were used to purchase Sommerville Park, it was necessary to determine
                    the parties’ respective shares in the former. In turn it required this
                    court to ascertain the couple’s contributions to Kim Lin
                Mansion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At the first hearing, this court found that
                    the Wife had contributed $161,866.53 to the purchase of Kim Lin Mansion. As for
                    the Husband, this court initially found he had contributed $88,000 towards the
                    purchase of Kim Lin Mansion when he paid for the half share belonging to the
                    Wife’s sister. The figures were inaccurate and had to be revised at the
                    second hearing. The uncovering of new evidence of the Wife’s assets by the
                    discovery process required a relook of the earlier figures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Wife had submitted that amongst her
                    contributions she had paid $32,174.80 for the initial purchase of Kim Lin
                    Mansion. She also paid $15,750, being half of the deposit amount. In addition,
                    she contributed $18,117.60 towards the parties’ purchase of her
                    sister’s half share. Lastly, she had paid $29,041.33 for renovations and
                    furniture. This court accepted the Wife’s submissions on her
                    contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, it was also not disputed that the
                    Wife’s sister moved out of Kim Lin Mansion in December 1984. After the
                    Husband moved into the flat but prior to his purchasing the sister’s
                    share, the parties paid rental to the latter. This amounted to $46,800. The
                    Wife’s income tax returns for the years 1986 – 1988 showed it was
                    the Husband’s then employer Oil Asia, which paid the $46,800. Therefore,
                    this amount should be attributed as part of the Husband’s
                    contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Wife and her sister had taken a mortgage
                    when they purchased Kim Lin Mansion. The Husband said he started paying half of
                    the monthly mortgage payments of Kim Lin Mansion from the time the Wife’s
                    sister moved out. From July 1985 onwards, he paid in full the monthly
                    instalment. Some of the payments were made through his employer from 1985
                    – 1987, and subsequently by himself. The Wife disputed this. To support
                    her account, she adduced a letter from NTUC Income dated 13 April 1987 which
                    stated $132,825.30 of the loan had been repaid. However, it was revealed at the
                    second hearing that the Husband had passed the monies to the Wife, who then made
                    the mortgage payments from her account. As such, although a cursory glance at
                    the NTUC Income letter would support the Wife’s argument, more rigorous
                    scrutiny showed that from 1985 onwards, the Wife made no contributions
                    whatsoever towards the mortgage payments. Consequently, the Husband had paid
                    $202,800 in 13 years comprising of mortgage payments of $1,300 per
                month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     After selling Kim Lin Mansion but prior to
                    purchasing Sommerville Park, the parties rented two flats. During that period
                    (2001 to 2004), the Husband paid the rent of $1,400 a month. This totalled
                    $50,400 and should be considered as part of the Husband’s indirect
                    contribution towards Kim Lin Mansion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     For easier reference, the parties’
                    financial contributions have been listed in Tables 1 and 2 below. As the two
                    tables show, the financial contributions of the Wife and the Husband towards Kim
                    Lin Mansion were respectively 17.7% and 82.3%. However, taking into account the
                    parties’ non-financial contributions, this court decided that each party
                    should be deemed to have had a half share in Kim Lin Mansion. Kim Lin Mansion
                    was eventually sold for $2,024,193.54 in an <em>en-bloc</em> sale. As the proceeds were used entirely to fund the
                    purchase of Sommerville Park, each party may be said to have contributed
                    $1,012,096.77.</p>

                    produce any documentation to support her claims. Further, at the second hearing,
                    her counsel conceded that the $100,000 comprised furniture the Wife had
                    purchased for both Kim Lin Mansion and Sommerville Park. Given the lack of
                    supporting evidence and extensive double-counting, this court rejected the

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Non-financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Having considered the parties’ financial
                    contributions, direct and indirect, towards the purchase of Sommerville Park,
                    their non-financial contributions will now be addressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Wife said she purchased three cars that
                    were used by the Husband. She also claimed to have done household chores such as
                    cooking and cleaning, and to have paid much of the household expenses. Her
                    claims were matched by the Husband’s own claims of his indirect
                    contributions. He said he too did household chores such as washing the dishes
                    and contributing towards other household expenses. The impracticality of
                    examining the minutiae of the parties’ claims and the lack of evidence led
                    this court to apply the broad brush approach in assessing the parties’
                    indirect contributions. It seemed that even though it ended in divorce, the
                    marriage for the most part in its early days was one where the parties
                    contributed equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This court concluded therefore that the
                    parties’ financial contributions to Sommerville Park were nearly equal.
                    Their non-financial contributions, although different, were not of such a large
                    discrepancy as to warrant an adjustment to their equal financial contributions.
                    This led to this court’s decision to award each party an equal share in
                    Sommerville Park and to maintain the part of the first order that allowed the
                    parties to retain all other assets in their respective names.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Wife’s assets did not include the two gifts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Section 112(2)(h) of the Women’s Charter
                    states that when deciding the division of matrimonial assets, the court is to
                    consider “the matters referred to in s 114(1) so far as they are
                    relevant”. One such matter, as listed in s 114(1)(b), is “the
                    income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of
                    the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable
                    future”. Taking this factor into account, this court found that the Wife
                    possessed substantial assets over and beyond the monetary gifts she had received
                    from her mother and grandmother. This was the second reason why this court
                    reduced the Wife’s share in Sommerville Park from two-thirds to half. This
                    court made the finding that the Wife had/has other substantial assets on the
                    basis of two adverse inferences it had drawn. First, that she has other sources
                    of income and assets. Second, she had transferred her monetary gifts
                    elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Before justifying the adverse inferences I
                    drew, it would be helpful to set out the relevant principles on the drawing of
                    adverse inferences. First, as the Court of Appeal made clear in <em>BG v BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [52] (“<em>BG v
                        BF</em>”), the drawing of adverse inferences is based on the
                    duty of full and frank disclosure:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the general duty that every party to court proceedings owes to the
                        court to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information within
                        his or her knowledge is particularly relevant in the context of the division
                        of matrimonial assets. The position in law is that full and frank disclosure
                        is important and in its absence the court is entitled to draw inferences
                        adverse to the party who failed to do so: <em>Koh Kim Lan
                            Angela v Choong Kian How</em> [1993]
                        3 SLR(R) 491.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The drawing of adverse inferences acts as a disincentive to parties to
                    withhold information, which would be anathema to the process of reaching just
                    and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Second, the court should only draw an adverse
                    inference when the circumstances permit. A party cannot request the court to
                    make an adverse inference of the other party’s worth simply because he
                    claims the other is worth at least a certain amount. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co
                        Ltd</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [50] ruled:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether or not in each case an adverse inference should be drawn depends
                        on all the evidence adduced and the circumstances of the case. There is no
                        fixed and immutable rule of law for drawing such inference. Where, as was
                        the case here, the trial judge is of the view that the Wifes themselves had
                        not made out their claim to the requisite standard, then no drawing of an
                        adverse inference against the husbands is necessary. <em>The
                            drawing of an adverse inference, at least in civil cases, should not be
                            used as a mechanism to shore up glaring deficiencies in the opposite
                            party’s case, which on its own is unable to meet up to the
                            requisite burden of proof</em>. Rather, the procedure exists in
                        order to render the case of the party against whom the inference is drawn
                        weaker and thus less credible of belief. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Judith Prakash J said in <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai
                        Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21 at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well established that in order for a court to draw an adverse
                        inference, there must, in the first place, be some substratum of evidence
                        that establishes a <em>prima facie</em> case against
                        the person against whom the inference it to be drawn. In addition, it must
                        be shown that the person against whom the inference is to be drawn has some
                        particular access to the information he is said to be hiding (perhaps
                        because it is peculiarly within his knowledge). In other words, the
                        court’s ability to draw an adverse inference does not and cannot
                        displace the legal burden of proof that continues to lie with the Wife, or,
                        as in this appeal, the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Third, having drawn an adverse inference, the
                    court has to decide how to give effect to the same. There are two ways of doing
                    so. The first is to order a higher proportion of the known matrimonial assets to
                    be given to the other spouse, as was done by Phang JA in <em>NK v NL</em> and by Andrew Ang J in <em>BG v
                        BF</em>. Alternatively, the court may determine the value of the
                    undeclared assets. It may infer a value from the available information. Kan Ting

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the light of established principles, this

                    reasons. First, she had been extremely uncooperative throughout the discovery
                    process which the Court of Appeal had ordered. Table 5 below provides

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Second, despite numerous opportunities given
                    to her, the Wife did not satisfactorily explain her failure to disclose the
                    existence or details of several bank accounts that were revealed by the
                    discovery process. One such example was her Standard Chartered E-saver Bank
                    Account (“E-saver account”). In her 12 March 2009 and 3 September
                    2009 Declarations of the Value of Matrimonial Assets, the Wife did not disclose
                    this account. In her 10 August 2010 Affidavit, she submitted that she had
                    forgotten the account’s existence since credit statements were not issued
                    for E-saver accounts and the last time the account was in use was in 2007. She
                    had assumed that all her funds had now been transferred to private banking. For
                    a woman who took meticulous care in managing her finances (she even kept
                    receipts for groceries she had purchased while on a Cameron Highlands trip in
                    December 2007), this court found it hard to believe she would forget about an
                    account that held $275,671.95 at the time of the second hearing. The Wife sought
                    to explain her omission by alleging that the Husband knew or should have known
                    about this account. Such an argument was flawed because the burden was on her to
                    provide disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Wife made the same argument in relation to
                    her Standard Chartered Foreign Currency Cheque and Save Account (“Cheque
                    and Save account”) which she also failed to disclose. She claimed the
                    Husband knew about this account because he had accompanied her when she opened a
                    Deutsche Bank account with a cheque drawn from the Cheque and Save account. The
                    Husband said he could not recall this incident. However, even if he had
                    accompanied her, he argued he did not know which account the cheque was drawn
                    from. He therefore did not know about the Cheque and Save account. This court
                    found the Wife’s explanation of her non-disclosure of this account to be
                    inadequate, even if one assumed the Husband knew of the same – the
                    obligation was on the Wife not only to disclose the existence but also the
                    details of, the bank account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There were other instances where the Wife
                    failed to adequately provide details about her accounts even after their
                    presence had been discovered, for example the OCBC account she used for CPF
                    investments. The Husband only learnt of the OCBC account because in a DBS
                    Vickers statement, in relation to the Wife’s DBS Vickers Trading Account,
                    it was revealed that $13,409.59 was credited to it from the OCBC account
                    (transaction reference No 471211/003/01). The Wife refused to disclose
                    information about the OCBC account. She merely provided a CPF Statement of
                    Account (for July to December 1996) which stated she had a basic investment
                    scheme account with OCBC. Following the orders for discovery on 12 July 2010
                    made below, the Wife simply stated at para 3(l) of her 24 September 2010
                    Affidavit that “the OCBC account merely facilitated CPF transfers”
                    and that she “has nothing else to do with that account and as such has no
                    documents pertaining to it”. Her failure to provide a more detailed
                    explanation was a clear and blatant breach of the duty to give full and frank
                    disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This court therefore drew the adverse
                    inferences that the Wife had other sources of income and assets, and that she
                    had transferred the monies elsewhere. This court drew the two adverse inferences
                    due to the Wife’s failure to explain large movements between her accounts.
                    The tables below list the transactions for which the Wife failed to provide any
                    details. For the sake of brevity, only transactions of $10,000 and above have
                    been listed.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The total amount of unexplained withdrawals, utilizing historical
                    exchange rates for conversion to Singaporean currency, was $3,404,866.17. The
                    value of the unexplained deposits amounted to $2,303,598.10. The Wife’s
                    failure to account for the withdrawals led to the inference that she had other
                    assets elsewhere. This court also inferred that she had other sources of income
                    and assets on the basis of the unexplained deposits. Those inferences, in turn,
                    indicated that the Wife had more assets than she had disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The inferences were further justified by the
                    Wife’s failure to trace her monetary gifts. First, in her 24 September
                    2010 Affidavit para 3(j)(iv), the Wife disclosed a HSBC account statement, dated
                    3 September 2003, to show she had deposited her grandmother’s gift of
                    $70,000 on 1 September 2003. This contradicted her first Affidavit of Assets and
                    Means, filed on 28 November 2009 where she claimed she had received the amount
                    in 2001. Second, the Wife stated in her 24 September 2010 Affidavit at para
                    3(j)(v) that she had deposited her mother’s first gift of $250,000 in her
                    Cheque and Save account on 24 February 2004. This was inconsistent with her
                    third Affidavit of Assets and Means, filed on 12 February 2009, where the Wife
                    (at para 75) stated she received the gift in 2003. A 12 March 2004 statement
                    showed a deposit (reference number FM0330603736) of $250,637.67. Though the Wife
                    had consistently claimed the gift was a round figure of $250,000, she did not
                    explain where the excess $637.67 came from. Consequently, she failed to prove
                    the monies in this account mainly comprised her mother’s
                gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     At the second hearing, this court gave the
                    Wife’s counsel the opportunity to rebut the adverse inferences. He
                    submitted the Wife could not have had more assets than the monetary gifts as she
                    had no source of income. However, the Wife’s accounts clearly show her to
                    be an active investor. In fact, she had been certified by the Institute of
                    Banking and Finance to give financial advice on futures trading and commodity
                    broking. It was entirely possible for her to have accumulated greater wealth
                    through her investment activities. Second, to support her case, her counsel
                    relied on an email from the Husband to his brother, dated 22 February 2008. In
                    this email, the Husband wrote “she [the Wife] was given $1,250,000 by her
                    mother” and “[w]hat riles me is that she was given most of her
                    money by her mother whereas I had to work hard for mine”. He submitted
                    that this showed that the Husband admitting that the Wife had little assets
                    beyond her monetary gifts. This court was not convinced by this argument. It was
                    entirely consistent for the Husband to moan about the Wife’s
                    “windfall” and for her to increase her assets by way of investing
                    the monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As an argument in the alternative, the Husband
                    submitted that the tracing rules pointed to the conclusion that the Wife’s
                    current assets were not traceable to the gifts. Therefore, the monies the Wife
                    had disclosed should be placed into the pot of matrimonial assets to be divided.
                    In support, the Husband cited <em>Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee
                        Guan</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 605 at [58] –
                    [59]. In considering whether a gift
                    given to either party in the course of a marriage should retain the
                    characteristics of a gift if it is transformed into a new asset, Phang J
                    held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a new asset will be ‘acquired ... by gift’ if the done
                        intends the new asset to assume the same nature as that of the original
                        asset i.e. that of being a gift... However ... before one can even undertake
                        this enquiry of whether the original asset should be that of the new asset,
                        it would, in all cases be necessary to first consider whether the new asset
                        is traceable to the assets which constituted the original gift (here, the
                        shares) to begin with. If such tracing is not available, for example, where
                        it is unclear what the source of funds used to acquire the new asset were,
                        it would be logically impossible to additionally consider whether the new
                        asset continues to be in the nature of a gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to the Husband, if one employs the “first in, first
                    out” rule of <em>Devaynes v Noble</em> (1816) 1 Mer
                    572 (“<em>Clayton’s rule</em>”), one
                    can conclude that the gift monies have already been dissipated. The case of
                        <em>Neo Mei Lan Helena v Long Melvin Anthony</em>
                    [2002] 2 SLR(R) 616 (“<em>Neo Mei Lan
                        Helena</em>”) was relied upon to show that the courts have used
                    the rule before in a similar context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, a closer scrutiny of <em>Neo Mei Lan Helena</em> at [53] would show Woo Bih Li JC’s point in the case was made
                    only in passing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although Mr. Rai had sought to argue that not all the moneys in the
                        husband’s CPF account had been used to buy the Dairy Farm apartment,
                        he was not able to establish this, even if the fresh evidence which he had
                        sought to adduce had been allowed. That fresh evidence was simply a
                        statement of his CPF account as at 13 July 1984, one day before the
                        marriage. Besides, his argument might have been effectively countered by the
                        “first in, first out” principle, but I need say no more
                        thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Woo JC’s obiter remark cannot be taken as authority for the use
                    of <em>Clayton’s rule</em> in the context of dividing
                    the parties’ matrimonial assets. In addition, there is a more fundamental
                    flaw in the Husband’s arguments. <em>Clayton’s
                        rule</em> is an equitable rule of tracing. Though much academic
                    comment has been made of the arbitrariness of having two distinct tracing
                    regimes, for one to avail oneself of equity’s tracing rules, one still
                    needs to show a trust relationship. As this is not present on the facts, this
                    court dismissed this argument of the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Given the finding that the Wife had more
                    assets than she had disclosed, this court then had to decide how to give effect
                    to the adverse inference. The Wife’s lack of candour despite the Court of
                    Appeal’s order for discovery meant it was impossible to put a value on the
                    undisclosed assets. As such, this court chose to grant the Husband a larger
                    share of the disclosed assets. Taking this approach was the second reason this
                    court decided to increase the Husband’s share in Sommerville Park. Even
                    so, my finding that the Wife had undisclosed assets and that her contributions
                    to the matrimonial home were much less than the Husband’s were only two of
                    the factors to be considered in the overall assessment of a just and equitable
                    division. In the light of all the circumstances of the case, in particular the
                    Wife’s non-financial contributions, this court increased the
                    Husband’s share from a third to half.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Wife had argued that as a Singaporean, she
                    needed a home. In contrast, the Husband is only a Singapore PR. According to
                    her, he frequently visited England for long periods and that was evidence that
                    he still maintained roots in his country of birth. This court was not persuaded
                    by such arguments. The Husband clearly regarded Singapore as his home and
                    occasional visits to his family in the United Kingdom did not detract from the
                    fact that he too needed permanent accommodation in Singapore. In any event, the
                    Wife had little reason to complain since this court had given her the first
                    right of refusal to buy Sommerville Park. Given this court’s finding, the
                    Wife should have no difficulty in buying over the Husband’s half share,
                    even based on her disclosed assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consequential orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Following the decision to give each party 50%
                    share in Sommerville Park, this court ordered that the matrimonial home be sold
                    in the open market within 90 days of 10 January 2011 but giving the Wife the
                    first right of refusal. Should the Wife fail or decline to purchase the
                    Husband’s share in Sommerville Park, it would be sold and the net sale
                    proceeds (less sales commission and other incidental expenses) were to be
                    divided equally between the parties. Given the Wife’s conduct during the
                    discovery process, this court also ordered that the Husband shall have conduct
                    of the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     At the Appeal, the Court of Appeal had ordered
                    that the value of the parties’ properties was to be determined on a date
                    one month prior to the second hearing. The Wife submitted a revised valuation
                    report from Knight Frank dated 19 October 2010, which valued the property at
                    $2.75m. The Husband responded by adducing current data from the Urban
                    Redevelopment Authority which showed that a flat in the estate was sold in
                    November 2010 for $3.35m. It was not known whether there were dissimilarities
                    between that flat and the parties’ which would make such a comparison
                    inappropriate. Taking this factor into account, along with the general upward
                    trend of prices in the current property market, this court fixed the value of
                    Sommerville Park at $3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The last consequential order was necessitated
                    by the first order that the Husband must move out of Sommerville Park by 30
                    September 2009. He complied with the order. However, the Husband was forced to
                    move his possessions out of Sommerville Park by the Wife a week after the first
                    hearing as she changed the locks, notwithstanding the first order that his
                    possessions could remain in the property until the day of completion of the
                    sale. While the Wife has had exclusive occupation of Sommerville Park since 30
                    September 2009, the Husband has had to pay rent for his accommodation at various
                    places including hotels. In the context of this court having given the parties
                    an equal share in Sommerville Park, I ordered the Wife to pay the Husband (half)
                    notional rent amounting to $1,500 per month for the duration that the Husband
                    did not occupy Sommerville Park, <em>viz</em> from 30
                    September 2009 until completion of its sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     This court had in the first order awarded the
                    Wife lump sum maintenance of $50,000. This court rescinded this order at the
                    second hearing. Again, this was a consequence of the finding that the Wife had
                    more assets than she had disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Law on Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Section 113 of the Women’s Charter
                    empowers the court to make an order for maintenance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may order a man to pay maintenance to his wife or
                        former wife -</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    during the course of any matrimonial
                                proceedings; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    `when granting or subsequent to the grant of a
                                judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of
                                marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In making such an order, the court has to
                    consider all the circumstances of the case, including the factors set out in
                    s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other
                            financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is
                            likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the financial needs, obligations and
                            responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is
                            likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family
                            before the breakdown of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the
                            duration of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the
                            parties to the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the
                        welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the
                        home or caring for the family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity
                            of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any
                            benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or
                            annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of
                            acquiring.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Court of Appeal had helpfully elaborated
                    on the principles for maintenance in <em>BG v BF</em> at
                    [74]-[75]. First, adequate provision must be made to ensure the support and
                    accommodation of the children of the marriage. This was a non-issue in the
                    present case as the parties have no children. Second, provision must be made to
                    meet the needs of each spouse. Third, it is ultimately the court’s sense
                    of justice which demands and obtains a just solution to many a difficult issue.
                    Fourth, the power to order maintenance is exercised in a manner supplementary to
                    the power to divide matrimonial assets, such that the court takes account of
                    each party’s share of the assets, and the order for maintenance plays a
                    complementary role to the order for assets. Lastly, citing <em>Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok Dennis</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR(R) 376, the Court of Appeal held that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the rationale behind the law imposing a duty on a former husband to
                        maintain his former wife is to even out any financial inequalities between
                        the spouses, taking into account any economic prejudice suffered by the wife
                        during marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     At the second hearing, the Wife wanted arrears
                    of maintenance for the three years preceding the second hearing (she claimed
                    that the Husband failed to provide her any allowance for the period) and
                    maintenance of $5,000 a month thenceforth. Alternatively, she requested a lump
                    sum of $600,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     This court found the Wife’s claim to be
                    unreasonable and excessive. As stated above, one main factor to consider is
                    whether a wife has been adequately provided. Before the Court of Appeal, the
                    Wife submitted that her monthly allowance was $900. She should receive three
                    years arrears for this sum and 25 years future maintenance. By her own
                    admission, she needed only $302,400 (based on a monthly sum of $900 x 28 years x
                    12 months). This court failed to see why there was such a huge increase in her
                    request at the second hearing. Her undisclosed assets may well have meant that
                    she was much better off than the Husband and required no maintenance from him at
                    all let alone $600,000. Indeed, counsel for the Husband pointed out that based
                    on her disclosed assets in foreign currencies, the Wife earned a monthly
                    interest income of $3,154.57.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Wife had accused the Husband of passing to
                    her two sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs), Herpes HSV-1 and Chlamydia, and
                    she blamed her inability to have children on the latter. The Husband denied
                    giving the Wife Chlamydia but acknowledged that he had infected her with Herpes.
                    According to his counsel, the Husband married the Wife out of guilt that he had
                    infected her with Chlamydia. Given that medical literature produced by the
                    Husband’s counsel showed it takes more than two weeks for symptoms of
                    Chlamydia to manifest and appear, and the fact that the parties only commenced a
                    sexual relationship a week prior to the Wife being diagnosed with Chlamydia (on
                    3 October 1983), this court agreed with the Husband that it was more likely than
                    not that he was not responsible for that infection. The Wife had also claimed
                    that due to the resultant breakout of lesions from Chlamydia, she could not
                    work. As evidenced by her complaints of the Husband’s termination of her
                    supplementary memberships of the Tanglin Club and the Singapore Island Country
                    Club, the Wife maintained an active social life notwithstanding her professed
                    inability to work. In this court’s view, her lifestyle undermined her
                    claim that the STDs prevented her from interacting with people. This was not a
                    case of an individual who was unable to work but one who deliberately chose not
                    to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Another argument of the Wife was that she had
                    not worked for over 20 years. In addition, she claimed that her Fine Arts
                    (Painting) degree from La Salle College of Arts and the Royal Melbourne
                    Institute of Technology was not marketable. As such, she was unlikely to be able
                    to support herself. This court was unconvinced. The Wife had been certified by
                    the Institute of Banking and Finance to give financial advice on futures trading
                    and commodity broking. Evidence was adduced by the Husband that the Wife had
                    engaged in commodity futures trading in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in an
                    affidavit filed by one Dorian Francis Ball. For reasons stated above, the Wife
                    likely possessed more assets than she had disclosed. Taken together, the
                    evidence refuted the Wife’s claim that she would be unable to support
                    herself. It was also telling that throughout the entire divorce proceedings from
                    18 January 2008 up to the first hearing, the Wife did not apply for interim
                    maintenance. She had filed a maintenance summons on 20 November 2008 but that
                    was dismissed as she failed to turn up for the mention of the summons. She filed
                    a second maintenance summons on 6 October 2009 in the Subordinate Courts but
                    withdrew the same when she was told the Subordinate Courts had no jurisdiction
                    as the issue had been determined by this court at the first
                hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     This court then proceeded to consider the
                    Husband’s situation. He has been retired (since 2000) and although he
                    immerses himself in various activities, such as his PhD research and organising
                    golf tours, these were unlikely to be a regular source of significant income to
                    support the Wife’s maintenance claims in the long run. Granted, the
                    Husband has considerable assets of his own. However, they were overshadowed by
                    the Wife’s assets which appeared to be more than his.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Wife claimed that the Husband receives or
                    will receive two pensions. He should therefore have no difficulty to support
                    her. She pointed out that the Husband had already started receiving his monthly
                    Merchant Navy pension of £84.77. The Husband has yet to receive his state
                    pension. Since he is not resident in the European Union, the state pension is
                    not index-linked. Consequently, the amount of this pension is unlikely to be
                    significant either. Accordingly, the two pensions cannot realistically be
                    considered to be a steady income stream for the Husband. Further, the Husband is
                    in poor health. He suffered from ankylosing spodylitis, a disease which has
                    affected his spine and causes him considerable pain. He has had hip replacements
                    in 2004 and 2006. Unfortunately, X-ray and bone scans have recently revealed his
                    hip implant may have loosened and further costly surgery may be
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The above reasons explained this court’s
                    first order to the Husband to pay lump sum maintenance of $50,000 to the Wife.
                    This court decided to rescind the order following my findings in the second
                    hearing that the Wife had more assets than she had disclosed. The object of
                    maintenance is to “even out any financial inequalities between the
                    spouses”, according to the Court of Appeal in <em>BG v
                        BF</em>. As there was every likelihood that the Wife had the same or
                    even more assets than the Husband, there was no financial inequality to even out
                    between the parties. Therefore, an order for maintenance was not
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     This court awarded indemnity costs of $18,000
                    to the Husband because his counsel produced to this court an Offer to Settle
                    that her client had made to the Wife that contained terms that were more
                    generous to her than the orders that were made at the second hearing. The costs
                    excluded disbursements which were awarded to the Husband on a reimbursement
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     This court allowed the Husband to deduct from
                    the Wife’s share of the sale proceeds of Sommerville Park, (in the event
                    the Wife exercised her right of first refusal to purchase the Husband’s
                    share) and to add on to his 50% share, the following items:</p>
