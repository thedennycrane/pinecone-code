</div> The plaintiffs were the claimants and counterclaim respondents in the arbitration (“the Arbitration”). The defendants were the respondents and counterclaimants. Since it is not necessary to draw any distinction between the individual plaintiffs or defendants, I shall refer to the plaintiffs together as “CMJ” and the defendants together as “CML”, their names having been anonymised for the purposes of these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The OS was filed in the High Court (Originating Summons No 873 of 2020) on 9 September 2020 and was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court on 13 April 2021. Following the filing of affidavits and written submissions, there was an oral hearing before me on 1 and 2 November 2021 where Mr Giam Chin Toon SC (“Mr Giam SC”) appeared on behalf of CMJ and Mr Cavinder Bull SC (“Mr Bull SC”) appeared on behalf of CML.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Arbitration was commenced 6 June 2016. It was seated in Singapore and the applicable substantive law was the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). It was administered by the SIAC and conducted under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules of 1976 (“the UNCITRAL Rules”).

CML denied the claims made, disputing the scope of the duties alleged and the alleged breaches. CML counterclaimed for damages for CMJ’s alleged breaches of the contracts and for recovery of outstanding amounts allegedly owed by CMJ to CML under the contracts. Both parties claimed to be entitled to terminate the contracts by reason of the alleged breaches.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 By the Award dated 11 June 2020, a three-member tribunal (“the Tribunal”) dismissed all of CMJ’s claims but upheld CML’s counterclaim to a limited extent and awarded damages in respect of those breaches.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 CMJ seek to set aside the Award on the ground that there were breaches of natural justice in that they were not given a fair opportunity to present their case and that the Tribunal failed to apply its mind to important aspects of their submissions in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Arbitration arose from a dispute between the parties in relation to a petroleum contract entered into on 24 March 2005 to explore, develop and produce oil and gas resources at certain offshore fields. The collaboration between the parties turned out to be less successful than they had hoped. It appears that not only did the parties discover less gas in the fields than was anticipated but world gas prices also declined significantly over the course of the project which put the parties at a disadvantage in their negotiations with the sole buyer for the gas produced. The reasons for the less than satisfactory outcome are, however, not relevant to the OS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 What is relevant is the way in which the Arbitration, which was regulated in the usual way by Procedural Orders, was conducted. The timeline of the Arbitration is conveniently set out in a table in the first affidavit of Mr Yuen Po Kwong Peter, which is reproduced below:

CML made the point that if CMJ wished to raise these issues, para 9.2(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of PO2 gave them an opportunity to do this by way of direct examination at the evidentiary hearing and stated that if BT2 was to be admitted, CML should be given an opportunity to submit further evidence in response.

As indicated, Mr Giam SC had confirmed at the hearing before me that CMJ were not pursuing the objection in relation to the latter (see [16] above). So far as concerns Mr C’s evidence, there was an issue in the Arbitration as to whether CML had been in breach of their contractual duty to drill for additional gas. In the Award, there was a factual finding that CML had complied with their duty to drill for additional gas and thus was not in breach. CMJ contends that the failure to admit BT2, which related to this issue, meant that CMJ had been denied the opportunity properly to respond to evidence given in the Rejoinder and, hence, that the refusal to admit BT2 caused real prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The second is expressed as being an objection based upon the form of the JER of the PRC law experts.  In the course of the oral submissions before me it became clear that the objection was in truth an objection about the conduct of CML in filing Prof Liu’s report as part of the Rejoinder evidence rather than with the Defence. Thus CMJ had been denied the opportunity to respond by way of a full written report from Prof Ling in the Reply evidence and the procedure directed by the Tribunal for dealing with the late filed report of Prof Liu denied CMJ a proper opportunity of responding to CML’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The third is an assertion, related to the first, based upon an alleged legal duty to drill for additional gas arising out of a letter dated 15 July 2011 from CML to CMJ (“the 15 July 2011 Letter”).

Seen in this light, it becomes evident that the real inquiry is whether the breach of natural justice was merely technical and inconsequential or whether as a result of the breach, the arbitrator was denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations. Put another way, the issue is whether the material could reasonably have made a difference to the arbitrator; rather than whether it would necessarily have done so. Where it is evident that there is no prospect whatsoever that the material if presented would have made any difference because it wholly lacked any legal or factual weight, then it could not seriously be said that the complainant has suffered actual or real prejudice in not having had the opportunity to present this to the arbitrator … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Both parties drew my attention to the recent Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>”)<span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>The Court of Appeal summarised the applicable principles on the setting aside of an arbitral award for breach of natural justice, as follows (at [104]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The foregoing discussion of the applicable principles may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The parties’ right to be heard in arbitral proceedings finds expression in Art 18 of the Model Law, which provides that each party shall have a “full opportunity” of presenting its case.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Mr Yuen’s 1st Affidavit at pp 195-196. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Appropriately redacted to preserve anonymity, they read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">519 With respect to the [X] well, the contemporaneous documentation shows that the idea of drilling it was dropped after January 2015. The Tribunal notes that after January 2015, the TCM [Technical Committee] and JMC [Joint Management Committee] meetings, and the documents cited above, do not discuss the [X] well, and, by November 2017, the drilling of the [Y] well was proposed. [CMJ] subsequently agreed to the budget for the [Y] well in November 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">520 The Tribunal notes that [CML] did not present a drilling plan and detailed budget for the [X] well after the favourable economic evaluation of the well in November 2013 and April 2014 following the October 2013 meetings. [CML] as the Operator, could have made proposals to boost reserves, at a time where a revised estimate of the reserves made it impossible for the Sellers to achieve the requirements under the [contracts]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">521 However, contemporaneous evidence does not show that [CMJ] insisted on pushing through with the [X] well during this period. From the period starting January 2015, [CMJ] never brought up that they regarded the [X] well as essential, and never warned [CML] that they considered the failure to advance the plans as a dereliction of duty.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">523 Thus, it is apparent that the [X] well discussion stalled after January 2015 because of the more pressing issue of the low level of offtake. This sheds light on the probable reason why the [X] well design and budget were not put forward by [CML], and why in 2015, [CMJ] may not have approved a plan, given their more urgent priorities. In any case, there was nothing preventing [CMJ] from insisting on this in the JMCs [meetings]. There is no sufficient evidence showing that [CMJ] continued to strongly insist in progressing the work regarding the [X] well after January 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">524 Considering these, the Tribunal finds that [CML’s] failure to proceed with the arrangements for the [X] well was not a breach of its obligations as Operator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In essence, CMJ’s case is that the evidence that Mr C proposed to give in BT2 would demonstrate that CMJ did continue to insist strongly that the work regarding the [X] well should be progressed at the relevant time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 CMJ’s case thus is:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there was a breach of natural justice in that CMJ’s right to be treated with equality and be given a full opportunity of presenting their case pursuant to Art 18 of the Model Law was undermined; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) this was done by the Tribunal’s refusal to admit BT2, which was replying to new issues raised in the Rejoinder;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the breach was connected to the making of the Award in that it could have affected the conclusions reached at para 523 of the Award; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the breach thus prejudiced CMJ’s rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 CML challenges each limb of this argument. First, they contend that the material in BT2 was not in response to any new issues in the Rejoinder.  Second, even if it was, the Tribunal’s decision in exercising its discretion not to allow it to be admitted was proper and reasonable in all the circumstances. Third, any possibility of the parties not being treated with equality was removed by the Tribunal’s decision to allow CMJ the opportunity to adduce 30 minutes of evidence-in-chief from Mr C. Fourth, even if the evidence in BT2 had been adduced, it did not have the potential to undermine the conclusion at para 523 of the Award. It could not therefore have affected the outcome on that issue, so that CMJ have suffered no prejudice even if there was a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I do not propose to resolve the question of whether the relevant contents of BT2 were in response to new issues, merely expanded upon matters already covered in earlier evidence or raised new issues. The Tribunal was of the view that it <span class="font-italic">did</span> expand on the issues already raised and contained new allegations based, apparently, on recently acquired factual material (see [20] above). However, the Tribunal took steps to ensure that CMJ were not disadvantaged by its refusal to admit BT2, whatever be the status of the evidence, by allowing Mr C to give evidence-in-chief for 30 minutes. The question is whether those steps were, in the circumstances of this case, sufficient to avoid the breach of natural justice which CMJ now relies upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The starting point is to revert to para 8.10 of PO2 which is set out above (at [14]). This provision expressly anticipates that there may be a need for testimony from a witness which is offered to rebut an argument or evidence raised in the Rejoinder. Paragraph 8.10 of PO2 is not limited to testimony directed to issues raised for the first time in the Rejoinder. It was thus open to CMJ to adduce oral evidence from Mr C directed at any part of the Rejoinder evidence. Indeed, CMJ appreciated this in their letter of 18 July 2018 (the contents of which I have set out above at [16]), where they contended that it would be better to submit BT2 prior to the evidentiary hearing rather than make the same points in examination-in-chief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In its ruling on 2 August 2018, the Tribunal refused to allow BT2 to be introduced in evidence (see [20] above). This was an exercise of discretion based upon its analysis of the nature of the evidence, the proximity of the hearing, the fact that the experts would have to consider the new evidence when they were already in the final stages of drafting the JERs and the fact that CML would not have an opportunity to peruse and respond to the evidence before the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In response to the refusal, CMJ requested that Mr C should be allowed 30 minutes to give evidence-in-chief and be allowed to adduce further materials in support. The former request was allowed but the latter was not (see [21] above). There was thereafter no protest by CMJ that the inability to adduce further materials rendered it impossible for Mr C to give the evidence which CMJ wished him to give.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Tribunal was placed in a not unfamiliar but nonetheless invidious position of having to deal with late applications to adduce evidence. On the one hand, a refusal to admit the evidence could lead to an injustice, but to admit it could also lead to an injustice to the other party in having to grapple with the new evidence as well as preparing for the hearing. Accommodating the needs of both parties could possibly have the result of jeopardising the hearing date, which in a case such as this would be thoroughly undesirable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 To my mind, this is a case where the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> ([54] above) are particularly apposite. This was a matter of procedure and the Tribunal did its best to be fair to both parties consistent with adhering to the existing procedural timeline (see [8] above). I do not consider that what the Tribunal did falls out with the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal might have done in the circumstances of this case.  There was therefore no breach of natural justice in the Tribunal’s refusal to admit BT2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Even if I were to be wrong in this, I consider that CMJ’s case on the issue fails on other grounds as well.  I shall briefly explain my reasoning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 First, CMJ assert that the evidence in BT2 would serve to demonstrate that they did insist strongly that the work regarding the [X] well should be progressed.  I do not read it as so doing. Instead, BT2 deals with Mr C’s concerns that the [Y] well was being proposed (see para 15 of BT2)

</div>  His evidence was that he was critical of the decision to proceed with the [Y] well and discussed possible alternatives with CML but did no more than that. Mr C was therefore given the opportunity at the evidentiary hearing to adduce the evidence that CMJ now says should have been admitted, but he did not.

In the Award, the Tribunal did not consider whether a separate duty to drill on part of [CML] arose from [the 15 July 2011 Letter] but rather focused solely on whether such duty arose from the parties’ discussions and agreement at the JMC. The Tribunal then dismissed [CMJ’s] claims with respect to Additional Gas on the basis [CMJ] did not continue to insist on progressing the work regarding the [X] well after January 2015.

Had such an independent duty existed, [CMJ’s] insistence or otherwise at the JMC would not have been the key determining factor. Rather, [CML] would have been under an independent duty to ensure that the relevant plans for the drilling of wells for Additional Gas were made and presented to the JMC. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89 The Tribunal dismissed [CMJ’s] case on [CML’s] obligation to drill additional wells on the factual basis that the JMC never approved the [X] well and [CMJ] did not insist on progressing the work regarding the well after January 2015.

It equally had well in mind that drilling decisions were to be subject to the authorisation of the JMC. At para 509 of the Award,

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> the Tribunal also held that it was apparent from the statements in the JMC meetings as well as in other documents that CMJ themselves had “proceeded very carefully about the plan of additional drilling”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Whilst it does not expressly state that the obligations placed on CML by the terms of the 15 July 2011 Letter were the same as those placed on them as a reasonable and prudent operator, the inescapable conclusion is that it is implicit from the Tribunal’s reasoning that it did. Indeed, it would make no commercial sense to interpret the wording of the 15 July 2011 Letter as imposing a duty on CML to drill wells which no reasonably prudent operator would consider it was viable to drill, which is what CMJ’s submissions amount to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I therefore accept that the question of whether CML’s conduct constituted a breach of their obligations under, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the terms of the 15 July 2011 Letter had been raised before the Tribunal. I do not accept that there was a failure in the Award properly to address this issue and I therefore find that there was no breach of natural justice in the way in which the Tribunal approached this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ground 2: The PRC law issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 CMJ’s submission is a clear one. They adduced expert evidence in the form of the Ling Report as part of the Statement of Claim in April 2017 (see [9] above). CML did not adduce any PRC law evidence in their Defence which was served in October 2017 (see [9] above). There was therefore no need for CMJ to adduce any evidence on PRC law as part of their Reply evidence in March 2018. CML did however adduce the Liu Report as part of their Rejoinder evidence on 18 June 2018, a month before the JERs were due on 23 July 2018 (see [10] above). Accordingly, CMJ were denied the opportunity, of responding to CML’s PRC law evidence whilst preparing their Reply – a period of some five months following the service of the Defence. The conduct of CML thus put CMJ in a position of inequality and denied them the full opportunity of presenting their case as Art 18 of the Model Law mandates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 CMJ, quite reasonably and properly, did not seek an order that the Liu Report was not to be admitted in evidence. That would have amounted to a denial of CML’s right properly to present their case unless CML’s conduct was such as to warrant such a draconian order. Provided that the report could be admitted without prejudicing CMJ’s right to respond in an appropriate way, there would be equality, notwithstanding CML’s regrettable conduct in adducing the Liu Report late.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 CMJ however contends that the directions which the Tribunal did give denied them this opportunity.  CMJ says they sought to use the JER process to set out the areas of disagreement in relation to matters set out in the Liu Report, but this was opposed by CML and the Tribunal agreed with CML. Although the Tribunal allowed the additional 10 PRC law authorities to be adduced and granted CMJ the latitude to have an additional 1.5 hours over and above the 30 minutes for their experts (including Prof Ling) to make oral presentations during the evidentiary hearing (see [37]-[38] above), this did not give Prof Ling a proper opportunity to deal fully with the matters raised by Prof Liu and thus constituted a material breach of Art 18 of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For their part, CML make three points. First, that the procedure adopted by the Tribunal was fair and that it certainly did not constitute the sort of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Tribunal that would justify the intervention of the court on a setting aside application. Secondly, that the procedure adopted was procedure that CMJ <span class="font-italic">themselves </span>proposed and to which they made no complaint at that time. Third, that, in any event, CMJ have suffered no prejudice even if there was a breach of natural justice in the way in which the expert evidence was adduced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I have set out earlier the way in which this issue arose and the manner in which the Tribunal had directed that Prof Ling’s evidence should be adduced (see [23]-[41] above). The first point to note is that at no time did CMJ seek permission from the Tribunal to adduce a further written report from Prof Ling. It sought to achieve the same result by modifying the JER process so that the JERs contained, by way of an explanation of the areas of disagreement, additional material from Prof Ling to refute assertions made by Prof Liu. This course of action was rejected by the Tribunal, but it did allow the 10 additional PRC law authorities to be introduced by Prof Ling and, following repeated requests from CMJ, did accede to CMJ’s request for an extra 1.5 hours over and above the 30 minutes previously provided for their experts’ oral presentations. The Tribunal also gave CMJ an additional 4 hours to present their case and cross-examine CML’s witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In making these directions the Tribunal was implementing in the manner it deemed appropriate the procedure as set out at para 8.10 of PO2 (see [14] above) which specifically foresaw that there might be a need to receive oral testimony from a witness at the hearing to rebut evidence adduced in the Rejoinder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 When faced with late evidence, a court or tribunal is presented with the difficult task of balancing the potential unfairness to one party or the other in the way in which it permits the parties to respond and deal with that evidence, should it allow it to be adduced. It must bear in mind that “perfect justice” - by which I mean giving the party faced with dealing with the new evidence the opportunity that it otherwise would have had, had the new evidence been adduced on time - is seldom an option if the proposed hearing date is not to be lost. Adjourning a hearing, particularly in a case where there are numerous counsel and witnesses and there are three judges or arbitrators is a course which the overall interests of justice require should be avoided, if at all possible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 My instinct, on the facts of this case, would have been to give CMJ a brief period in which they could put in a further expert report from Prof Ling in response to the Liu Report and for the JER process for the PRC law issues to be delayed until after this had been done. But that is not what CMJ sought and the fact that I might have done things differently is not a relevant consideration (see <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>([51] above) at [65(c)]). The relevant question is whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was fair within the specific context of the particular facts and circumstances of this case. I have to ask myself whether what the Tribunal did falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done. In doing so I must accord a margin of deference to the Tribunal in matters of procedure (see [62] above; see also <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>([54] above) at [104(c)]-[104(d)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 On this basis, I conclude that the Tribunal did act in a way that was both fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this case. In so doing, I take into account the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it would have been unfair to deprive CML of the opportunity to adduce the Liu Report notwithstanding the fact that it could and should have been adduced as part of the Defence; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) PO2 anticipated that further evidence might have to be adduced to rebut matters that arose as part of the Rejoinder and that this was to be done by way of oral evidence at the hearing;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the 10 additional PRC law authorities were introduced, as requested by CMJ; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) CMJ were allocated an extra 1.5 hours for oral presentations by their experts and a total of four hours for presenting their case so as to be able to deal with issues that arose as part of the Rejoinder and that these issues were then canvassed fully in the written closing submissions; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the course adopted by the Tribunal was calculated to, and did, avoid the possibility of having to adjourn the evidentiary hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 CMJ contended that oral testimony was not as good as written testimony but, as Mr Bull SC pointed out at the hearing before me, in those 1.5 hours, Prof Ling could have read out a prepared statement encapsulating all the material that he would have included in a reply report. CMJ also contended that time was taken up during those 1.5 hours in translating Prof Ling’s evidence for Prof Liu’s benefit. However, CMJ would have been aware that this would be necessary when they sought and were granted the additional 1.5 hours. It was also suggested that the Tribunal rushed Prof Ling when he gave his oral evidence.

</div> He was not being treated unfairly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Taking all these matters together, I am satisfied that there was no breach of natural justice and that this ground of objection by CMJ must fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the light of this decision, I can deal with the other two contentions of CML briefly. Their second point was that the procedure adopted by the Tribunal was procedure that CMJ themselves proposed and to which they made no complaint at the material time. I do not consider that this is a fair assessment of the position. The initial course proposed by CMJ was rejected by the Tribunal and thereafter CMJ made various requests which, it is apparent from the correspondence, they considered represented the next best way forward if they were not to be allowed to proceed in the way which they thought would give them a proper opportunity to respond to the late evidence in the Rejoinder (see [35]-[37] above). It was a course proposed under protest, not by desire. This aspect of CMJ’s conduct is unlike that of an aggrieved party who had conducted itself before the tribunal on the footing that it remained content to proceed with the arbitration, but only to complain after the fact when it realised that an award has been made against it (see <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>([54] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [168] and [170]). Had I concluded that there was a breach of natural justice, I would not have denied CMJ relief on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The third point was that, in any event, CMJ have suffered no prejudice even if there was a breach of natural justice in the way in which the expert evidence was adduced. There were two issues on which the PRC law experts disagreed. The first was as to whether the particular agency relationship between CMJ and CML constituted a “general” or “special” agency under PRC law.

</div> The latter was not challenged before me. I therefore accept that, even if the Tribunal acted in breach of natural justice by denying Prof Ling a proper opportunity to present the arguments on this issue, CMJ would have suffered no prejudice, since ultimately it was irrelevant to the outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 So far as concerns the unpaid/uncompensated agent issue, again, the Tribunal decided it in CML’s favour and concluded that in order for CML to be liable as an uncompensated agent, CMJ would have to prove that there had been a breach of duties which amounted to wilful misconduct or gross negligence (see paras 295-304 of the Award).

</div> Briefly put, it held that almost all of the alleged breaches arose out of CML’s actions as co-seller rather than as agent and that, in so far as they did not, CMJ had failed to establish the factual basis of these allegations, far less that these were a result of CML’s wilful misconduct or gross negligence. Accordingly, I accept that, even if there was a breach of natural justice in relation to the unpaid/uncompensated agent issue, such that the finding that CML were an unpaid agent might be reviewed, this finding would only have become relevant if the Tribunal determined that CML had acted in wilful misconduct or gross negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Tribunal’s conclusion, however, was not premised on a finding that CML had acted in wilful misconduct. It found in favour of CML on the underlying facts. Since the issue of wilful misconduct or gross negligence did not arise, the outcome would have been the same irrespective of whether the Tribunal determined the unpaid/uncompensated agent issue in CML’s favour. CMJ has therefore suffered no relevant prejudice on this issue either.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 For the reasons given, CMJ are not entitled to the declarations sought in the OS.
