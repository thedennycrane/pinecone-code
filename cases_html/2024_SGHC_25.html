SPPG is a member of the SP Group that provides energy utility services in Singapore. The Accused was tasked with supervising the electrical works relating to the decommissioning of a substation. During those electrical works, one Mr Asogan s/o Suparamaniam (the “Deceased”) was electrocuted while decommissioning an electrical cable (the “Incident Cable”), which resulted in his death. The Accused was charged with doing a negligent act at work (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>by allowing the Deceased and a few other workers to carry out electrical works unsupervised on the de-energised Incident Cable without ensuring that the Incident Cable remained de-energised). The Prosecution’s case was that the Accused’s negligence resulted in the death of the Deceased and endangered the safety of the other workers who were in close proximity to the Deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the court below, the Prosecution argued that the Accused had tested the Incident Cable to confirm that it was de-energised before allowing the workers, including the Deceased, to start work. The workers thus commenced work, with the Deceased first testing the Incident Cable with a colleague to confirm that the Incident Cable was in fact de-energised. The Deceased then handled the Incident Cable with his bare hands. While the Deceased was handling the Incident Cable, the Incident Cable became re-energised and this resulted in the Deceased’s electrocution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In contrast, the Accused claimed that he had expressly told the workers <span class="font-italic">not</span> to start work as the Incident Cable was still “live” and that he was going to de-energise the Incident Cable. However, this was ignored by the workers, including the Deceased, who commenced work on the Incident Cable. According to the Accused, the Incident Cable had not been de-energised when the Deceased first handled it. Before the Accused could de-energise the cable, the Deceased had proceeded to pull the ends of the Incident Cable and this led to his electrocution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Following the trial, the District Judge (the “DJ”) acquitted the Accused of the charge under s 15(3A) of the WSHA (the “Charge”). In acquitting the Accused, the DJ found that the Prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Incident Cable was de-energised in the first place. Further, the DJ found that it was doubtful that the Accused had given the workers the go-ahead to commence work on the Incident Cable. Ultimately, the DJ preferred the Accused’s evidence over the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses, finding that the Accused’s version of events was corroborated by one Mr Mohamed Fharouk bin Mohamed Salleh (“Fharouk”). Fharouk was an SPPG employee who assisted the Accused at the material time, and who was summoned to give evidence in the court below on the court’s motion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Prosecution was dissatisfied and appealed against the DJ’s decision to acquit the Accused. Having considered the parties’ submissions on appeal, I agreed with the Prosecution that the DJ had erred in acquitting the Accused of the Charge. Accordingly, I allowed the Prosecution’s appeal and convicted the Accused of the Charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The parties were then asked to submit on the appropriate sentence. The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of ten to 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate. The Accused submitted that a sentence not exceeding eight months’ imprisonment was appropriate. Having considered parties’ submissions, I imposed a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment on the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I now set out the detailed reasons for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the incident</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The incident occurred in or around a substation at Kranji No 5 (the “Substation”), which was in the process of being decommissioned by Jurong Town Corporation at the material time. For the purposes of these proceedings, the Substation was a ‘workplace’ as defined under s 5(1) of the WSHA. The Substation was managed by SP PowerAssets Ltd (“SPPA”).

Therefore, the Prosecution suggested that even if the Accused’s version of events was to be preferred, he ought to be convicted on an amended charge for allowing the Deceased and the other workers to carry out electrical works on the Incident Cable without supervision.

</div> The workers’ evidence suggested that the Accused had confirmed that the Incident Cable was de-energised before the Deceased commenced work on it. If the Accused did so, then it would have been unnecessary for the Deceased to use a test lamp or for Malek to perform a “flick test” to verify that the Incident Cable was de-energised. The fact that these tests were performed and that the Deceased did not take proper care in wearing protective gloves – a vital safety measure – suggests that they were eager to proceed with the works despite not receiving any instruction to do so. Further, the ‘flick test’ used by Malek was a highly unreliable method for verifying if a current was passing through a cable.

</div> The DJ found that the EMA Report was inconclusive on whether the Incident Cable was initially de-energised and subsequently re-energised. On that footing, the DJ felt that it was not open to the Prosecution to rely on the EMA Report to advance its case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I found that the DJ erred in this regard because he had failed to appreciate that the Prosecution’s case was not based solely – or even primarily – on the EMA Report.

The Deceased’s unfortunate electrocution made it patently clear that the decommissioning of the Incident Cable was an inherently high-risk activity. With such high-risk activities, it was perfectly sensible for the Workers to want to satisfy themselves that the Incident Cable was de-energised before commencing work (rather than simply taking the Accused’s word for it).

</div> However, the DJ placed minimal weight on this aspect of Dineshkumar’s evidence on the basis that: (a) it was uncorroborated; and (b) it did not show whether or how the Incident Cable was re-energised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I disagreed with the DJ for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The fact that Dineshkumar’s account was uncorroborated was, in all likelihood, because he was the only one who ran towards the Substation to notify the Accused at the Substation of the electrocution. It followed that Dineshkumar would have been the only individual close enough to the Substation to notice someone stick his head out momentarily. Dineshkumar’s evidence on this point could not, therefore, be disregarded simply because it was uncorroborated.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Based on the totality of the evidence which I considered at [51]–[75] above, I found that the Incident Cable was de-energised when the Deceased commenced work. It followed that, for the Deceased to have been electrocuted whilst working on the Incident Cable, the Incident Cable must have been re-energised <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Deceased commenced work. In my view, this alone was sufficient for the court to conclude that the Incident Cable had in fact<span class="font-italic"> </span>been re-energised.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Dineshkumar’s evidence thus shed some light on <span class="font-italic">how </span>the Incident Cable could have been re-energised. For the Incident Cable to have been re-energised, someone had to insert the fuse into the terminal unit of the LV Board in the Substation. Only the Accused or Fharouk could have done so because they were the only persons who could have been in the Substation at the material time. The fact that Dineshkumar saw someone stick his head out of the Substation shortly after the Deceased had been electrocuted lent credibility to the hypothesis that the Accused and Fharouk <span class="font-italic">were</span> in the Substation at the material time, and that it was one of them who inserted the fuse into the terminal unit of the LV Board after the Deceased commenced work on the Incident Cable. It was important to remember, however, that the Prosecution was under no burden to prove exactly when and how the Incident Cable was re-energised (for the same reasons set out at [42]–[47] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ultimately, the Prosecution only needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Incident Cable had, in fact, been re-energised after the Deceased commenced work on it. In my view, there was ample evidence to conclude that the Prosecution had discharged this burden. By allowing the Workers to commence work on a de-energised Incident Cable which subsequently became re-energised, the Accused had failed to ensure that the Incident Cable remained de-energised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Given that the Prosecution had proven all the elements of the Charge, I was of the view that the DJ had erred in acquitting the Accused of the Charge.

</div> Furthermore, there was high potential harm to other persons, given the risk of death or serious injury by electrocution to the other workers present at the material time. The likelihood of this potential harm was high as the Accused had failed to check if any of the Workers were wearing safety gear. Furthermore, the Accused had also failed to ensure that the Incident Cable was de-energised before allowing the Workers to commence work.

First, the Accused failed to supervise the electrical works. Second, he failed to take precautions and to ensure that the Incident Cable remained de-energised during the electrical works. Finally, he failed to ensure that the Workers wore insulated gloves and fire-retardant clothing before starting work.

</div> In terms of culpability, the Accused argued that his culpability ought to be pegged at the moderate level. The Accused maintained that he had informed the Workers not to start work until he had de-energised the Incident Cable. Furthermore, the Accused stated that he did not instruct the Deceased to carry out any work on the Incident Cable, and much less did he give such instructions without first ensuring that the Deceased had donned the requisite safety gear.

This was clearly against the weight of the evidence, as I explained at [78]–[84] above.
