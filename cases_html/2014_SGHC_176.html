<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action was the second of two actions
                    brought by Ho Soo Fong (“HSF”) – either in his own name or
                    in the name of Ho Pak Kim Realty Co Pte Ltd (“HPK”) –
                    against the defendant, the Government of the Republic of Singapore (“the
                    Government”), to recover damages for certain judicial acts and orders
                    made. In Suit No [X] (“the First Action”), HSF’s action was
                    to recover damages for judicial acts or orders made in relation to ancillary
                    matters concerning the dissolution of the marriage between HSF and his former
                    spouse. In the present action, HSF commenced proceedings on behalf of HPK, of
                    which HSF was the Managing Director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appeal in the present action was made by HPK
                    against the decision of a Senior Assistant Registrar (“the SAR”),
                    who allowed an application by way of Summons No 445 of 2014 for the Statement of
                    Claim (“the SOC”) and the action against the Government to be
                    struck out and dismissed respectively. After hearing arguments, I dismissed the
                    appeal. I was in agreement with the SAR that the claim against the Government
                    did not contain a reasonable cause of action. HPK has since filed an appeal
                    against my decision. I now state the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">HPK’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the present action brought by HPK, damages in
                    the sum of $4,797,631.27, interest, and costs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> were claimed for a number of
                    orders made by judges and judicial officers. These orders were made pursuant to
                    court proceedings commenced as a result of construction disputes between HPK and
                    Revitech Pte Ltd (“Revitech”). HPK was the main contractor
                    employed by Revitech to construct a block of apartments with basement car park
                    and a swimming pool at No 89 Kovan Road, Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    It was HPK’s case that the decisions on the disputes in Suit No 36 of 2006
                    and Civil Appeal No 74 of 2010 were “bias[ed]” and
                        “unfair”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       For background information, the following
                    judicial acts and orders formed the subject of the present action:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Ho Pak Kim Realty
                            Co Pte Ltd v Revitech Pte Ltd</em> [2007] SGHC 194: This was the
                        first tranche of Suit No 36 of 2006. The High Court was asked to determine
                        whether certain documents formed part of the building contract between the
                        parties. The court’s finding would impact the determination of the
                        scope of the works contracted for. Justice Lai Siu Chiu ruled in favour of
                        Revitech on 13 November 2007. HPK filed an appeal (Civil Appeal No 149
                        of 2007) but did not file the Record of Appeal in time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The appeal was hence deemed to have
                        been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Ho Pak Kim Realty Co Pte Ltd v Revitech Pte
                            Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 106: This was the second tranche of Suit No
                        36 of 2006. HPK proceeded on its substantive claims for (i) outstanding
                        progress payments certified by the architect; (ii) under-valuation of works
                        carried out; and (iii) damages for wrongful termination of the contract.
                        Revitech counterclaimed for liquidated damages for delay in the construction
                        works and cost of rectification of defective works. Lai J delivered judgment
                        on 8 April 2010, granting final judgment to HPK in the sums of $771,630.97
                        and $10,023.49. Its claim for undervalued works and wrongful termination of
                        the contract were dismissed. Lai J granted final judgment to Revitech in the
                        sum of $414,000 for liquidated damages for HPK’s delay. Lai J also
                        granted several other reliefs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Civil Appeal No 74 of 2010: The Court of Appeal dismissed
                        HPK’s appeal against Lai J’s decision in <em>Ho
                            Pak Kim Realty Co Pte Ltd v Revitech Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 106.
                        A minor variation (underlined below) was made to Lai J’s order for
                        interlocutory judgment at [135(f)(ii)]:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The defendant was awarded interlocutory judgment against the plaintiff
                            for defective construction <del>of but not
                                </del><u>limited to</u> (1) the roof

            <em>Ho Pak Kim Realty Co Pte Ltd v Revitech Pte Ltd</em> [2013] SGHC
                        41: This was a cross-appeal by both HPK and Revitech against an Assistant
                        Registrar’s assessment of damages for part of the interlocutory
                        judgment ordered against HPK. Lai J delivered the judgment on 19 February
                        2013. Revitech’s appeal was allowed while HPK’s appeal was
                        dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_e"></a>(e)     Suit
                        No 36 of 2006 (Assessment of Damages No 60 of 2013): This was the second
                        tranche of an assessment of damages hearing in which Assistant Registrar
                        James Elisha Lee (“AR Lee”) was asked to determine
                        Revitech’s cost of rectifying HPK’s defective construction. HPK
                        did not participate in the proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> On 29 October 2013, AR Lee awarded damages
                        of $1,473,828.48 to Revitech.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       HPK’s dissatisfaction with the above
                    orders culminated in the present action. HPK sued the Government for the above
                    judicial orders made. It was alleged that Lai J “intentionally acted
                    unfairly” and “bull[ied]” HPK.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He also claimed that the three
                    judges of the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 74 of 2010 had erred when they
                    “supported [Lai J]’s decision”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> As for AR Lee’s
                    order in Assessment of Damages No 60 of 2013, HPK claimed that it was
                    “totally not correct”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Government’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">HPK was not represented by a solicitor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Government advanced two arguments. First,
                    the writ of summons should be set aside under O 12 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) and that this suit be
                    dismissed on the ground that the writ was in breach of O 5 r 6(2) of the
                        ROC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The argument was that O 5 r 6(2)
                    requires HPK to be represented by a solicitor when beginning or carrying on
                    proceedings in the Supreme Court. HSF is not a solicitor.
                    O 5 r 6(2) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  Subject to Order 1, Rule 9(2) and any other
                        written law, and except in accordance with any practice directions for the
                        time being issued by the Registrar, a body corporate may not begin or carry
                        on any proceedings in Court otherwise than by a solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As can be seen, O 5 r 6(2) expressly
                    states that the provision is qualified by O 1 r 9(2), which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  For the purposes of section 34(1)(<em>ea</em>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161) and
                        paragraph (1), the Court may, on an application by a company or a
                        limited liability partnership, give leave for an officer of the company or
                        limited liability partnership to act on behalf of the company or limited
                        liability partnership in any relevant matter or proceeding to which the
                        company or limited liability partnership is a party, if the Court is
                        satisfied that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) the officer has been duly authorised by
                        the company or limited liability partnership to act on behalf of the company
                        or limited liability partnership in that matter or proceeding; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) it is appropriate to give such leave in
                        the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Although O 1 r 9(2) of the ROC allows
                    the court to grant leave for an officer of the company to represent it in the
                    proceedings, the Government argued that the provision applied only to
                    proceedings commenced in the Subordinate Courts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    This was because, until 1 May 2014, the phrase “relevant matter or
                    proceeding” found in O 1 r 9(2) was defined in O 1
                    r 9(5) to mean “any matter or proceeding in a District Court or a
                    Magistrate’s Court” and the word “Court” found in
                    O 1 r 9(2) was defined in O 1 r 9(6) to mean “a
                    District Court or a Magistrate’s Court”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Recently, amendments were made to O 1
                    rr 9(5) and (6) of the ROC such that O 1 r 9(2) was extended to
                    cover proceedings commenced in the Supreme Court. These amendments came into
                    operation on 1 May 2014. Although the present action was commenced (on
                    3 January 2014) before the amendments came into effect, it would
                    nevertheless be covered by the amendments. This is because O 1 r 9(5)
                    expressly provides that the amendments apply to proceedings commenced before
                    1 May 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lack of substantive merits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Alternatively, the Government argued for the
                    SOC to be struck out under O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC. It argued that the
                    SOC:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     disclosed no reasonable cause of
                        action under O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                        ROC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     was
                        scandalous, frivolous or vexatious under O 18 r 19(1)(<em>b</em>) of the ROC; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     amounted to an abuse of process under O 18
                            r 19(1)(<em>d</em>) of the
                ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     To this end, the Government relied on the same
                    legal arguments advanced in the First Action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> A
                    summary of those arguments can be found at [7]–[8] of the grounds of
                    decision for the First Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Even though HPK had not made an application
                    for HSF to represent it, pursuant to O 1 r 9(2) (in the light of the
                    recent amendment to the ROC referred to above at [9]), I did not require such an
                    application to be made as it was quite clear to me that the present action had
                    no substantive merit. HPK would have incurred additional costs to make such an
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The remaining issue before this court was
                    whether there was a reasonable cause of action against the Government for the
                    judicial acts and orders set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for striking out the SOC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For the reasons I have stated in my Grounds of
                    Decision for the First Action, I concluded that no reasonable cause of action
                    was disclosed in the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Furthermore, AR Lee is also protected under
                    s 79(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed),
                    which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Protection of Registrar and other
                            officers</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79.—(1) The Registrar, the Deputy Registrar or an Assistant
                        Registrar or other person acting judicially shall not be liable to be sued
                        in any court exercising civil jurisdiction for any act done by him in the
                        discharge of his judicial duty whether or not within the limits of his
                        jurisdiction, provided that he at the time in good faith believed himself to
                        have jurisdiction to do or order the act complained of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After hearing submissions on costs, I ordered
                    HPK to pay $500, inclusive of disbursements, forthwith to the Government for the
                    appeal in the present action as there was another appeal by HSF in the First
                    Action with similar arguments.</p>
