Mistakes can therefore prove costly. There are two important technical documents involved in registering a patent: ‘claims’ and ‘specifications’. The former defines the scope of protection afforded by a patent. As for the latter, it is said that a patent “lives or dies” by its specification – if the description of the invention in the specification is not disclosed in a manner which is “clear and complete for the invention to be performed by the person skilled in the art”, the specification is said to lack enabling disclosure which may result in the patent being revoked: Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore</span>”) at [29.4.14], see also Robert Burrell and Catherine Kelly, “Parliamentary Rewards and the Evolution of the Patent System” (2015) 74(3) Cambridge Law Journal 423 at pp 426–427 for a brief history of patent specifications. Consequently, any error in these documents would affect the scope of protection afforded by a patent, and whether a patent can be registered in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 That said, the law recognises that patent agents, who are usually responsible for drafting these documents, are liable to make mistakes: see David Vaver, “Clerical Errors in the Patent Office” (2011) Intellectual Property Journal 131 at pp 132–133. Section 107 of the Patents Act 1994 (Rev Ed 2020) (“the Patents Act”) states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Registrar may, subject to any provision of the rules, correct any error of translation or transcription, clerical error or mistake in any specification of a patent or application for a patent or any document filed in connection with a patent or such an application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the case before me, the Applicant appealed against the decision of the Registrar of Patents (the “Registrar”) refusing a proposed correction to the specification of the patent application filed in Singapore. The main issue I had to deal with in this dispute was whether the Applicant’s proposed correction should be allowed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Applicant in the present case is a company incorporated in Japan.

In proceedings before the Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks of IPOS (the “PAR”), the plaintiff applied for leave to amend its statement of grounds (“SOG”) which had been submitted as part of its application to invalidate and revoke the trade mark. Because amendments were sought after pleadings were deemed closed, the PAR directed the plaintiff to seek the Registered Proprietor’s consent. When said consent was not forthcoming, the PAR directed parties to file written submissions on the proposed amendments. A week before parties were due to file the written submissions, the plaintiff filed a revised version of the proposed amendments in which they sought to include an additional ground of revocation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 After considering parties’ written submissions, the PAR dismissed the application for leave to amend the SOG. The plaintiff subsequently sought leave to apply for a quashing order against the PAR’s decision and for a mandatory order directing the PAR to allow amendments to the SOG on grounds that the PAR’s decision suffered from illegality and irrationality.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 As the plaintiff had initially brought the application for judicial review against the AG instead of IPOS, the issue as to who the proper party to the application for judicial review arose. At the first pre-trial conference before the Assistant Registrar, the AG objected to being named as a party to the judicial review proceedings, and argued that the proper party to be sued was IPOS as: a) the relief the plaintiff sought could only be performed by IPOS, and b) IPOS was a statutory board and a separate legal entity from the Government (<span class="font-italic">Axis </span>at [12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 After the first pre-trial conference, the AG wrote to the plaintiff, asking them to explain their position and invited them to amend the originating summons. No reply was forthcoming, but at the second pre-trial conference, the plaintiff explained (<span class="font-italic">Axis </span>at [14]) that it named the AG as a party pursuant to <br/>s 19(3) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed) (“GPA”) which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Civil proceedings against the Government shall be instituted against the appropriate authorised Government department, or, if none of the authorised Government departments is appropriate or the person instituting the proceedings has any reasonable doubt whether any and if so which of those departments is appropriate, against the Attorney-General. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The AG, however, took the view that s 19(3) of the GPA did not apply as IPOS was not a government department within the meaning of s 19(3) (<span class="font-italic">Axis </span>at [17]). Rather, IPOS, being a body corporate established under the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore Act (Cap 140, 2002 Rev Ed), was capable of suing and being sued in its own name. Further, being a statutory board, IPOS was legally separate from the Government in identity and representation. The AG also took the view (<span class="font-italic">Axis </span>at [18]) that the requirement to serve applications for leave on the AG under O 53 r 1(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) did not make the AG a party to all judicial review proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 After considering the various arguments canvassed by parties, Tay Yong Kwang J, as he then was, held (<span class="font-italic">Axis </span>at [20]) that IPOS was the proper defendant to the proceedings because it was a statutory board capable of suing and being sued in its own name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 It is clear from the <span class="font-italic">Axis </span>case, that neither party in that case considered whether the Registrar of Trade Marks should have been a party to the proceedings. The main contention between the parties focused on whether it was the AG, or IPOS, who should be a proper party to the suit. This was because the plaintiff in that case had originally brought judicial review proceedings against the AG, and not IPOS. As far as I can tell, neither party in <span class="font-italic">Axis</span> made submissions on whether it was the Registrar of Trade Marks or IPOS who should have been the proper party to the judicial review proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I therefore respectfully decline to follow the holding in <span class="font-italic">Axis</span>. It is the Registrar, and not IPOS which is the proper party to the present proceedings. This is made clear by the following statutory provisions. First, <br/>s 106 of the Patents Act draws a distinction between IPOS and the Registrar:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Immunity of Office, its officers and Examiners</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">106.  The Office, any officer of the Registry and any Examiner shall not —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) be taken to warrant the validity of any patent granted under this Act or any treaty to which Singapore is a party;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) incur any liability by reason of or in connection with any examination or investigation required or authorised by this Act or any such treaty or any report or other proceedings consequent on any such examination or investigation; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) incur any liability by reason of an incorrect entry in the register of patent agents or the register of foreign patent agents maintained under Part 19.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Section 2(1) of the Patents Act defines the “Office” to mean the IPOS whereas s 4 states that the Registrar is an officer of the Registry. It is therefore clear from s 106 that the Act envisions that legal proceedings may be brought against either the IPOS or the Registrar, as distinct entities, in the exercise of their respective powers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 This distinction between the IPOS and the Registrar is similarly reflected in ss 34(2) and 34(3) of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore Act 2001 (“IPOS Act”) which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings conducted by officers of Office</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Despite any written law, <span class="font-weight-bold">a legal officer of the Office</span> who has been admitted as an advocate and solicitor under the Legal Profession Act 1966 may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  (a) appear in any civil proceedings <span class="font-weight-bold">involving the Office or any Registrar</span> in the performance of the legal officer’s functions or duties under any written law; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  (b) make and do all acts and applications in respect of such proceedings on behalf of the Office or any Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  For the purposes of this section, <span class="font-weight-bold">“Registrar”</span> means the <span class="font-weight-bold">Registrar of Designs</span> referred to in section 49 of the Registered Designs Act 2000, the <span class="font-weight-bold">Registrar of Geographical Indications</span> referred to in section 17 of the Geographical Indications Act 2014, the <span class="font-weight-bold">Registrar of Patents</span> referred to in section 4 of the Patents Act 1994, the <span class="font-weight-bold">Registrar of Trade Marks</span> referred to in section 62 of the Trade Marks Act 1998, or the principal officer administering the system for the protection of any other intellectual property under any other written law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Under s 2 of the IPOS Act, “Office” is defined to mean IPOS. As defined in s 34(3), “Registrar” refers to either the Registrar of Designs, the Registrar of Geographical Indications, the Registrar of Patents or the Registrar of Trade Marks. Therefore, references in s 34(2) of the IPOS Act to “proceedings involving the Office or any Registrar” clearly shows, as the respondent rightly points out,

Under s 107 (reproduced above at [2]), the Registrar has the power to correct errors in patent applications.

The Registrar provided reasons for his decision which the Applicant now appeal against. They say the Registrar erred, and the correction should be allowed. Therefore, it follows that the Registrar who made the decision in the exercise of his powers under the Patents Act, should be the proper party to the present appeal.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As a final point, s 91(2) of the Patents Act states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">General powers of court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… (2)  In all proceedings before the court under this Act, the <span class="font-weight-bold">costs of the Registrar </span>are in the discretion of the court, <span class="font-weight-bold">but the Registrar is not to be ordered </span>to pay the costs of any other of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 This provision clearly envisions that the Registrar may be made party to proceedings and provides the appropriate costs order for such an event.

In particular, Section 84 states that an amendment cannot add subject matter or in the case of a patent, extend the protection conferred. The limitations of Section 84 apply only to amendments under sections 31, 38(1), 81 and 83. In contrast <span class="font-weight-bold">Section 107 has no such restriction, and </span><span class="font-weight-bold">as a consequence a correction can potentially result in the specification disclosing new matter or extending the scope of protection of a patent</span> (Rock Shing Industrial Ltd v Braun AG BL O/138/94). Furthermore, <span class="font-weight-bold">once the correction is made the document is considered to have always been in the state in which it is after correction.</span> In theory this can change the scope of the granted patent and make something an infringement that was not an infringement prior to the correction, but this is tempered by the requirement that it must be immediately evident that nothing else would have been intended than what is offered as the correction. Thus a skilled person reading the document would immediately ascertain that there was an error and understand what was intended. In effect there would be no new disclosure provided the error is truly obvious. <span class="font-weight-bold">Nevertheless, the implications of such corrections necessitate a stringent consideration of whether they are obvious</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Applicant, being the one seeking the exercise of the Registrar’s powers to make the correction, bears the burden of proof to show that the correction is justified: <span class="font-italic">Lonza </span>at [1]–[2] citing Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013) at [12.007].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 What then is the applicable test in deciding whether the correction should be made?

</div> In that case, the appellants had filed a request for the grant of a European patent for a ‘heating method in textile machines’, claiming priority of 29 August 1988 from Swiss patent application No. CH-03 204/88-4 under the Convention on the Grant of European Patents (5th Ed, 1989) (“the EPC”). The drawings, however, did not correspond with the description of the invention, but corresponded instead, with the drawings in the priority document. The appellants requested a correction under Rule 88 of the Implementing Regulations to the Convention on the Grant of European Patents (European Patent Convention) (5th Ed, 1989) (“the EPC Regulations”) whereby the description, claims and abstract as filed would be replaced with a text identical to that in the priority document. In allowing the appeal, the German Technical Board of Appeal was of the view (<span class="font-italic">Rieter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]) that it was immediately evident that nothing else would have been intended than what was offered as the correction. The appellants had obviously wished to file a patent application in keeping with Swiss patent application No. 03 204/88-4 whose priority was claimed, and this could be deduced from the request for the grant of a European patent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, the editor’s note to the case, which is an English translation of the official German text, states that: the reasoning in this decision was likely to be examined in the pending case of <span class="font-italic">AIOTECH Deutschland GmbH</span> G 2/95 (“<span class="font-italic">Aiotech</span>”) as the following point of law had been referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The question was: “Can the complete documents forming the description claims and drawings be replaced by way of a correction under Rule 88 EPC by other documents which the applicant intended to file with his request for grant?”. This question was referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal due to the divergence of opinions in <span class="font-italic">Rieter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and the decision in J 21/85 (OJ EPO 1986, 117), which was the subject of the appeal in <span class="font-italic">Aiotech</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Enlarged Board of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Aiotech</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>answered the question in the negative – the complete documents forming a European patent application (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the description, claims and drawings) could not be replaced by way of a correction under Rule 88 EPC Regulations by other documents which the applicant intended to file with his request for grant. The Enlarged Board of Appeal reasoned that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The interpretation of Rule 88, second sentence, EPC must therefore be in accord with Article 123(2) EPC. This means that a correction under Rule 88 EPC is thus bound by Article 123(2) EPC (point 1 above), in so far as it relates to the content of the European patent application as filed (G 3/89, loc. cit.; Reasons, 1.3). Such a correction may therefore be made only within the limits of what a skilled person would derive directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge and seen objectively and relative to the date of filing, from the whole of the documents forming the content of the European patent application (G 3/89, loc. cit.; Reasons, 3). The content of the European patent application is formed by the parts of the application which determine the disclosure of the invention, namely the description, claims and drawings (G 3/89, loc. cit.; Reasons, 1.4). <span class="font-weight-bold">As a result of the prohibition of extension under Article 123(2) EPC, documents other than the description, claims and drawings may only be used in so far as they are sufficient for proving the common general knowledge on the date of filing</span> (G 3/89, loc. cit.; Reasons, 7). <span class="font-weight-bold">On the other hand, documents not meeting this condition may not be used for a correction even if they were filed together with the European patent application</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">These include, inter alia, priority documents, the abstract and the like </span>(G 3/89, loc. cit.; Reasons, 7). Since infringement of the prohibition of extension under Article 123(2) EPC is a ground for both opposition (Article 100(c) EPC) and revocation (Article 138(1)(c) EPC), this interpretation of Rule 88, second sentence, EPC goes some way to ensuring the legal validity of a granted European patent (G 3/89, loc. cit.; Reasons,1.6).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Article 123(2) EPC provides that the European Patent Application or European Patent may not be amended in such a way that it contains subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed. The Enlarged Board of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Aiotech</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>therefore made it clear that any documents, such as priority documents, which did not meet the requirement imposed by Art 123(2) EPC, could not be used for corrections made pursuant to Rule 88 EPC Regulations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It is therefore clear from the aforementioned authorities that where the correction request involves the replacement of the entire specification, no reference can be made to the priority document to show that it was immediately obvious that nothing else would have been intended than what was filed as the correction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Respondent, however, recognised that the present case did not involve the replacement of the entire specification. They argued that the principle drawn from cases such as <span class="font-italic">Berg</span>, that a discrepancy between the specification of an application and that of its priority application does not mean that it is immediately evident that the intention was for the former to correspond to the latter, is equally applicable to requests for correction of a part of the specification.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I disagree. In my view, where the proposed correction does not involve the replacement of the entire specification, reference can be made to the priority documents in determining whether nothing else other than the proposed correction was intended. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Caisse</span><span class="font-italic"> Palette Diffusion/Correction of drawings </span>[1991] EPOR 521 (“<span class="font-italic">Caisse</span>”), the appellant filed with the European Patent Office, a European patent application which included seven drawings. Three drawings, however, were missing from the application as filed, but was referred to in the application and contained in a copy of the priority document. As the appellant’s request for correction of the application under Rule 88 EPC Regulations by filing the missing drawings was rejected by the Receiving Section, the case went before the French Legal Board of Appeal. There, the Board, in allowing the appeal, noted (<span class="font-italic">Caisse</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [6]–[7]) that while the description filed expressly mentioned Figures 8 – 10, there was no corresponding drawing, and this could only be due to error which was confirmed by the copy of the priority document which showed the drawing containing the missing figures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Tragen’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Application </span>BL O/096/90 (“<span class="font-italic">Tragen</span>”), the Principal Examiner held that, in principle, if an error was present in a specification, it could be corrected by reference to the priority document. There was, however, a high evidentiary burden placed on the applicant to show that nothing else other than the proposed correction would have been intended. In particular, one had to consider the nature of the omission and the relationship of the two documents to each other. The Principal Examiner refused the application for correction because, upon comparing the specification with that of the priority document, the differences between both documents were “the result of a conscious act of judgment by the drafter rather than the result of an error”. In light of this, and in the absence of any other evidence, the Principal Examiner opined that it could only be assumed that the words used by the drafter of the present application accurately reflected his intentions, and that the priority document did not afford any guidance at all as to the intentions of the drafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In ascertaining whether it was immediately obvious to the skilled observer that nothing else apart from the proposed corrections to Table 7 would have been intended, I therefore consider the nature of the error and the relationship between the Subject Application and the priority application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Here, the nature of the error in the present case is slightly different from cases such as <span class="font-italic">Dukhovskoi</span>. In that case, the specifications of a patent application in Russian were translated into English. These specifications concerned a rubber surface wetted under vacuum with “carbon tetrafluoride”. The translator, relying on one dictionary, translated the relevant Russian word as “carbon tetrafluoride”. The correct translation, however, according to another reputable dictionary, should have been “fluorocarbon”. This was because wetting the rubber surface with carbon tetrafluoride was clearly impossible given that it was a gas with a boiling point of -128 degrees Celsius. The applicants made a request to correct this error of translation by replacing the words “carbon tetrafluoride”, which was used in the specification, with “fluorocarbon”, and sought to justify this correction by reference to the mistranslated document which was not identical with the priority document, which had not previously been available to the Patent Office. The Principal Examiner, who was acting for the Comptroller, refused to make the correction, and parties appealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Whitford J, who heard the appeal, took the view that the correction ought to be allowed, subject to the Comptroller being able to satisfy themselves that in truth, “the word in the Russian original from which the English translation of the specification of the application was made can only be sensibly translated in the sense now claimed”: <span class="font-italic">Dukhovskoi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 16.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In contrast, the error in the Subject Application relates to data that is included in the specification. Here, the patent specification first describes the invention – subsequently, it goes on to describe the invention in more detail by making reference to various chemical compounds.

</div> After listing these various compounds, and the manner in which they are prepared, the specification then provides, in the form of tables, instrumental analytical data such as mass spectrometric and elemental analytical data.

</div> The error is found in Table 7 which contains this instrumental analytical data. This, to my mind, is a critical difference. The concern in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Dukhovskoi</span>, where the error was in the substantive content of the specification, rather than data that was included in the specification, was that it may not be immediately obvious to a skilled observer that the proposed correction was what was initially intended. After all, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Tragen</span>, any differences between the priority application and the present specification may be the result of a conscious act of judgment by the drafter rather than the result of an error. Where the difference relates to data included in the specification itself, in my view, it is more likely to be the result of an error, rather than a conscious act of judgment by the drafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Because the error in this case related to data that was presented in the specification, I was satisfied that it would have been immediately obvious to the skilled observer, looking at the priority document, that nothing else other than the proposed correction could have been intended. The error in Table 7 was quite clearly, the result of the wrong set of data having been copied over.
