Katong Hostel was incorporated on 1 July 2003 and in December 2003, it started the first student hostel at 369 Tanjong Katong Road. The hostel business proved profitable and Sim expanded the business. The management of each hostel was placed under a separate company. Pearl Hill Hostel was incorporated on 25 May 2004 and Hill Lodge on 9 January 2006. In 2007, Sim expanded the business to the management of serviced apartments and incorporated Global Residence which started its serviced apartments business with rented apartments at Tiong Bahru.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Winsta Holding was incorporated on 27 February 2008 and became the holding company.  On 13 March 2008, Queensway Hostel was incorporated as another subsidiary of Winsta Holding. In 2009, Winsta Holding acquired Carlisle Hostel.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In January 2010, M Development bought 51% of the issued share capital of Winsta Holding from a number of shareholders including Sim and Joyce. M Development completed its acquisition of the shares on 23 August 2010. The vendors represented that the consolidated net profit after tax of Winsta Holding and its subsidiaries for the period from 1 July 2008 to 31 December 2010 would not be less than $4,000,000 (“the Profit Warranty”). Sim was invited but declined to join the Board of M Development. Lynn was appointed to the Board of M Development; the date of her appointment is unclear but it appears she had become a director of M Development by 8 September 2010.

</div> In my view, Lynn’s explanation is not credible. Dave Kong himself was an employee of OSPC and under the MSA, OSPC was required to achieve a high occupancy rate and optimise revenues for Global Residence’s properties. Yet, Dave Kong apparently saw no conflict in his ownership in ATAS. Joyce could not explain the transfer of shares to Lynn’s mother-in-law save to say that she had done so on Lynn’s instructions.

I agree with the plaintiffs that the fact that the target clientele may have been those with higher budgets was no reason why the opportunity could not have been directed to Global Residence or, if it was necessary for branding and market segmentation reasons, to set up a new Winsta Group entity for that purpose. I find that the Scotts Square opportunity was directed to ATAS instead of Global Residence only because that was what Lynn and Joyce wanted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It is also clear that ATAS’ business was in competition with Global Residence. Both were in the serviced apartment business. Lynn’s and Joyce’s interests in ATAS put them in a position of conflict with respect to Winsta Holding and Global Residence. Both Lynn and Joyce breached the no-conflict rule when they</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) directed the Scotts Square opportunity to ATAS; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) procured ATAS to compete with Global Residence,</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">without the informed consent of the Board of Winsta Holding. The reasons given as to why the Scotts Square opportunity was not directed to Global Residence are also irrelevant, even if true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In my view, the Scotts Square opportunity was received by Lynn and Joyce in their capacities as Global Residence’s directors. As stated earlier, Lynn decided that Global Residence was not in a position to take up the opportunity. I note also that the landlord of the units at Scotts Square had initially expressed a preference for Global Residence to be the lessee or a shareholder of the lessee.

An IPT gives rise to an actual conflict of interests because the interested director stands on both sides of the transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It is not disputed that the only disclosure made to the Board of Winsta Holding was the fact that Joyce would be appointed to the Board of Uni-House and even then this was pursuant to the terms of the tenancy agreement with Uni-House. Lynn and Joyce did not disclose their interests in Uni-House to Winsta Holding and Hill Lodge. Lynn and Joyce also did not disclose their interests in Unihouse @ Evans to Winsta Holding and Evan Hostel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Lynn and Joyce therefore breached the no-conflict rule.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Claims in respect of JMJ Hotpot</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 JMJ Hotpot was incorporated on 7 April 2014.

Joyce admitted that the transfer of shares to Dave Kong was to enable JMJ Hotpot to apply for work permits.

First, as discussed above, their defence that ICS Catering was part of plans for Winsta Holding was clearly untrue. Winsta Holding was not even told of the setting up of ICS Catering.

</div> That may be so. However, the Winsta Group did not have to continue engaging I-Masters’ services if its rates ceased to be below market.

I agree with the plaintiffs that Lynn and Joyce would not have unilaterally taken steps which would hurt Sim’s interests in the Winsta Group as a shareholder and the Managing Director. Further, Sim, Lynn and Joyce were guarantors for the Liberty bonds (see [34] above). Any steps that may hurt the Winsta Group’s businesses and the ability to pay the rentals to SLA, could result in the Liberty bonds being called upon by SLA and consequently in the guarantees being called upon. It is just unbelievable that given these circumstances, Lynn and Joyce would have acted without Sim’s knowledge and approval.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The claim that Lynn and Joyce made decisions for Global Residence to forgo business opportunities at Illuminaire and Scotts Square, without consulting Sim, does not sit well with Lynn’s evidence that decisions on new businesses, properties, and leases would have to discussed and cleared by Sim.

</div> It would appear that this was a mistake by the plaintiffs, due at least in part to the fact that ATAS was first incorporated as OSPC Pte Ltd (see [10(b)] above). The plaintiffs would have learnt of this mistake when Dave Kong stated in his AEIC that Illuminaire was managed by OSPC. Dave Kong’s AEIC was affirmed on 22 November 2017. On 5 December 2017, Dave Kong applied to amend his defence to plead that Illuminaire was managed by OSPC; his amended defence (amendment no. 3) was filed on 13 December 2017.

No objections were raised by Dave Kong when he was cross-examined on the diversion of the Illuminaire opportunity to OSPC. In my view, the plaintiffs ought to be permitted to pursue their claim based on diversion of the Illuminaire opportunity to OSPC. The mistake in the plaintiffs’ statement of claim did not result in any prejudice to Dave Kong, or indeed, to any of the other defendants. Dave Kong knew what the issues relating to Illuminaire were and he addressed them in his AEIC.

The controversy on this issue started with the Privy Council’s decision in the Canadian case of <span class="font-italic">Brickenden v London Loan &amp; Savings Co of Canada </span>[1934] 3 DLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span> stands for the proposition that but-for causation is not essential for liability for breach of fiduciary duty. Although couched in terms of liability, the effect of that proposition is that in the context of equitable compensation, it is not necessary to show a causal link between the breach and the loss claimed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns (a firm)</span> [1996] 1 AC 421 (<span class="font-italic">“Target Holdings</span>”), the House of Lords held that the plaintiff finance company had not sustained any compensable loss because it had obtained precisely what it would have acquired had no breach of trust occurred. In other words, the House of Lords held that but-for causation was essential for liability. As Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed (at 439): “Equitable compensation for breach of trust is designed … to make good a loss in fact suffered by the beneficiaries and which, using hindsight and common sense, can be seen to have been caused by the breach.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings </span>was followed by much academic discussion. Suffice it to say that <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>has been described as a “perplexing authority”: Tan Ruo Yu, “Causation in Equitable Compensation: The <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span> Rule in Singapore” (2014) 26 SAcLJ 724 at para 25. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 More recently, the UK Supreme Court reviewed this issue in <span class="font-italic">AIB Group (UK) </span><span class="font-italic">plc v Mark Redler &amp; Co Solicitors </span>[2014] 3 WLR 1367 (“<span class="font-italic">AIB</span>”) and applied <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings</span>. The UK Supreme Court made it clear that in a claim for breach of trust, the trustee is required to make good the breach either by restoring the trust fund (if still in existence) or by paying monetary compensation (if the trust were no longer subsisting) so that the beneficiary is restored to the position he would have been but for the trustee’s breach. The UK Supreme Court also held that the measure of compensation was to be assessed at the date of the trial, with the benefit of hindsight and on a common sense view of causation so as to establish that the losses had in fact been caused by the breach, but that foreseeability of loss was irrelevant. Lord Reed explained the causation requirement as follows (at [135]): “… the loss must be caused by the breach of trust, in the sense that it must flow directly from it.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">AIB </span>explained that the rules applicable to the measurement of loss resulting from a breach of duty depends on the nature of the obligation breached (see [76] and [92]). Foreseeability was held to be irrelevant in assessing the compensation to be paid for breach of fiduciary duty because a breach of fiduciary duty was a wrong in itself, regardless of whether a loss could be foreseen (at [86]). In contrast, foreseeability is relevant in assessing loss resulting from a negligent act because the tort of negligence involves the duty to take reasonable care to guard against a reasonably foreseeable risk (at [92]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 In Singapore, <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>was followed by the High Court in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing and others </span>[2013] 3 SLR 631 (“<span class="font-italic">QAM</span>”) and in <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other suits </span>[2014] 1 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon</span>”). The learned Judge (who presided over both cases) reconciled <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>and <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings </span>by limiting <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>(but-for causation not required) to cases involving fiduciaries in one of the well-established categories of fiduciaries and culpable breaches of core duties of honesty and fidelity, and leaving <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings</span> (but-for causation required) to cases involving fiduciaries in one of the well-established categories of fiduciaries and innocent breaches (see <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon</span>  at [108]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon</span> went on appeal.<span class="font-italic"> </span>However, the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to decide this particular issue on the facts although it did note that this area of the law must now be considered in the light of the decision in <span class="font-italic">AIB</span> – see, <span class="font-italic">Maryani Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other appeals</span> [2015] 1 SLR 496 at [9] and [11].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The issue came up again in <span class="font-italic">Beyonics </span><span class="font-italic">Technology Ltd and another v Goh Chan Peng and others</span> [2016] 4 SLR 472 (“<span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span>, the High Court adopted the propositions in <span class="font-italic">QAM </span>and <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon </span>(at [137]). The learned Judge explained <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span>, <span class="font-italic">QAM</span> and <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon </span>as follows (at [136]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">QAM </span>clarified the burden-shifting function of the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span> decision, <span class="font-italic">i.e. </span>once the principal adduces some evidence to connect the breach to the loss, the evidential burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove that “but for” his breach, the loss would still have occurred; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) bearing in mind this burden-shifting function of the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span> rule, <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon </span>should not be understood as dispensing with the need for “but for” causation altogether.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There was an appeal to the Court of Appeal. However, the issue of causation in claims for equitable compensation was not one of the issues before the Court of Appeal.<span class="font-underline"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>should not be followed in Singapore. I respectfully agree with the decision in <span class="font-italic">AIB</span>. Equitable compensation for breach of trust aims to provide the pecuniary equivalent of performance of the trust (see <span class="font-italic">AIB</span> at [93]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>It should not matter whether a fiduciary belongs to a well-established category of fiduciaries or not, or whether the breach is of a core duty or is innocent. <span class="font-italic"> </span>If there is a breach of fiduciary duty, as a matter of principle, the beneficiary should be compensated for loss suffered as a result of that breach and no more. Justice demands that the law does not punish the wrongdoer by making him liable for loss not causally linked to his breach. As Lord Toulson put it in <span class="font-italic">AIB </span>(at [64]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where there has been a breach of [the trustee’s] duty, the basic purpose of any remedy will be either to put the beneficiary in the same position as if the breach had not occurred or to vest in the beneficiary any profit which the trustee may have made by reason of the breach … Placing the beneficiary in the same position as he would have been in but for the breach may involve restoring the value of something lost by the breach or making good financial damage caused by the breach. But a monetary award which reflected neither loss caused nor profit gained by the wrongdoer would be penal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In my view, there is also no reason in principle why the evidential burden on causation should shift to the fiduciary on the mere ground that the principal proves that the breach “is in some way connected” to the loss. If (as I have decided) the principal has to prove but-for causation, the legal burden of proof remains squarely on the principal to prove that his loss is causally linked to the fiduciary’s breach of duties.

</div> The rental for the new lease was $402,000 per month which was a very huge increase compared to the previous monthly rental of $80,000. Lynn pointed out that the next highest bid for the premises was $401,000 per month; this showed that Katong Hostel’s bid at $402,000 per month was necessary if Winsta Holding wanted to retain its lease. Lynn explained that the decision to bid to renew the lease was because Katong Hostel was the Winsta Group’s flagship. It was the biggest hostel in Singapore at the time, well located near schools and institutions and there was a ready supply of students staying at the hostel.

</div> It seems to me that that opinion went beyond the scope of his expertise as a forensic accountant. Besides, the rate to bid for the renewal of the lease at Tanjong Katong was a business decision which has been explained (see [214] above). As Lynn pointed out, the next highest bid was at $401,000 per month. Further, there is no alleged wrongdoing in respect of the decision to bid for the lease at $402,000 per month</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 In my judgment, the evidence clearly shows that there was no causal link between the defendants’ wrongdoings and either the expected shortfall of $11.2m or the general financial situation that the Winsta Subsidiaries were in in 2015. As set out earlier in this judgment, the defendants’ wrongdoings relate to the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the diversion of the Illuminaire opportunity to OSPC and consequently, OSPC’s business in competition with Global Residence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the diversion of the Scotts Square opportunity to ATAS and consequently, ATAS’ business in competition with Global Residence; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the IPTs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the tenancy agreements) between Uni-House and Hill Lodge and between Unihouse @ Evans and Evan Hostel;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the misuse of Winsta Group’s resources to provide support and administrative services to JMJ Hotpot;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the diversion of the 2014 summer camp opportunity to Devonshire;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the IPTs between ICS Catering and the Winsta Group; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) the IPTs between I-Masters and the Winsta Group.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 It cannot be said that but for the above wrongdoings, there would not have been a projected shortfall of $11.2m or that the Winsta Subsidiaries would not have been in the financial situation that they were in. The reasons for the expected shortfall of $11.2m or the Winsta Subsidiaries’ general financial situation had nothing to do with the defendants’ wrongdoings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The evidence strongly suggests that M Development did not want to inject more funds into the Winsta Group and saw the defendants’ misconduct as an opportunity for it to exit its investment in Winsta Holding profitably. There can be no denying that the defendants have misconducted themselves and that their wrongdoings must have caused the plaintiffs loss which the plaintiffs are completely entitled to recover. However, the plaintiffs have to prove their loss. The plaintiffs have not proved that the decisions to liquidate the Winsta Subsidiaries were causally linked to the defendants’ wrongdoings. Any post-liquidation loss of profits suffered by the Winsta Subsidiaries was the result of the decisions in August 2015 to liquidate them. Since the reasons for those decisions were not causally linked to the defendants’ wrongdoings, it follows that the defendants cannot be held liable for any loss of profits post-liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Pre-liquidation loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 The defendants remain liable to compensate the plaintiffs for pre-liquidation loss suffered by the Winsta Subsidiaries provided that such loss can be shown to be causally linked to the defendants’ wrongdoings. However, the plaintiffs still bear the burden of proving what that loss is and how the loss is causally linked to the defendants’ wrongdoings.

</div> However, for purposes of calculating Global Residence’s average “but for” profit before tax (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the profit before tax after adjusting for the effects of any wrongdoing), the Expert chose to use the figures for 2012 and 2013 (which were positive) and ignored the figures for 2014 and 2015 (which were negative).

</div>
</div> The average “but for” profit before tax figure was relevant to the Expert’s computation of post-liquidation loss. The Expert’s reasons for doing so were that (i) Global Residence started leasing private apartments only in 2012 and (ii) in 2014, three out of eight of Global Residence properties would have closed.

</div> These reasons are not in the least persuasive. There was no reason for the Expert to ignore the loss figures in 2014 and 2015; they reflected the actual difficulties that Global Residence was facing in its business and these difficulties had nothing to do with the alleged wrongdoings.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Expert assumed that Katong Hostel would have renewed its lease at 369 Tanjong Katong for two years upon its expiry in December 2015.

</div> The Expert took the view that the contractual rental was unreasonable and that his reduced rental was in line with the average increase in rental based on SLA historical tender results. As I stated earlier, the Expert’s opinion on the reasonableness or otherwise of the contracted rental was outside the scope of his expertise. More importantly, there was absolutely no justification whatsoever for the Expert to ignore the fact that the rental of $402,000 had been agreed between SLA and Katong Hostel and to impose his own view of what the rental should have been!    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Expert’s assessment under Scenario 2 assumed that the Winsta Group would have been able to achieve the same financial performance it achieved in 2010 (when M Development acquired its 51% shareholding in Winsta Holding) and that that level of profit before tax could have continued into the future in perpetuity.
