</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is common ground between the Applicant and the Respondents in OSP 4 that there is no local authority which addresses specifically the issue of whether a beneficiary of a trust has any right to disclosure of communications between the trustee and other beneficiaries. In its submissions, the Applicant has placed heavy reliance on the English case of <span class="font-italic">Rosewood</span>. It is critical, however, to understand the principles that the Privy Council (“PC”) in <span class="font-italic">Rosewood</span> actually established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">Rosewood</span>, having reviewed previous cases in which it had been held or suggested that a beneficiary’s right or claim to disclosure of trust documents should be regarded as being founded on a proprietary right (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span> the judgment of Salmon LJ in <span class="font-italic">Londonderry’s Settlement </span>[937), the PC disagreed with this line of reasoning. Lord Walker, in delivering the judgment of the PC, stated that the PC was in general agreement with the approach adopted in the judgments of Kirby P and Sheller JA in the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in <span class="font-italic">Hartigan</span>. Both these judges, while disagreeing on the outcome of the appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hartigan</span>, were agreed in their rejection of the “proprietary right” approach. Kirby P affirmed the views expressed by Professor H A J Ford in <span class="font-italic">Principles of the Law </span><span class="font-italic">of Trusts </span>(Law Book Co, 1990) at p 425 that a beneficiary’s right to inspect trust documents was founded “not upon any equitable proprietary right which he or she may have in respect of those documents but upon the trustee’s fiduciary duty to keep the beneficiary informed and to render accounts. It is the extent of that duty that is in issue”. Sheller JA similarly opined that there were difficulties in applying the proprietary analysis as a basis for a beneficiary’s right to inspect documents and that this line of logic was “if not a false, an unhelpful trail”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">Rosewood</span>, the PC held that the more principled and correct approach would be to regard the right to seek disclosure of trust documents as one aspect of the court’s inherent jurisdiction to supervise, and if necessary, to intervene in the administration of trusts. The right to seek the court’s intervention does not depend on entitlement to a fixed and transmissible beneficial interest. Indeed, the PC was of the view that it was neither sufficient nor necessary for an applicant to have a proprietary right, as there might be circumstances (especially of confidentiality) in which even a vested and transmissible beneficial interest would not be a sufficient basis for requiring disclosure of trust documents. Lord Walker noted that the courts had begun to work out in some detail the way in which the court should exercise its discretion in such cases. In his words (at [54]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are three such areas in which the court may have to form a discretionary judgment: whether a discretionary object (or some other beneficiary with only a remote or wholly defeasible interest) should be granted relief at all; <span class="font-italic">what classes of documents should be disclosed, either completely or in a redacted form</span>; and what safeguards should be imposed (whether by undertakings to the court, arrangements for professional inspection, or otherwise) to limit the use which may be made of documents or information disclosed under the order of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In its concluding remarks (at [66]-[67]), the PC also made it clear that “<span class="font-italic">no beneficiary…has any entitlement as of right to disclosure of anything which can plausibly be described as a trust document</span>. Especially where there are issues as to personal or commercial confidentiality, the court may have to balance the competing interests of different beneficiaries, the trustees themselves, and third parties” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Based on the PC’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Rosewood</span>, the starting point in the present case is that the Applicant has no entitlement as of right to disclosure of communications between Providentia and the 2nd to 7th Respondents. It is for the Applicant to satisfy this court that there is basis for the court to intervene and to exercise its discretion in this case to order disclosure of these communications, both past and future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In this connection, it is regrettable that despite purporting to rely on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Rosewood</span>, the Applicant’s affidavit evidence and the submissions made on his behalf have not addressed with any specificity the interests which should be considered in the balancing exercise to be carried out by the court, beyond reproducing the relevant paragraph in <span class="font-italic">Erceg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>noted at [22] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In any event, having reviewed the affidavit evidence and parties’ submissions, I am of the view that the Applicant has not satisfied me of the merits of his application for disclosure of both past and future unilateral correspondence between Providentia and the 2nd to the 7th Respondents. My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 First, the disclosure specifically of communications between a trustee and a beneficiary involves unique considerations compared to disclosure of trust documents at large. These considerations would tend to militate against disclosure. One consideration is that communications from beneficiaries, particularly the sort divulged by beneficiaries in unilateral communications, may involve sensitive or confidential information. Such considerations are highly relevant in assessing the propriety of disclosure (<span class="font-italic">Rosewood </span>at [67]). Another consideration is the need to promote transparency between beneficiaries and trustees/administrators. In this regard, I accept Providentia’s arguments that there are likely to be various situations where separate discussions with each (or either) party would be appropriate or necessary.

</div>
</div> For example, if Providentia needs to clarify information which relates to the Applicant’s mishandling of his prior administration of the Estate, it will be conducive to frank disclosure by the beneficiaries if Providentia were able to consult the Applicant and the 2nd to 7th Respondents separately for their input on this issue, without being compelled to report each side’s communications to each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Another relevant consideration is the need to avoid placing onerous obligations on the trustee or administrator that will impede his ability to administer the trust or estate. Here, the obvious ongoing acrimony between the parties already makes the administrator’s job difficult. This should not be exacerbated by the imposition of additional obligations on an administrator that are likely to increase the prospects of confrontation and satellite litigation. In this connection, I give significant weight to Providentia’s own assessment as administrator that copying all beneficiaries and their solicitors on <span class="font-italic">every single piece of correspondence</span> will likely hinder the timely administration of the Estate.

</div> I add that given the bitter hostility with which the two sides regard each other, it is improbable that joint meetings or discussions will be a feasible means of eliminating confrontation and dispute.

He has failed to provide any basis for suggesting that there have been communications made unilaterally in bad faith or that there is impropriety involved; instead, he has offered only vague conjecture and insinuation. In particular, I note that he sought to suggest that there were “serious questions as to whether and to what extent the unilateral communications between [Providentia] and the [2nd to 7th Respondents] influenced the [2nd to 7th Respondents’] choice of [Providentia] as the professional third-party administrator (for example, as they believed that [Providentia] would administer the Mustafa Estate in a manner that would be more favourable to them)”, and whether “if these unilateral communications were disclosed”, this court “would still have appointed [Providentia] as the administrator of the Mustafa Estate”.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It should be pointed out that Providentia was not in fact the only nomination put forward by the 2nd to 7th Respondents: they had put forward a second nomination for this court’s consideration, just as the Applicant himself had put forward two different nominations. Logic and common sense dictate that prior to putting forward these nominations, each side would have communicated with the professional firms in question in order to inform them of the potential scope of work and to obtain necessary information such as the rates quoted by these firms, the CVs of the relevant personnel, among other things. It is absurd to imagine that either side would have been able to put forward their respective nominations without first communicating with the professional firms in question. There was no complaint at all from the Applicant prior to my decision on 14 January 2022 or thereafter about not having been privy to any communications between Providentia and the 2nd to 7th Respondents which led to the former being put forward as one of the latter’s two nominations. There is not a shred of evidence before me to suggest that there was anything in the communications between Providentia and the 2nd to 7th Respondents which led the latter to believe that Providentia “would administer the Mustafa Estate in a manner that would be more favourable to them”. I consider the Applicant’s baseless insinuations to be misleading, and indeed, malicious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The threadbare nature of the Applicant’s case and his reliance on unfounded speculation are made even more apparent by his conduct in resorting to casting aspersions on the parties’ solicitors. Much of the noise made by the Applicant relates to communications which did not involve any staff of Providentia and/or any of the 2nd to 7th Respondents personally – such as the telephone call on 8 August 2022 between lawyers from TSMP, D&amp;T, and DSC.

The Applicant seeks to imply that what was discussed in such communications was “<span class="font-italic">not at all innocuous</span>”.

</div> This necessarily involves calling into question the professionalism and integrity of the lawyers from the three different law firms present when in truth, the Applicant has no evidence at all to support such serious allegations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Third, Providentia has made disclosure of the broad contents of past communications (see [17] and [18] above). These do not in any way hint at, much less reveal, any impropriety. They are the very sort of communications that would be needed in order for an administrator of an estate to carry out their work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Fourth, while the Applicant has alleged that he will be prejudiced if he is not given access to all <span class="font-italic">future</span> communications between Providentia and the 2nd to 7th Respondents, he has failed to demonstrate what precisely this prejudice may be. Indeed, as noted by Providentia, there have been unilateral communications between the Applicant himself and Providentia regarding information and supporting documents. No concerns were raised by the Applicant as to the non-inclusion of the 2nd to 7th Respondents in such communications, nor has the Applicant been transparent about such unilateral communications. The Applicant cannot legitimately claim, therefore, that there is some sort of prejudice which arises <span class="font-italic">generally</span> from non-disclosure of unilateral communications. Neither has he been able to substantiate any <span class="font-italic">specific</span> prejudice that he will uniquely face as a result of non-disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I make a further comment on the Applicant’s case in respect of the ban he seeks on future unilateral communications. In their oral submissions, counsel for the Applicant stated that they were seeking this court’s directions on the “extent of unilateral communications allowed”. Counsel also indicated that the Applicant was in fact open to being subject to any restrictions or prohibitions which the 2nd to 7th Respondents might be subject to. However, this belated suggestion was wholly at odds with the wording of the relevant prayer in OSP 4, which was couched as a <span class="font-italic">blanket</span> prohibition of unilateral communication, and which was stated to apply only to communications between Providentia and the 2nd to 7th Respondents – not the Applicant. I reproduce below the relevant prayer:
