<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff’s
                                        primary claims in this suit are that its four ex-employees
                                        (“the ex-employees”) had taken its confidential information
                                        and used it for the benefit of a rival company, which they
                                        subsequently joined. The plaintiff also had ancillary claims
                                        against the rival company and its owner as well as against
                                        an ex-contractor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s claims
                                        are for breach of confidence, conspiracy, breach of
                                        employment contract, breach of fiduciary duty, inducing
                                        breach of contract, dishonest assistance, knowing receipt,
                                        conversion and breach of supply agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The trial lasted 49
                                        days. For the reasons given in this judgment, I allow, in
                                        part, the claims for breach of confidence, conspiracy,
                                        breach of employment contract, breach of fiduciary duty and
                                        conversion against the four ex-employees and the rival
                                        company and its owner. I dismiss the rest of the claims. The
                                        detailed orders are set out in [330]–[333] and [344]–[345]
                                        below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is
                                        Clearlab SG Pte Ltd (“Clearlab”). It is a company engaged in
                                        the manufacture and sale of contact lens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first four
                                        defendants are the ex-employees. The first defendant is Ting
                                        Chong Chai (“Ting”), the former Head of Engineering and
                                        Technology Development at Clearlab. Whilst working at
                                        Clearlab, Ting oversaw the manufacturing process and the
                                        research and development (“R&amp;D”) projects related to the
                                        manufacturing process. The second defendant is Rathinaraj
                                        David (“David”), previously an R&amp;D engineer in
                                        Clearlab’s engineering department. David’s work at Clearlab
                                        included preparing lens formulations and developing new lens
                                        material. The third defendant is Goh Wee Hong (“Goh”). He
                                        was an assistant manager of the R&amp;D department charged
                                        with designing inserts and directing the cutting of those
                                        inserts. Additionally, he is Ting’s nephew. The fourth
                                        defendant is Ng Chee Han (“Ng”), a former senior optical
                                        tooling technician in the Insert Manufacturing department.
                                        His work at Clearlab mainly comprised the cutting of inserts
                                        using a computer numerical control machine known as Optoform
                                        80. In this capacity, he worked with Goh to produce the
                                        inserts designed by Goh. David, Goh and Ng were Ting’s
                                        subordinates in Clearlab and they reported to
                                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The fifth defendant,
                                        Aquilus Lens International Pte Ltd (“Aquilus”), is the
                                        company that the ex-employees joined after they left
                                        Clearlab. It was incorporated on 7 July 2010 by the ninth
                                        defendant, Ho Kar Kit (“Ho”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Ho is also the owner
                                        of the sixth defendant, Central Global Pte Ltd (formerly
                                        known as Cencorp Engineering Pte Ltd) (“Central Global”).
                                        Central Global’s main business is in fitting out factories.
                                        It had undertaken 49 remodelling and repair projects for
                                        Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The seventh and eighth
                                        defendants are a married couple, Ma Zhi (“Ma”) and Li Yuexin
                                        (“Li”). They have a partnership called OSC Automation
                                        Engineering (“OSC”), through which they undertake
                                        engineering projects. Ma is in charge of the technical
                                        aspect of the partnership whereas Li is in charge of the
                                        business aspect. From 2009 to 2010, OSC serviced Clearlab
                                        for various engineering matters. In 2011, Li registered a
                                        sole proprietorship, Optic Automation Engineering (“Optic”).
                                        Ma and Li undertook work for Aquilus through Optic instead
                                        of OSC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       For the purposes of
                                        this suit, there are essentially two groups of defendants.
                                        The first is directly associated with Aquilus, <em>ie</em>, the first six defendants and
                                        the ninth defendant. In parts of this judgment, I have
                                        referred to them as “the defendants”. The second comprises
                                        Ma and Li, and reference to “the defendants” would not
                                        include them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Key events leading up to the
                                dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As this dispute
                                        revolves around very extensive and detailed facts, it is
                                        useful to first set out the key events in a chronological
                                        order. Thereafter, as I analyse each cause of action, the
                                        relevant facts which bear on the issues will be repeated for
                                        convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The background facts
                                        are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Clearlab was
                                        incorporated on 24 May 2007 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
                                        Mi Gwang Contact Lens Co Ltd (“Mi Gwang”). Dr Park Jong-Gu
                                        (“Dr Park”) was appointed as its chairman, and his wife,
                                        Park Hae Kyeung (“Mrs Park”), was appointed as its managing
                                        director. Both Dr Park and Mrs Park are undisputedly the
                                        movers and shakers in Clearlab. On 25 May 2007, a sale and
                                        purchase agreement (“S&amp;P Agreement”) was entered into by
                                        Clearlab, Mi Gwang, 1-800 Contacts Inc and Clearlab
                                        International Pte Ltd in respect of the “Acquired Assets”.
                                        Briefly, the “Acquired Assets” are a manufacturing facility
                                        in Singapore, all the tangible property, fixed assets and
                                        inventory at the manufacturing facility, intellectual
                                        property relating to the products produced at the
                                        manufacturing facility, existing rights relating to supply
                                        and distribution, know-how related to the manufacturing
                                        process, capital stock of Clearlab Europe Ltd and capital
                                        stock of Shayna Ltd. Importantly, one of the intended
                                        outcomes of the S&amp;P Agreement was to obtain for Clearlab
                                        the right to use a spincast manufacturing technology to
                                        manufacture contact lens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the second half
                                        of 2008, the ex-employees joined Clearlab one after another.
                                        Ting joined first, on 1 July 2008. His nephew, Goh, joined
                                        Clearlab next on 4 August 2008. Then Ng joined on 28 October
                                        2008, and David joined on 3 December 2008. Prior to joining
                                        Clearlab, Ting, Goh and David had been working at another
                                        contact lens manufacturer, CIBA Vision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In 2010, three major
                                        events unfolded which set the stage for the ex-employees to
                                        leave Clearlab and join Aquilus. First, Aquilus came into
                                        existence. It was incorporated by Ho on 7 July 2010 with
                                        $200,000 as its start-up capital. Two weeks after its
                                        incorporation, on 28 July 2010, Ho made enquires with
                                        Clearlab about the possibility of Aquilus becoming a
                                        distributor of Clearlab’s products. This resulted in a
                                        meeting on 26 August 2010 between Ho and Mrs Park at
                                        Clearlab’s office on the very matter of distributorship, but
                                        the matter was not taken any further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Second, seeds of
                                        friction were sown by the various emails that Ting sent. His
                                        July 2010 emails claimed that Sim Kok Seng (“Simon”), who is
                                        the Head of Regulatory Affairs and Compliance, was hoarding
                                        Clearlab’s confidential documents, displayed “strange”
                                        behaviour, was “not a good team player”, and was perpetually
                                        late for work. Ting then insinuated that Simon “might be
                                        looking around for another job”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> On 23 July 2010,
                                        Ting complained to Dr Park and Mrs Park that “[t]oday’s
                                        Clearlab is becoming too bureaucratic and inefficient” and
                                        that other people in Clearlab “really insulting my presence
                                                [<em>sic</em>]” by instructing
                                        his engineers to do work without his knowledge. Ting gave an
                                        ultimatum to Dr Park and Mrs Park to “[pay] attention before
                                        myself and my team decide for another career [<em>sic</em>]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The unhappy emails
                                        continued all the way to March 2011, but it was clear by
                                        June 2010 that Ting’s relationship with his other colleagues
                                        was increasingly deteriorating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Third, Ho claimed to
                                        have steered Aquilus in a new business direction in October
                                                2010:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> he decided that
                                        Aquilus would undertake the manufacturing of contacts lens
                                        instead of distribution. Consistent with this decision, he
                                        took the following preparatory steps. In February 2011, Ho
                                        engaged Tay Ah Teck John from Synergy Solutions Associates
                                        to provide consultancy services on the ISO certifications
                                        that Aquilus would require. In March 2011, Ho started on the
                                        construction of a clean room, increased Aquilus’ capital to
                                        $700,000 and got Ting to attend meetings at Aquilus. On 31
                                        March 2011, Ho met Toh Boon Hou William (“Toh”) from
                                        TRAXonline Solutions LLP to discuss Aquilus’ mould base
                                        design.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     By the end of 2011,
                                        all the ex-employees had left Clearlab and joined Aquilus.
                                        It began with Ting, who was abruptly dismissed from Clearlab
                                        on 26 April 2011. Upon dismissal, Ting left Clearlab’s
                                        premises with his personal laptop which he was using for his
                                        work at Clearlab. Ting also attempted to leave with bags of
                                        documents and boxes but was stopped from doing
                                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 3 May 2011, Ting
                                        commenced full-time work in Aquilus. He was the only
                                        technical personnel at Aquilus at that time; David, Goh and
                                        Ng were still employed at Clearlab, but this was soon to
                                        change. Ting approached David, Goh and Ng individually to
                                        offer them employment at Aquilus. All of them accepted the
                                        offer. David signed his letter of offer on 9 May 2011, and
                                        Goh and Ng signed theirs on 10 May 2011. Within the same
                                        month, David, Ng and Goh tendered their resignations to
                                        Clearlab. Ng resigned on 25 May 2011 and left on 24 July
                                        2011, David resigned on 26 May 2011 and left on 25 July 2011
                                        and, lastly, Goh resigned on 30 May 2011 and left on 29 July
                                        2011. They did not disclose to Clearlab that they were
                                        leaving to join Aquilus. David said that he was going back
                                        to India to teach, whereas Goh and Ng said that they were
                                        joining an engineering company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Also in May 2011,
                                        certain steps were taken which would pave the way for
                                        Aquilus to obtain certifications. On 18 May 2011, Ting got
                                        himself engaged by TQCS International Pty Ltd (“TQCSI”), an
                                        audit firm. He signed a document entitled “Auditors &amp;
                                        Technical Specialists Confidentiality Agreement” (“TQCSI
                                        Confidentiality Agreement”), which provided undertakings of
                                        confidentiality from Ting with regard to any audit work that
                                        he may partake in. Shortly afterwards, on 26 May 2011, Looi
                                        Peck Eng (“Nancy Looi”), who was Aquilus’ manager, enquired
                                        TQCSI about the certification of Aquilus for four standards:
                                        ISO 13485:2003, ISO 14001:2004, ISO 9001:2008 and OHSAS
                                        18001:2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Aquilus formally
                                        applied to TQCSI for the certification of the aforementioned
                                        standards on 1 June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The workforce in
                                        Aquilus expanded when David, Goh and Ng started work at
                                        Aquilus on 1 August 2011. The capital of Aquilus was also
                                        expanded when Ho increased it to $1.8m. At the same time, Ho
                                        issued 360,000 shares (<em>ie</em>, 20%
                                        of the total number of shares in Aquilus) to Ting’s wife,
                                        Kerk Bong Chee, which she held as a nominee for Ting. That
                                        same month, some members of the staff of Clearlab spotted
                                        Ting and David at a seminar organised by the Health Sciences
                                        Authority of Singapore (“HSA”) and discovered that they were
                                        working for Aquilus. That discovery led Clearlab to
                                        investigate the computers used by the
                                ex-employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Meanwhile, unaware
                                        that Clearlab had formed suspicions about Aquilus, the
                                        defendants made progress with their goal of certifying
                                        Aquilus for the three ISOs and one OHSAS standards. In
                                        September 2011, TQCSI was invited to Aquilus’ premises to
                                        conduct an audit on Aquilus for the purpose of
                                        certification. Throughout the audit, which took place over a
                                        number of days, Ting was on record as TQCSI’s nominated
                                        technical specialist and as having accompanied the auditors
                                        from TQCSI to carry out the audit on Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 3 October 2011,
                                        Clearlab filed a writ of summons in this suit. The next day,
                                        on 4 October 2011, Clearlab applied, by way of <em>ex </em><em>parte</em> summons for a search order,
                                        against Ting, David and Aquilus, which it obtained on
                                        6 October 2011. The search order was executed over nine
                                        non-consecutive days, starting from 17 October
                                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the first day of
                                        the search, which is 17 October 2011, the plaintiff’s
                                        solicitors and the supervising solicitor entered Aquilus’
                                        premises. The search order was served on Nancy Looi, David,
                                        Aquilus and Ng. Although it was not served on Ho, the order
                                        was explained to him. By the afternoon, the first to sixth
                                        defendants’ solicitor, Clearlab’s IT forensic expert (Darren
                                        Cerasi (“Cerasi”)) and Clearlab’s representatives (Dr Park,
                                        Simon and Wong Yun Hui) arrived at Aquilus’ premises. The
                                        physical search of Aquilus’ premises then commenced. The
                                        search was first conducted of the laboratory area, where Dr
                                        Park took photographs of the chemicals found in the fridge
                                        and the contents of storage cabinets. A set of plastic casts
                                        found therein were also tagged. The search moved on to the
                                        cleanroom and photographs of the cleanroom were also taken.
                                        Next, the search was done on the electronic devices at
                                        Aquilus’ premises. In particular, during the preview of the
                                        hard disk of David’s computer, the flashdrive found at
                                        David’s work station and the hard disk of Ting’s computer,
                                        Clearlab’s documents surfaced. This led Cerasi to image the
                                        three devices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Concurrently, on the
                                        same day, a search was conducted of David’s home by a
                                        different team of solicitors. The search order was served on
                                        David’s sister-in-law, who was the owner of the apartment.
                                        As part of the search, the computers and laptop at the
                                        apartment were previewed. It was then discovered that the
                                        hard disk of a Dell Inspiron laptop contained a document
                                        bearing Clearlab’s letter and the hard disk of a HP Compaq
                                        computer contained files and folders which were deleted
                                        earlier in the day. Both hard disks were
                                imaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The following day,
                                        18 October 2011, the search of Aquilus’ premises and David’s
                                        home continued. At Aquilus’ premises, Ting and Goh were
                                        served with the search order. Thereafter, Cerasi resumed his
                                        search of the contents of the electronic devices at Aquilus.
                                        He found “SOP-ENG-02-01 Insert Manufacturing Inventory
                                        cvontol.docx” in Goh’s computer hard disk. He also found
                                        what Simon and one of the plaintiff’s solicitors believed to
                                        be Ting’s business card in Nancy Looi’s computer hard disk.
                                        Based on that, the two hard disks were imaged. Meanwhile, a
                                        second IT forensic expert (Pravin Pandey (“Pandey”)) who was
                                        brought onto Aquilus’ premises, extracted data from Ting’s
                                        Nokia phone and the Micro SD card contained within that
                                        phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At David’s home, a
                                        physical search of the apartment took place but it revealed
                                        nothing that was within the search parameters. With that,
                                        the search at David’s home ended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The search at
                                        Aquilus, however, carried on the next day, which is 19
                                        October 2011. Three plastics bags containing PET mould casts
                                        (“the PET casts”) were found in a room and placed in boxes,
                                        which were then sealed. In the afternoon, Pandey started the
                                        extraction of data from Goh’s Samsung phone, David’s Nokia
                                        phone and the SIM cards in each of their phones. Because Ho
                                        needed to leave Aquilus’ premises to attend to other
                                        matters, his phone was only visually inspected and the
                                        following features were noted down: there were two inbox
                                        messages, no outbox messages, two sent items, two missed
                                        calls, five received calls, five dialled numbers and more
                                        than a hundred contacts stored in Ho’s phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the fourth day,
                                        20 October 2011, Pandey previewed Ting’s Gmail and Yahoo
                                        accounts. A keyword search for “Clearlab” produced a number
                                        of hits in both accounts. After accessing certain emails
                                        from the accounts, it was decided that all emails in both
                                        accounts would be imaged. Elsewhere in Aquilus’ premises,
                                        Cerasi examined Aquilus’ server. A file name search on
                                        “Clearlab” disclosed three hits, which files appeared to be
                                        deleted or overwritten. 11 sub-folders were also opened. The
                                        first was “Tech file 1 day lens”, which contained a pdf file
                                        Simon identified to be Clearlab’s document. The other ten
                                        sub-folders were named “SOP”. All 69 files contained within
                                        these 11 sub-folders appeared to be deleted or overwritten
                                        as well. As such, Cerasi initiated the imaging of the server
                                        data.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The imaging process
                                        of the server was left running through 21 October 2011, the
                                        fifth day of the search, until 24 October 2011, the sixth
                                        day of the search. On 24 October 2011, due to the premature
                                        termination of the imaging process, it was restarted. It was
                                        restarted again on 25 October 2011, the seventh day of the
                                        search for the same reason. On 27 and 28 October 2011, the
                                        eighth and ninth days of the search, the imaging process
                                        hung at 99%, was restarted and terminated at 99%. The
                                        plaintiff settled for 99% of imaging and that essentially
                                        concluded the search at Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     After the execution
                                        of the search order, there were two other noteworthy events.
                                        The first was the successful certification of Aquilus for
                                        the three ISOs and one OHSAS standards by TQCSI on 3
                                        November 2011, and second was the departure of Ting and Goh
                                        from Aquilus in the midst of the trial, on 31 May
                                        2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ting’s misdemeanours</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before leaving the
                                        facts, I set out my findings on the egregious manner in
                                        which Ting had conducted himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Firstly, Ting had
                                        attended the meetings in Aquilus while he was employed at
                                        Clearlab. While he was helping Aquilus set up a competing
                                        business in this manner, Ting sent an email to Mrs Park on
                                        24 March 2011, complaining about Simon and stating that
                                        “Many people in the company including me are hoping our
                                        bosses can trust the right person”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Secondly, Ting
                                        helped assemble the core team (comprising himself, David,
                                        Goh and Ng) at Aquilus by poaching Clearlab’s
                                        employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Thirdly, he helped
                                        himself to Clearlab’s PET casts (even after being dismissed
                                        from Clearlab) by instructing Goh (who was still at
                                        Clearlab) to get those casts for Aquilus. Ting attempted to
                                        excuse his behaviour by claiming that the PET casts were to
                                        be discarded by Clearlab because the project had failed and
                                        that the PET casts were never used by Aquilus. None of these
                                        excuses have been corroborated by independent evidence. He
                                        did not satisfactorily explain how, even if the PET casts
                                        were to be discarded eventually, he was entitled to obtain
                                        them for Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Fourthly, he acted
                                        as technical specialist in TQCSI’s audit of Aquilus. The
                                        TQCSI Confidentiality Agreement that he signed on 18 May
                                        2011 not only provided undertakings of confidentiality, it
                                        also contained a term that Ting would ensure that he had not
                                        provided consultancy services to Aquilus in the preceding
                                        two years and did not have any personal interest in its
                                        affairs. It also required him to report to TQCSI any matter
                                        that may affect his role as technical specialist. These
                                        terms were blithely breached by Ting. Ting joined Aquilus on
                                        3 May 2011, two weeks before he signed the TQCSI
                                        Confidentiality Agreement. Ting was so totally not
                                        independent that his attempts to explain this conflict
                                        beggars belief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This was not the end
                                        of the charade. In the course of the audit process, Ting,
                                        aided by the other Aquilus employees, hid the fact that he
                                        was an employee of Aquilus from the audit team. Thus, when
                                        Cheng Ying Nung (“Cheng”), the lead auditor, introduced Ting
                                        to the Aquilus employees as a member of his audit team, he
                                        did not recall anything unusual in their response to make
                                        him realise that Ting had any connection with Aquilus.
                                        Further, Ting’s name did not appear in the organisation
                                        charts reviewed by the audit team. I find that “fraudulent”
                                        would not be too extreme a word to describe his
                                        participation in this audit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The key witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     A large number of
                                        witnesses have been called by the parties to give evidence.
                                        In total, there were 17 witnesses from Clearlab and 11
                                        witnesses from the nine defendants. The key witnesses of
                                        fact were the seven defendants who are natural persons:
                                        Ting, David, Goh, Ng, Ho, Ma and Li. Because the credibility
                                        of their accounts of what happened is crucial to my findings
                                        of fact, I will state my observations of their demeanour at
                                        the outset. I start with Ting and his evidence about the
                                        TQCSI audit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Under
                                        cross-examination, Ting denied that he was employed by TQCSI
                                        for the audit on the basis he did not receive any payment,
                                        despite the fact that the TQCSI Confidentiality Agreement
                                        stated that Ting was under the “employment” of TQCSI.
                                        Furthermore, Ting did not produce any evidence that TQCSI
                                        did not pay him, apart from his bare assertion. Ting also
                                        denied that there was a conflict of interest. In Ting’s
                                        opinion, his role as a technical specialist meant that he
                                        was there to benefit Aquilus (and presumably not for the
                                        purpose of TQCSI undertaking its role as auditor). This is
                                        despite the attendance sheets he signed which included his
                                        name under the category of “Other Auditor(s)”. Separately,
                                        he claimed that he did not participate in the audit because
                                        he only signed the attendance forms at end of the day, and
                                        implied that Cheng knew of it because he had given his
                                        Aquilus business card to Cheng when they met for the first
                                        time. But at another point in time, Ting said he was not
                                        involved in the audit because he only helped in the
                                        technical aspect of it. These were very audacious claims,
                                        made in the face of evidence totally inconsistent with what
                                        he earlier said.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This is not the sole
                                        instance of Ting’s demonstrated unreliability as a witness.
                                        There were three other instances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Firstly, in relation
                                        to Ting’s recruitment of Goh for Aquilus, Ting first stated
                                        that it was Goh who approached him after Ting’s dismissal on
                                        26 April 2011. According to Ting, Goh had problems working
                                        with Wong Sie Hung (“Wong”), the person who replaced Ting,
                                        because they had a falling out over a partnership they
                                        formed for a restaurant business. Ting also said that Goh
                                        told him that “when [Ting] was no longer in Clearlab [Goh]
                                        had to look for other job”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> But when
                                        Ting was subsequently asked about an Aquilus meeting of 11
                                        April 2011, he said that he proposed to have Goh join
                                        Aquilus by July because he knew Goh would come if he
                                        asked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Secondly, on the
                                        matter of Ho’s offer to join Aquilus, Ting said that he had
                                        not accepted the Aquilus job by 3 May 2011, and had in fact
                                        gone for interviews for other jobs. But in his affidavit of
                                        evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Ting said that he
                                        accepted Ho’s offer in early March 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Thirdly, with regard
                                        to the threat of his dismissal from Clearlab, Ting said in
                                        court that in October 2010, Mrs Park had told Simon that
                                        Ting would be dismissed very soon, and Simon had told this
                                        to Dr Yip Yuen Sing who then told Ting. But in his AEIC,
                                        Ting mentioned another period: February 2011. Ting said that
                                        he “found out that the MD [<em>ie</em>,
                                        Mrs Park] had been secretly talking to a few of my key
                                        subordinates to discuss about their ability to do without me
                                        in the company”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> When confronted with
                                        the inconsistencies, Ting explained that these were two
                                        different events. I found this explanation to be spurious;
                                        if there were two different events, then it is odd that the
                                        October 2010 event was not mentioned in Ting’s AEIC, whereas
                                        the February 2011 event, which revolved around the same
                                        topic of Ting’s threatened dismissal, was considered to be
                                        the spark for Ting’s acceptance of Ho’s offer to join
                                        Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Having considered
                                        what Ting said on the stand and the contents of his AEIC, as
                                        well as the other documents put to him, I concluded that
                                        Ting was an entirely unreliable witness. He was quick with
                                        glib explanations (which sometimes led to inconsistent
                                        answers) to many questions posed to him. A particularly
                                        difficult area for him was the evidence of his conspiracy
                                        with the other defendants to take Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information. Ting was unable to give a coherent explanation
                                        to the evidence of conspiracy; he made up explanations for
                                        each piece of evidence, which did not gel in totality.
                                        Generally, throughout his testimony, Ting did not hesitate
                                        to give any answer that came conveniently to mind to explain
                                        away any inconsistency in his evidence. The common fall-back
                                        positions he adopted were that the statements in the various
                                        affidavits he made were mistakes, or he had been confused
                                                (<em>eg</em>, about whether he
                                        carried one or two bags to dispose of in the early morning
                                        of 18 October 2011).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Ting had a tendency to
                                        willy-nilly shift his position as the situation demanded and
                                        I construed his evidence accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The second
                                        defendant, David, went on the stand after Ting. He seemed to
                                        be somewhat embroiled in inner turmoil. His answers were
                                        tentative and he tended to change tack slightly when
                                        questioned for detail. He also manifested discomfort, such
                                        as hesitation or was slightly choked when pressed by
                                        Clearlab’s counsel. On some issues, David had selective
                                        memory lapses, some of which were exposed when his testimony
                                        was contradicted by other evidence. For example, he had
                                        instructed Yeoh Jia Yan Sara (“Sara”), a sales and marketing
                                        executive at Aquilus to prepare standard operating
                                        procedures (“SOPs”) for Aquilus, which she admitted she
                                        “copy-typed” from Clearlab’s SOPs. On the stand, David
                                        explained that he did not know Sara was not technically
                                        trained and assumed she was and able to draft the SOPs. But
                                        in her AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, Sara clearly stated
                                        that she told David that she was “not qualified and … may
                                        have problems understanding the technical issues”. Further,
                                        David’s own email to Sara instructed her that she “needed to
                                        change for Aquilus”, and in one of her email replies, she
                                        stated that she had “removed all mentioned [<em>sic</em>] of Clearlab”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The
                                        short time taken by Sara in drafting Aquilus’ SOPs clearly
                                        supports Clearlab’s case that she had relied on the Clearlab
                                        SOPs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Another example of
                                        David’s prevarication was his explanation of an email sent
                                        by Ting to him which stated as follows: “Dear David, Do take
                                        pre-caution when you tender they might ask you to [<em>sic</em>] immediately so be
                                                prepare[d]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This was
                                        sent on 25 May 2011, a day before David tendered his
                                        resignation. David said that the email meant that Clearlab
                                        would ask David to stay on at Clearlab.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> But that is a
                                        strained interpretation of the words. It is far more likely
                                        that Ting thought that David would be asked to leave
                                        immediately as that was Ting’s experience at Clearlab. In
                                        the course of cross-examination on this point, David
                                        introduced the concepts of “not very confidential” to
                                        documents that he had removed from Clearlab which were
                                        marked as confidential. This was clearly a lame
                                        justification for his removal of those documents and he had
                                        to be taken to task on the lack of logic in his answer
                                        before he accepted that such documents were
                                        confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In other parts of
                                        his evidence, David made excuses for his behaviour which
                                        sounded thin. The two chief excuses he relied on for sending
                                        Clearlab’s documents to Ting and taking Clearlab’s documents
                                        were that: (a) he was, at the time, not thinking properly,
                                        and (b) the documents were taken for his own
                                        reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In view of the
                                        foregoing, I found David to be an unreliable witness and
                                        treated his testimony with much
                                circumspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The third defendant,
                                        Goh, appeared to be cooperative, but his answers about his
                                        work in designing inserts turned out to be highly
                                        inconsistent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Clearlab’s primary
                                        allegation against Goh is that he had used its confidential
                                        “spincastsphere6” computer program (“SCS6”) to design
                                        inserts in Aquilus. In response, Goh simply said that he had
                                        not used SCS6 but had instead used a commercially available
                                        software called SolidWorks. However, Goh met with
                                        considerable difficulty on 18 February 2014 when he tried to
                                        demonstrate in court that he was able to use SolidWorks to
                                        design inserts. When he drew a curve for a zero power lens,
                                        and inputted the values from SolidWorks into the Multi-Curve
                                        Generator program (“MCG”), he found that the Z values were
                                        different. He explained that, on the first cut, he had to
                                        use MCG to get the Z value. Then, on cross-examination, he
                                        said he switched between MCG and SolidWorks several times in
                                        order to get his first cut design. By contrast, in his
                                        earlier examination-in-chief, he had adhered to what he had
                                        said in his AEIC which was that the values from SolidWorks
                                        can be inputted into MCG,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><em>ie</em>, MCG was not involved at
                                        all until the SolidWorks design was completed. Then on 19
                                        February 2014, Goh said that there was no need to go to MCG,
                                        and that the description in his AEIC was correct. It would
                                        appear from the way Goh’s evidence evolved that he was
                                        making things up as he went along.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Further, Goh’s
                                        explanations for the inconsistencies were weak. He said that
                                        he had not used SolidWorks for eight months and hence had
                                        made mistakes. However if SolidWorks was something that he
                                        used since 2009, it was difficult to understand how could he
                                        have forgotten whether MCG was involved in the design
                                        process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Goh also claimed in
                                        his AEIC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> that he
                                        abandoned SCS6 at Clearlab, and he clarified in
                                        cross-examination that this was by 2009. But this was
                                        contradicted by documents<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> which showed that he
                                        had used SCS6 in Clearlab up to 2010. Goh attempted to
                                        explain it away by saying that the SCS6 description was
                                                false.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> He said he was afraid
                                        to put down SolidWorks as the actual software being used
                                        because he might be questioned on his method and be required
                                        to change all “related” documents, even those that were not
                                        submitted by him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Later on, Goh
                                        proffered another explanation and said that that the numbers
                                        in the working papers were generated using SCS6 but they are

                                        relation to a specific document with job reference number
                                        “DA1P06OT47”, Goh explained that “T47” in the job reference
                                        number means that the document was a record of the 47th test
                                        carried out by him. He said that it was not normal to have
                                        so many tests, but 47 tests took place because he had not
                                        yet figured out how to produce good lenses with
                                                SCS6.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> His evidence seemed to
                                        vacillate according to the documents put before

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In view of Goh’s
                                        frequent changes of evidence (in respect of the
                                        SolidWorks/MCG demonstration as well as the usage/non-usage
                                        of SCS6 in Clearlab), I found him to be an unreliable
                                        witness. I was unable to accept any of his evidence about
                                        his purported ability to design inserts using
                                        SolidWorks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The fourth defendant
                                        and the last of the ex-employees, Ng, was generally a
                                        cooperative witness. He was quite prepared to admit to
                                        wrongdoing in terms of his taking of documents belonging to
                                        Clearlab and to their confidentiality. His mode of taking
                                        these documents was to forward his office emails (containing
                                        the documents as attachments) to his personal email account.
                                        This occurred sporadically from May 2011 to July 2011. The
                                        reason for doing so, he claimed, was for
                                        “self-improvement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Despite his overall
                                        candour, I cannot believe his explanation that he took
                                        Clearlab’s documents for “self-improvement”. This was simply
                                        too incredible, given (a) the volume of such documents,
                                        which contained technical details rather than scientific
                                        principles, and (b) the timing (<em>ie</em>, the documents were forwarded at a
                                        time when David was also sending Ting Clearlab’s documents
                                        and Aquilus was being set up in a hurry). The circumstances
                                        point very strongly to a deliberate decision to convert
                                        Clearlab’s documents for use at Aquilus. I had no doubt that
                                        Ng was taking the documents for the purpose of using them in
                                        Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The ninth defendant,
                                        Ho, is the principal owner of Aquilus. Much of his evidence
                                        was relevant on the question of Clearlab’s claim of the
                                        existence of a conspiracy involving him and the
                                        ex-employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In terms of his
                                        demeanour, I observed that he was fast in giving his
                                        answers. At times, he was candid, <em>eg</em>, when he admitted that Ting was
                                        playing active role when he sat in the Aquilus meetings. But
                                        when things got awkward, he tended to shift his answers,
                                        which showed that he was making up evidence. An example
                                        would be the reasons he gave for deleting documents on the
                                        first day of the search. In cross-examination, Ho was
                                        referred to his AEIC which stated that the deletion was done
                                        in “a moment of panic”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Ho explained that,
                                        after Ting told him that he had deleted Clearlab’s documents
                                        from his desktop computer, Ho deleted the server data as
                                        well because he thought documents on desktop computers would
                                        be replicated in the server.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> When confronted with
                                        another paragraph of his AEIC,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> where Ho said he
                                        deleted the server data because he did not want Clearlab to
                                        get Aquilus’ confidential documents, he said that that was
                                        also the reason. This inconsistency casts doubt on the
                                        veracity of either explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As for the seventh
                                        and eighth defendants, Ma and Li, I find them to be
                                        generally frank and credible. During Ma’s cross-examination,
                                        he gave answers which clearly helped Clearlab, <em>eg</em>, he acknowledged that he used
                                        the design of a spin-cast machine (“Quad Spinner”) that he
                                        did for Clearlab to design the spin-cast machines (“Lens
                                        Forming Machines”) for Aquilus. Ma seemed to be more
                                        interested in giving an accurate answer than to protect his
                                        position. The only doubtful parts of his testimony concerned
                                        the setting up of Optic, and OSC’s and Optic’s bank account
                                        statements. When the questions involved OSC or Optic, Ma
                                        appeared reticent and uncomfortable and was eager to divert
                                        the questions to his wife, Li.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Like Ma, Li was
                                        generally consistent in her answers. For example, in both
                                        cross-examination and re-examination, she explained that
                                        Optic was set up in order to retain work from Clearlab
                                        because she recognised that Clearlab would terminate their
                                        relationship if it learnt that OSC was supplying machines to
                                        Aquilus, a competitor. There was no guile in this answer.
                                        She said that she herself terminated work with a vendor who
                                        did work for her competitor. On this topic, I was inclined
                                        to believe that she was telling the truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of confidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Clearlab’s primary
                                        case was that Ting, David, Goh, Ng, Aquilus, Ho, Ma and Li
                                                (<em>ie</em>, all the
                                        defendants, except Central Global) were in breach of
                                        confidence because they had wrongfully used its confidential
                                        information to set up a competing business in
                                        Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The technology</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     To set the claim of
                                        breach of confidence in context, it will be useful to
                                        describe the confidential information at the heart of this
                                        claim. It is about contact lens and manufacturing of contact
                                        lens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Contact lens correct
                                        vision in the same way as conventional spectacle lens: by
                                        refracting light entering the eye in such a manner as to
                                        enable the eye to focus the light on the retina. Refraction
                                        is achieved by the curvature of the lens. There are three
                                        methods of manufacturing contact lens: lathe cutting, cast
                                        moulding and spincasting. Clearlab uses both the cast mould
                                        method as well as the spin-cast method to manufacture
                                        contact lenses. But it is mainly in respect of spincasting
                                        that the defendants were alleged to have breached their
                                        obligations of confidence to Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In spincasting, a
                                        monomer (which is a liquid) is placed in a spherical
                                        indentation in a cast and rotated at a certain speed. This
                                        causes the monomer to spread outwards inside the
                                        indentation. The bottom of the monomer adopts the shape of
                                        the indentation and this is the convex surface of the lens
                                        that is eventually formed. During spinning, the monomer is
                                        cured by means of ultra-violet (“UV”) light. Curing causes
                                        the monomer to polymerise, turning it into a clear solid in
                                        the shape of the contact lens. While the principle is not
                                        difficult to understand, the first hurdle is to obtain the
                                        right design for the shape of the indentation, the monomer
                                        formula and the spin rate in order to produce lens that
                                        achieve the desired optical correction. The next hurdle is
                                        to get the right processes in place with the necessary
                                        regulatory certifications to be able to manufacture contact
                                        lenses on an industrial scale and with a satisfactory level
                                        of consistency and quality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The process of
                                        manufacturing spin-cast lens at Clearlab begins with the
                                        design of the lens. A trial design of the shape of the lens
                                        is carried out with SCS6. This program computes the
                                        dimensions of the dry lens when it is fed with certain
                                        parameters such as optical correction, lens diameter,
                                                <em>etc</em>. The dimensions
                                        obtained from SCS6 are fed into the MCG, which generates a
                                        job cutting file that is loaded into an Optoform 80 machine.
                                        The Optoform 80 machine reads the file and grinds one end of
                                        an aluminium rod into the shape of the convex surface of the
                                        lens. This is the insert; it is used to form the indentation
                                        of the cast mould. The exact amount of monomer is placed in
                                        the mould and it is spun in an inert environment of nitrogen
                                        gas and cured with UV light. At this stage, the lens is dry.
                                        The dry lens is hydrated by addition of a saline solution,
                                        becoming the wet lens that is worn by the user. This wet
                                        lens is tested for optical properties. If it does not
                                        achieve the desired optical power, corrections to the lens
                                        design are made manually, using SolidWorks software to
                                        visualise the lens shape and make adjustments. Another
                                        insert is made based on this new lens shape and the process
                                        is repeated until a lens design that achieves the desired
                                        optical properties is produced. The process is repeated for

                                        same with the addition of the packaging process wherein the
                                        lens are sealed in the mould cast which is also used as the
                                        packaging for the lens.</p>

                                                the information must possess the necessary quality
                                                of confidentiality.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, there must be an

                                        Ma and Li, the second element may be satisfied simply by

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Distinction between mere confidential
                                information and trade secrets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     A preliminary issue
                                        arose in respect of the character of the information sought
                                        to be protected. As mentioned above, the first element
                                        requires the information to have the necessary quality of
                                        confidentiality. It is trite that the confidentiality
                                        requirement is satisfied if the information is relatively
                                        inaccessible to the public, <em>ie</em>, it has not become public knowledge. It is
                                        not necessary to differentiate amongst the different degrees
                                        of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     However, if the
                                        breach of confidence claim is made against an ex-employee,
                                        the law has taken care to distinguish between “skill and
                                        knowledge” belonging to an ex-employee and “confidential
                                        information” belonging to the ex-employer. The law
                                        recognises that in the post-employment situation, while an
                                        ex-employer’s confidential information should be protected,
                                        the scope of protection should not unreasonably encroach
                                        upon the ex-employee’s ability to utilise his skill and
                                        knowledge to compete with the ex-employer or to seek
                                        alternative employment in the same field. Thus, in <em>Ocular Sciences Ltd </em><em>&amp; anr v Aspect Vision Care Ltd
                                                </em><em>&amp; ors</em>
                                        [1997] RPC 289, Laddie J observed at 370–371 that, a matter
                                        of public policy, an employee should be entitled to use his
                                        skill and knowledge, whether or not it is confidential to
                                        the employer at time of acquisition, and that if the
                                        ex-employee’s right to restrain misuse of his confidential
                                        information collides with the public policy of allowing an
                                        ex-employee to freely use his acquired skill and knowledge,
                                        it is the latter which prevails. For completeness, it should
                                        also be stated that the usage of such skill and knowledge by
                                        the ex-employee may be restrained where the ex-employee is
                                        bound by a restraint of trade clause. But the claim in such
                                        an action arises from contract and not from any duty of
                                        confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Apart from the
                                        category of information under “skill and knowledge”, there
                                        is some indication that a further distinction should be
                                        drawn between “trade secrets” and “mere confidential
                                        information” (<em>ie</em>, confidential
                                        information of a lesser degree of confidentiality than trade
                                        secrets). In <em>Faccenda Chicken Ltd v
                                                Fowler and others</em> [1987] 1 Ch 117
                                                (“<em>Faccenda Chicken
                                                (CA)</em>”), there is a suggestion that an
                                        express covenant is not capable of restraining an
                                        ex-employee from using confidential information which falls
                                        short of a trade secret. This has significant implications
                                        for the parties as it means that Clearlab cannot protect its
                                        mere confidential information (as opposed to trade secrets)
                                        from further use or disclosure by the
                                ex-employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Before addressing
                                        the parties’ submissions on this issue, it is apposite to
                                        examine the decision in <em>Faccenda Chicken
                                                (CA)</em>. The brief facts are as follows. A
                                        number of employees left the plaintiff company and served a
                                        competing business in selling fresh chickens. None of them
                                        were subject to an express restrictive stipulation. The case
                                        put forward by the plaintiff there was that the defendants
                                        had wrongfully used its confidential sales information,
                                        which consisted of the names and addresses of customers, the
                                        most convenient routes to be taken to reach the individual
                                        customers, the usual requirements of individual customers,
                                        the days of the week and times of day when deliveries were
                                        made to individual customers, and the prices charged to
                                        individual customers. At first instance, Goulding J treated
                                        the sales information as falling within the second category
                                        of information, described as “which once learned necessarily
                                        remains in the servant’s head and becomes part of his skill
                                        and knowledge applied in the course of his master’s
                                        business”; the first category, in comparison, relates to
                                        non-confidential information and, the third category relates
                                        to “trade secrets so confidential that … they cannot
                                        lawfully be used for anyone’s benefit but the masters’s”:
                                                <em>Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler and
                                                others</em> [1984] ICR 589 (“<em>Faccenda Chicken (Ch)</em>”) at 599C
                                        and 600D. In respect of the second category of information,
                                        Goulding J also held that it was not protectable after
                                        termination of employment unless it was the subject of a
                                        valid restraint of trade clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On appeal, Neill LJ
                                        disagreed with the view that an express restrictive covenant
                                        may prevent an ex-employee from using the second category of
                                        information, stating (at 137F):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We must therefore express our respectful disagreement
                                                with the passage in Goulding J.’s judgment … where
                                                he suggested that an employer can protect the use of
                                                information in his second category, even though it
                                                does not include either a trade secret or its
                                                equivalent, by means of a restrictive
                                                covenant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is strictly <em>obiter</em>, as the
                                                <em>ratio decidendi</em> in the
                                        case was that the implied post-employment obligation of
                                        confidence owed by the former employees was restricted to
                                        information that is invested with a sufficient degree of
                                        confidentiality to render it a trade secret or its
                                        equivalent; accordingly, the appeal was dismissed because
                                        neither the sales information as a whole nor the information
                                        about the prices by itself fell within that class of
                                        information.</p>

                                        concern in the present proceedings is the <em>obiter dictum</em>, which seems to suggest
                                        that only trade secrets can justifiably be restrained from
                                        use post-employment. It was briefly considered by the Court

                                                adopted. If one is of the view that full rein should
                                                be given to the concept of freedom of contract, an
                                                express (as opposed to an implied) covenant ought to
                                                be held to be sufficient to prevent either the
                                                disclosure or use of the confidential information.
                                                If, on the other hand, one adopts the view that it
                                                is the <em>status</em> of the
                                                information concerned that is the critical factor,
                                                then the use or disclosure of such information
                                                should be allowed after the employment contract
                                                comes to an end, as that is when the duty of
                                                fidelity owed by the employee to his or her employer
                                                simultaneously terminates as well. [emphasis in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I will add that the
                                        answer may also well lie in the notion of trade secret as
                                        applied in <em>Faccenda Chicken
                                                (CA)</em>. It was observed by Campbell JA in
                                                <em>Del Casale &amp; ors v Artedomus

                                        [108] and [128] that the expression “trade secret” has been
                                        used in different contexts with different imports. It is
                                        therefore necessary to decipher the purpose for which it is
                                        being used, on the particular occasion when it is being
                                        used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the <em>ratio decidendi</em> of <em>Faccenda Chicken (CA)</em>, the
                                        notion of trade secret was used as an indicator of whether a
                                        term of contract can be implied to restrain an ex-employee
                                        from using the information at the end of the employment. The
                                        holding is that an ex-employee’s implied obligation only
                                        goes as far as to protect trade secrets, so while there is a
                                        broad range of information which is confidential to the
                                        ex-employer, only a narrow range of information which has
                                        the requisite high degree of confidentiality as to
                                        constitute trade secrets will in fact be protected in
                                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In the <em>obiter dictum</em>, the notion of
                                        trade secret was used as a guide to ascertain the validity
                                        of a restrictive covenant. In this separate context, it
                                        seems to have a different meaning. Just before disagreeing
                                        with Goulding J, Neill LJ in <em>Faccenda
                                                Chicken </em><em>(CA)</em> cited <em>Herbert

                                                (“<em>Herbert Morris</em>”) for
                                        an example that a restrictive covenant will not be upheld on
                                        the basis of the status of the information, unless it can be
                                        regarded as a trade secret or its equivalent. Importantly,
                                        Lord Parker of Waddington in <em>Herbert
                                                Morris</em>, when considering the validity of
                                        a restrictive covenant, said at 709:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Wherever such covenants have been upheld it has been
                                                on the ground, <em>not that the
                                                  servant or apprentice would, by reason of his
                                                  employment or training, obtain the skill and
                                                  knowledge necessary to equip him as a possible
                                                  competitor in the trade</em>, but that he
                                                might obtain such personal knowledge of and
                                                influence over the customers of his employer, or
                                                such an acquaintance with his employer’s trade
                                                secrets as would enable him, if competition were
                                                allowed, to take advantage of his employer’s trade
                                                connection or utilize information confidentially
                                                obtained. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It seems to me that that “trade secrets”, as understood in the
                                        second context, is used as a juxtaposition to “skill and
                                        knowledge”. Restraint of the latter was unjustifiable
                                        because it unduly constrains competition and interferes with
                                        an ex-employee’s right to depend on it to earn a living. In
                                        balancing between the interests of the ex-employer in
                                        protecting confidential information and the interests of the
                                        ex-employee to use his skill and knowledge, the law has come
                                        down on the side of the ex-employee. This is less of a
                                        question on the degree of confidentiality necessary to grant
                                        protection and more of a question whether a restraint of
                                        trade is reasonable and therefore justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Understood in this
                                        way, <em>Faccenda Chicken (CA)</em> is
                                        silent on whether an express restrictive covenant may
                                        legitimately cover confidential information which is not a
                                        trade secret. In my view, parties should be free to agree to
                                        protect the confidential information of the ex-employer,
                                        subject always to the restraint of trade doctrine. It seems
                                        to me implausible that the agreement should collapse at some
                                        point along the spectrum of confidentiality, in spite of
                                        parties taking the trouble to define and agree what
                                        confidential information they would protect. On the other
                                        hand, it is important to recognise that confidential
                                        information could form part of an ex-employee’s general
                                        skill or knowledge during the course of employment. To the
                                        extent that the restraint against the use of such knowledge
                                        and skill is unreasonable, it could be struck down. This
                                        could depend on the nature of the information and how it is
                                        being exploited in particular circumstances. Thus, all
                                        things considered, there is an interplay between the freedom
                                        of contract and the status of the information. While the
                                        status of confidential information generally does not
                                        prevent it from being protected as a matter of agreement, it
                                        might, in the appropriate cases, affect the assessment of
                                        the reasonableness of the restraint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I turn, then, to the
                                        parties’ submissions on whether there is a distinction
                                        between mere confidential information and trade secrets.
                                        Clearlab contended there need not be one, because mere
                                        confidential information is protectable by an express
                                        confidentiality clause. On the facts of the case, an express
                                        confidentiality clause is imposed against the ex-employees
                                        in their employment contracts. Accordingly, it is said that
                                        all of Clearlab’s confidential information is
                                        protected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The defendants’
                                        response, in most parts, did not disagree with Clearlab’s
                                        submission. Their sole objection was to the possible
                                        restraint against the use of the ex-employees’ skill and
                                        knowledge as part of the confidentiality clause. The
                                        defendants submitted that the skill and knowledge acquired
                                        by the ex-employees did not constitute a legitimate
                                        proprietary interest that Clearlab could protect and
                                        furthermore, there is a strong policy reason that an
                                        ex-employee should be free to put his skill and knowledge to
                                        use in the most market-efficient manner. This proposition is
                                        echoed in the case of <em>Ixora Trading
                                                Incorporated and another v Jones and
                                                another</em> [1990] 1 FSR 251. At 258–259,
                                        Mummery J held that an express covenant may protect against
                                        post-employment use of confidential information other than
                                        trade secrets, but it would be unenforceable insofar as the
                                        restraint is against information that has become part of the
                                        ex-employee’s skill and knowledge or is otherwise too
                                        wide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In my view, both
                                        parties’ submissions are consistent with what I had set out
                                        above: that a line needs to be drawn between confidential
                                        information protected by contract and skill and knowledge
                                        gained in the course of employment. Where they are
                                        coterminous, the courts have been disinclined to enforce the
                                        agreement. But if it is merely a question of the degree of
                                        confidentiality of the information, there is no bar against
                                        parties agreeing to protect their confidential information.
                                        So long as the information sought to be protected is
                                        confidential to one party, I do not see how any policy
                                        reason why the agreement that such information shall remain
                                        confidential should not be enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Upon a reading of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As such, for the
                                        purposes of this suit, there is no need to distinguish
                                        between Clearlab’s trade secrets and mere confidential
                                        information. It is an entirely separate question whether any
                                        such information should be regarded as part of the
                                        ex-employees’ skill and knowledge which they are entitled to
                                        use and which Clearlab may not protect for its own. This
                                        question has to be addressed in relation to each specific
                                        information that is alleged to have been incorporated as
                                        part of any skill and knowledge acquired in the course of
                                        employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Standing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     There is one final
                                        preliminary issue to be dealt with: that of Clearlab’s
                                        standing to bring the action. The general assertion made by
                                        all the defendants is that Clearlab lacked standing to sue
                                        for breach of confidence because it had not acquired the
                                        proprietary information upon which it is
                                suing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Spincasting technology, design of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I will first deal
                                        with the issue of standing in relation to the breach of
                                        confidence claims made against Ting, David, Goh, Ng, Ho and
                                        Aquilus. There were three main arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was
                                                unclear if confidential information in the
                                                spincasting technology was ever purchased from
                                                Clearlab International Pte Ltd by Clearlab because
                                                there was no express term for it in the S&amp;P
                                                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_b"></a>(b)     The original Dual
                                                Spinners were supplied by Barr &amp; Paatz to
                                                Clearlab International Pte Ltd prior to their being
                                                purchased by Clearlab, and there is no evidence that
                                                the IP rights in the Dual Spinners were ever
                                                transferred to Clearlab International Pte
                                                Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_c"></a>(c)     The SCS6 program was
                                                written by a Don Noack from Capriconia Contact Lens
                                                as a favour or on an <em>ex
                                                  gratia</em> basis and the copyright in SCS6
                                                was never assigned to Clearlab, therefore, Clearlab
                                                does not legally own SCS6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     These arguments seem
                                        to say that Clearlab lacked the requisite property rights
                                        (whether in copyright or patent) to sue the defendants. For
                                        example, the defendants argued that copyright in the SCS6
                                        program could not have been assigned to Clearlab because the
                                        transfer of the SCS6 program was not evidenced in writing in
                                        accordance with s 194 of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, Rev Ed
                                        2006). Insofar as arguments of this nature are being made,
                                        they are irrelevant because Clearlab was not asserting a
                                        right in copyright or patent. What it claimed was a breach
                                        of confidence by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     That said, if the
                                        arguments are that Clearlab lacked standing to sue upon the
                                        confidential information because “ownership” of the
                                        requisite confidential information was not transferred to
                                        Clearlab, then these arguments, if made out, are a defence
                                        against Clearlab’s claim of breach of
                                confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   “Ownership” of confidential
                                information</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I preface the
                                        discussion by stating that information, in itself, is not
                                        property. It does not give rise to property rights or rights
                                                <em>in rem</em> that can be
                                        owned or said to belong to a person. Rather, confidential
                                        information is protectable if there is a basis for importing
                                        an obligation upon a person not to use or disclose it. The
                                        basis could lie in equity (which was once described as “the
                                        notion of an obligation of conscience arising from the
                                        circumstances in or through which the information was
                                        communicated or obtained”: <em>Moorgate
                                                Tobacco Co Limited v Philip Morris Limited and
                                                another (No 2)</em> (1984) 156 CLR 414
                                                (“<em>Moorgate</em>”) at 438).
                                        It could also arise in contract (see, <em>eg</em>, the confidentiality clauses in the
                                        ex-employees’ contract with Clearlab).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Language relating to
                                        “ownership”, such as “own”, “property” and “belong” is
                                        sometimes used metaphorically to denote that a person has an
                                        interest in protecting the confidential information that is
                                        enforceable by an action for breach of confidence. I have
                                        noticed that the parties have used words like “own”,
                                        “property” and “belong” in the metaphorical sense, and thus
                                        any reference to their submissions using these words will
                                        also be in that sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Circumstances of the transfer of
                                information</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In my view, each of
                                        the three arguments fails because the requisite confidential
                                        information was transferred to Clearlab with the
                                        understanding that the confidential information could not be
                                        further used or disclosed to a third party without
                                        Clearlab’s consent. In those circumstances, I find that
                                        Clearlab has standing to sue for breach of confidence. Let
                                        me explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In relation to
                                        argument (a) at [82(a)] above, the critical facts are cl
                                        1(3) and Exhibit A-5 of the S&amp;P Agreement. Clause 1(3)
                                        provides that Clearlab acquires a 50% undivided tenancy in
                                        common interest in the “Dual-Use Know-How” as described in
                                        Exhibit A-5. The other 50% was bought by Menicon Co Ltd.
                                        Specifics of “Dual-Use Know-How” are listed in Exhibit A-5.
                                        Briefly, they are “the know-how, information, data and
                                        proprietary rights … which is commercially used to
                                        manufacture spin-cast daily lenses”. On a plain reading, the
                                        agreement contemplates that Clearlab and Menicon Co Ltd will
                                        exclusively possess confidential information about
                                        spincasting technology transferred from Clearlab
                                        International Pte Ltd. Subsequent to the purchase, the
                                        information was validly in the custody of Clearlab and had
                                        been treated by Clearlab as confidential. I do not see why
                                        it would not fall within the range of protection accorded by
                                        the law of confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Argument (b) at
                                        [82(b)] above, which concerned Clearlab’s interest in the
                                        confidential information in the original Dual Spinner, is
                                        more nuanced. It appears to be this: even if the S&amp;P
                                        Agreement purported to transfer the confidential information
                                        in the original Dual Spinner to Clearlab, the information
                                        could not have been transferred from Clearlab International
                                        Pte Ltd to Clearlab, because Barr &amp; Paatz, the maker of
                                        the Dual Spinners, had not transferred the information to
                                        Clearlab International Pte Ltd. This presumes that the
                                        confidential information in the Dual Spinner resides with
                                        the maker and not the party which commissioned it. However,
                                        given the gap in evidence on the transaction for the supply
                                        of the original Dual Spinners, this appeared to be an
                                        unfounded presumption. The fact that Barr &amp; Paatz had
                                        made the Dual Spinners does not suffice to show that it, and
                                        not Clearlab International Pte Ltd, had designed the Dual
                                        Spinners, or that (if it had designed the Dual Spinners) it
                                        had not sold the design to Clearlab International Pte Ltd.
                                        On the contrary, the words of the S&amp;P Agreement suggest
                                        that Clearlab International Pte Ltd owned the rights to the
                                        design of Dual Spinner because the design of the Dual
                                        Spinner is included in the list of confidential information
                                        in Exhibit A-5 to be sold to Clearlab and Menicon Co
                                        Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Since there was
                                        insufficient factual basis for the defendants to contradict
                                        the S&amp;P Agreement, I find that Clearlab had acquired the
                                        confidential information in the Dual Spinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As will be seen
                                        shortly, the same question arose as to the confidential
                                        information in Ma’s work on the Dual Spinner and the Quad
                                        Spinner. Again, it is a fact-centric enquiry. Whether
                                        Clearlab has come to own the rights in the confidential
                                        information arising from Ma’s work will be determined by the
                                        particular facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     As for argument (c)
                                        at [82(c)] above, there is clearly shared interest between
                                        Clearlab and Don Noack to protect the confidential
                                        information in SCS6. The program was given to Clearlab for
                                        its use. It has hence been kept confidential by Clearlab.
                                        There is no basis to hold that Clearlab was not entitled to
                                        protect the program which had been improperly taken by one
                                        of the defendants, in concert with some of the others, who
                                        had access to the program by virtue of his trusted position
                                        in Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In summary, Clearlab
                                        was entitled to enforce its contractual right of
                                        confidentiality in respect of the spincasting technology,
                                        the original Dual Spinner and the SCS6 program. There is
                                        therefore no issue of standing as against Ting, David, Goh,
                                        Ng, Ho and Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Design of the Quad Spinner and modifications
                                to the Dual Spinner</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I will now consider
                                        the issue of standing in relation to the breach of
                                        confidence claim made against Ma and Li. This issue arises
                                        because they asserted that OSC retained the rights over the
                                        information in the work that Ma did for Clearlab. I will
                                        first outline the extent of Ma’s work for
                                Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In July 2008, Ting
                                        had just joined Clearlab as its Head of Engineering and
                                        Technology Development and he had discovered that the
                                        spin-cast machines (also known as “Dual Spinners”) in
                                        Clearlab required repair or modification. At that time, Ma
                                        was employed as a senior electrical control engineer in
                                        Sys-mac Automation Engineering Pte Ltd (“Sysmac”). Ma
                                        received the assignment to work on the Dual Spinners. But Ma
                                        soon left Sysmac, so his ongoing work with the Dual Spinners
                                        was transferred to a new partnership called SC-Tech
                                        Automation and Engineering that he had set up with Wu
                                        Zhigang in late 2008. This partnership did not last long. In
                                        2009, Ma set up another partnership called OSC with his
                                        wife, Li. His work with the Dual Spinners was transferred
                                        once more, this time to OSC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     After Ma’s work on
                                        Dual Spinners was completed, he was approached by Ting in
                                        late 2009 to design and fabricate a new spin-cast machine.
                                        The original proposal was that the machine should have eight
                                        to ten spin tubes to maximise output. After Ma’s initial
                                        studies and research, Ma recommended that each machine
                                        should only house a maximum of four spin tubes. The
                                        recommendation was accepted by Clearlab. Ma proceeded to
                                        construct the Quad Spinner, which he completed and delivered
                                        to Clearlab in December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Sometime in March
                                        2011, Ho contacted Ma for a quotation for six units of
                                        spin-cast machines. These machines were named “Lens Forming
                                        Machines”. All six units were delivered to Aquilus’ premises
                                        in August 2011. Now, Clearlab claimed that the Lens Forming
                                        Machines supplied to Aquilus were essentially the same as
                                        the Quad Spinner that Clearlab had commissioned OSC to build
                                        for Clearlab. The features of the Quad Spinner were
                                        allegedly replicated in the Lens Forming Machine in breach
                                        of Ma’s duty not to use Clearlab’s confidential information
                                        acquired by Ma.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     There is some
                                        logical basis for Clearlab to suppose that Ma had used what
                                        he learned from working on Clearlab’s spin-cast machines in
                                        his work for Aquilus. Between 2008 to 2010, Ma was privy to
                                        information about Clearlab’s Dual Spinners (that he was
                                        charged with repairing and modifying) and Clearlab’s Quad
                                        Spinner (that he was commissioned to construct). Therefore,
                                        in 2011, it was possible that he had misused such
                                        information to make the Aquilus’ Lens Forming
                                        Machines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     But to determine if
                                        there is a breach of confidence, one must first determine if
                                        Clearlab had standing to sue upon the information allegedly
                                        used to make the Lens Forming Machine. There are two types
                                        of information here. The first type consists of information
                                        that originated from Ma. This relates to Ma’s design of Quad
                                        Spinner and the modifications he made to Dual Spinner. There
                                        is an issue with standing with this type of information
                                        because the parties disputed its ownership: Clearlab
                                        submitted that the information residing in Ma’s work
                                        belonged to Clearlab, whereas Ma submitted that it belonged
                                        to Ma and/or OSC. If Ma was correct, this would eliminate
                                        Clearlab’s claim because only the person who is entitled to
                                        the confidence had the standing to sue for breach of
                                        confidence: <em>Fraser v Evans and
                                                others</em> [1969] 1 QB 349 at 361 per Lord
                                        Denning MR. In other words, if Clearlab cannot establish
                                        that it was owed a duty of confidence from Ma and Li in
                                        respect of such information, it would not have standing to
                                        assert a claim of confidentiality over it. The second type
                                        consists of information that originated from Clearlab. This
                                        includes information from the unmodified Dual Spinner that
                                        was used or incorporated in the Lens Forming Machine as well
                                        as any other information that was communicated by Clearlab
                                        to Ma. As held earlier at [89]–[90], the confidential
                                        information in the unmodified Dual Spinner did reside with
                                        Clearlab. Thus, unlike the first type, there is no issue
                                        with standing here. The main issue with this second type of
                                        information is instead about its unauthorised use. This will
                                        be addressed in a separate section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Turning now to the
                                        issue regarding the ownership of the information relating to
                                        the design of Quad Spinner and the modifications to the Dual
                                        Spinner, Clearlab’s fundamental submission was that the
                                        party which had commissioned and paid for a bespoke machine
                                        owned the confidential information to the exclusion to the
                                        other party which made the bespoke machine. Ma and Li, on
                                        the other hand, submitted that the commissioned party
                                        retained the confidential information in the commissioned
                                        work that was generated by him, unless it was transferred by
                                        way of an agreement (which they submitted was not the case
                                        here). In short, the parties have approached the issue from
                                        diametrically opposing positions.</p>

                                        which concerned, <em>inter alia</em>,
                                        with a breach of confidence by the defendants who were
                                        commissioned by the plaintiff to supply specially designed
                                        injection-moulded plastic drawers but had reneged on their
                                        agreement. The plaintiff was a company in the business of
                                        making and selling furniture. The managing director of the
                                        plaintiff, a Mr Felfernig, had been looking for a
                                        considerable time for a plastic drawer suitable for his
                                        business and, having found none, was seeking to make a tool
                                        for producing the drawer. That was how the first defendant,
                                        a tooling company, came into the picture. During the
                                        discussions between Mr Felfernig and the representatives of
                                        the first defendant company, who were Mr Flood and Mr
                                        Stoffregen, Mr Felfernig referred to the drawers that he had
                                        considered but rejected: the Elmaco drawer was said to be
                                        too flimsy and the Nylex drawer too expensive. It then
                                        occurred to Mr Felfernig that features from the Nylex drawer
                                        and Elmaco drawer could be adapted to create a new drawer.
                                        Thus, at a meeting between Mr Felfernig and Mr Stoffregen,
                                        Mr Felfernig drew and described to Mr Stoffregen the drawer
                                        he envisaged and Mr Stoffregen provided some feedback,
                                        including an idea to hinge the sides of the drawer. This was
                                        followed by negotiations on the price and, in the midst of
                                        negotiations, Mr Felfernig stated the precise metric
                                        dimensions he wished for the drawer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It is readily
                                        apparent that the plaintiff contributed most of the
                                        information required to make the drawer and the defendants
                                        were only responsible for the idea to use a hinge. The court
                                        held that all information relating to the drawer resided
                                        with the plaintiff. Fullagar J said (at 194):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Returning to the present case, it is in my opinion
                                                clear that all the information, comprising the
                                                configuration and mode of manufacture of the drawer
                                                of the present case, was in the eyes of equity the
                                                property of the plaintiff company, and any
                                                reasonable man in the position of Messrs. Stoffregen
                                                and Flood and the defendants must have realized that
                                                this was so. It is quite true that the defendants
                                                contributed the important, indeed in one sense
                                                vital, feature of the final product of the
                                                injection-moulding process being “hinged” so as to
                                                enable the final configuration to be snapped into
                                                place manually. But this is so only in a sense.
                                                There is no reason to suspect that another designer
                                                could not have designed a method of making the
                                                plastic drawer, so far as envisaged by Mr. Felfernig
                                                alone, without using the hinge. And [a furniture
                                                catalogue] suggests that this was, after all, an
                                                ingenious “workshop improvement”. <em>But the important fact is that the defendants
                                                  were employed by the plaintiff for the very
                                                  purpose of contributing, for the benefit of the
                                                  plaintiff, a solution to the problem of design
                                                  which was in fact solved by this contribution of
                                                  the hinge. For full consideration the defendants
                                                  have, as it were, provided an accretion to the
                                                  property of the plaintiff, having been employed
                                                  for the very purpose of providing just such an
                                                  accretion. In my opinion the defendants were
                                                  clearly obliged in equity not to use this property
                                                  of the plaintiff (this information) for any
                                                  purpose other than that for which it was conveyed,
                                                  without the consent of the plaintiff.</em>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Another case that
                                        was cited in support of Clearlab’s claim was <em>Vestergaard Frandsen A/S and others v
                                                Bestnet Europe Limited and others</em> [2009]
                                        EWHC 657 (Ch) (“<em>Vestergaard</em>”).
                                        It also involved the question of whether work created for
                                        the benefit of the plaintiffs was confidential to the
                                        plaintiffs. The plaintiffs in that case were manufacturers
                                        of insecticidal mosquito nets. Dr Skovmand was a consultant
                                        whom they have engaged to develop a new kind of polyethylene
                                        net. Although there was no written agreement between the
                                        plaintiffs and Dr Skovmand, it was accepted that there was
                                        an oral contract. In 2004, two employees of the plaintiffs
                                        left to set up a competing business. In 2005, Dr Skovmand
                                        followed suit and resigned from his consultancy to assist
                                        the two former employees with their development of
                                        polyethylene net. There was a finding of fact that Dr
                                        Skovmand devised the initial recipes for the polyethylene
                                        net for the competing business based on information that he
                                        had recorded in a database whilst working for the
                                        plaintiffs. This led Arnold J to consider whether Dr
                                        Skovmand owed an obligation of confidence to the plaintiffs
                                        in respect of the information in the database. He answered
                                        it in the affirmative. There are three separate grounds for
                                        holding that information arising out of the work that the
                                        plaintiffs gave Dr Skovmand would be confidential to the
                                        plaintiff. First, it was an express term of Dr Skovmand’s
                                        contract. Second, even if there was no express term, it was
                                        also an implied term of the contract. Third, even if there
                                        was no contract, Dr Skovmand was subject to an equitable
                                        obligation on the same terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The court’s
                                        reasoning is largely contained in [631]–[640]. It is
                                        illustrative of the factors that the court will take into
                                        account when deciding to whom an obligation of confidence
                                        would be due. On first blush, however, I would say that
                                        there are substantial divergences in the factual matrix of
                                                <em>Vestergaard</em> and the
                                        present case which would make the reasoning in <em>Vestergaard</em> not entirely
                                        applicable to the present case. Let me first state the
                                        similarities, which are that both Dr Skovmand and Ma were
                                        paid to develop a new product, and that the payment would
                                        cover raw materials and the tests required to obtain the
                                        final product. The chief dissimilarities are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
                                                relationship between the plaintiff(s) and the person
                                                commissioned to do the work. In <em>Vestergaard</em>, it was decided that Dr
                                                Skovmand’s status was close to that of a senior
                                                employee: at [632]. This might partly have to do
                                                with the fact that Dr Skovmand was engaged for a
                                                relatively long period of time, from 1998 to 2005.
                                                In contrast, Ma was always viewed as an independent
                                                contractor. This is implicit in para 134 of the
                                                Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) (“SOC”) where
                                                Clearlab complained about Ting outsourcing the work
                                                on the Quad Spinner to OSC even though Clearlab had
                                                (or so it asserted) the resources to do some of the
                                                work internally.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_b"></a>(b)     Input from
                                                other sources. There was an observation that Dr
                                                Skovmand had not carried out all of the development
                                                work or given all the advice for the development of
                                                the products. In fact, much of the work in that case
                                                was done by the plaintiff’s employees or other
                                                contractors and some advice was obtained from third
                                                party sources: at [633]–[634]. The dynamics were
                                                different in the present case because Ma worked
                                                independently. From the evidence before me, Clearlab
                                                would inform Ma of its requirements or the problems
                                                it required fixing, and Ma would work at creating
                                                the solution. As elaborated at [213] below, there
                                                was some communication of information, in that
                                                Clearlab allowed Ma to access its Dual Spinners and
                                                Ting highlighted to Ma some features of the Quad
                                                Spinner that Clearlab wanted to have, but otherwise,
                                                Ma was left on his own to do the
                                        work.</p>

                                                resultant information. In <em>Vestergaard</em>, the plaintiffs paid for
                                                the compilation of the database itself: at [637]. It
                                                is not so clear, in the present case, that Ma was
                                                paid for the information relating to the design of
                                                the Quad Spinner or the modifications to the Dual
                                                Spinners, in addition to the physical work that he
                                                had done for Clearlab. The dispute as to the terms
                                                of their supply agreement will be addressed later at
                                                [121]–[123].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_d"></a>(d)     The understanding
                                                struck between parties as to whom the information
                                                “belonged” to. The intention of parties as regards
                                                the information created during Dr Skovmand’s course
                                                of work for the plaintiffs was made manifest in a
                                                number of instances. Before Dr Skovmand left, he
                                                handed over the database to the plaintiffs. He also
                                                recognised in his goodbye letter that he should only
                                                use the information in the copy he retained for a
                                                limited purpose: at [638]. Further, throughout his
                                                consultancy with the plaintiffs, it was clearly
                                                understood that the inventions made by Dr Skovmand
                                                belonged to the plaintiffs, in the sense that the
                                                plaintiffs had the right to patent his inventions
                                                and own those patents: at [639]. Thus, either during
                                                or after the termination of his relationship with
                                                the plaintiffs, it could not have been intended by
                                                the parties that Dr Skovmand would be able to
                                                exploit the information he created for the
                                                plaintiffs: at [640]. Conversely, in the present
                                                case, Ma had not delivered his drawings of the Quad
                                                Spinner and the Dual Spinner to Clearlab. Neither
                                                were there words or conduct that indicated that Ma
                                                could not himself use the information that he
                                                generated in making the Quad Spinner or modifying
                                                the Dual Spinners. Thus, it was not so clear that
                                                parties intended for Clearlab to “own” the
                                                information arising out of Ma’s work (as opposed to
                                                the physical machines). This will be addressed in
                                                fuller detail, also at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    There is one other
                                        authority relevant to the issue of whom confidential
                                        information in a commissioned work resided with. It is the
                                        case of <em>Invenpro (M) Sdn Bhd v JCS
                                                Automation Pte Ltd and another</em> [2014] 2
                                        SLR 1045 (“<em>Invenpro</em>”). Ma and
                                        Li cited this case for its holding that the commissioned
                                        party retained the confidential information in the
                                        commissioned work. It bucked the trend in the earlier two
                                        cases which decided that the confidential information in the
                                        commissioned work resided with commissioning party. The
                                        differences in the holding, however, appear to arise from
                                        different facts than from a controversy in the legal
                                        principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In <em>Invenpro</em>, Komag (the
                                        commissioning party and also the defendant) approached
                                        Invenpro (the commissioned party and also the plaintiff) to
                                        manufacture a batch scrubber for its production line.
                                        Invenpro created an improved version of the existing batch
                                        scrubber, called “2006 Improved Komag Batch Scrubber”. The
                                        defendants were later engaged by Komag to modify its batch
                                        scrubber cleaning system and they were alleged to have
                                        copied confidential features of the 2006 Improved Komag
                                        Batch Scrubber to produce their own batch scrubbers. The
                                        rights in relation to the confidential information in these
                                        features thus become important as Invenpro would need to, at
                                        the threshold, establish that confidential information in
                                        the 2006 Improved Komag Batch Scrubber still resided with
                                        Invenpro in order to have the <em>locus
                                                standi</em> to assert a claim of breach of
                                        confidentiality against the defendants.</p>

                                        observed, at [150], that “the question as to who owns the IP
                                        rights in the product/solution (if any) depends on a
                                                <em>close examination of the
                                                relationship between the manufacturer/inventor and
                                                the customer</em>. <em>In most
                                                cases, this will depend largely on the terms of the
                                                contract that has been entered into</em>.”
                                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    What is peculiar
                                        about the case is that there were two clauses relating to
                                        the rights in the commissioned work (<em>ie</em>, the 2006 Improved Komag Batch
                                        Scrubber) that were apparently superseded by a
                                        non-disclosure agreement. One clause, headed “Non-Disclosure
                                        of Confidential Matter”, stated that all data provided by
                                        the commissioning party “shall remain [its] property
                                        regardless whether they have been modified by [the
                                        commissioned party]”. The other clause, headed “Patent
                                        Licence”, granted to the commissioning party an
                                        “irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty free licence and
                                        licence” in respect of “any and all inventions and
                                        discoveries” that arose from the contract that the
                                        commissioned party was to perform. The “superseding”
                                        non-disclosure agreement had no equivalent
                                clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The deliberate
                                        reference by the parties to the non-disclosure agreement
                                        “superseding” the two clauses led Wei JC to find that the
                                        commissioned party “was not willing to part with any IP
                                        rights that they might own”. The non-disclosure agreement
                                        (which may or may not be valid) laid down “what the parties
                                        thought should be the governing position between them – that
                                        parties would own their own IP rights in respect of any
                                        collaboration”: at [155]. This seemed to be the decisive
                                        factor for holding that the confidential information in the
                                        2006 Improved Komag Batch Scrubber still belonged to
                                        Invenpro. Even if it was Komag that had commissioned
                                        Invenpro to produce the 2006 Improved Komag Batch Scrubber
                                        and had identified most of the issues and problems that
                                        Invenpro eventually overcame with the 2006 Improved Komag
                                        Batch Scrubber, it did not automatically mean that the
                                        confidential information in the 2006 Improved Komag Batch
                                        Scrubber vested in Komag. At the end of the day, the
                                        understanding between parties was that each party would
                                        respect and safeguard the other party’s confidential
                                        information. As such, Invenpro “owned” the confidential
                                        information in the commissioned work and had the <em>locus standi</em> to sue for breach
                                        of confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It seems to me
                                        that the principle involved is this: confidential
                                        information arising out of a commissioned work can equally
                                        reside with the commissioned party or the commissioning
                                        party. There is neither a presumption that the confidential
                                        information is retained by the commissioned party nor a
                                        presumption that the commissioning party obtains the
                                        confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    On the question of
                                        which party is bound to keep the information confidential,
                                        much depends on the facts of the case. What is known from
                                        the three cases is that the basis for imposing a duty of
                                        confidence on one party can lie in contract or in equity. As
                                        a matter of contract, there may be an express or implied
                                        term which states that one party is to keep the information
                                        arising in the commissioned work confidential to the other
                                        party. The rights of the parties in relation to the
                                        confidential information would obviously be governed by
                                        their contract and the contract will usually be
                                        determinative of the issue. Where there is no contract, then
                                        there is different question of whether one party is subject
                                        to an equitable obligation to keep the information
                                        confidential to the other party. This may involve a
                                        considerably more difficult task of fact-finding. Some of
                                        the facts considered by the courts are the proportion of the
                                        input by each party to the commissioned work, and the
                                        understanding between parties (short of a binding agreement)
                                        as to the confidential information in the commissioned work.
                                        Ultimately, it must be shown that a reasonable man, given
                                        the circumstances of the case, would recognise the
                                        information as being confidential to one party and not the
                                        other, such that equity would intervene and impose a duty of
                                        confidence even in the absence of a contractual
                                        provision.</p>

                                        I turn to determine if parties had specifically agreed on

                                        Clearlab submitted that the confidentiality agreement only
                                        protected Clearlab’s confidential information whereas Ma
                                        asserted that there were mutual obligations to protect each
                                        other’s confidential information. The salient terms of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    A literal reading
                                        of the clauses supports Ma’s contention that there were
                                        mutual obligations of confidence imposed by the agreement.
                                        The terms “Disclosing Party” and “Recipient” could refer to
                                        either Clearlab or OSC. Thus, the meaning of cll 3 and 6 of
                                        the confidentiality agreement between Clearlab and OSC,
                                        taken jointly, was that either party’s confidential
                                        information was protected from disclosure or use by the
                                        other party. It did not contemplate that only Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information was to be protected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Clearlab, however,
                                        rejected this interpretation and submitted that the recitals
                                        made it clear that Clearlab wished to protect the trade
                                        secrets and confidential information that it relied upon to
                                        manufacture and sell contact lenses. I did not see how this
                                        assisted Clearlab as this position was not borne out in the
                                        wording of the agreement. Recital A merely stated: “WHEREAS
                                        CLEARLAB carries on the business of researching, developing
                                        and designing contact lenses and contact lens products for
                                        eventual manufacture and sales using CLEARLAB’s trade
                                        secrets and PROPRIETARY information”. At most it emphasised
                                        the importance of protecting Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information. Further, OSC’s obligation to protect Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information was not inconsistent with Clearlab
                                        having a corresponding obligation to also protect OSC’s
                                        confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Clearlab advanced
                                        another point, which was that parties could not have
                                        contemplated protecting OSC’s confidential information at
                                        the time of signing the confidentiality agreement because no
                                        confidential information could have been shared by OSC to
                                        Clearlab. As of 15 October 2009, OSC was engaged to work on
                                        the Dual Spinners and, in that context, Clearlab submitted
                                        that there was only disclosure of Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information in the Dual Spinner to OSC but no disclosure of
                                        any information by OSC to Clearlab. However, Ma had made a
                                        number of modifications to the Dual Spinner and these
                                        modifications could arguably be protected as confidential
                                        information. In any event, the words of the agreement
                                        clearly provided for mutual obligations of confidence.
                                        Crucially, it was not an agreement drafted specially for OSC
                                        but a standard non-disclosure agreement for all external
                                        vendors of Clearlab. Thus, given the clear words and the
                                        circumstances, it does not behove Clearlab to argue that the
                                        agreement preceded any contemplation that there could be a
                                        flow of confidential information from OSC to
                                        Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In summary, as a
                                        matter of construction of cll 3 and 6, each party was
                                        obliged to protect the other party’s confidential
                                        information and each party retained the right to its own
                                        confidential information. The necessary implication of this
                                        mutuality of obligation was that OSC’s confidential
                                        information arising from Ma’s work (whether on the Dual
                                        Spinners or the Quad Spinner) resided with OSC and not
                                        Clearlab. Consequently, Clearlab was not entitled to
                                        restrain any of the defendants from using and/or disclosing
                                        the information that Ma had generated in his work, <em>ie</em>, his design of the Quad
                                        Spinner and his modifications to the Dual
                                Spinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The supply agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Given that parties
                                        had a comprehensive agreement on how they were prepared to
                                        deal with their rights in relation to all confidential
                                        information that arose from the transactions between them,
                                        it would not be necessary for me to expound on their rights
                                        specifically in relation to Ma’s design of the Quad Spinner.
                                        Nevertheless, I shall briefly deal with Ma’s and Li’s
                                        contention that (even without the confidentiality agreement)
                                        parties had always understood that design of the Quad
                                        Spinner was to be retained by OSC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    This issue
                                        concerned the supply agreement for the Quad Spinner, which
                                        is evidenced by the quotation from OSC and purchase order
                                        from Clearlab.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> For the price of
                                        $22,600, OSC was to design and fabricate a Quad Spinner for
                                        Clearlab. The requirements for the Quad Spinner were
                                        succinctly set out in the quotation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    There were a
                                        number of factors indicating that OSC was only selling the
                                        physical machine and not the design. They buttressed my
                                        earlier conclusion that confidential information arising
                                        from Ma’s work was retained by OSC. Firstly, the price
                                        charged for the supply of the Quad Spinner was low, even for
                                        the sale of a physical machine. It was to cover budgeted
                                        costs of $11,669.34 for raw materials, several months of
                                        work relating to testing, modifications and tuning, as well
                                        as other follow-up services.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> I accepted Ma’s
                                        evidence that the price was negotiated down on the
                                        understanding that Clearlab would order more units of the
                                        same machine. The deal, as reflected by the low price, was
                                        that OSC would retain the design of the Quad Spinner and
                                        Clearlab would have to order more units from OSC whenever it
                                        required them. Because of economies of scale, OSC had
                                        thought that it would make more profits from selling more
                                        units to Clearlab in due course. Consistent with that
                                        belief, I observed that OSC had pragmatically ensured that
                                        it had the exclusive ability to supply additional units
                                        because it retained the mechanical drawing, pneumatic
                                        diagram, revised program logic controller diagram and
                                        electric circuit diagram of the Quad Spinner. Without these
                                        drawings and diagrams, Clearlab was incapable of replicating
                                        the Quad Spinner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> It was clear that
                                        if Clearlab had wanted more units, it necessarily had to buy
                                        them from OSC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Furthermore, it
                                        was not a term of the supply agreement to deliver the
                                        drawings and diagrams to Clearlab. This suggested that OSC
                                        was indeed retaining the confidential information in Ma’s
                                        design of the Quad Spinner. It would be surprising for a
                                        party to have purchased the design of a machine but had
                                        chosen to forgo the design drawings, thereby precluding
                                        itself from making more machines through other parties. If
                                        Clearlab had intended to purchase the right in the design of
                                        the Quad Spinner, the delivery of the design drawings would
                                        have been included as a term in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Moreover, it was
                                        not apparent from the supply agreement that the OSC was
                                        inhibited from using the design of the Quad Spinner in
                                        future projects. The plain words of the agreement merely
                                        required Ma to produce a Quad Spinner of certain
                                        specifications. It did not follow that Clearlab had any
                                        rights to the information concerning the design of the Quad
                                        Spinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Therefore, on the
                                        basis of the supply agreement, it could also be said that
                                        the design of the Quad Spinner was retained by OSC and that
                                        Clearlab lacked standing to pursue a claim of
                                        confidentiality over the design of the Quad
                                Spinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First element: Quality of
                                confidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I turn to the
                                        individual elements of a breach of confidence action. First
                                        and foremost, the information, which is the subject of
                                        Clearlab’s claim, must possess the necessary quality of
                                        confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The scope of such
                                        allegedly confidential information is set out at Annex 1 to
                                        Clearlab’s SOC (“Annex 1”). The entire list of items spans
                                        four pages and 40 separate categories. At the end of the
                                        trial, Clearlab maintained that all of the items in Annex 1
                                        were confidential, but elaborated that there were some among
                                        them which were highly confidential. For those items that
                                        Clearlab considered to be highly confidential information,
                                        there was a separate list set out at Annex A of Clearlab’s
                                        closing submissions (“Annex A”). In short, Annex A is a
                                        subset of Annex 1, and it is a selection of the highly
                                        confidential information in Annex 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In my view, the
                                        way in which certain items were excluded from Annex A was
                                        revealing. It appeared to be an acknowledgment that the
                                        items excluded from Annex A were unsupportable. I give a few
                                        examples below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_a"></a>(a)     Item
                                                32 of Annex 1: “the Plaintiff’s business strategy to
                                                tap into underdeveloped markets in Asia like, China,
                                                Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines”. I had
                                                difficulty in ascertaining what item 32 was, for it
                                                was stated in very general terms, and
                                                unsubstantiated with any evidence. That being so, I
                                                cannot see that it contains confidential
                                                information.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_b"></a>(b)     Item 3 of Annex 1:
                                                “the use of a Hamilton Pump to inject the precise
                                                amount of Lens Monomer into the Cast before
                                                spinning”. On the evidence before me, this was
                                                common industry knowledge. When pressed, Dr Park
                                                conceded that “if someone want to have precise
                                                dosing … one can actually … try to think about this

                                                said was correct, because the use of a Hamilton Pump
                                                to dispense precise amounts of monomer to make
                                                contact lenses is in fact publicised in its sales

                                                The very same step to streamline the manufacturing
                                                process has been suggested in International Patent

                                                does not encompass any information that is not
                                                already disclosed in the public
                                        domain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    To state the point
                                        succinctly, there was simply a lack of evidence to show why
                                        the items in Annex 1 (other than those in Annex A) were
                                        confidential. As such, this part of Clearlab’s claims must
                                        be dismissed for lack of proof of their
                                        confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    It follows that
                                        Clearlab’s breach of confidence action is confined to the
                                        items listed in Annex A. The items in Annex A comprises the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    To begin, the list
                                        must be narrowed down further to exclude the information
                                        which Clearlab lacked standing to sue upon. These are item
                                        (g)(ii), to the extent that it relates to the design of the
                                        Quad Spinner, and item (g)(i), to the extent that it relates
                                        to the modifications to the Dual Spinner, because Clearlab
                                        does not own either of such information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    For the remaining
                                        information in Annex A, I find that there is a <em>prima facie</em> case of
                                        confidentiality. Generally, the information have been pieced
                                        together from different sources and know-how, and refined
                                        from years of R&amp;D. In particular, the set of information
                                        that is integral to the manufacturing process, such as the
                                        precise dosage, spin-speed and lens dimension, were unique
                                        to Clearlab; it was linked to the equipment and materials
                                        that Clearlab used and was also the result of extensive
                                        experimentation. It was not suggested that the information
                                        was made public or shared with other manufacturers of
                                        contact lens. I therefore found that the information
                                        possessed a quality of confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The defendants
                                        contended, however, that any information relating to
                                        spincasting could not be confidential because it was a dated
                                        technology. A brief history of spincasting is useful here.
                                        In the 1960s, a Czech, Professor Otto Wichterle, invented a
                                        method of manufacturing lenses using a centrifugal casting
                                        procedure, <em>ie</em>, spincasting.
                                        From 1968 to 1988, he prodigiously filed patents on the
                                        spincasting method and the apparatus he used for
                                        spincasting. These included information on the polymer (the
                                        lens material), the mould casts holding the polymer, the
                                        outer diameter and height of the mould casts, the rotation
                                        speeds, the use of nitrogen or argon to create an inert
                                        environment, the solvent (such as glycerol), the source and
                                        emission wavelength of UV light, and the stacking of mould
                                        casts in a vertical tube. From 1983 to 1987, scientists,
                                        other than Professor Wichterle, also filed patents on
                                        spincasting and added to the knowledge in the public domain.
                                        The defendants pointed out that even the party which sold
                                        Clearlab the manufacturing facility in Singapore had filed a
                                        patent application on spincasting in 2004. In this
                                        application, specific information about spincasting was
                                        disclosed, <em>eg</em>, 10–40
                                        microlitres of dosage and 200–500rpm spin-speeds were
                                                recommended.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> However, the
                                        application was found by the patent examiner to lack
                                        inventiveness and it was ultimately abandoned on 30 March
                                        2009. In view of this background, the defendants challenged
                                        the confidentiality of the spincasting technique as used by
                                        Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The crucial aspect
                                        of the defendants’ submission was that, if the information
                                        sought to be protected by Clearlab appeared in any patent or
                                        patent application, it obviously cannot be confidential. The
                                        publication of the patents or patent applications put the
                                        information in the public domain and therefore destroyed any
                                        confidentiality. That is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    However,
                                        Clearlab’s case was put on a different footing. It was that,
                                        even if the concept of spincasting dated back to the 1960s,
                                        and even if spincasting was the subject of many patents and
                                        failed patent applications, the detailed operations at
                                        Clearlab were not revealed in those patents and patent
                                        applications. Therefore, the information listed in Annex A
                                        remained confidential to Clearlab. To illustrate, the patent
                                        may disclose that the range of spin-speeds was 200–500rpm.
                                        But that did not disclose the exact spin-speed that Clearlab
                                        used, the duration for that spin-speed, the lens formulation
                                        used in combination with that spin-speed, the mould cast
                                        dimensions for holding the lens monomer, the inserts used in
                                        the prior step to obtain the mould cast, <em>etc</em>. These details and their combination
                                        were unique to Clearlab. Such information was developed by
                                        Clearlab over the years and had evolved into a form that
                                        enabled Clearlab to produce contact lens of consistently
                                        good quality in a commercially viable production
                                        environment. In contrast, the patents and patent
                                        applications inform of a general process of spincasting; it
                                        could also enable a person to manufacture contact lens, but
                                        such person would not have the precise, controlled steps
                                        that Clearlab had set out in its confidential documents.
                                        Thus, insofar as Clearlab’s claims had been based generally
                                        on certain steps in its manufacturing process, such as the
                                        use of clear plastic mould casts to facilitate UV radiation,
                                        such claim of confidentiality would be struck down (as it
                                        has been at [127]). But insofar as the claim related to
                                        specific designs or dimensions or reports or their
                                        combination, I found that such information did possess a
                                        quality of confidence. This was the essential difference
                                        between the items in Annex A and those in Annex 1 that were
                                        excluded from Annex A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In addition, where
                                        there was a quality of confidence about the information, the
                                        corporate policies of Clearlab had been vital in preserving
                                        its confidentiality. There were a number of such policies
                                        regarding IT security and physical access to documents that
                                        were put in place to ensure that the confidential
                                        information was not exposed to the public. It is sufficient
                                        here to mention a few of them. First, Clearlab had appointed
                                        a Head of Regulatory Affairs and Compliance to manage the
                                        hard copies of all its confidential documents, which were
                                        stored centrally at a document centre. Prior
                                                approval<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> was required for access
                                        to these documents. Second, Clearlab allowed only designated
                                        employees to use electronic devices (<em>eg</em>, computers) in the course of their
                                        work and, even then, only with electronic devices issued by
                                        Clearlab. When Ting infringed the policy by using his
                                        personal laptop, Clearlab reimbursed Ting for the costs of
                                        his personal laptop so that it had the right to ask the
                                        laptop to be surrendered upon the termination of his
                                        employment. Third, access to network applications and shared
                                        folders had to be preceded by a request form and the
                                        requisite approval. All in all, Clearlab had treated its
                                        confidential information in a demonstrably confidential
                                        manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    On this note, I
                                        turn to the specific items in Annex A which the defendants
                                        submitted were non-confidential. These were (a) product
                                        artwork, (b) supplier lists, (c) design of four notches at
                                        the bottom of the mould cast, and (d) certain documents sent
                                        by David to Ting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Product artwork
                                        was described by Clearlab as consisting of product
                                        packaging, labels, package inserts, instructions for use and
                                        symbols as required by the customers and/or respective
                                        national regulatory bodies. I agree with the defendants that
                                        such information is found in products circulated for sale
                                        and clearly in the public domain. The claim of
                                        confidentiality over product artwork is therefore
                                        unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The second,
                                        supplier lists, were argued to be non-confidential because
                                        Dr Park conceded that there was nothing confidential about
                                        the names of the suppliers or their particulars. This
                                        argument appeared to be misconceived. Clearlab’s supplier
                                        lists were the result of its experience over a period of
                                        time with each supplier having been validated as being able
                                        to supply chemicals of sufficiently good grade. Oddly
                                        enough, the defendants had supported Clearlab’s case by
                                        submitting that David had been part of the validation
                                        process. While David was working at Clearlab, he was said to
                                        have used his skill and experience to find the suppliers,
                                        whereupon he determined the suitability of the chemicals
                                        they supplied. It was therefore clear to me that the
                                        supplier lists were protectable as confidential
                                        information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Third, the
                                        defendants challenged the confidentiality of a specific part
                                        of the mould cast design, namely, the four equidistant
                                        features at the bottom of each mould cast. It is submitted
                                        that the four features were obvious because they were
                                        necessary to purge the mould casts of oxygen during the
                                        polymerisation process and, further, they appeared in mould
                                        casts produced by M Ltd, another contact lens manufacturer.
                                        However, these submissions were shown to be either false or
                                        irrelevant. The necessity of the four features in
                                        spincasting was falsely stated because Clearlab also used
                                        casts which did not employ such features. The use of such
                                        features by M Ltd was irrelevant because confidentiality was
                                        not compromised simply because another person had
                                        independently come up with the same idea. More than one
                                        person may protect the same confidential information,
                                        provided that the information could still be regarded as
                                        confidential. Thus, it was more important that both Clearlab
                                        and M Ltd had kept the information about the features
                                        confidential by, for example, keeping the mould casts with
                                        such features from public circulation and not publicising
                                        its use. There was no suggestion from the defendants that
                                        the information was publicly available as such. In the
                                        result, I found the four features to be a design element
                                        that was confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    This leaves only
                                        the confidentiality of the documents that David sent to Ting
                                        to be determined. There were five such documents contended
                                        by the defendants to be non-confidential. Four of them did
                                        not appear to fall within the scope of Annex A but, in any
                                        event, they may be swiftly dealt with as their lack of
                                        confidentiality was not seriously disputed:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_a"></a>(a)     Atago
                                                Hand Held Refractometer.pdf. This was an operating
                                                manual for the Atago brand of refractometer. The
                                                only dispute between the parties was whether it was
                                                available for online download or whether it was
                                                provided with the machine. In either case, I found
                                                that there was sufficient dissemination of the
                                                document to make it
                                        non-confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_b"></a>(b)     chemist[1].doc. This
                                                was either David’s resume or a description of
                                                David’s position in Clearlab. Clearlab had not
                                                suggested that it was
                                        confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_c"></a>(c)     3287.001.pdf. The
                                                defendants asserted that this was a press release
                                                issued by Cognis UK Ltd announcing BASF’s purchase
                                                of its business. This was not challenged by
                                                Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_d"></a>(d)     http.doc. The
                                                defendant asserted that this was a website link to
                                                scientific articles and journals. This too was not
                                                challenged by Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Thus, all four
                                        documents above were non-confidential. The only truly
                                        contentious document was the fifth, “Raw Material.doc”.
                                        According to the defendants, this was a bare form generated
                                        based on information from the US Food and Drug
                                        Administration website. According to Clearlab, however, it
                                        was a list compiling the particulars of Clearlab’s chemical
                                        suppliers and suppliers of raw materials. It contained their
                                        telephone numbers and email addresses as well as the
                                        industry standard chemical number of the various chemicals
                                        and raw materials supplied by them. Neither party’s version
                                        can be verified as the document had been deleted and could
                                        not be recovered. But given that the existence of the
                                        document was discovered from an email fragment retrieved by
                                        Clearlab’s IT forensics experts, and the email fragment
                                        showed that David emailed the document to Ting on 24 June
                                                2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> (which
                                        was after Ting’s dismissal from Clearlab but during David’s
                                        employment at Clearlab), I was inclined to believe Clearlab.
                                        On balance, I found that Raw Material.doc was
                                        confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    To summarise, the
                                        items in Annex A were <em>prima
                                                facie</em> protectable by Clearlab as
                                        confidential information (except for the following: (a)
                                        design of the Quad Spinner in item (g)(ii), (b)

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second element: Obligation of
                                confidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    In the second
                                        element of breach of confidence, the plaintiff must show
                                        that each of the defendants was subject to an obligation of
                                        confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    This element was
                                        easily satisfied in relation to the following defendants who
                                        were under a contractual obligation of confidence: the first
                                        to fourth defendants (<em>ie</em>,
                                        Ting, David, Goh and Ng), who were ex-employees and
                                        restrained under an express confidentiality clause in their
                                        employment contracts, and the seventh and eighth defendants
                                                (<em>ie</em>, Ma and Li), who
                                        were bound by a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The fifth
                                        defendant, Aquilus, stood in a slightly different position.
                                        It was a third party recipient of information. More
                                        importantly, it was the corporate vehicle through which the
                                        defendants intended to exploit the confidential information
                                        they had obtained in breach of confidence. The general rule
                                        of law is that the knowledge of the defendants (of the
                                        confidentiality of information they had passed on to the
                                        company) will be imputed to the company. In <em>JN Dairies Limited v Johal Dairies Limited
                                                </em><em>and others</em>
                                        [2009] EWHC 1331 (Ch), the court had no hesitation in
                                        finding at [113] that the company, which had received
                                        confidential documents through its director, would, through
                                        the director, be deemed to have knowledge of the
                                        confidential nature of the documents and the circumstances
                                        in which it had been obtained, and thus be bound by the same
                                        duty of confidence. The same principle applies here.
                                        Aquilus, through the knowledge of its employees, was put on
                                        notice of the confidentiality of the information that came
                                        into its possession through the defendants and would
                                        therefore owe an equitable obligation of
                                confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    As for the ninth
                                        defendant, Ho, I found that there were good grounds for him
                                        to be aware that Clearlab’s confidential information was
                                        used at Aquilus. Insofar as he had received Clearlab’s
                                        documents, he would be fully aware that the documents were
                                        confidential to Clearlab because they were unerringly marked
                                        with Clearlab’s name and a confidentiality warning. While I
                                        note the defendants’ point, which was that Clearlab may not
                                        throw a cloak of confidentiality over its documents and
                                        bestow them with confidentiality if they did not contain
                                        confidential information in the first place, that was not
                                        Clearlab’s contention here. Clearlab submitted that Ho had
                                        objective notice of the confidentiality of the relevant
                                        documents that were in fact confidential. Also, it was
                                        obvious that the documents are taken by the ex-employees,
                                        whom Ho had recruited, for the purpose of establishing a
                                        competing business in contact lens manufacturing. I also
                                        found as a fact that Ho knew about the nature of the
                                        documents. These circumstances imported an equitable
                                        obligation of confidence upon Ho.</p>

                                        along this line; I will first discuss the alleged
                                        unauthorised use by the defendants in group (a), and then

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Overview of the defendants’
                                conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    I would state at
                                        the outset that I considered it clear that the group (a)
                                        defendants were in breach of confidence. There were two
                                        factors which drive this point home. First, these defendants
                                        were involved in an ambitious plan to establish a business
                                        in manufacturing contact lens within an impossibly short
                                        time and with only the ex-employees to serve as the
                                        technical personnel. Second, the ex-employees had
                                        surreptitiously taken a large number of documents from
                                        Clearlab and later (together with Ho) deleted what seemed to
                                        be the same documents in Aquilus when they realised there
                                        was a search order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Let me elaborate.
                                        From the minutes of the meetings at Aquilus, tight deadlines
                                        were set for the product to be registered with the HSA. On 8
                                        August 2011, exactly a week after David, Goh and Ng joined
                                        Aquilus, it was already decided that an application for a
                                        manufacturing licence would be made to HSA in October
                                                2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> It was difficult to
                                        see how the ex-employees could independently create the
                                        manufacturing process from scratch within such a short
                                        timeframe relying only on themselves, a skeletal crew of
                                        four, for the technical expertise. But such speed would be
                                        consistent with the use of Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information. For example, test reports were forged by
                                        copying actual test reports from Clearlab. David admitted
                                        that S-STB-FIR-11-002.doc was copied wholesale from a
                                        shelf-life report for Clearlab’s daily lens.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Shortly before
                                        leaving Clearlab, David, Goh and Ng essentially took all
                                        that they needed to recreate Clearlab’s manufacturing
                                        process. Evidence was captured of David accessing a series
                                        of documents in Clearlab within seconds or minutes of each
                                        other. Upon cross-examination, David admitted that he was
                                        looking at specific documents and downloading
                                                them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    This resulted in a
                                        remarkable number of documents that were taken from
                                        Clearlab. Each of the ex-employees had taken documents and
                                        David alone had admitted to taking 1,500. At a joint review
                                        of 49,787 forensic images extracted during the execution of
                                        the search order, 6,153 documents were acknowledged as
                                        belonging to Clearlab. It later appeared that not all of
                                        these 6,153 documents were Clearlab’s documents (<em>ie</em>, they seemed to be third
                                        party documents) but this did not obscure the point that a
                                        substantial number of Clearlab’s documents were amassed by
                                        the ex-employees for easy access at Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Subsequently, a
                                        large collection of Clearlab’s documents appeared to be
                                        stored in Ting’s and David’s office and home desktop
                                        computers, which were deleted <em>en
                                                masse</em> on the first day of the search
                                        order. A basic keyword search using the term “Clearlab” was
                                        run on their computers and the following number of deleted
                                        files were found:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Deletions were
                                        also made of files in an external hard disk drive belonging
                                        to an employee of Aquilus, Nancy Looi,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>
                                        and files in Aquilus’ server.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    It would appear,
                                        from the hasty deletions, that the defendants were surprised
                                        by the search order and scrambled to delete the documents to
                                        hide their tracks. In turn, this suggested that the deleted
                                        documents were Clearlab’s confidential
                                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    As such, I had no
                                        doubt that a case of breach of confidence was made out
                                        against Ting, David, Goh, Ng, Ho and Aquilus. The only issue
                                        was the extent to which Clearlab would succeed in proving
                                        all of its individual claims of breach of
                                confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    As it is easier to
                                        deal with the clear instances of breach, I shall begin with
                                        those.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Clear instances of breach of
                                confidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Profiling software – SCS6</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    The SCS6 was a
                                        program used in the initial stages of the manufacturing
                                        process to calculate the requisite lens dimensions for a
                                        range of optic power. There was no dispute that SCS6 was
                                        confidential and treated by Clearlab as such. The only
                                        serious argument advanced against the Clearlab’s case was
                                        that SCS6 was not used and could not be used. While Goh was
                                        still at Clearlab, he alleged that he had never successfully
                                        used SCS6 for designing inserts and had to resort to
                                        SolidWorks to carry out his work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The evidence raised
                                        in support of his allegation came to this: (a) the engineer
                                        who had preceded Goh in Clearlab had difficulties designing
                                        inserts using SCS6,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> (b) Goh would have
                                        taken a much shorter time developing inserts whilst in
                                        Clearlab if he did know how to use SCS6, (c) but since he
                                        was using the slower trial and error method with SolidWorks,
                                        he was only able to complete insert designs for a limited
                                        range of powers (<em>ie</em>, 13 out of
                                        50 powers) for Aquilus as of 28 February 2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and (d) Clearlab could
                                        have checked whether the Aquilus’ lens have the
                                        characteristic three dominating curves with two blendings
                                        and different bands of powers that would result from using
                                        SCS6, but it did not. In short, the defendants’ case was
                                        that Goh had used SolidWorks all the while at Clearlab and
                                        later at Aquilus, and Clearlab only had to check the
                                        differences between Clearlab’s and Aquilus’ lens to confirm
                                        that SCS6 had not been used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    It appeared to me
                                        that the defendants’ allegations stood on shaky ground. If
                                        Goh’s contention was that he solely used SolidWorks to
                                        design inserts, he was unable to show it in court. He had
                                        initially explained that, in designing inserts, he would
                                        always start with the R value; he would see how the changing
                                        of R produces a different dioptre. There were other values
                                        involved, such as X and Z, but they were not used as the
                                        independent variable because his method consisted of fixing
                                        X, varying R and then checking how Z was correspondingly
                                                varied.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In his demonstration
                                        in court of how he would design a zero power lens using
                                        SolidWorks, he veered from his avowed method. First, Goh
                                        took the Z value generated by MCG to input into SolidWorks.
                                        This completely contradicted his explanation that Z was a
                                        dependent variable, and that it was R which should drive the
                                        change in Z in SolidWorks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Secondly,
                                        as mentioned at [49] above, in Goh’s AEIC, he had not stated
                                        that MCG was involved at all until SolidWorks design was
                                                completed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> But he
                                        shifted his evidence three times. When he did the
                                        demonstration, he gave an impression that the Z value had to
                                        be obtained from MCG. On cross-examination, he said that he
                                        had to go back and forth between MCG and SolidWorks in order
                                        to get good values for his first cut design.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> On the next day, he
                                        said his demonstration was wrong because there was no need
                                        to refer to MCG for designing insert for zero power
                                                lens.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> I also said
                                        earlier that his explanation that he had forgotten how to
                                        use SolidWorks was highly doubtful at [49]–[52] above.
                                        SolidWorks, as thoroughly demonstrated by Goh, was merely a
                                        3D imaging software, with no computational function for
                                        deriving lens dimensions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Further, as
                                        mentioned at [51] above, Goh was further confronted with
                                                documents<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> which showed that he
                                        had used SCS6 in Clearlab up to 2010. His claim to have
                                        discarded SCS6 at Clearlab and having used SolidWorks only
                                        became more incredible in view of this evidence.
                                        Furthermore, he had explained that the label of “SCS6” on
                                        the documents was “for show only” but on re-examination, he
                                        accepted he was documenting his attempts to use SCS6. I
                                        found that he was not a credible witness at
                                all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Lastly, the
                                        defendants were unable to explain why SCS6 was found to have
                                        been run on Ting’s Aquilus desktop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    From the evidence
                                        before me, I agreed with Clearlab that Goh’s explanation of
                                        using SolidWorks was a contrived explanation to distance
                                        himself from SCS6. I found that Goh did know how to use,
                                        could use and had used SCS6 in breach of
                                confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Profiling software –
                                torsing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The torsing
                                        program functioned very much like the SCS6 program; it also
                                        computed the dimensions of lens. The main difference was
                                        that torsing was used for designing toric lenses which were
                                        made using the cast mould method, whereas SCS6 was used for
                                        designing lenses which were made using the spin-cast
                                        method.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    For the same
                                        reasons as above, it was unlikely that the SolidWorks
                                        software was sufficient for designing toric
                                lenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    The defendants,
                                        however, proceeded with another line of defence, claiming
                                        that Aquilus did not intend to manufacture toric lenses, and
                                        therefore they would not have any reason to use the torsing
                                        program. But this defence was untenable given that: (a) Goh
                                        admitted to accessing the torsing program from his
                                        thumbdrive whilst in Aquilus,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> (b) there
                                        was IT forensic evidence that torsing was run on Ting’s and
                                        Goh’s Aquilus computers,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> and (c) Goh further
                                        admitted to making drawings of female toric
                                                inserts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> (although
                                        this admission was made in an attempt to side-step a
                                        separate allegation that the drawings were wrongfully taken
                                        from Clearlab). I make no finding as to who had drawn those
                                        inserts, but if it were Goh, I have no doubt that he had
                                        used torsing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Despite these
                                        admissions, Goh attempted to dispute the use of torsing by
                                        alleging that it was an unreadable file. In the face of the
                                        aforementioned IT forensic evidence showing that the file
                                        had been opened and run, this was clearly
                                false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   Hioxifilcon A
                                formulations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The preparation of
                                        the monomer, or the material of the lens, using a lens
                                        formulation was a key step in the manufacturing process. At
                                        Clearlab, both spin-cast and mould-cast lenses were made
                                        using its allegedly confidential Hioxifilcon A formulations.
                                        Clearlab asserted that its precise chemical formulations
                                        were not disclosed in any patent. This was despite Clearlab
                                        acknowledging that it had a licence for the world-wide use
                                        of Hioxifilcon A formulation that was the subject of several
                                        US patents owned by Benz Research and Development
                                        Corporation and Hydrogel Vision Corp, namely, US Patent No
                                        5,532,289, US Patent No 6,011,081 and US Patent No
                                                6,555,598.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The
                                        argument run by Clearlab was that its lens formulations were
                                        derived after many years of R&amp;D and significant
                                        financial investment. They were not revealed in the patents
                                        that Clearlab took a licence to use. I agreed with Clearlab.
                                        I noted that, at Clearlab, David was tasked to carry out
                                        trials to alter the lens formulations,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> so this supported
                                        Clearlab’s case that its formulations were being improved
                                        over the years. Based on the defendants’ submissions, it
                                        also appeared that the defendants did not deny that
                                        Clearlab’s formulations were confidential. Thus, I proceed
                                        on the basis that Clearlab’s formulations were protectable
                                        as confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The main dispute
                                        with regards to the lens formulations concerned the use of
                                        these formulations. The defendants’ case was that David
                                        derived a different Hioxifilcon formulation at Aquilus using
                                        US Patent No 6,566,417 B2. They claimed that there was no
                                        breach of confidence because Aquilus’ formulation was not
                                        copied from Clearlab. On the contrary, they alleged that
                                        Aquilus’ formulation was developed by David relying on his
                                        own skill and knowledge. The evidence that the defendants
                                        relied on were the differences between Clearlab’s and
                                        Aquilus’ Hioxifilcon A formulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    There are indeed a
                                        number of stark differences between the two formulations.
                                        However Clearlab urged me to take a sceptical view of the
                                        differences between the two formulations. The reasons appear
                                        to be three-pronged. First, the column displaying the
                                        formulation for Aquilus’ Vodaclear Daily lenses contained
                                        dated information. It emerged in cross-examination that
                                        Aquilus’ lens formulation was no longer the lens formulation
                                        in use at Aquilus.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> It was
                                        wholly unclear what lens formulations Aquilus was using at
                                        the time because there was no further evidence from the
                                        defendants on this matter. Second, Clearlab argued that the
                                        information misled the court into thinking that Clearlab’s
                                        formulation was never used by David, when it in fact was.
                                        Two alleged differences in the formulations were said to be
                                        fallacious.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_a"></a>(a)     Surfactant: The defendants’ case was that that
                                                Aquilus used Tetronic whereas Clearlab used
                                                Pluronic. However, this was doubtful because, at one
                                                point, David admitted that he initially used
                                                Pluronic at Aquilus.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> Further, there was a
                                                photograph taken by Clearlab of a bottle of Pluronic
                                                in Aquilus’ laboratory at the time of the execution
                                                of the search order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> It was also
                                                discovered that, even before David left Clearlab, he
                                                had downloaded a document on the material
                                                specification for Pluronic from Clearlab’s server.
                                                Clearlab stated that this was highly suggestive that
                                                David had set out to use
                                        Pluronic.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_b"></a>(b)     UV initiator: The
                                                defendants’ case was that that Aquilus used Darocur
                                                whereas Clearlab used BME. But, again, David
                                                admitted to using BME at Aquilus,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> and a bottle of BME
                                                was found in Aquilus’ laboratory and photographed by
                                                Dr Park during the execution of the search
                                                  order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> After leaving
                                                Clearlab, Ting had also asked David for photographs
                                                of Clearlab’s Millipore pressure vessel and
                                                filtration system, which David in turn asked Tan Aik
                                                Ming (“Tan”), a Clearlab employee, to take. Tan took
                                                five to seven photographs of Clearlab’s equipment
                                                and sent them to David’s personal email account.
                                                Clearlab stated that the interest displayed in the
                                                equipment showed that the defendants had intended to
                                                use BME at the outset because this equipment was
                                                necessary to filter out BME or any other solid form
                                                of UV initiator. If the defendants had intended to
                                                use Darocur, they would not have required such
                                                equipment (or photographs of the equipment) because
                                                Darocur was a liquid UV
                                initiator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Third, Clearlab
                                        submitted that the properties of the lenses produced by
                                        Aquilus were inaccurate or contrived. David gave evidence
                                        that higher water content correlated to a higher swell
                                        factor in the lens, but it was in conflict with his own AEIC
                                        which stated that Aquilus lens had a higher swell factor but
                                        lower water content.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> David
                                        tried to get round this inconsistency by suggesting that the
                                        laboratory report on the water content of Aquilus’ and
                                        Clearlab’s lenses was wrong, but I found his explanation to
                                        be unconvincing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Given the logical
                                        inconsistencies of the figures and David’s admissions that
                                        he was not currently using the exact formulation, I treated
                                        the differences between the two formulations with caution.
                                        In my mind, it carried little, if any, weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    However, even if I
                                        should heed the differences between the two formulations,
                                        Clearlab submitted that these differences were only
                                        cosmetic. In this alternative submission, Clearlab submitted
                                        that the defendants would not make any significant changes
                                        to Clearlab’s lens formulations because it would impede them
                                        from using Clearlab’s combination of lens dimensions, dosage
                                        and spin-speeds in the subsequent steps to manufacture
                                        contact lenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    To show that the
                                        defendants had copied from Clearlab but cosmetically
                                        disguised its formulation to look like a different
                                        formulation, Clearlab submitted that the properties of the
                                        Hioxifilcon A produced from both formulations were not so
                                        dissimilar. The properties in the three bottommost rows of
                                        the table were refractive index, specific gravity and oxygen
                                        permeability. David admitted that the figures reflecting the
                                        properties of Clearlab’s lens could fall within the standard
                                        deviation (associated with each property) of the figures for
                                        Aquilus’ lens.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, in terms
                                        of the differences in the constituents of the formulations,
                                        Clearlab had shown that some of the differences were not so
                                        significant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_172-p2_a"></a>(a)     For
                                                the surfactant and the UV initiator, David admitted
                                                that Pluronic and BME were functional equivalents of
                                                  Tetronic<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>
                                                and Darocur<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>
                                                respectively. Both Pluronic and Tetronic (used as
                                                surfactant) served the same function of debonding
                                                the lens from the surface of the cast, and both BME
                                                and Darocur (used as UV initiator) served to effect
                                                polymerisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_172-p2_b"></a>(b)     For the tint,
                                                David admitted that the difference was insignificant
                                                as it was no more than a chemical to colour a
                                                  lens.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_172-p2_c"></a>(c)     Finally, the packaging solution was merely a
                                                solution that finished lenses were immersed in when
                                                packaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    The broad thrust
                                        of Clearlab’s submissions was that these differences were an
                                        attempt to camouflage the fact that the defendants had
                                        copied Clearlab’s formulation. However, I was not prepared
                                        to conclude that all the differences are merely cosmetic.
                                        This was because Clearlab had not submitted on how the
                                        difference in the GMA/HEMA ratios applied at Clearlab and
                                        Aquilus was not significant. Bearing in mind that the
                                        end-product, Hioxifilcon A, was essentially a copolymer of
                                        GMA (2,3-dihydroxypropyl methacrylate) and HEMA
                                        (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), I could not simply discount
                                        the different combinations of HEMA and GMA shown by the
                                        differences between Clearlab's and Aquilus' formulations.
                                        For this reason, it remained unclear whether Aquilus’
                                        formulation was merely cosmetically different from
                                        Clearlab’s formulation. That said, the uncertainty in this
                                        regard was immaterial as I have earlier stated that I am not
                                        placing much weight on the differences between the two
                                        formulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Aside from
                                        technical evidence on lens formulations, Clearlab submitted
                                        that there was irrefutable evidence that the defendants
                                        copied the formulation. First, the defendants had access to
                                        the requisite information because Ting admitted that David
                                        had sent to him the full suite of Clearlab’s lens
                                                formulations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>
                                        Amongst the documents sent, two were entitled, quite
                                        tellingly, “S-TEF-FRP-004 TECHNICAL FILE (Clear All
                                        Day).doc” and “SG-ID-002_R08 Composition of Monomer
                                                Formulation.pdf”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Further, there was
                                        evidence the defendants had intended to replicate Clearlab’s
                                        formulation. The defendants’ plan, as encapsulated in its
                                        minutes of meeting on 8 August 2011, was to apply for a HSA
                                        manufacturing licence by October 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> David admitted under
                                        cross-examination that Aquilus had to have a workable lens
                                        formulation in order to obtain HSA manufacturing licence.
                                        There would not have been enough time for David, since
                                        joining Aquilus in August 2011 till the deadline of October
                                        2011, to look at patents and independently develop a lens
                                        formulation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    From the
                                        foregoing, it can be seen that the defendants had formed an
                                        intention to replicate Clearlab’s formulations at the time
                                        of taking the documents out of Clearlab, and had acted on
                                        that intention by buying and using chemicals that were, by
                                        their own evidence, not required under the formulation they
                                        claimed they used, but were clearly required under
                                        Clearlab’s formulation. The irresistible inference was that
                                        the defendants had indeed used Clearlab’s formulations and I
                                        so find.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    There was one
                                        other argument that the defendants had made to resist
                                        liability in relation to the lens formulation. As stated
                                        earlier, Clearlab entered into a licence agreement for the
                                        use of three US patents. Based on this, the defendants
                                        challenged Clearlab’s right to commence legal action in
                                        relation to its Hioxifilcon A formulation, first, because it
                                        was a mere licensee and, secondly, because the patents were
                                        only enforceable in the US. This was a misconceived argument
                                        as Clearlab had not claimed the right to enforce patents.
                                        Thus, while the defendants’ submissions about the patent law
                                        may well be correct, they were inapplicable to the present
                                        suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   Combination of dosage, spin-speed
                                and lens dimensions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    After preparing
                                        the lens monomer, but before the curing process, there was a
                                        spinning process. A precise quantity of lens monomer would
                                        be dosed onto the mould cast and spun at controlled speeds.
                                        Both sides accepted that minor variations in dosage and
                                        spin-speed would affect the power of the lens produced.
                                        Accurate speed controls and precise dosage were therefore
                                        critical to the manufacturing process. The claim of breach
                                        of confidence under this head was in respect of the
                                        combination of dosage and spin-speed to produce lens of the
                                        requisite dimensions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The defendants did
                                        not dispute the confidentiality of the information. They,
                                        however, submitted that there was insufficient evidence to
                                        show that they had used Clearlab’s spin-speed and dosage
                                        because if the defendants had copied Clearlab’s spin-speed
                                        and dosage, they would had to copy the exact spin-speed and
                                        dosage. Otherwise, the lens produced would not attain the
                                        targeted power. If there was any difference in spin-speed
                                        and/or dosage, it would prove that the defendants had not
                                        copied from Clearlab. The defendants emphasised that
                                        Clearlab had refused to disclose its combination of dosage,
                                        spin-speed and lens dimensions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    On that last
                                        point, it bears noting that Clearlab was entitled to redact
                                        any documents containing such information on the basis of
                                        confidentiality. Therefore, the lack of such information was
                                        not, in itself, determinative of the matter. Separately,
                                        there was ample evidence that a document containing dosage
                                        and spin-speed information was taken from Clearlab. The
                                        request for the document was first made by David to Tan. Tan
                                        acceded to the request and sent the document from his
                                        personal Gmail account to David’s personal Gmail account.
                                        David then sent the document to Ting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>

                                        David had asked for the document from Tan because he needed
                                        it to develop -3.00 dioptre lens. This suggested that the
                                        document was used at least for making -3.00 dioptre lens. I
                                        find that breach of confidence was made out in respect of
                                        Clearlab’s combination of dosage, spin-speed and lens

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    The metal insert
                                        for producing the cast mould was cut using an Optoform 80
                                        machine. As described earlier, the dimensions of the insert
                                        were initially determined by the SCS6 and fine-tuned by an
                                        iterative process using SolidWorks. The insert dimensions
                                        were then converted into parameter settings which were
                                        inputted to the Optoform 80 machine to cut the
                                        insert.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    There was no
                                        dispute that the parameter settings were confidential. The
                                        only question was whether they were used by Aquilus. The
                                        evidence was relatively straightforward. Ng admitted to
                                        copying the excel file storing the parameter settings keyed
                                        in by other technicians.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, Ng
                                        admitted that the file was not deleted when he left to join
                                        Aquilus and he later forwarded it to Goh using his Aquilus
                                        email account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> The excuses Ng
                                        made were poor. First, he claimed to have taken the file for
                                        “self-study”, which was incredible, because it was unlikely
                                        that he could learn much from what was basically a
                                        compilation of numbers representing spindle rpm, feed rate,
                                        pass rate, block diameter, cup depth, <em>etc</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> It also did not
                                        explain why he had to send Goh the file as well. Secondly,
                                        he claimed that a lathe machine service engineer was engaged
                                        to input the parameter setting in Aquilus’ Optoform 80
                                                machine,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> but
                                        it is hard to believe that an engineer without a background
                                        in contact lenses would know what settings to input. Minutes
                                        later during the cross-examination, he seemed to change his
                                        evidence by saying that he did it the hard way from scratch,
                                                <em>ie</em>, he tested until he
                                        got the correct result.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>

                                        defendants’ closing submissions, there was a further
                                        suggestion that a comparison should made between Aquilus’
                                        inserts and mould casts, and Clearlab’s inserts and mould
                                        casts. If the dimensions were different, then, logically,
                                        the parameter settings (for cutting the inserts, which are
                                        in turn used to shape the concave cavity of the mould casts)
                                        must also be different. However, the defendants stopped
                                        short of submitting that the inserts and mould casts had
                                        different dimensions, though, they did, in their reply
                                        submissions, referred to Goh’s AEIC on the different sizes
                                        of Aquilus’ and Clearlab’s inserts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    This evidence was
                                        adduced to rebut Clearlab’s other claim that Goh had used
                                        its SCS6 program. Earlier, I have disbelieved Goh’s claim
                                        that he was able to design inserts using SolidWorks only. As
                                        the dimensions of Aquilus’ inserts were put to me as the
                                        result of Goh’s work using SolidWorks, their <em>bona fides</em> were doubtful. I
                                        therefore did not rely on this evidence.</p>

                                        18001:2007) on 1 June 2011 and, following an audit by TQCSI,
                                        obtained all four certifications on 3 November
                                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    According to
                                        Clearlab, this was an impossible feat unless Aquilus had
                                        copied and used Clearlab’s confidential documents. Clearlab
                                        highlighted that the defendants, with such limited manpower,
                                        had set tight deadlines for themselves. Three of its four
                                        technical crew (<em>ie</em>, David, Goh
                                        and Ng) had only come on board on 1 August 2011, after the
                                        application for certifications was made and barely three
                                        months later, the certifications were issued. Clearlab also
                                        pointed out that the ISO certification required a minimum of
                                        three months of actual implementation of QMSs and related
                                        SOPs. The remarkable speed at which Aquilus obtained
                                        certifications, Clearlab submitted, overwhelmingly suggests
                                        copying.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    In rebuttal, the
                                        defendants sought to credit the quick certification process
                                        to Nancy Looi’s previous experience with ISO standards in
                                        Central Global and Jingle Interior Decorations (S) Pte Ltd.
                                        However, none of those companies were involved in contact
                                        lens manufacturing nor were they accredited with
                                        ISO13485:2003 (the quality management standard for the
                                        design and manufacture of medical devices). It seemed that
                                        Nancy Looi’s experience had little relevance in the
                                        technical areas of contact lens manufacturing and she could
                                        only speed the certification process up to a limited
                                        extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Secondly, Clearlab
                                        pointed to emails sent by David to Sara with vague
                                        instructions for her to make changes to various documents.
                                        The first of such emails was sent on 1 September 2011 with
                                        the following words: “This is Clearlab Microlab SOP, please
                                        write it for Aquilus”. Four days later, on 5 September 2011,
                                        David sent a larger batch of documents to Sara, saying
                                        “attached are some SOPs and OIs, needed to change for
                                        Aquilus”. Sara replied on 5 October 2011 with eighteen
                                        attachments and described her work as having “removed all
                                        mentions of CL and also changed the words 1-Day to Daily
                                                Lens”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Finally, on 6
                                        October 2011, David emailed back saying “Thanks for SOPs. It
                                        is great.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    A review of some
                                        of these attachments showed that Aquilus’ documents were in
                                        substance identical to Clearlab’s.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> When confronted with
                                        Clearlab’s and Aquilus’ nearly-identical “Essential
                                        Requirement Checklist” for daily disposable lens, Sara
                                        admitted to copying (by copy-typing, not cutting and
                                        pasting) as copying had saved weeks of time to prepare the
                                        document, and that it was wrongful.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> During the copy-typing
                                        process, she changed (a) Clearlab’s name to Aquilus’ name,
                                        and (b) Clearlab’s product names to generic
                                                names.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Although Sara gave
                                        evidence she had gotten David’s instructions
                                                wrong<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> because David had
                                        later (after the execution of the search order) told her
                                        that she was supposed to use Clearlab’s documents only as a
                                        template and to write the documents independently, that was
                                        scarcely believable. Sara had no prior experience in the
                                        contact lens industry. She was hired by Aquilus as a sales
                                        and marketing executive. It was questionable why David would
                                        even approach Sara to write some SOPs and OIs when she had
                                        little to no knowledge of the manufacturing process for
                                        contact lenses. Moreover, Sara, in her AEIC,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> clearly stated that she
                                        told David that she was not technically
                                trained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Nevertheless, the
                                        defendants asserted that there was no breach of confidence
                                        because the copy-typed documents were not used by Aquilus,
                                        whether for certification or otherwise. The main evidence
                                        came from David who attested that he did not open some of
                                        Sara’s attachments at all because he had doubts about her
                                        capability after seeing her copy-typed work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> The defendants also
                                        pointed out that the auditors’ checklist and work sheets did
                                        not refer to Sara’s copy-typed documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    However, use of
                                        Clearlab’s SOPs and OIs were not limited to the audit of
                                        Sara’s copy-typed documents. Implementation of the SOPs and
                                        OIs to satisfy the audit requirements would constitute use
                                        as well. Relevantly, David had emailed Dawn Teng to run the
                                        company using Clearlab’s standards in an email on 6
                                        September 2011. The exact words in that email were: “As per
                                        Mr Ting advice, we can use Clearlab’s standard for a
                                                while.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> This email was sent in
                                        the midst of the audit, which took place on 5, 10, 11, 12
                                        and 13 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In view of the
                                        foregoing, I found that the evidence had shown that the
                                        defendants used Clearlab’s documents in breach of confidence
                                        to obtain the four certifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Potential use</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    An interesting
                                        issue arose as to claims of breach of confidence in respect
                                        of the documents that were not so clearly used. As
                                        mentioned, there were thousands of documents that were taken
                                        by the defendants. The above discussion only addressed
                                        documents that were used, which comprised a fraction of the
                                        documents taken by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    The evidence
                                        showed that the defendants took as many documents as they
                                        could while they were in Clearlab and in a position to do
                                        so. Amongst the documents taken, many were not immediately
                                        useful to Aquilus. The defendants drew the court’s attention
                                        to records of customer complaints, password-protected files
                                        that could not be opened, clinical studies on Clearlab’s
                                                products,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> obsolete

                                        rates at Clearlab.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> The defendants
                                        pointed out that these were useless to Aquilus. Also, given
                                        the promptness in which Clearlab obtained an interim
                                        injunction against the defendants, there were other
                                        documents the defendants had no opportunity of using by the
                                        time of the institution of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Contrary to the
                                        defendants’ submission, it was clear to me that in taking
                                        the documents in such a manner, they had intended to arm
                                        Aquilus with a database of information from which they could
                                        extract such information that would be useful as and when
                                        needed. Wholesale copying was convenient for the defendants
                                        as it did not require expenditure of cost or manpower and
                                        the documents taken could be analysed for usefulness at
                                        leisure. They were also on tap as a useful library of
                                        resource material. That was the reason that the process was
                                        not selective and they had ended up with many documents that
                                        were totally useless and many more that were not of
                                        immediate use but were potentially useful. The critical
                                        question was: can confidential documents be taken from
                                        Clearlab in such a blatant manner and, simply because they
                                        cannot individually be proved to be used by Aquilus, not be
                                        subject to an injunction or order for delivery up? The
                                        defendants had construed this question as being one of
                                        breach. They seemed to be asserting that the particular
                                        breaches in respect of documents that were not used could
                                        not be made out and therefore no remedy was available for
                                        these documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    But that is not
                                        the only way to look at this question. In <em>National Broach and Machine Co v Churchill Gear
                                                Machines Ltd</em> [1965] 1 WLR 1199, it was
                                        held that a plaintiff was also entitled to a remedy in
                                        respect of all the information he had shown to be
                                        confidential, so long as there are proven instances of
                                        breach of confidence. The rationale in that case was that
                                        “there is a certain lack of reality” to limit recovery to
                                        the exact number of drawings that the defendants wrongfully
                                        used, when it appeared that there were only some but not all
                                        of the drawings that were received by the defendants: at
                                        1202 per Willmer LJ. I agree entirely with this approach.
                                        The principal concern in the present case was to restrain
                                        the defendants, who were proven to have wrongfully used some
                                        of Clearlab’s confidential information, from committing
                                        further breaches of confidence in respect of the remaining
                                        confidential information that they had wrongfully taken
                                        away. This was the principal basis of my orders at
                                        [331]–[332]­.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    I will leave the
                                        question open as to whether the mere taking of confidential
                                        information can constitute a breach of confidential
                                        information. By way of observation, I will add that there
                                        are competing considerations. On one hand, there is a
                                        perception that breach should not be confined to use and
                                        disclosure, but should be interpreted in the context within
                                        which the obligation of confidence arose. Thus, the argument
                                        could be made that the defendants’ behaviour in taking
                                        Clearlab’s documents and keeping them for the purpose of
                                        future reference was at odds with their obligation of
                                        confidence to Clearlab and should constitute a breach of
                                        confidence. The key fact was that they had surreptitiously
                                        obtained for their own use confidential information which
                                        they should not have access to after their employment with
                                        Clearlab ceased. On the other hand, many of the cases on
                                        breach of confidence are grounded on past unauthorised use
                                        or disclosure. Based on the consistent emphasis of breach
                                        being actual use or disclosure, and the vintage of <em>Coco</em>’s formulation of the
                                        element of breach as “an unauthorised use of that
                                        information to the detriment of the party communicating it”
                                                (<em>Coco</em> at 47), the
                                        opposing argument is that the defendants should not be
                                        liable if they are not actually shown to have used the
                                        confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    As this issue has
                                        not been discussed in any depth in Singapore, I find it
                                        useful to review the relevant decisions in the other
                                        Commonwealth jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    First of all, the
                                        Australian courts have explicitly moved away from the
                                        concept that actual use or disclosure is required to
                                        establish a breach of confidence. According to the
                                        Australian authorities, threatened use or disclosure of the
                                        confidential information is sufficient. As early as 1984, in
                                                <em>Moorgate</em> at 438, it
                                        was mentioned in passing that the court in its equitable
                                        jurisdiction may grant relief against an “actual or
                                        threatened abuse of confidential information”. The case did
                                        not in fact address why threatened abuse should suffice but
                                        that phrase was repeated in a number of subsequent
                                        decisions. Thereafter, it became settled law that one of the
                                        elements for a breach of confidence was “actual or
                                        threatened misuse” of confidential information: see
                                                <em>Smith Kline &amp; French
                                                Laboratories (Aust) Limited and others v Secretary,
                                                Department of Community Services and
                                                Health</em> (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 87. Claims
                                        have therefore been pursued on the basis that there was an
                                        apprehended breach of confidence in order to restrain an
                                        expected injury to the plaintiff’s right and to preserve the
                                        confidentiality of information. For example, in <em>AZPA Pty Ltd and anor v Dogan and
                                                anor</em> [2010] VSC 51, the defendants had
                                        not yet disclosed the confidential information but the
                                        plaintiffs feared that they would do so in favour of a
                                        supplier, so they moved to restrain the defendants. Under
                                        this approach, the second element for the breach of
                                        confidence action was framed by the court, and seemingly
                                        accepted by all parties, as a requirement that one of the
                                        defendants “proposes to, or threatens to use that
                                        information”: at [10].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    In England, the
                                        test for breach of confidence remains that of the
                                        aforementioned three elements stated by Megarry J
                                                in <em>Coco</em>. But despite
                                        the requirement of an “unauthorised use” in <em>Coco</em>, the courts have been
                                        willing to come to the aid of the plaintiff even where there
                                        is only imminent use or disclosure of confidential
                                        information. This is well illustrated in the case of
                                                <em>Imerman v Tchenguiz and
                                                others</em> [2011] 2 WLR 592 (“<em>Imerman</em>”). The case concerns the
                                        right of a wife, who was seeking ancillary relief from her
                                        husband, to retain copies of documents which were unlawfully
                                        obtained. In reaching the conclusion that a claim in
                                        confidence against the wife would succeed and that she
                                        should return all copies of the documents, the court stated
                                        (at [68]–[69]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If confidence applies to a defendant who
                                                adventitiously, but without authorisation, obtains
                                                information in respect of which he must have
                                                appreciated that the claimant had an expectation of
                                                privacy, it must, <em>a
                                                  fortiori</em>, extend to a defendant who
                                                intentionally, and without authorisation, takes
                                                steps to obtain such information. It would seem to
                                                us to follow that <em>intentionally

                                                  private, is itself a breach of
                                                  confidence</em>. The notion that looking at
                                                documents which one knows to be confidential is
                                                itself capable of constituting an actionable wrong
                                                (albeit perhaps only in equity) is also consistent
                                                with the decision of the Strasbourg court that
                                                monitoring private telephone calls can infringe the
                                                article 8 rights of the caller: see Copland v United

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, <em>it would be a breach

                                                  authority of the claimant, to examine, or to make,

                                                It is of the essence of the claimant’s right to

                                                establishes a right of confidence in certain
                                                information contained in a document should be able
                                                to <b>restrain any threat by an
                                                  unauthorised defendant to look at, copy,
                                                  distribute any copies of, or to communicate, or

                                                return (or destruction) of any such document or
                                                copy. Without the court having the power to grant
                                                such relief, the information will, through the

                                        observations can be made from the decision. First, the court
                                        appears to have accepted a wide range of acts as capable of
                                        constituting breach: these are italicised above. They
                                        consist of the unauthorised acquisition of the information
                                        (whether by examining it or making copies) or the more
                                        conventional acts of use or disclosure of the information
                                        (such as, by supplying copies to a third party). The court
                                        could not condone the deliberate steps taken to purloin
                                        confidential documents without the consent of the plaintiff,
                                        and it seems that any act relating to, enabled by or flowing
                                        from the taking of confidential documents will be put to a
                                        stop. If the defendant was not entitled to the confidential
                                        information in the first place, the defendant would not be
                                        entitled to the confidential information no matter what was
                                        done. The court went on to pronounce at [74] that “equity
                                        fashions the appropriate relief to fit the rights of the
                                        parties, the facts of the case, and, at least sometimes, the
                                        wider merits”. It also seems that a threat to use or
                                        disclose was good enough for the law to intervene. From the
                                        words in bold cited above in <em>Imerman</em>, a breach of confidence may be
                                        established on threats to infringe on another’s right of
                                        confidentiality and relief would similarly be granted to
                                        restrain these threats. Such robust application of the law
                                        of confidence was justified for two reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_203-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
                                                reasonable expectation of privacy must be upheld.
                                                Because the case arose in the family context, the
                                                confidential information specifically concerned the
                                                husband’s private life and was covered by the right
                                                to respect private life in Art 8 of the European
                                                Convention on Human Rights. It should be noted that,
                                                since the House of Lords decision in <em>Campbell v MGN Ltd</em> [2004] 2 AC
                                                457, the right to respect private life has been
                                                incorporated in the English law of confidence: see
                                                [65].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_203-p2_b"></a>(b)     The unauthorised acts
                                                of the defendant must not be allowed to undermine
                                                the confidentiality of the information. If the
                                                defendant threatens to use or disclose the
                                                confidential information, he could be injuncted from
                                                doing so. If the information is already “out there”
                                                in the possession of one who should not have it,
                                                then a court order could be obtained to have it
                                                returned or destroyed: see [72]–[73]. It appears
                                                that the court was fully prepared to protect a
                                                plaintiff against the risk of loss of
                                                confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Most
                                        interestingly, the court did not view its decision as
                                        representing a new authority in English law that an
                                        injunction is available even in circumstances when the
                                        confidential information was not yet used. As Lord Neuberger
                                        of Abbotsbury MR observed at [71], it is not the position in
                                        English law that there has to be such misuse before a claim
                                        for breach of confidence can succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    I pause now to
                                        observe that, in both Australia and England, the courts
                                        recognised that a person who had received or taken
                                        confidential information, and had notice of its
                                        confidentiality, should not be allowed to act in a manner
                                        which is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s right of
                                        confidentiality. While it is commonly the case that use and
                                        disclosure of the information constitutes a breach of his
                                        obligation of confidence, the courts have accepted that
                                        accessing, acquiring or threatening to abuse the
                                        confidential information may also form a breach of
                                        confidence. The turning point for this development seems to
                                        be an awareness that an obligation of confidence is
                                        ineluctably shaped by the particular facts of the case. I
                                        can imagine that the relationship between the parties, the
                                        manner in which confidential information was obtained, the
                                        measures taken to safeguard confidentiality, <em>etc</em>, would define the boundary
                                        of the defendants’ obligation of confidence and, in turn,
                                        affect the analysis of whether the obligation was indeed
                                        breached. Thus, whether there has been breach of confidence
                                        appears to be a question of fact and degree that must be
                                        regarded in its wider context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Whilst it is not
                                        necessary for this court to reach a conclusion on whether
                                        the taking of documents by the defendants is a breach of
                                        confidence, I am minded to observe that the defendants have
                                        acted wholly inconsistently with their obligations of
                                        confidence to Clearlab. I return to the circumstances in
                                        which the documents were taken out of Clearlab. First, the
                                        sheer number of documents taken suggests that the
                                        ex-employees were taking the documents, not for the purposes
                                        of their work at Clearlab, but for accumulating documents to
                                        be potentially used at Aquilus. Ting admitted that the
                                        documents were taken for “reference”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> David similarly
                                        passed on certain documents on SOPs and OIs to Sara for
                                                “reference”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> From the way
                                        the defendants handled Clearlab’s documents prior to leaving
                                        Clearlab and after they started work for Aquilus, it is
                                        clear that the documents were treated as a resource that the
                                        defendants can freely use. Second, each of the ex-employees
                                        was in breach of cl 3 of their employment contract when they
                                        retained the confidential documents after their employment
                                        with Clearlab ended. The reasons for the breach of cl 3 are
                                        given below at [265]–[268]. The point being made now is that
                                        the ex-employees were not entitled to keep the confidential
                                        documents, much less use them for the benefit of Aquilus.
                                        The flagrant breach of contract would bolster a case that
                                        the defendants had, in the first place, surreptitiously
                                        acquired the documents without Clearlab’s
                                consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    According to the
                                        above principles, it would appear that the defendants
                                        breached their obligations of confidence to Clearlab in
                                        respect of the whole lot of documents that they had taken
                                        out of Clearlab. It is hardly an answer to a claim in
                                        confidence that certain documents in the defendants’
                                        collection of Clearlab’s documents were not actually used
                                        when each of these documents was wrongfully taken with the
                                        intention of using them. At its heart, the action for breach
                                        of confidence is to vindicate Clearlab’s right to preserve
                                        the confidentiality of its documents. To accept the
                                        defendants’ piecemeal analysis why certain documents cannot
                                        be used or to ignore that further use was prevented because
                                        of the timely interim injunction, and therefore decline to
                                        protect the documents that were not used, would undoubtedly
                                        do violence to Clearlab’s right of confidentiality. Thus,
                                        insofar as the documents can properly be regarded as
                                        confidential and were wrongfully taken from Clearlab with
                                        the view of using them, it would seem that there was a
                                        breach of confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Toh’s mould base design</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    Before leaving the
                                        breach of confidence action against the defendants, there is
                                        one final issue relating to the mould base design used at
                                        Aquilus. Clearlab argued that Toh from TRAXonline Solutions
                                        LLP copied features from the mould base design that he
                                        carried out for Clearlab in the mould base design that he
                                        later did for Aquilus. The way in which Clearlab put its
                                        case was as follows. When Toh designed the mould base for
                                        Clearlab’s moulding line “D”, he incorporated the best
                                        features from two of Clearlab’s existing mould base designs,
                                        which were known as the 1-Day mould base and the FRP mould
                                        base. In cross-examination, Toh was directed to look at the
                                        1-Day mould base, the FRP mould base and the new “D” mould
                                        base. Counsel for Clearlab pointed out that admissions were
                                        made by Toh that there are similarities between Clearlab’s
                                        existing mould bases and the “D” mould base that Toh
                                        designed for Clearlab. For example, both the FRP mould base
                                        and the “D” mould base had four cavities, a cooling channel,
                                        and a flat lock pin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> Next, counsel
                                        asserted that that Clearlab’s and Aquilus’ mould base
                                        designs were essentially the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    However it seemed
                                        to me that there was a missing step here. Even assuming that
                                        features from the 1-Day mould base and the FRP mould base
                                        were incorporated in the “D” mould base, it was not clear if
                                        they were also incorporated in Aquilus’ mould base. Further,
                                        there were alleged differences between the Clearlab’s and
                                        Aquilus’ mould bases which, if true, would directly rebut
                                        Clearlab’s assertion that certain features of Clearlab’s
                                        mould bases were replicated in Aquilus’ mould bases. For
                                        example, Toh’s evidence was that the hot runner in the mould
                                        bases was different because Clearlab used a Mold Master
                                        X-design, whereas Aquilus used a Husky H-design.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    The key question
                                        that arose here was whether Aquilus’ mould base design
                                        incorporated Clearlab’s confidential information. Looking at
                                        the limited evidence before me, I was unable to find that
                                        this was the case. Clearlab was therefore not entitled to a
                                        remedy in respect of the mould base design that Toh designed
                                        for Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ma and Li</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    I come now to the
                                        alleged breach of confidence by Ma and Li. This claim was
                                        mounted in respect of the supply of spin-cast machines by
                                        Optic to Aquilus. Such spin-cast machines essentially
                                        handled two steps of the manufacturing process; first, the
                                        spinning of lens monomer in mould casts and, second, the
                                        polymerisation of the lens monomer by exposing it to UV
                                        light.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Scope of Clearlab’s confidential
                                information</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    It should be
                                        recalled that Clearlab had no standing to sue in respect of
                                        the information that arose from Ma’s work for Clearlab.
                                        Thus, the breach of confidence claim against Ma and Li was
                                        confined to the information originating from Clearlab that
                                        was disclosed in confidence to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    The first step was
                                        to identify the information that was disclosed. There were
                                        two separate circumstances under which Ma received
                                        information. The first was when he was tasked with repairing
                                        and modifying the Dual Spinners at Clearlab. It was
                                        undisputed that Ma had made detailed drawings of the
                                        unmodified Dual spinners and was told the problems
                                        encountered with those Dual Spinners. The second was when Ma
                                        designed the Quad Spinner for Clearlab. This posed some
                                        evidentiary difficulty for Clearlab as Ting seemed to be the
                                        only person at Clearlab who had dealt with Ma in respect of
                                        his work on the Quad Spinner. I noted that Dr Park had the
                                        impression that Ting alone liaised with OSC and was
                                        personally unaware if any design specifications or details
                                        were given to Ma.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> Dr Park was
                                        therefore in no position to contradict Ma’s testimony that
                                        he had not received any design input from anyone from
                                                Clearlab.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> So
                                        based on Ma’s evidence, in total, he was given:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_213-p2_a"></a>(a)     full
                                                access to Dual Spinner;</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_213-p2_c"></a>(c)     some instructions on what the proposed spin-cast
                                                machine should have, which were:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       eight to ten spin tubes using one shared drive

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       adjustable UV fluorescent tubes with variable
                                                  exposure timings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_213-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       nitrogen-gas flow
                                        control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    Amongst these
                                        broad categories of information, I accepted that the details
                                        of the unmodified Dual Spinner in Clearlab (<em>ie</em>, category (a)) and the
                                        measurements taken of Clearlab’s casts (<em>ie</em>, category (b)) were protectable as
                                        confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Ting’s instructions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    The instructions
                                        given by Ting (<em>ie</em>, category
                                        (c)), however, appeared to be too broad to be capable of
                                        being protected as confidential information. In <em>De Maudsley v Palumbo and others</em>
                                        [1996] FSR 447 (“<em>De
                                        Maudsley</em>”), an idea for a dance club was held not
                                        to be protectable because its five composite elements were,
                                        individually or combined, far too vague and/or unoriginal to
                                        constitute confidential information. For ease of comparison,
                                        the unprotectable elements in <em>De
                                                Maudsley</em> are (a) the club would operate
                                        all night long, (b) the decor would be of “high tech
                                        industrial” warehouse style, (c) there would be separate
                                        areas for dancing, resting and socialising as well as a VIP
                                        lounge, (d) the acoustic design for the enclosed dance area
                                        would prevent sound, light and atmosphere to leak beyond the
                                        area, and (e) top disc jockeys would appear at the club. I
                                        found that there was a similar level of generality about
                                        Ting’s instructions to Ma that was fatal to a claim to their
                                        confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Unmodified Dual Spinner</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    As such,
                                        Clearlab’s case rested on the information contained in the
                                        Dual Spinner and the plastic casts (<em>ie</em>, categories (a) and (b)). What
                                        Clearlab must show was some significant fingerprints of
                                        copying reflected in certain details of the Lens Forming
                                        Machine that could only have come from the Dual Spinner or
                                        the sample of plastic casts given to Ma. As a preliminary
                                        note, because Clearlab analysed its confidentiality claim
                                        first in terms of the similarities between the Dual Spinner
                                        and the Quad Spinner, and then in terms of the similarities
                                        between the Quad Spinner and the Lens Forming Machine, it
                                        was difficult to reconcile which elements of the Dual
                                        Spinner was confidential, divulged on trust to OSC to be
                                        used for the restricted purpose of designing and building
                                        the Quad Spinner and used in breach of confidence to make
                                        the Lens Forming Machines in Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Nevertheless, from
                                        Clearlab’s submissions, there seemed to be three main
                                        aspects of or relating to the Dual Spinner that were said to
                                        be copied over to the Lens Forming Machines:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_217-p2_a"></a>(a)     Design improvements informed by the problems
                                                encountered with the Dual Spinner (such as the
                                                removal of quartz tubes because of the occurrence of
                                                breakage, the replacement of individual bearing
                                                housing with a single bearing plate to overcome
                                                re-alignment difficulties, and the usage of a
                                                belt-driven system instead of gears because gears
                                                experience more wear and tear).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_217-p2_b"></a>(b)     Careful selection of individual components and how
                                                they collectively form a workable machine. The
                                                emphasis is placed on the combination of all the
                                                individual components that form the
                                        design.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_217-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dimensions and
                                                specifications of the individual
                                        components.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    As far as (a) is
                                        concerned, it seemed to be an alternative way of presenting
                                        the argument that the features in Ma’s design were
                                        confidential to Clearlab. This argument did not go far
                                        because of the finding of fact made earlier, which was that
                                        Clearlab and OSC each retained its own confidential
                                        information. Therefore, Clearlab was precluded from claiming
                                        a breach of confidence based on the information generated by
                                        Ma.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    As to (b), the
                                        challenge for Clearlab was to show that the combination of
                                        individual components in the unmodified Dual Spinner was
                                        used in the Lens Forming Machine. Ma and Li may not be
                                        liable if they had only used some of the components. This
                                        put Clearlab in an unusual position because its pleaded case
                                        was that there were problems with the unmodified Dual
                                        Spinner that Ma had solved by modifying some components. To
                                        the extent that Ma’s solutions were carried over to the Lens
                                        Forming Machine, there were necessarily differences between
                                        the two spin-cast machines. This made it difficult for
                                        Clearlab to show that Ma had taken, in substance, the
                                        whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    Even absenting
                                        these differences flowing from flaws in the unmodified Dual
                                        Spinner, there was scant evidence on how the combination of
                                        the components in the unmodified Dual Spinner was used in
                                        the Lens Forming Machine. Ma did admit to using the Quad
                                        Spinner design for the Lens Forming Machine, but that had
                                        little relevance unless it could be shown that the Quad
                                        Spinner was largely identical to the unmodified Dual Spinner
                                        in terms of the combination of their components. There was
                                        an opinion from Clearlab’s expert witness that the Quad
                                        Spinner was derived from the Dual Spinner because the form
                                        factors (or modular build-up) and eight interior
                                        characteristics of the Dual Spinner and the Quad Spinner
                                        were similar. However, there was some doubt as to this
                                        opinion because it seemed to have ignored features that were
                                        dissimilar, such as the increase in the width of the
                                        vertical rods in the Dual Spinner and the Quad Spinner.
                                        Therefore, I was not convinced, on a balance of
                                        probabilities, that Ma had indeed made use of that
                                        combination of the components in the unmodified Dual Spinner
                                        for the Lens Form Machine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    As to (c), the
                                        same issue with evidentiary proof surfaced. Clearlab had
                                        asserted that the specifications and dimensions of the
                                        individual components were confidential and that they were
                                        used in the Lens Forming Machine, but this assertion was not
                                        borne out from the evidence. For example, it was alleged
                                        that the inner diameter of the spinning column, which was
                                        dictated by the outer diameter of the mould casts, was
                                        copied. However, Ma’s evidence was that there was a
                                        difference in the size of Clearlab’s and Aquilus’ casts, and
                                        therefore a difference in the inner diameters in the
                                        spinning columns in the Quad Spinner and the Lens Forming
                                        Machine. For the Quad Spinner, the inner diameter was said
                                        to be 25.4mm because the largest outer diameter of all the
                                        mould casts that Clearlab had given him to measure was
                                        25.385mm. To get 25.4mm from 25.385mm, Ma explained that he
                                        would add an allowable gap of 0.015mm. This was the space
                                        between the mould cast and the wall of the spinning column
                                        when the mould cast was fitted into the spinning column. In
                                        contrast, for the Lens Forming Machine, Ma stated that the
                                        inner diameter was 25.35mm because Aquilus had stipulated
                                        that its casts’ outer diameter would be 25.335mm. While
                                        Clearlab disputed that Ma had used the measurement of
                                        25.385mm for Clearlab’s Quad Spinner (there was some
                                        suggestion that the 25.335mm was in fact used because Wong,
                                        Clearlab’s engineering manager, testified that the outer
                                        diameter of Clearlab’s casts was 25.335mm),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> I was not shown
                                        any evidence that the inner diameter of the Quad Spinner was
                                        not 25.4mm but 25.35mm. In the end, Clearlab had not proven
                                        that its confidential dimensions were embodied in the
                                        defendants’ Lens Forming Machine or that Ma copied its
                                        dimensions and specifications. There was therefore no breach
                                        of confidence under this head as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    More generally,
                                        Clearlab suggested that Ma and Li would not have been able
                                        to make any spin-cast machines if they had not seen
                                        Clearlab’s Dual Spinner because a spin-cast machine was a
                                        very specific application with specific issues. But I was
                                        not persuaded by this argument. First, there were patents on
                                        spin-cast machine which showed some features that a
                                        spin-cast machine should have. For example, US Patent No
                                        4,732,714 discloses that there should be a vertical spin
                                        tube to hold the mould casts in a column, a system of
                                        bearings, pulleys and belt that is driven by a motor to spin
                                        the tube, as well as the use of inert gas to remove oxygen
                                        and UV light for curing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> Second, Clearlab
                                        acknowledged that Ma may have experience in designing
                                        machines more complicated than the Quad Spinner. Third, the
                                        defendants’ expert witness opined that the functionalities
                                        of a spin-cast machine drive its design features, thus an
                                        understanding of these functions would lead Ma to the
                                        appropriate design. It was therefore not shown, on a balance
                                        of probabilities, that Ma could not have created a Lens
                                        Forming Machine without having seen Clearlab’s Dual
                                        Spinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    All in all, the
                                        breach of confidence action mounted against Ma and Li has
                                        failed. It followed that the reliefs sought against Ma and
                                        Li, insofar as they pertained to the confidential
                                        information in the Dual Spinner, Quad Spinner and Lens
                                        Forming Machine, would not be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conspiracy by unlawful means</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    Clearlab had also
                                        claimed that all the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy
                                        to breach Clearlab’s rights of confidentiality. There were
                                        two separate allegations made. The thrust of the first
                                        allegation was that all the defendants and/or Toh had
                                        combined to steal Clearlab’s confidential information and
                                        use it in Aquilus (“the First Conspiracy Claim”). The thrust
                                        of the second allegation was that Ma, Li and Ting, as well
                                        as the firms that they operated, OSC and Optic, had
                                        conspired to sell spin-cast machines to Aquilus that
                                        contained Clearlab’s confidential information (“the Second
                                        Conspiracy Claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The First Conspiracy Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    At its heart, the
                                        First Conspiracy Claim was grounded on the coordination
                                        amongst all the defendants to replicate Clearlab’s
                                        manufacturing processes in Aquilus. There was ample evidence
                                        supporting the existence of a plan to set up a competing
                                        business using Clearlab’s confidential information, and its
                                        execution by certain defendants. I had no difficulty in
                                        holding that the claim was made out against these
                                        defendants. What Clearlab did not satisfy me was that all of
                                        the defendants and Toh were implicated. On the facts before
                                        me, the claim could only be sustained against the
                                        ex-employees, Ho and Aquilus. Nothing turned on the conduct
                                        of the sixth to eighth defendants and Toh. There was no
                                        evidence that they were participants in the conspiracy. The
                                        reasons are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    The undisputed
                                        facts were that, at the inception of Aquilus, Ho came up
                                        with $200,000 for Aquilus’ start-up capital and had
                                        included, as one of Aquilus’ principal activities, the
                                        manufacturing of optic goods. Ho said that by October 2010
                                        he had decided that Aquilus would manufacture contact
                                        lenses. In December 2010, Aquilus committed to lease 13,000
                                        square feet of factory space at $15,000 per month for at
                                        least two years. This represented a commitment of $360,000.
                                        Further costs, estimated at $2m, were spent on machinery. In
                                        early 2011 Aquilus had started paying rent and placing
                                        orders for machinery even though it did not have a single
                                        employee on its payroll with the technical know how to make
                                        contact lens. It should be recalled that Ting only started
                                        working full-time at Aquilus on 3 May 2011, and David, Goh
                                        and Ng started even later on 1 August 2011. This meant that
                                        Ho had ventured into the business of contact lens
                                        manufacturing and had committed to a sizeable investment
                                        without any technical ability for it. For months, there was
                                        no one in Aquilus who could actually manufacture the contact
                                        lens. This did not accord with Ho’s testimony that he had
                                        planned to recoup his investment in merely three years by
                                        selling a targeted one million contact lenses per
                                                month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    The evidence that
                                        then emerged pointed to Ho being assured that he had
                                        procured the technical expertise that would enable him to
                                        implement his business plan within a very short time. First,
                                        Ho displayed a lackadaisical attitude towards hiring the
                                        “technical people”. His evidence was that, for the whole of
                                        2010, apart from approaching Ting, he did not look for any
                                        other person. He said that in 2011, he persisted in
                                        persuading Ting to join and that he received a hint from
                                        Ting that he would join in March. That was also when Ting
                                        started attending Aquilus meetings even as he was still
                                        working in Clearlab; Ting did not leave Clearlab until April
                                        2011. Then from March to May 2011, Ho reverted to passivity
                                        and said he did not look for any employees. Second, when Ho
                                        was asked of his contingency plan in the event that the
                                        ex-employees refused to join Aquilus, he initially stated
                                        that he could get CIBA Vision employees to join Aquilus. But
                                        he immediately changed his position to state that he could
                                        easily hire the right people for Aquilus:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    It was clear from
                                        the evidence that Ho did not have a contingency plan; he did
                                        not need one because he had the assurance that the
                                        ex-employees would join Aquilus. As it turned out, this
                                        belief was neither misconstrued nor misplaced as each of the
                                        ex-employees did join Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    I turn to consider
                                        the conduct of Ting. It seemed clear to me that his
                                        involvement with Aquilus began even while he was still
                                        employed in Clearlab. Starting from 7 March 2011, the
                                        undisputed evidence was that Ting attended Aquilus meetings
                                        and was assigned tasks to carry out, such as giving his

                                        to Ting while he was still paid a salary by Clearlab, the
                                        entity that Aquilus was in direct competition with. In light
                                        of the number of tasks that was assigned to Ting, his
                                        strenuous assertion that he was only attending the meetings
                                        as a “visitor” was scarcely believable. While Ting also
                                        denied doing any of the assigned tasks until 19 April
                                                2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> the minutes
                                        of meeting painted a different picture. They showed that his
                                        task list was updated at each meeting; certain tasks that he
                                        was assigned earlier did not feature in the minutes of
                                        subsequent meetings. New tasks were assigned to him at
                                        various meetings. For example, in the meeting on 14 March
                                        2011, one of Ting’s task was to await the quotation for
                                        “Spinner (6 units)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> Two
                                        weeks later, in the meeting of 28 March 2011, Ting was to
                                        revert on the status of the spinner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> In addition, he was
                                        given a new task of obtaining a quotation for an air
                                        compressor to compare with a quotation that Aquilus had
                                                received.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span>
                                        This suggested that Ting had completed some tasks and that
                                        he was entrusted with more to do. Further, Ting admitted to
                                        have helped<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> prepare a seed
                                        funding proposal that was submitted to SPRING Singapore in
                                        the first week of March 2011. There was a whole host of
                                        evidence showing that, from at least early March 2011, while
                                        still employed by the Clearlab, Ting had a central role in
                                        the establishment of Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    The evidence also
                                        showed that Ho had heavily relied on Ting’s expertise and
                                        experience to get production up very quickly. Thus, the
                                        SPRING seed funding proposal<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> which
                                        was prepared in March 2011 made claims that Ting was
                                        Aquilus’ technical director, even though he was still
                                        employed by Clearlab. From this evidence, it seems Ting’s
                                        position in Aquilus was already secured at the very latest,
                                        by March 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    As for David, Goh
                                        and Ng, sometime in early May, Ting contacted each of
                                                them<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> and secured their
                                        consent to work for Aquilus. David signed a letter of offer
                                        from Aquilus on 9 May 2011, and Goh and Ng signed theirs,
                                        one day later, on 10 May 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span>
                                        Towards the end of the month, they resigned from Clearlab;
                                        David resigned on 26 May 2011, Goh, on 30 May 2011, and Ng,
                                        on 25 May 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    A fact that leapt
                                        out of the evidence was that, after tendering their
                                        resignation to Clearlab in late May 2011, David and Goh
                                        accessed various documents in Clearlab on topics ranging
                                        from SOPs to material specifications. The nature of such
                                        access was that all documents were accessed within seconds
                                        and minutes from one document to the next.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> Such speed
                                        suggested that they were trawling through Clearlab’s
                                        collection of documents rather than reading those documents.
                                        Combined with the evidence of the huge number of Clearlab’s
                                        documents found in Aquilus’ computers and storage devices,
                                        the clear inference was that David and Goh had downloaded
                                        those documents for the benefit of Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    In the case of Ng,
                                        confidential documents, such as those relating to the
                                        production output of Clearlab’s daily lenses, were emailed
                                        by him to his personal email account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> These emails were
                                        mostly sent after the date of his resignation from Clearlab.
                                        Further, Ng admitted to doing “housekeeping” of his Clearlab
                                        emails before leaving Clearlab, which involved and
                                        forwarding those that appeared useful to his personal email
                                                account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    It was clear from
                                        the evidence that David, Goh and Ng had intended to take and
                                        did take the pertinent confidential information out of
                                        Clearlab before their two-month notice period ended. They
                                        had collected such documents from Clearlab as they had felt
                                        could be needed for the various processes, such as
                                        validation and design. As for Ting, his employment at
                                        Clearlab was terminated on 26 April 2011 and so he relied on
                                        David to send him the necessary information. From 27 May
                                        2011 to 1 July 2011, Ting directed David to send him
                                        specific documents, and David complied.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> The combined
                                        efforts of the ex-employees culminated in the passing of a
                                        substantial number of Clearlab’s documents to Aquilus. These
                                        include the full suite of Clearlab’s lens
                                                formulations,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> and the

                                        2011, the first day of the search, what was clear was that
                                        Ho and the ex-employees had quickly deleted documents. Ho,
                                        in a span of minutes, deleted some 13,000 documents from

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    I also found that

                                        showed that the conspirators had intended to injure

                                        in the same market, the conspirators had intended to injure
                                        Clearlab by causing a loss of its profit. In <em>Chew Kong Huat and others v Ricwil

                                        the Court of Appeal found at [35] that damage to the

                                        to the defendant, a direct competitor. In that case, the
                                        court had no difficulty finding that there was an intention
                                        to injure the plaintiff in those
                                circumstances.</p>

                                        Aquilus was breach of confidence. While the scope of
                                        “unlawful means” for the purposes of conspiracy by unlawful
                                        means is yet to be settled (see the remarks of the Court of
                                        Appeal in <em>EFT Holdings</em> at
                                        [91]–[93]), in <em>Faccenda Chicken
                                                (Ch)</em> at 602, Goulding J accepted that a
                                        breach of confidence could form the requisite unlawful means
                                        for establishing a conspiracy by unlawful means. This is
                                        implicit from the way Goulding J proceeded to determine
                                        whether the claim of conspiracy can be made out by analysing
                                        if the wrongful act (<em>ie</em>, the
                                        abuse of confidential information) by itself was actionable
                                        or if there was a sole or predominant purpose to injure the
                                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    As for the last
                                        element, (e), Clearlab submitted that it suffered loss as a
                                        result of the defendants’ wrongful combination, and that its
                                        losses were the significant legal and professional fees that
                                        Clearlab had to incur in prosecuting this action and the
                                        management time that has been diverted away from its
                                        business. While it is not clear that all of the above losses
                                        are the kinds of loss relevant to the tort of conspiracy by
                                        unlawful means, based on the relevant legal authorities
                                        before me, I accept at least that the loss required in
                                        element (e) has a broad scope. It can consist of the expense
                                        in unravelling and detecting the unlawful machinations of
                                        the defendants (<em>British Motor Trade

                                        or the cost of managerial and staff time spent in
                                        investigating, or mitigating the consequences of, the
                                        conspiracy (<em>Lonrho Plc and others v Fayed

                                        connection, I observed that Clearlab had expended money to
                                        have IT forensic experts uncover what the confidential
                                        documents that the ex-employees had taken were, and
                                        significant time and effort had been expended to analyse
                                        what of its information had been illegitimately used in
                                        Aquilus. These flowed from the conspiracy and may constitute
                                        the damages required in element (e).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    In light of the
                                        above, I concluded that the ex-employees, Ho and Aquilus
                                        joined in a conspiracy to injure Clearlab by unlawful means.
                                        They all had the same objective of taking and using
                                        confidential information belonging to Clearlab for the
                                        benefit of Aquilus. In carrying out those acts, they had
                                        committed a breach of confidence and caused injury to
                                        Clearlab. Accordingly, their liability under this tort is
                                        complete.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Central Global, Ma, Li and Toh were not
                                involved</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    In contrast, there
                                        was no evidence that the sixth to eighth defendants and Toh
                                        were associated in the combination. According to Clearlab,
                                        each of them had specifically brought Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information to Aquilus. Their individual roles
                                        were highlighted to me. The sixth defendant, Central Global,
                                        was in charge of collecting the layout of Clearlab’s
                                        premises, which it had access to when it performed the 49
                                        cases of remodelling and repair works for Clearlab. The
                                        seventh and eight defendants, Ma and Li, were tasked with
                                        supplying Aquilus with Quad Spinners. Finally, Toh was
                                        responsible for supplying Aquilus with a mould base that
                                        bore the same features as Clearlab’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    But there was
                                        insufficient evidence that their acts were a step in the
                                        execution of the common wrongful purpose. The essence of
                                        conspiracy is a combination (<em>ie</em>, element (a)); if it cannot be shown
                                        that a defendant had an intention to join the conspiracy or
                                        was a party to the combination, then that is fatal to the
                                        allegation of conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    In relation to the
                                        claim against Central Global, Clearlab submitted that
                                        Central Global was Ho’s corporate vehicle. However, it could
                                        not be inferred that a company is participating in a
                                        conspiracy simply because it is related to another defendant
                                        who is party to the conspiracy. The inclusion of Central
                                        Global as a co-conspirator was therefore without merit. In
                                        relation to the claim against Ma and Li, Clearlab submitted
                                        that there was a financial arrangement in place amongst
                                        Ting, Ma and Li such that Ting would somehow benefit from
                                        the profits of OSC and Optic. But, crucially, Clearlab did
                                        not furnish any evidence to show that Ma and Li were aware
                                        of a plan to take confidential information out of Clearlab
                                        for the benefit of Aquilus. While I accept that a
                                        conspirator need not be aware of all the details of a
                                        conspiracy, I would think that the conspirator must at least
                                        know of its general nature and has agreed to it by taking
                                        action in pursuit of it. In fact, Ma and Li seemed to be
                                        ignorant of the plan, which meant that it was impossible
                                        that they have agreed to it. Further, the allegation that
                                        there was a financial arrangement amongst Ting, Ma and Li
                                        involved a great conjectural leap and was not bridged by
                                        cogent evidence. The same allegation was made and elaborated
                                        in the Second Conspiracy Claim; as such, I have given my
                                        reasons for rejecting it at [255] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    To summarise, the
                                        existence of any combination cannot be inferred from the
                                        objective facts and the claim of conspiracy against the
                                        sixth to eighth defendants and Toh must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Conspiracy Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    The Second
                                        Conspiracy Claim can be dismissed for the simple reason that
                                        I have earlier held that there was no breach of confidence
                                        in Ma’s and Li’s supply of the Lens Forming Machine to
                                        Aquilus. As it was not shown that there was any element of
                                        unlawfulness involved in this claim of conspiracy by
                                        unlawful means, the claim necessarily fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    Nevertheless, I
                                        will consider, briefly, Clearlab’s arguments. There were two
                                        main pegs on which the allegation of the Second Conspiracy
                                        Claim was hung.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    First, it was
                                        contended that Ma and Li set up Optic as a smokescreen to
                                        conceal that they had sold what was essentially the same
                                        Quad Spinner to Aquilus. It should be recalled that the Quad
                                        Spinner was sold to Clearlab under the banner of OSC, and
                                        that Optic was only set up later to supply Lens Forming
                                        Machines to Aquilus. Clearlab emphasised that Optic was not
                                        treated separately from OSC because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_251-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
                                                accounts of Optic and OSC were commingled: not only
                                                was the starting balance of $500 in Optic’s account
                                                transferred from OSC’s account,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> $60,000 was also
                                                taken from Optic’s account to reimburse Li for the
                                                  top-up<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> that she made
                                                to OSC’s account (so that OSC can refund to Clearlab
                                                for the cancelled order for a cartoning
                                                machine).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_251-p2_b"></a>(b)     The email address used
                                                by Li to send Optic’s quotations to Aquilus was her
                                                OSC email address.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_251-p2_c"></a>(c)     Most importantly, it was the same person, Ma, who
                                                designed the spin-cast machines for Clearlab (in
                                                OSC’s name) and for Aquilus (in Optic’s
                                                name).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    However, I was
                                        unable to infer from the setting up of Optic that Ma and Li
                                        combined with Ting for some wrongful purpose. No one
                                        disputed that Optic was set up so that Ma and Li could
                                        distance themselves from OSC when supplying to Aquilus. As
                                        mentioned at [58], Li frankly stated that she recognised
                                        that Clearlab would terminate their relationship if it
                                        learnt that OSC was supplying machines to Aquilus, a
                                        competitor, because she herself had previously stopped
                                        working with a vendor who did work for her
                                                competitor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> In other
                                        words, Li’s evidence was that Optic was a front to show to
                                        Clearlab that OSC was not supplying to its competitor in
                                        order to retain Clearlab as a customer. I accepted her
                                        evidence in this regard. I found that it cohered with her
                                        conduct of setting up Optic to give an outward appearance of
                                        two separate firms, but not bothering to maintain separate
                                        accounts, email addresses or different teams of engineers to
                                        work on the machines. As such, I did not see how the mere
                                        existence of Optic showed that Ma, Li and Ting were in a
                                        combination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    I now turn to
                                        Clearlab’s second contention, which was that Ting was given
                                        OSC’s and Optic’s bank account statements because he had a
                                        financial interest in OSC and Optic, and his furtive conduct
                                        in discarding the bank account statements in the night of
                                        execution of the search order served to strengthen the
                                        inference about his financial interest in OSC and Optic.
                                        Once again, the critical issue was whether the evidence
                                        about Ting’s possession and subsequent disposal of OSC's and
                                        Optic's bank account statements showed that Ma, Li and Ting
                                        were in a combination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    On one hand, Ma,
                                        Li and Ting sought to explain that the bank statements were
                                        merely used to negotiate the price that Aquilus would pay
                                        for the Integrated Primary Packaging Machine (“IPPM”). On
                                        the other hand, Clearlab challenged this explanation as
                                        being riddled with inconsistencies. The main inconsistencies
                                        alleged were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_254-p2_a"></a>(a)     In
                                                his AEIC, Ting said that it was Ma<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> who provided him
                                                with the bank statements, but on cross-examination,
                                                Ting changed his tune and said it was Li<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> who gave him the
                                                statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_254-p2_b"></a>(b)     Ting explained that Li
                                                wanted to show their “cash flow
                                                  tightness”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> but:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_254-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       this was not borne out from the bank
                                                  statements because the bank statements showed a
                                                  positive balance every month, and in the month of
                                                  April 2011, the average balance even exceeded

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_254-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       this was a new explanation Ting offered on the
                                                  stand: the explanation given by Ting in his AEIC
                                                  was simply that losses were suffered as a result
                                                  of Clearlab’s cancellation of its order for the
                                                  cartoning machine and the bank statements were
                                                  used to prove the operating costs and the amounts
                                                  that were spent buying materials to make the

                                                were used to show that Li had not overcharged

                                                AEIC and did not make sense because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_254-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       the bank statements did not show if a
                                                  particular machine was overpriced;
                                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_254-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the more logical thing for Li to do was to
                                                  show Ting the invoices from the vendors or a

                                                bank statements were to demonstrate that OSC did not

                                                amendment of Li’s AEIC to state that the Ma and Li
                                                only “offered” to provide the bank statements at
                                                that time, there would have been a discrepancy in
                                                the accounts given by Ting and
                                Li.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    In light of the
                                        above, I accepted that serious doubt was cast on Ma’s, Li’s
                                        and Ting’s explanation that Ting possessed the bank
                                        statements solely for negotiating and discussing the price
                                        of the IPPM. Having said that, it did not necessarily lead
                                        to the conclusion that Ting had a financial interest in OSC
                                        and Optic, and therefore Ma and Li were involved in a
                                        conspiracy with him. Because even assuming that their
                                        explanation was false, it did not mean that there was a
                                        conspiracy. There was a significant gap between Ting’s
                                        possession of the bank statements and the further inference
                                        that he had a combination with Ma and Li which involved a
                                        financial arrangement amongst the three of them. While Ting
                                        had financially benefited OSC and Optic in some ways
                                                (<em>eg</em>, Ting had given
                                        OSC the job to construct the Quad Spinner and also referred
                                        Ho to Ma for the job to construct the Lens Forming
                                        Machines), he had also taken certain actions which were
                                        financially detrimental to OSC. I refer to Ting’s urging of
                                        Ma and Li to forgo the upfront payment of the cartoning
                                        machine when the order was cancelled. When Clearlab first
                                        notified Ma that it wished to cancel the order for the
                                        cartoning machine, it stated that the cancellation costs
                                        that it was willing to pay OSC were “not more than
                                        S$28,000”. Ma replied that he needed to charge $30,000 to
                                        cover his costs. In a surprising turn of events, the email
                                        from Clearlab then stated: “Thank you for your final
                                        decision after Mr Ting approach [<em>sic</em>] for the cancellation of this
                                        equipment at no cost.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> Clearly, between
                                        these last two emails, Ting had successfully persuaded Ma
                                        and Li to accept Clearlab’s cancellation without asking for
                                        recompense, which they would have been entitled to. This did
                                        not seem to me like an act of a person protecting his
                                        financial interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    As such, after
                                        weighing the evidence before me, I was neither able to find
                                        that Ting had a financial interest in OSC and Optic, nor a
                                        combination amongst Ting, Ma and Li. The Second Conspiracy
                                        Claim correspondingly failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of employment contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    The conduct of the
                                        ex-employees was also the subject of a series of claims for
                                        breach of employment contract. Ting was alleged to have
                                        breached clauses prohibiting him from soliciting Clearlab’s
                                        employees and customers as well as a clause to serve
                                        Clearlab exclusively during the course of his employment. In
                                        addition, all the ex-employees were alleged to have
                                        breached: (a) a non-compete clause, (b) a “Return of
                                        Materials” clause, and (c) a duty of good faith and
                                        fidelity. As most of these clauses were drafted plainly and
                                        unambiguously, the issue of breach involved more or less a
                                        straightforward factual inquiry.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Non-solicitation of employee
                                clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    Clause 2(c) of
                                        Appendix A of the employment contract provided that Ting,
                                        for a period of time after the termination of his
                                        employment, was not to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… directly or indirectly, employ, attempt to employ,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    There were two
                                        points in this clause that needed to be clarified. The first
                                        was the period of restraint. In Ting’s original employment
                                        contract, the period of restraint was stated to be six
                                        months. Sometime after Ting signed the employment contract,
                                        Clearlab’s Head of Human Resource, Low Bee Hee (“Low”),
                                        informed Ting that there was a management decision to change
                                        the period from six months to two years. The hard copy of
                                        Ting’s employment contract was therefore amended by hand on
                                        14 October 2008, and Ting and Low countersigned against the
                                        amendment. In the present proceedings, the defendants
                                        emphasised in their pleaded defence that the amendment was
                                        done at the insistence of Clearlab. I recognised that this
                                        flagged a potential issue of whether the amendment was
                                        valid. But the issue did not arise, at least in respect of
                                        this alleged breach. The alleged acts of soliciting took
                                        place within one month of Ting’s dismissal from Clearlab. As
                                        such, be the period of restraint six months or two years, if
                                        the allegations were proven true, Ting would have breached
                                        this clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    The second was the
                                        definition of a “Key Employee”. In cl 7(c) of Appendix A of
                                        the employment contract, the meaning of “Key Employee” was
                                        stated to be:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… any employee of [Clearlab] who is or was (in the
                                                Period) employed to the knowledge of the Employees
                                                at management grade or in a senior capacity or in a
                                                capacity in which he/she has access to or obtained
                                                Confidential Information and in respect of whom the
                                                Employee exercise control or had managerial
                                                responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The crucial words were: “in respect of whom the Employee
                                        exercise control or had managerial responsibility”. The
                                        “Employee” is defined as Ting in the preamble to the
                                        employment contract. The only question therefore was whether
                                        David, Goh and Ng were under the control or management of
                                        Ting. I found that this must be the case. As the Head of
                                        Engineering and Technology Development, Ting had purview
                                        over the work that David, Goh and Ng undertook in Clearlab.
                                        It followed that David, Goh and Ng were “Key Employees” for
                                        the purposes of cl 2(c) of Appendix A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    Turning now to the
                                        evidence, it was clear that Ting solicited David, Goh and Ng
                                        to join Aquilus. David, Goh and Ng individually confirmed
                                        that Ting had offered them a job at Aquilus in May
                                                2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> which led to their
                                        signing of Aquilus’ letter of offer on either 9 or 10 May
                                                2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> Their evidence
                                        was not challenged by Ting. Accordingly, I found that Ting
                                        breached this clause.</p>

                                        provided that Ting was not to:</p>

                                        Ting solicited one of its customers was an email sent by Loh
                                        Tang Meng (allegedly from Kwang Meng Co Pte Ltd, one of
                                        Clearlab’s customers in China) to Dr Park saying that “Ting
                                        did give a call to our company informing that he is not with

                                        contents of the email, however, were inadmissible because
                                        Loh Tang Meng was not produced as a witness, and therefore
                                        the contents of the email were hearsay evidence. As there
                                        was no further evidence to show that Ting solicited a
                                        customer of Clearlab’s, the claim that cl 2(d)(i) of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Employee shall not at any time during his/her
                                                employment hereunder except with the written consent
                                                of [Clearlab], engage, be concerned or interested in
                                                any other business, undertaking, activity, trade or
                                                profession or occupation whatsoever other than that
                                                of [Clearlab].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clearlab submitted that Ting had breached cl 11.1 by attending
                                        meetings at Aquilus while he was still employed by Clearlab.
                                        Ting’s attendance at these meetings began as early as 7
                                        March 2011, and continued after the termination of his
                                        employment at Clearlab on 26 April 2011. Earlier, I have
                                        also held at [229] that Ting was not merely attending the
                                        meetings as an observer; he was also doing work for Aquilus.
                                        In these circumstances, it was undoubtedly the case that
                                        Ting breached cl 11.1.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    Clause 2(a) of
                                        Appendix A of the employment contract stipulated that the

                                        after the termination or expiration of their employment with
                                        Clearlab “carry on or be concerned, engaged, or interested
                                        in any part of trade or business which involves the

                                        competition with Clearlab. For David and Ng, the period of
                                        restraint was two years. For Goh, it was six months. And for
                                        Ting, as mentioned earlier, it was either two years or six
                                        months. All the ex-employees commenced full-time work in
                                        Aquilus less than a month after leaving Clearlab. They had
                                        all breached the non-compete clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">“Return of Materials” clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    Clause 3 of
                                        Appendix A of the employment contract required the
                                        ex-employees to return all property belonging to Clearlab
                                        and not to remove or destroy materials containing
                                        “Proprietary Information”. The clause, in full,
                                        stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Employee agrees that, upon the termination or
                                                expiration of the Employment, he/she shall
                                                immediately return to the Company all property in
                                                his/her possession, use or control, including all
                                                originals and any and all copies of any files,
                                                documents, computer disks, works and other materials
                                                containing any Proprietary Information or any
                                                Proprietary Information of any third party. The
                                                Employee shall not remove, or cause or permit the
                                                removal, from the Company’s facilities, or carry out
                                                any unauthorized destruction of, any originals or
                                                copies of any files, documents, works and other
                                                materials containing any Proprietary Information or
                                                any proprietary information of any third
                                                party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    The term
                                        “Proprietary Information” was undefined in the employment
                                        contract. But given that the clause unreservedly sought the
                                        return of all property that Clearlab regarded to be its own,
                                        it would appear to encompass Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information. Thus, read as a whole, I found that the clause
                                        prohibited the ex-employees from keeping, removing,
                                        destroying any material which contained its own or a third
                                        party’s confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    The most obvious
                                        breach of this clause was the amassing of Clearlab’s
                                        confidential documents by the ex-employees for use in
                                        Aquilus. As was evident from the discussion on breach of
                                        confidence by the first to fifth and ninth defendants, each
                                        of the ex-employees had a hand in taking the relevant
                                        confidential documents from Clearlab and keeping them within
                                        reach while they were working in Aquilus. In
                                        particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_267-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ting
                                                admitted, at one point, that he did not return
                                                “[s]ome, not many”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> documents and, at
                                                a later point, that he had retained “one Clearlab
                                                file [which] is the quality plan file”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_267-p2_b"></a>(b)     David admitted that he took 1,500 documents from
                                                Clearlab. Although David asserted that many of these
                                                documents could be found in the public
                                                  domain,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span>
                                                I found that there were at least some, amongst the
                                                1,500, which were confidential to Clearlab and
                                                retained by David for the purpose of being used in
                                                Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_267-p2_c"></a>(c)     Goh agreed that the
                                                four insert blank drawings found in Nancy Looi’s
                                                hard disk were the same as the ones he requested
                                                from Clearlab’s document control
                                                  department.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> This raised an
                                                inference that Goh had taken these drawings and
                                                uploaded them into the hard disk.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_267-p2_d"></a>(d)     Ng
                                                admitted that he emailed to himself:</p>

<p class="Judg-2">and that these documents were deleted after the
                                                execution of the search order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    In light of the
                                        above, it was clear to me that each of the ex-employees
                                        breached the “Return of Materials” clause. If there was any
                                        lingering doubt that the ex-employees breached their
                                        contract in failing to return confidential documents to
                                        Clearlab, it was put to rest by: (a) the fact that at least
                                        299 Clearlab’s documents made their way into Nancy Looi’s
                                        hard disk,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span> which could not
                                        have been obtained by anyone other than the ex-employees,
                                        and (b) the decision of Ting, David and Ho to delete
                                        documents in the midst of the execution of the search order,
                                        as that palpably suggested that Clearlab’s documents were
                                        being kept by the ex-employees as at the date of the search
                                        order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duty of good faith and fidelity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    Lastly, Clearlab
                                        submitted that the ex-employees breached a duty of good
                                        faith and fidelity. This was said to consist of an implied
                                        duty of fidelity as well as the express duties listed under
                                        cl 3.3 of the employment contract. It was essential to note
                                        that the duty of good faith and fidelity, whether as an
                                        implied term or expressly enshrined in cl 3.3, concerned the
                                        employee’s conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                                        the employer during the course of employment. Thus, only the
                                        particulars which relate to the ex-employee’s conduct during
                                        their employment with Clearlab were relevant. I found that
                                        they involved two main types of conduct: (a) the acts of the
                                        ex-employees in taking confidential information from their
                                        ex-employer, Clearlab, with the intention to use it for
                                        their new employer, Aquilus, and (b) Ting’s attendance at
                                        Aquilus’ meetings whilst employed by Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    In relation to
                                        (a), since <em>Robb v Green</em> [1895]
                                        2 QB 315 (“<em>Robb v Green</em>”), it
                                        is well-settled that the taking of an employer’s
                                        confidential information for one’s own benefit and to the
                                        detriment of the employer is a breach of good faith. Just as
                                        the defendant in <em>Robb v Green</em>
                                        was in breach for copying names and addresses of customers
                                        from the plaintiff’s order-book in order to contact them and
                                        induce them to transfer their custom to him after his
                                        employment with the plaintiff ceased, the ex-employees in
                                        the present case were clearly in breach by taking
                                        confidential information from Clearlab in order to set up a
                                        competing business in Aquilus. The only difference between
                                        the two cases is that the court in <em>Robb v
                                                Green</em> had to resort to an implied term,
                                        whereas in the present case, there is no need to because cl
                                        3.3(c) of the employment contract sets out the specific duty
                                        that was breached. Clause 3.3(c) provided that the
                                        ex-employees were “not to do and to exercise all reasonable
                                        endeavours to prevent there being done everything which may
                                        be prejudicial or detrimental to [Clearlab] or any Group
                                        Company”. That was undoubtedly breached by the ex-employees
                                        in taking Clearlab’s confidential information with an
                                        intention of using it in Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_271"></a>271    In relation to
                                        (b), there was an obvious failure by Ting “to devote the
                                        whole of his/her time, attention and abilities and the full
                                        benefit of his/her knowledge, expertise and skills in the
                                        proper performance of his/her duties” in accordance with cl
                                        3.3(f) of the employment contract. For almost two months
                                        before the abrupt termination of his employment, Ting was
                                        splitting his time between Clearlab and Aquilus. The
                                        evidence was clear that Ting breached
                                cl 3.3(f).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of fiduciary duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_272"></a>272    Aside from the
                                        contractual obligations, Clearlab submitted that a fiduciary
                                        relationship arose in the context of Ting’s employment in
                                        Clearlab, and therefore he also owed fiduciary obligations
                                        to Clearlab. I pause here to make a brief observation about
                                        the imposition of an additional fiduciary duty on an
                                        employee, which is that it is the exception rather than the
                                        norm. For the court to regard that an employee is also a
                                        fiduciary, the employee has to be placed in a position where
                                        he must act solely in the interests of his employer:
                                                <em>University of Nottingham v Fishel
                                                and another</em> [2000] ICR 1462 at 1493E. The
                                        mere fact of an employment relationship is not sufficient to
                                        support the existence of a fiduciary relationship. Rather,
                                        it must be shown that there are particular functions of the
                                        employee, which requires him to pursue the interests of his
                                        employer to the exclusion of other interests, including his
                                        own: <em>Lonmar Global Risks Limited
                                                (Formerly SBJ Global Risks Limited) v Barrie West
                                                and others</em> [2010] EWHC 2878 (QB) at
                                        [152]. Until then, it may not be said that there are
                                        fiduciary obligations imposed upon the employer as a matter
                                        of equity in addition to the obligations that the employee
                                        already owes as a matter of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_273"></a>273    The starting point
                                        therefore is the employment contract. It has to be shown
                                        that the employee in question is put in a situation where he
                                        is obliged to act solely for the benefit of his employer.
                                        But that is not the end of the story. Once a fiduciary
                                        relationship is found on the facts, there is further inquiry
                                        on whether it is engaged on the matters relied on by the
                                        plaintiff. There is no wholesale importation of every kind
                                        of fiduciary duty into each case, as that disregards what
                                        exactly it is about the particular employee’s situation that
                                        makes him a fiduciary. Even if the facts do bear a fiduciary
                                        relationship, it must be examined, in the particular
                                        circumstances, what are the fiduciary duties that arise. In
                                        this connection, the employment contract is of central
                                        importance. The scope and the content of the fiduciary
                                        duties that may arise from the employment must be
                                        accommodated within the terms of the employment contract and
                                        must not alter its intended operation: <em>Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical
                                                Corporation and others</em> (1984) 156 CLR 41

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_274"></a>274    Relatedly, care
                                        must be taken to delineate between contractual obligations
                                        and fiduciary obligations. Though both curtail what an
                                        employee may do, the latter is far more onerous. To quote

                                        fiduciary to act contrary to the interests of one’s
                                        employer, and not just disloyalty or dishonesty in general
                                        by the employee, that constitutes breach of a fiduciary

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The fiduciary has scope for
                                                  the exercise of some discretion or
                                                power.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The fiduciary can unilaterally

<p class="Judg-1">At the end, the foundation for fiduciary obligation is the
                                        parties’ relationship. Factors such as ascendancy,
                                        vulnerability, and dependence which characterise the
                                        relationship will be important in deciding if one party does
                                        owe specific obligations to solely act in another’s interest
                                        at all times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_276"></a>276    With these
                                        principles in mind, I turn now to the parties’ submissions.
                                        The argument that Clearlab ran was that Ting was a fiduciary
                                        by reason of: (a) his seniority in Clearlab, (b) his
                                        exposure to highly confidential information, (c) his
                                        involvement in top secret R&amp;D projects, and (d) his
                                        power to hire and fire employees in the department he
                                        headed. Further, Ting was described as being third in
                                        command at Clearlab, <em>ie</em>,
                                        second only to Dr Park and Mrs Park.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span> In contrast, the
                                        defendants argued that no one, other than Dr Park and Mrs
                                        Park, could possibly owe fiduciary duties. The defendants
                                        pointed out that Clearlab was entirely owned, managed and
                                        controlled by Dr Park and Mrs Park, and all other managers
                                        were subordinate to them. However senior Ting’s position
                                        was, they argued, he could not be considered to be in the
                                        top rung of management because it comprised only Dr Park and
                                        Mrs Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_277"></a>277    The evidence
                                        showed that Ting had considerable autonomy in a number of
                                        aspects in his job at Clearlab. While he was the subordinate
                                        of Dr Park and Mrs Park, he had the power to make certain
                                        decisions for Clearlab, such as whom to hire or fire, which
                                        put him in a position to act for his own interests, at the
                                        expense of Clearlab’s interests. Therefore, I am of the view
                                        that there was a fiduciary relationship between Ting and
                                        Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_278"></a>278    This, however, did
                                        not mean that Ting owed fiduciary duties at large (on the
                                        basis that Clearlab had reposed trust in him on certain
                                        matters like hiring and firing), for there is no such
                                        principle in law. The real question was whether Ting owed
                                        specific fiduciary duties in the particular circumstances
                                        that Ting had acted against the interests of Clearlab. It
                                        bears repeating that, even though a fiduciary relationship
                                        arose in the context of Ting’s employment, it did not mean
                                        that every kind of fiduciary duty was imposed on him.
                                        Whether a fiduciary duty, and if so, what fiduciary duty,
                                        was created depended on the particular circumstances, namely
                                        Ting’s employment relationship with Clearlab. The fact that
                                        there existed a fiduciary relationship also did not
                                        automatically transmute Ting’s contractual obligations into
                                        fiduciary ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_279"></a>279    Thus, to succeed
                                        in the claim for breach of fiduciary duty, Clearlab must
                                        show that Ting was under specific fiduciary duties and they
                                        arose because of the particular circumstances, which obliged
                                        Ting to act solely in Clearlab’s interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_280"></a>280    First, it was
                                        alleged that Ting breached his fiduciary duties by working
                                        for Aquilus when employed by Clearlab. For example, Ting
                                        assisted Aquilus to draw up a funding proposal to SPRING
                                        Singapore and gave technical input on what equipment to buy
                                        and who to buy from. This had been held to be in breach of
                                        Ting’s contractual obligations to Clearlab, <em>viz</em>, cll 3.3(f) and 11.1 of the
                                        employment contract. But I did not find that it was
                                        concurrently an abuse by Ting in his position as a fiduciary
                                        to Clearlab. Crucially, none of the three characteristics
                                        cited at [275] arose in the situation where an employee
                                        moonlighted on company’s time for a competitor company. I
                                        found that it was a situation where the employee had failed
                                        his duty of good faith and fidelity owed to his employer.
                                        But that duty should not be elevated into a fiduciary
                                        duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_281"></a>281    Second, it was
                                        alleged that Ting breached his fiduciary duties by failing
                                        to inform Clearlab of the existence of a competitor,
                                        Aquilus. But Ting was not even under a contractual
                                        obligation to disclose the existence of a competitor, much
                                        less a fiduciary one. It would be a better argument to say
                                        that Ting was under a fiduciary duty to disclose the
                                        existence of the competitor that he wrongfully assisted by
                                        using Clearlab’s confidential information. That overlapped
                                        with the third allegation, and hence this will be dealt with
                                        below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_282"></a>282    The third
                                        allegation was that Ting breached a fiduciary duty not to
                                        exploit any opportunity or confidential information. The nub
                                        of Ting’s wrongdoing was that he misappropriated Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information for use at Aquilus. Crucially, Ting
                                        had come by Clearlab’s confidential information in his
                                        position as the Head of Engineering and Technology
                                        Development in Clearlab. Further, Ting was entrusted with
                                        managerial responsibilities to apply the confidential
                                        information for Clearlab’s benefit. For example, his role at
                                        Clearlab involved overseeing the R&amp;D activities in
                                        respect of Clearlab’s products and machine development, and
                                        supervising the engineering and insert development. He would
                                        obviously have access to Clearlab’s confidential information
                                        in order to perform his role. There was therefore an element
                                        of vulnerability as Clearlab depended on Ting to use its
                                        confidential information only for its benefit and not use it
                                        for a third party. In these circumstances, I agreed that
                                        Ting owed a fiduciary obligation not to exploit Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information made available to him by reason of
                                        his position in Clearlab. It was breached when Ting took
                                        advantage of his position in Clearlab to further Aquilus’
                                        interest, <em>ie</em>, by copying and
                                        retaining Clearlab’s confidential documents with the
                                        intention of benefiting Aquilus, as well as omitting to
                                        disclose such wrongdoing or the existence of Aquilus as the
                                        beneficiary of such wrongdoing. These acts and omissions
                                        formed a line of conduct whereby Ting placed Aquilus’
                                        interest above Clearlab’s. Accordingly, Ting was in a breach
                                        of his fiduciary duty in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Secondary wrongdoing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a>283    The following
                                        three causes of action, which are (a) tort of inducing a
                                        breach of contract, (b) dishonest assistance, and (c)
                                        knowing receipt, have been labelled “secondary” because
                                        liability depended on there being committed a primary
                                        actionable wrong. The primary actionable wrongs so relied on
                                        are: (a) breach of Ting’s employment contract, (b) breach of
                                        Ting’s fiduciary duty, and (c) breach of trust by the
                                        ex-employees. The main question here was whether Aquilus or
                                        the other defendants alleged to be secondary wrongdoers have
                                        such degree of participation in the wrongful act of the
                                        primary wrongdoer which would make them also liable for the
                                        wrong. I will now deal with each secondary wrongdoing in the
                                        order they have been mentioned.</p>

                                        employment contract with Clearlab. The resulting breaches,
                                        as found earlier, were of cll 3.3(c), 3.3(f), and 11.1 of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a>286    I begin with an
                                        analysis of the element of inducement, for that appears to
                                        be absent from the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_287"></a>287    It should be
                                        fairly obvious that a plaintiff alleging the tort of
                                        inducing a breach of contract should identify the inducement
                                        and show that the defendant did in fact induce that breach.
                                        In <em>Lumley v Gye</em> (1853) 118 ER
                                        749, Johanna Wagner, an opera singer, was induced to break
                                        her contract to perform exclusively at the plaintiff’s
                                        theatre by the higher fee that the defendant offered her to
                                        perform instead at the defendant’s theatre. In <em>Bents Brewery Co Ltd and others v Luke
                                                Hogan</em> [1945] 2 All ER 570, the managers
                                        of the plaintiff’s public houses were induced to break their
                                        contractual obligation not to disclose confidential
                                        information by the defendant trade union officer’s
                                        distribution of questionnaires. In each case, the act taken
                                        by the defendant to induce a breach is identified, and a
                                        causative link is drawn between that and the eventual breach
                                        by the contract-breaker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a>288    Drawing back to
                                        the facts, there was some confusion over what had allegedly
                                        induced Ting to breach his contract (and therefore, also
                                        whether Ting was in fact induced to breach his contract).
                                        From what I understand from Clearlab’s case, there were two
                                        versions of events. One version was that Ho incorporated
                                        Aquilus in July 2010, came up with the idea of setting up a
                                        business of manufacturing contact lens, and offered Ting 20%
                                        shareholding in Aquilus so as to incentivise Ting to join
                                        Aquilus. These shares were held by Ting’s wife to avoid
                                        detection by Clearlab. In this version, the inducement was
                                        the 20% shareholding in Aquilus. The second version was
                                        that, prior to and the latest by the date of the
                                        incorporation of Aquilus, Ting had the idea of setting up a
                                        business of manufacturing contact lens. He conspired with
                                        the other defendants (including Ho) to put the idea into
                                        motion and, in pursuant of the conspiracy, caused Aquilus to
                                        be incorporated in July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span>
                                        In this second version, there was no inducement by Aquilus;
                                        it was Ting’s decision to breach his employment
                                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a>289    The upshot of
                                        either version of events was this: (a) Ting received shares
                                        from Aquilus (which were put in his wife’s name), and (b)
                                        Ting received a handsome salary from Aquilus (albeit
                                        slightly lower than what he received from
                                                Clearlab<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_158" id="Ftn_158_1"><sup>[note: 158]</sup></a></span>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a>290    What was not shown
                                        was whether Ting’s breaches of his employment contract
                                        transpired because of an inducement by Aquilus (through Ho)
                                        or because Ting had an idea, approached Ho and convinced Ho
                                        to act in accordance with his idea. There was insufficient
                                        evidence to conclude whether Ho approached Ting or Ting
                                        approached Ho. Conceivably, there was even a third scenario:
                                        Ho and Ting discussed and simultaneously came up with the
                                        idea to do the acts that were in breach of Ting’s employment
                                        contract. There was insufficient evidence to prove that the
                                        first scenario, not the second or the third scenario
                                        occurred. Therefore the claim under this cause of action had
                                        to be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dishonest assistance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_291"></a>291    The second claim,
                                        which is dishonest assistance, was made in respect of two
                                        types of breaches: (a) a breach of fiduciary duty by Ting,
                                        and (b) a breach of trust by David, Goh and
                                Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ting’s breach of fiduciary duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_292"></a>292    To begin, it
                                        should be recalled that a number of fiduciary duties were
                                        asserted to be owed by Ting, but all were rejected, except
                                        for the fiduciary duty not to exploit Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information acquired by reason of Ting’s
                                        position in Clearlab. It flowed from this conclusion that
                                        the claim for dishonest assistance of Ting’s breach of
                                        fiduciary duty was limited to the breach of this particular
                                        fiduciary duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_293"></a>293    Within this
                                        limited claim, two main forms of dishonest assistance were
                                        alleged. The first related to Ho’s and Aquilus’ assistance
                                        of Ting by promising him a higher salary and shares in
                                        Aquilus. The second related to David’s, Goh’s, Ng’s, Ma’s
                                        and Li’s assistance of Ting by complying with his requests
                                        to obtain Clearlab’s confidential information for
                                        Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Aquilus and Ho</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_294"></a>294    As to the first
                                        form of dishonest assistance, the relevant facts were that,
                                        in December 2010 or January 2011, Ho offered to pay Ting
                                        $1,000 more than what he was making in Clearlab<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span> (which did not
                                        materialise because a lower salary was eventually paid) and,
                                        in April 2011, Ho offered Ting shares in
                                                Aquilus.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_295"></a>295    Thus, one
                                        plausible argument was that Aquilus and Ho procured Ting’s
                                        breach of fiduciary duty. But one would immediately see the
                                        fallacy of this argument. Because Clearlab relied on the
                                        same evidence that was used for proving the tort of inducing
                                        a breach of contract, it was susceptible to the same
                                        evidentiary weakness. As held at [288]–[290] above, the
                                        crucial fact of inducement was not established for the claim
                                        of the tort of inducing of a breach of contract because it
                                        was unclear whether Aquilus induced the contractual breaches
                                        or whether Ting independently decided to breach his
                                        contract. Similarly, here, it was unclear whether Aquilus
                                        persuaded Ting to take confidential information for its
                                        benefit in breach of his fiduciary duty or whether Ting, on
                                        his own initiative, did the same. It therefore cannot be
                                        said that Aquilus and Ho procured Ting’s breach of fiduciary
                                        duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_296"></a>296    That said, I note
                                        that the test for dishonest assistance allows for a lesser
                                        degree of participation than that for the tort of inducing a
                                        breach of contract. It suffices that the defendant in
                                        question assists, as opposed to, induces the breach of
                                        fiduciary duty. The alternative argument therefore was that
                                        the offer of an attractive salary and shares in Aquilus to
                                        Ting assisted him to breach his fiduciary
                                duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_297"></a>297    But even then, I
                                        could not see how the offer of a higher salary and shares in
                                        Aquilus assisted Ting to misappropriate Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information in breach of his fiduciary duty.
                                        There was no evidence that a causal link could be drawn
                                        between one and the other. There is case law to the effect
                                        that the plaintiff must at least show some causative
                                        significance in the acts by the defendant (although he need
                                        not show the precise causative significance nor is it
                                        appropriate for the court “to become involved in attempts to
                                        assess the precise causative significance of the dishonest
                                        assistance”: <em>Grupo Torras SA v Al-Sabah

                                        this is a case where there was no causative effect in the
                                        first place, so there was no assistance given by Aquilus and
                                        Ho, and therefore “the requirements of conscience [did not]
                                        require any remedy at all”: <em>Brown &amp;

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_298"></a>298    In summary, the
                                        allegation that Ho and Aquilus either induced or assisted
                                        Ting to misappropriate confidential information in breach of
                                        his fiduciary duty was not borne out on the evidence. The
                                        claim that Ho and Aquilus were liable for the dishonest
                                        assistance of Ting’s fiduciary duty accordingly
                                        failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   David, Goh, Ng, Ma and Li</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_299"></a>299    As to the second
                                        form of dishonest assistance, it was submitted that David,
                                        Goh, Ng, Ma and Li dishonestly assisted Ting to breach his
                                        fiduciary duty by complying with his request to
                                        misappropriate Clearlab’s confidential information. In
                                        particular, it was submitted that David emailed Ting the
                                        confidential information that Ting asked for, Goh brought
                                        over the PET casts, Ng copied the parameter settings for the
                                        Optoform machine, and Ma and Li supplied the Lens Forming
                                        Machines. These were the factual matrix upon which dishonest
                                        assistance of Ting’s breach of fiduciary duty was
                                        alleged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a>300    But, pertinently,
                                        for the other defendants to have dishonestly assisted in
                                        Ting’s breach of fiduciary duty, their acts must be
                                        referable to Ting’s breach of fiduciary duty. Was that the
                                        case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_301"></a>301    To answer the
                                        question, it was crucial to revisit the circumstances in
                                        which Ting was held to have owed a fiduciary duty not to
                                        exploit Clearlab’s confidential information and how he
                                        breached it. At [282], it was held that Ting’s fiduciary
                                        duty arose because he was able to obtain Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information for his work as the Head of
                                        Engineering and Technology Development in Clearlab.
                                        Therefore, he owed a fiduciary duty to Clearlab to use the
                                        confidential information that he acquired in the course of
                                        his employment only for the furtherance of Clearlab’s
                                        interests. This fiduciary duty was breached when Ting helped
                                        himself to Clearlab’s confidential documents with the
                                        intention of using them in Aquilus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_302"></a>302    From the
                                        description of Ting’s breach of fiduciary duty, the answer
                                        was no. One could scarcely say that the defendants were
                                        assisting in Ting’s breach of fiduciary duty (which he
                                        committed by misappropriating confidential information) by
                                        (in the case of David, Goh and Ng) also misappropriating
                                        Clearlab’s confidential information or (in the case of Ma
                                        and Li) lawfully supplying Lens Forming
                                Machines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_303"></a>303    Further, it could
                                        not be said that a separate breach of fiduciary duty took
                                        place when Ting requested David, Goh and Ng to
                                        misappropriate Clearlab’s confidential information. In order
                                        for Ting to be in breach of fiduciary duty by making those
                                        requests, it must be shown that Ting was abusing these
                                        powers that he possessed qua <em>fiduciary</em>. I did not think this was made
                                        out. By the time Ting made those requests, he was already
                                        dismissed from his position as the Head of Engineering and
                                        Technology Development in Clearlab. What had been shown was
                                        that David, Goh and Ng continued to associate with Ting, but
                                        they did so as co-conspirators. Each of Ting’s request was
                                        made to further a conspiracy to use Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information for the benefit of Aquilus, and they responded
                                        to him in the same light. In this context, one would not
                                        consider Ting to be still standing in the position of a
                                        fiduciary to Clearlab. His requests to David, Goh and Ng did
                                        not trigger a fiduciary duty because he was no longer acting
                                        on behalf of Clearlab or exercising any of the powers
                                        conferred upon him by Clearlab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_304"></a>304    To conclude,
                                        David, Goh, Ng, Ma and Li had not dishonestly assisted in
                                        Ting’s breach of fiduciary duty when Ting personally
                                        misappropriated confidential information from Clearlab
                                        during his employment. Post-dismissal, there was no breach
                                        of fiduciary duty for which David, Goh, Ng, Ma and Li could
                                        have dishonestly assisted in.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">David’s, Goh’s and Ng’s breach of
                                trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_305"></a>305    Separately,
                                        Clearlab also claimed that there was dishonest assistance of
                                        a breach of trust by David, Goh and Ng. The claim for
                                        dishonest assistance was parasitic upon a breach of trust by
                                        David, Goh and Ng, therefore it was crucial for Clearlab to
                                        first establish that David, Goh and Ng were trustees of
                                        Clearlab’s confidential information that they had access to
                                        or made copies of, and they had acted in breach of trust by
                                        obtaining such confidential information for Aquilus.
                                        Clearlab’s argument was that the subject matter of the
                                        alleged trust was confidential information, David, Goh and
                                        Ng were its nominal owners (for they hold it as trustees for
                                        Clearlab), and Clearlab was the beneficiary. Put in this
                                        way, I could not see how a trust arose over Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information. Unlike property, there is no
                                        concept of “title” in respect of information and, therefore,
                                        no segregation of legal and equitable titles for the
                                        purposes of a trust. Thus, even though David, Goh and Ng
                                        received Clearlab’s confidential information, they were not
                                        its nominal owners. The disclosure of confidential
                                        information to them did not carry with it a bare title to
                                        the confidential information. Further, while David, Goh and
                                        Ng were bound to use Clearlab’s confidential information
                                        only for Clearlab’s benefit, these obligations arose as a
                                        matter of the law of confidence, irrespective of any
                                        existence of a trust over Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information. The appropriate cause of action therefore
                                        appeared to be a breach of confidence as against David, Goh
                                        and Ng. Having received Clearlab’s confidential information
                                        in circumstances of confidence, they owed an obligation of
                                        confidence to Clearlab not to use or disclose that
                                        information without authority. The obligation was breached
                                        when David, Goh and Ng took Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information to Aquilus. Consequently, Clearlab was entitled
                                        to remedies available for breach of confidence to correct
                                        the injustice in relation to the unauthorised use or
                                        disclosure of its confidential information, and to restrain
                                        further breaches by them. Given such comprehensive rights,
                                        obligations and protection under the law of confidence, it
                                        was difficult to see how a trust could be superimposed on
                                        the framework already laid down by the law of
                                        confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_306"></a>306    For these reasons,
                                        I was not persuaded that there was a trust over Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information. It followed that there was neither
                                        a breach of trust by David, Goh and Ng, nor dishonest
                                        assistance by Aquilus of that breach of trust by David, Goh
                                        and Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Knowing receipt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_307"></a>307    The claim for
                                        knowing receipt was premised on Aquilus having received
                                        Clearlab’s confidential information which was traceable to:
                                        (a) a breach of fiduciary duty by Ting, or (b) a breach of
                                        trust by David, Goh and Ng. Notably, the subject matter of
                                        the knowing receipt claim was Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information. But it is doubtful if confidential information
                                        is the kind of “property” contemplated in <em>Barnes v Addy</em> (1874) LR 9 Ch App 244
                                                (“<em>Barnes</em>”) when the
                                        cause of action of knowing receipt was first formulated. The
                                        exact words in <em>Barnes</em> at
                                        251–252 are:</p>

                                                agents of trustees in transactions within their
                                                legal powers, transactions, perhaps of which a Court
                                                of Equity may disapprove, unless those agents
                                                  <em>receive and become chargeable

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_308"></a>308    The words in
                                        italics denote the requisite <em>actus
                                                reus</em> for knowing receipt. In the cases
                                        that follow, it was interpreted as “first, a disposal of
                                        [the plaintiff’s] assets … [and, second], the beneficial
                                        receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as
                                        representing the assets of the plaintiff”: <em>El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings plc and
                                                another</em> [1994] 2 All ER 685 at 700 per
                                        Hoffmann LJ. The general idea is that receipt must
                                        correspond to a disposal. But this is not true of
                                        information. First, the confidential information which is
                                        received by a defendant is not necessarily put beyond the
                                        reach of a plaintiff. Being capable of infinite replication,
                                        the confidential information need not leave the possession
                                        of the plaintiff when the copies passed into the hands of
                                        the defendant. Correspondingly, the defendant who received
                                        confidential information could not be wholly dispossessed of
                                        it. At most, he could be prohibited from using or disclosing
                                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_309"></a>309    There are also
                                        wide ramifications for allowing knowing receipt in respect
                                        of information. An illustration is useful here. If a person
                                        comes to know of information as a result of a breach of his
                                        fiduciary duty and he publishes the information as well as
                                        the facts of the breach of his fiduciary duty in a
                                        newspaper, it could mean that anyone who reads the newspaper
                                        is regarded as a knowing recipient. In turn, an unlimited
                                        number of defendants may be called upon to personally
                                        account for the information that was received. That would be
                                        a perversion of the cause of action of knowing receipt as
                                        propounded in <em>Barnes</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_310"></a>310    Further, knowing
                                        receipt appears to be traditionally concerned with the
                                        preservation of property: see Peter Jaffey, “The Nature of
                                        Knowing Receipt” (2001) 15 Trust Law International 151. But
                                        confidential information is not subject to the same risks of
                                        dissipation. Rather, it is more concerned with the loss of
                                        confidentiality or further unauthorised dissemination. There
                                        are two entirely different considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_311"></a>311    In light of the
                                        above, I did not accept that the meaning of “property” in
                                        knowing receipt could extend to confidential information.
                                        Accordingly, Clearlab’s claim that there is knowing receipt
                                        of confidential information by Aquilus was dismissed. In any
                                        event, the claim for knowing receipt in relation to the
                                        alleged breach of trust by David, Goh and Ng must also be
                                        dismissed based on the earlier finding that there is no
                                        breach of trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Tort of conversion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_312"></a>312    The next claim is
                                        for the tort of conversion. There were two separate subject
                                        matters that were alleged to be converted: (a) the PET
                                        casts, and (b) a SolidWorks software licence. As a matter of
                                        law, the tort is committed when there is unauthorised
                                        dealing with the claimant’s chattel so as to question or
                                        deny his title to it: <em>Tat Seng Machine

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_313"></a>313    There is no
                                        question that there was an act of conversion with respect to
                                        the PET casts. Ting admitted that, after he had left
                                        Clearlab and whilst he was working at Aquilus, he had asked
                                        Goh to bring the PET casts to Aquilus with a view of using
                                        them “for testing the formulation”, and that these PET casts
                                        were made at Clearlab by an employee called Oran
                                                Khamhomkul.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span> Subsequently,
                                        PET casts were found at Aquilus’ premises on the day of the
                                        search order, which signified that they were successfully
                                        brought over on Ting’s instructions. I therefore found that
                                        Ting and Goh were liable personally and Aquilus vicariously
                                        in the tort of conversion for taking the PET
                                casts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_314"></a>314    As for the
                                        SolidWorks software licence, Clearlab submitted that Ting
                                        misappropriated its licensed copy of the SolidWorks software
                                        installed on Ting’s personal laptop by not deactivating the

                                        activation history showed that the software was first
                                        installed on 9 July 2010 and remotely deactivated by the
                                        software vendor only on 31 May 2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span> which was
                                        about a month after Ting was dismissed from Clearlab on 26
                                        April 2011. Clearlab further submitted that its licensed
                                        copy of the SolidWorks software must have been used at
                                        Aquilus for a period of time because, until 12 December
                                        2011, Aquilus did not purchase for itself the licence to use
                                                SolidWorks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_315"></a>315    There were a
                                        number of fundamental issues with these submissions. First,
                                        the tort of conversion is traditionally confined to
                                        chattels, <em>ie</em>, it requires
                                        interference with tangible personal property rather than
                                        with intangible choses in action: see <em>OBG
                                                Ltd and another v Allan and others</em> [2008]
                                        1 AC 1. A software licence is not a chattel and therefore
                                        traditionally not viewed as capable of being converted. But
                                        even assuming that a software licence can be converted, that
                                        depends on the terms of the licence to use. A licence that
                                        is “personal” to the licensee permits use only by the
                                        licensee. A licence to use of this nature, being
                                        non-assignable, cannot be misappropriated. A licence to use
                                        that is proprietary, on the other hand, is assignable in its
                                        own right, but it is difficult to see how that may happen
                                        without the licensee’s consent. Thus, the second issue
                                        related to the nature of the SolidWorks licence. Clearlab
                                        bore the burden of proving that its intangible right to use
                                        SolidWorks could be misappropriated. But no evidence had
                                        been adduced to show, for this purpose, if the SolidWorks
                                        licence was personal or proprietary. Third, there was a
                                        question of degree of whether the software licence had been
                                        dealt with in a manner that excluded the rightful licensee
                                        from its use. Conversion has been described as “an act of
                                        deliberate dealing with a chattel in a manner inconsistent
                                        with another’s right whereby that other is deprived of the
                                        use and possession of it”: <em>Kuwait Airways
                                                Corpn v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5)</em>
                                        [2002] 2 AC 883 at 1084, [38], citing <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (Margaret
                                        R Brazier gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th Ed, 1995) at p
                                        636, para 13-12; Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead noted that the
                                        textbook description was “judicially approved” at 1084,
                                        [40]. The latter part of the sentence – “whereby that other
                                        is deprived of the use and possession of it” – was the
                                        subject of some contention on the facts of this case. On one
                                        hand, Ting has wrongfully retained an activated copy of the
                                        SolidWorks software with Seat ID 761941 on his personal
                                        laptop and thereby interfered with Clearlab’s right to
                                        activate the SolidWorks software with the same Seat ID on a
                                        different computer. On the other hand, it appeared from the
                                        evidence that Clearlab could have, at any time,
                                        “repossessed” the SolidWorks software by instructing the
                                        software vendor to remotely deactivate the SolidWorks
                                        software on Ting’s laptop. There was therefore some
                                        uncertainty as to whether the degree of control on
                                        Clearlab’s part to recover use of the SolidWorks software
                                        together with Ting’s mere omission to deactivate the
                                        installed SolidWorks software on his laptop amounted to
                                        conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_316"></a>316    Accordingly, on
                                        the last two issues, there was insufficient evidence in
                                        support of the assertion that Clearlab’s SolidWorks licence
                                        could be and had been converted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_317"></a>317    In any event, I
                                        noted that there would have been no substantive relief even
                                        if Clearlab had proven a tort of conversion with respect to
                                        the SolidWorks software licence. The particular copy of the
                                        SolidWorks software with Seat ID 761941 that Ting had on his
                                        laptop was deactivated by the time this action commenced. As
                                        such, Clearlab was not seeking any “return” of that software
                                        licence. Further, Clearlab had not produced any evidence of
                                        loss suffered during the time the SolidWorks software
                                        remained wrongfully activated on Ting’s laptop. At the very
                                        most, Clearlab would have only been entitled to nominal
                                        damages under this cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of supply agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_318"></a>318    The final claim
                                        against Ma and Li was for the breach of the supply agreement
                                        in relation to Quad Spinner. It was common ground that there
                                        was an implied term in the supply agreement that the Quad
                                        Spinner would be of merchantable quality and fit for its
                                        purpose. Clearlab’s claim was that the implied term has been
                                        breached when OSC supplied a Quad Spinner that was unable to
                                        achieve accurate spin speeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_319"></a>319    The chronology of
                                        relevant events was as follows. In December 2010, the Quad
                                        Spinner was delivered to Clearlab. In April 2011, defects
                                        surfaced and Ma attended to them. On 25 April 2011, Clearlab
                                        inspected the Quad Spinner and produced an inspection report
                                        which showed that “the Quad Spinner had passed the parameter
                                        inspection, <em>ie</em>, the lens
                                        produced is of the correct specifications”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span> This meant that the
                                        Quad Spinner was working fine as at 25 April
                                                2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span> On 19 May
                                        2011, however, defects surfaced again. These were documented
                                        in a logbook entry, which stated that Tubes 2 and 4 of the
                                        Quad Spinner “failed dry lens prism check”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span> The effect of the
                                        defects was allegedly that there was a discrepancy between
                                        the spin speed that was keyed into the Quad Spinner and the
                                        actual spin speed of the Quad Spinner. Ma subsequently did
                                        not repair the Quad Spinner again and Clearlab undertook the
                                        repairs itself, claiming that it spent $16,480 in the
                                        process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_320"></a>320    As such, the
                                        central question was whether the defects (which resulted in
                                        inaccurate spin speeds) were attributable to a flaw in the
                                        design or fabrication of the Quad Spinner, or whether they
                                        were attributable to the end-user. Clearlab argued that the
                                        defects lay with the software in the Quad Spinner, and
                                        therefore this was a design issue. Consistent with that
                                        position, Clearlab had replaced the digital system in the
                                        Quad Spinner with an analogue system so as to rectify the
                                        defects. Clearlab further pointed out that the defendants’
                                        expert witness had agreed that an analogue system was more
                                        accurate than the digital system. The following passage from
                                        the cross-examination was cited to me:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_321"></a>321    On a closer
                                        reading, however, this did not support Clearlab’s claim that
                                        the defects could be attributed to the software in the Quad
                                        Spinner. All that the cross-examination revealed was that an
                                        analogue system was capable of achieving more accuracy than
                                        a digital system, not that the digital system was bound to
                                        be inaccurate. To illustrate, an analogue system would make
                                        a smooth transition from, say, 1rpm to 2rpm, whereas a
                                        digital system would make a jump from 1rpm to 2rpm. This was
                                        not the problem that Clearlab alleged. The problem,
                                        according to Clearlab’s engineering manager, Wong, was that
                                        the Quad Spinner spun at a different speed from what was
                                        keyed in by the user. For example, it would spin at 448rpm
                                        or 452rpm when the user had keyed in 450rpm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_322"></a>322    Therefore, the
                                        only evidence that Clearlab had adduced which is relevant to
                                        this issue of breach of implied term was the single-page
                                        logbook entry dated 19 May 2011. While the logbook entry did
                                        show that Tubes 2 and 4 of the Quad Spinner were defective,
                                        it did not explain that the defects arose from the software
                                        in the Quad Spinner. On the contrary, under the header of
                                        “Troubleshoot”, it stated that “Tube 2 &amp; 4 did not grip
                                        belt tightly. Area of contact between tube 2 &amp; 4 and
                                        belt are very small.” This suggested that the problem of
                                        inaccurate spin speeds related to the grip between the tubes
                                        and the belt, rather than the software. Therein lay further
                                        uncertainty. It was not clear what caused the poor grip
                                        between the tubes and the belt. Ma and Li suggested that it
                                        was possible that this arose from normal wear and tear or
                                        normal operational issues after the few months that the Quad
                                        Spinner was in Clearlab’s possession, as opposed to Ma’s
                                        faulty design or fabrication. Regardless of the actual cause
                                        of the problem, Ma and Li submitted that Clearlab had not
                                        discharged the burden of proving that any defect with the
                                        Quad Spinner was attributable to them. I agreed. The claim
                                        for breach of implied term was therefore
                                dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Remedies</p>

                                        pleaded by Clearlab was a restraint against the defendants

                                        direct or indirect competition with the Plaintiff’s

                                        narrowed down in the closing submissions to a restraint
                                        against the defendants “[m]anufacturing contact lens using
                                        the spin cast method”. Clearlab sought not only to restrain
                                        the defendants from using Clearlab’s spincasting technology,
                                        but also to restrain the defendants from using spincasting
                                        technology altogether. It was noted that the spincasting
                                        technology existed in many variants, hence it was not
                                        necessarily the case that the defendants, specifically the
                                        first to fifth and ninth defendants, would be using
                                        Clearlab’s confidential information (and be in continued
                                        breach of confidence) merely because they engaged in
                                        manufacturing spin-cast lens in the future. It was possible,
                                        for example, for these defendants to obtain a licence to
                                        utilise a third party’s spincasting technology, or develop a
                                        different way of spincasting lens based on the information
                                        revealed in spincasting patents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_325"></a>325    Clearlab
                                        nevertheless submitted that it is a fair outcome that the
                                        defendants be permanently restrained by making spin-cast
                                        lens. The sole authority that Clearlab relied on was
                                                <em>Johnson &amp; Bloy (Holdings)
                                                Limited and another v Wolstenholme Rink plc and
                                                another</em> [1989] 1 FSR 135 (“<em>Johnson</em>”). It was cited for its
                                        broad consideration of what was necessary for the proper
                                        protection of the plaintiffs in relation to the information
                                        that was vital to the effective continuation of the
                                        plaintiffs’ business. But the case did not in fact assist
                                        Clearlab. In <em>Johnson</em>, the
                                        second defendant left the plaintiffs’ employ to work for the
                                        first defendant, taking with him confidential materials,
                                        such as formulations for printing inks. A question was
                                        raised as to whether the plaintiffs could restrain (at an
                                        interlocutory stage) the use of a mere combination of the
                                        two ingredients for manufacturing gold offset ink dryer
                                        (which was required as an “intermediary” for preparing
                                        inks), as opposed to the precise formulation. The court held
                                        that they could. Its main concern was that the defendants
                                        would get around the more specific restraint by varying the
                                        percentages of the ingredients in the precise formulation;
                                        that would have set the protection to the plaintiffs’ trade
                                        secrets at nought. Importantly, the case did not go as far
                                        as to say that the plaintiffs were entitled to restrain the
                                        defendants wholly from manufacturing dryer. At the end of
                                        the judgment, the injunction was stated to be subject to the
                                        following proviso (at 143–144):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that it shall not constitute a breach of
                                                either injunction for the first defendant to use and
                                                manufacture a dryer in accordance with a formula
                                                obtained from an independent third party subject to
                                                the further proviso (a) that the third party has not
                                                devised such formula by reason of any disclosure
                                                (direct or indirect) by the defendants or either of
                                                them since March 1st, 1987, of the information that
                                                the two said ingredients may be used in combination
                                                in the manufacture of a dryer for an offset metallic
                                                printing ink; (b) the first defendant has not
                                                obtained or used such formula by reason of such
                                                information; and (c) the first defendant first
                                                swears and delivers to the plaintiffs an affidavit
                                                verifying the foregoing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clearly, the defendants were free to continue a competing
                                        business in manufacturing dryer so long as it did not
                                        involve the use of the plaintiffs’ confidential information.
                                        An exception to the injunction was specifically carved out
                                        so that the defendants can use any dryer independently
                                        developed by third parties. The same reasoning applied with
                                        equal force here. Clearlab was only entitled to protect its
                                        own confidential information; it would overreach if it
                                        sought to permanently restrain the first to fifth and ninth
                                        defendants from the entire area of spincasting, without
                                        differentiating the situations between when they were
                                        actually misusing Clearlab’s confidential information and
                                        when they were not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_326"></a>326    On the facts,
                                                <em>Johnson</em> may also be
                                        distinguished from the present case. In <em>Johnson</em>, it was arguable that the
                                        combination of the two ingredients (and not just the precise
                                        formulation) was confidential information and therefore
                                        deserving of protection. In the present case, while
                                        Clearlab’s specific method of spincasting was confidential,
                                        there were other methods of spincasting that were not
                                        confidential. Clearlab itself acknowledged that there were
                                        “generic” spin-cast processes described in patents. It
                                        follows that what was protectable as confidential
                                        information were the refinements that Clearlab had made to
                                        its spin-cast process, rather than spincasting in general. A
                                        blanket injunction against the first to fifth and ninth
                                        defendants using any form of spincasting technology, even
                                        those that are in the public domain or may be licensed from
                                        third parties, did not appear to be warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_327"></a>327    In this
                                        connection, the defendants argued that there was no
                                        proportionality between the perceived threat and the remedy
                                        sought by Clearlab. It seemed that a general spincasting
                                        injunction would put Clearlab in a better position that it
                                        would have been had there been no breach. In fact, it would
                                        have insulated Clearlab permanently from competition from
                                        the defendants in the area of spincasting. It seemed that
                                        such an injunction was not reasonably necessary for the
                                        protection of Clearlab’s business interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_328"></a>328    As a matter of
                                        policy, however, Clearlab submitted that its confidential
                                        information could not be sufficiently protected without a
                                        wide injunction. This was an argument that ran on the facts
                                        of the case rather than strict doctrinal considerations. The
                                        defendants’ conduct from surreptitiously taking Clearlab’s
                                        documents to deleting Clearlab’s documents in contempt of
                                        the court order showed that they could not be trusted with
                                        compliance of a court order to not use or disclose
                                        Clearlab’s confidential information. Clearlab submitted that
                                        the defendants would continue to use Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information but would now do it under the guise of
                                        purchasing technology from third parties. Throughout the
                                        trial, the defendants had demonstrated a propensity to
                                        deceive. Goh strenuously denied using SCS6 even though he
                                        plainly could not design inserts without it. David put up a
                                        table comparing Clearlab’s and Aquilus’ lens formulations
                                        but later admitted that certain chemicals that were unique
                                        to Clearlab’s lens formulation (<em>eg</em>, BME and Pluronic) were in fact used
                                        in Aquilus. Ting, the mastermind of the crooked scheme to
                                        use Clearlab’s confidential information, had the audacity to
                                        join the audit team to audit Aquilus for ISO and OHSAS
                                        certifications. These were just a few examples of the
                                        defendants’ dishonesty. Given the defendants’ antecedents,
                                        there was a compelling case that the defendants would not
                                        simply refrain from using Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information. After all, Clearlab could not monitor such
                                        compliance without unreasonable costs. It was a real concern
                                        that the defendants would defy the court order in a way
                                        which would avoid detection by Clearlab. In order to do
                                        practical justice, Clearlab submitted that a more
                                        heavy-handed measure, <em>ie</em>, a
                                        wide injunction against the use of spincasting technology,
                                        was necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_329"></a>329    On this matter, it
                                        was crucial that the court should achieve as fair a balance
                                        as possible in the circumstances, between the two competing
                                        concerns. It was understandable, from Clearlab’s
                                        perspective, that anything short of a blanket ban against
                                        spincasting would not stop the defendants from using its
                                        confidential information. If a prior court order had not
                                        commanded their obedience, there was no reason to believe
                                        that the next court order will be regarded any differently
                                        by them, unless there was an effective way of enforcing it.
                                        From the defendants’ perspective, a permanent injunction
                                        against the use of spincasting technology would be a severe
                                        consequence. There is no precedent of a court granting a
                                        permanent injunction against an activity which does not
                                        necessarily involve the plaintiff’s confidential
                                        information. Typically, the injunction that is granted
                                        restrains only the use and disclosure of confidential
                                        information; that is regarded as sufficient to prevent the
                                        wrongdoer from profiting from his own wrong. Thus, it would
                                        not have been controversial if the defendants were
                                        prohibited from making spin-cast lens with the use of
                                        Clearlab’s confidential information, but a permanent
                                        prohibition against the use of spincast technology would be
                                        too wide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_330"></a>330    With these
                                        considerations in mind, I found that a fair balance on the
                                        facts of this case would be an injunction for a limited
                                        period. This would address the policy, on the one hand,
                                        against prohibiting the defendants from pursuing legitimate
                                        economic activity and on the other hand, protecting the
                                        rights of Clearlab against which much egregious conduct had
                                        been carried out by the same defendants. Clearlab’s concern
                                        was that an injunction against the use of confidential
                                        information would be difficult to enforce and, with the
                                        proven proclivities of the defendants to abuse its
                                        confidential information, there is a high probability that
                                        they would continue doing it so long as they felt that they
                                        would not be caught. Given that any technology has a limited
                                        life span, an injunction for a limited period would be
                                        sufficient to meet Clearlab’s concerns. In my view a fair
                                        period would be five years from the date of the writ.
                                        Although this means that the injunction will continue for
                                        only another two years, I take into consideration that
                                        Aquilus had already been effectively prohibited from
                                        manufacturing contact lenses since the date of the writ. In
                                        any event, the prime consideration is the fact that in this
                                        five-year period, the technology would have moved on and any
                                        undue advantage acquired by Aquilus from the confidential
                                        information, assuming they still have it, would be lost or
                                        at the very least, heavily diluted. I therefore grant an
                                        injunction against the first to fifth and the ninth
                                        defendants (<em>ie</em>, the
                                        ex-employees, Aquilus and Ho) from carrying out
                                        manufacturing of contact lenses using the spin-cast method,
                                        or from participating in any such
                                manufacturing.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_331"></a>331    The next relief
                                        that Clearlab sought was a permanent injunction against the

                                        from its confidential information. There was no dispute that
                                        Clearlab was entitled to this injunctive relief. It is just
                                        and appropriate that a defendant should be precluded from
                                        taking advantage of the confidential information if the
                                        confidential information comes to him in circumstances where
                                        he has notice or has agreed that the information is
                                        confidential. To preserve the confidentiality of the
                                        information and to prevent the defendants from further
                                        exploiting the confidential information, I will grant an

                                        in Annex A of its closing submissions, except for the
                                        information relating to the design of the Quad Spinner, the

                                        information were not protectable because, as concluded
                                        above, Clearlab either lacked standing or the information
                                        had already entered the public domain.</p>

                                        had held to be confidential, returned. I therefore order a

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Wrotham Park damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_334"></a>334    Clearlab made a
                                        rather peculiar and confusing submission about <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages. On one
                                        hand, it submitted that the first to sixth and ninth
                                        defendants could not be trusted not to use Clearlab’s
                                        confidential documents in the future, therefore <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages were a
                                        “just response”. On the other hand, Clearlab specifically
                                        asked to be compensated for the period between the breach of
                                        confidence and the interim injunction. Presumably, Clearlab
                                        sought <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages
                                        for two separate timeframes: from breach till the interim
                                        injunction, and from the date of the judgment onwards.
                                        Clearlab further submitted that, in the event that the
                                        defendants do not satisfy the judgment for <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages, they
                                        should be permanently restrained from manufacturing contact
                                        lens using the spin-cast method: this injunction has been
                                        discussed above and an injunction for a limited period of
                                        five years has been ordered. Notwithstanding my holding, it
                                        is an odd argument because <em>Wrotham
                                                Park</em> damages are usually given in lieu of
                                        injunction and not the other way round.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_335"></a>335    I should first
                                        affirm the authority of the court to award <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages for breach
                                        of confidence. It is consistent with the view expressed by
                                        Lord Denning MR in <em>Seager v Copydex Ltd
                                                (No 2)</em> [1969] 1 WLR 809 (“<em>Seager</em>”) that damages for breach
                                        of confidence could reflect the market value attached to the
                                        confidential information, or, as Clearlab put it, the price
                                        which the owner of the confidential information could
                                        reasonably have demanded for agreeing to relax the
                                        restriction in question. A necessary implication of an award
                                        of such damages is that the defendants are regarded as
                                        having made an outright purchase of the confidential
                                        information. Once the damages are assessed and paid, the
                                        confidential information would belong to the defendants as
                                        if they had bought it in an agreement of sale: see <em>Seager</em> at 813.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_336"></a>336    That said, this is
                                        not a proper case for awarding <em>Wrotham
                                                Park</em> damages. The main reason is that
                                        Clearlab is not desirous of relinquishing its rights over
                                        its confidential information. I understand Clearlab to be
                                        seeking both <em>Wrotham Park</em>
                                        damages and an injunction against continued use of its
                                        confidential information. But it is not possible to have
                                        both reliefs. <em>Wrotham Park</em>
                                        damages, as mentioned, are awarded in lieu of
                                        injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_337"></a>337    In the case of
                                                <em>Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v
                                                Parkside Homes Ltd and others</em> [1974] 1
                                        WLR 798 (“<em>Wrotham Park</em>”), from
                                        which the term <em>Wrotham Park</em>
                                        damages was derived, Brightman J awarded damages as “a just
                                        substitute for a mandatory injunction”: at 815D. Instead of
                                        ordering a mandatory injunction for the demolition of
                                        buildings developed in breach of a restrictive covenant,
                                        because that would have been an “unpardonable waste of much
                                        needed houses”, Brightman J had assessed damages as a sum
                                        which the plaintiffs might reasonably have demanded from the
                                        defendant as <em>quid pro quo</em> for
                                        relaxing the covenant. It assumes a hypothetical negotiation
                                        between parties to buy out or to release the relevant
                                        obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_338"></a>338    It is observed
                                        that in <em>Wrotham Park</em>, there
                                        had not been an interim injunction or a permanent
                                        injunction. The defendant managed to fully complete the
                                        development, sell all the completed housing units and then
                                        keep the profits because the housing units were not to be
                                        torn down. On the basis of the sale, the plaintiff was given
                                        a cut of 5%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_339"></a>339    There is no
                                        parallel in the present case. Here, the first to fifth and
                                        ninth defendants are already restrained by an injunction
                                        from making further use or profiting from Clearlab’s
                                        confidential information. Further, in view of the proven
                                        danger that this order may be breached, I have issued
                                        another injunction for a period of five years prohibiting
                                        the first to fifth and ninth defendants from manufacturing
                                        contact lenses using the spin-cast method. If <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages are to
                                        compensate for the future use of Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information, this would be double recovery. It is not right
                                        that the defendants have to buy the release of their
                                        obligations (by paying <em>Wrotham
                                                Park</em> damages) and then be injuncted from
                                        using any of Clearlab’s confidential
                                information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_340"></a>340    Thus, the more
                                        appropriate remedy in the circumstances of the case is the
                                        two injunctions and the delivery up order. Along with the
                                        costs order, they should effectively restore Clearlab to the
                                        same position that it would have been in had the defendants
                                        not breached their obligation of confidence. I will
                                        therefore decline to make any order for <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_341"></a>341    As for past
                                        misuse, Clearlab submitted that there was a period between
                                        the breach and interim injunction that needs to be
                                        compensated for. Prior to the execution of the interim
                                        injunction on 17 October 2011, each of the first to fifth
                                        and ninth defendants were clearly in breach of confidence
                                        and/or fiduciary duty. The exact dates of when the breach
                                        began are unknown, but, for Ting, it could be as early as
                                        March 2011 when he was attending meetings at Aquilus and,
                                        for David, it was at least since 22 May 2011 when he started
                                        sending Ting emails containing Clearlab’s confidential
                                        information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_342"></a>342    However, the
                                        argument that <em>Wrotham Park</em>
                                        damages are available for that specific timeframe is
                                        tenuous. It seems to have no regard for commercial reality.
                                        The fact is that no agreement could hypothetically have been
                                        struck between the parties for a limited use of confidential
                                        information in Aquilus that can never come to fruition

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On my reading of the authorities, where damages are to

                                        for the use of the confidential information for such time
                                        and extent before the products are fully developed for the
                                        market. It is a prime example of a hypothetical agreement
                                        that is “outside the bounds of realistic commercial
                                        acceptability”. The licensor, Clearlab, has everything to
                                        gain, in terms of monetary compensation, for loaning out the
                                        confidential information, whereas the licensee, the
                                        defendants, are ultimately prevented from benefiting from
                                        the use of the confidential information because the licence
                                        to use is retracted just before they are ready to sell the
                                        products made using the confidential information. The value
                                        of a licence for such temporary and restricted use is
                                        zero.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_344"></a>344    For the reasons
                                        above, Clearlab is not entitled to <em>Wrotham Park</em> damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damages / account of profits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_345"></a>345    The claim for
                                        damages or account of profits (at Clearlab’s election) can
                                        be summarily dismissed for the reason that no proof of loss
                                        or profits was adduced before the court. This is not
                                        surprising. The interim injunction was obtained in time
                                        before the defendants sold any products. There is therefore
                                        neither loss that is shown to be attributable to defendants’
                                        breach, nor any profit made by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_346"></a>346    In the premises,
                                        Clearlab has succeeded against: (a) the ex-employees, Ho and
