The parties have three children (collectively, “the Children”). The Husband described himself as a retiree. The Wife stated that she is the director of a company, [B] Pte Ltd (“[B]”). The divorce was uncontested. Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 27 March 2020, on the ground that the marriage had irretrievably broken down, because the Wife had sufficiently proven that the parties had lived apart for a continuous period of at least four years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ for Divorce on 19 October 2018.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was in line with the general starting position in law (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">BPC v BPB</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 608 (“<span class="font-italic">BPC</span>”) at [26]). Both parties also agreed that the non-monetary assets should take the valuation that was closest to the date of the Ancillary Matters (“AM”) hearing, 13 July 2022, while the monetary assets should be valued as of the date of the IJ. I accepted the parties’ positions on the applicable dates, bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157 (at [36] and [39]) that multiple operative dates are distinctly possible if the circumstances and the nature of the assets so warrant, and there is nothing to preclude the court from applying different cut-off dates to different categories of assets if the circumstances so warrant. The parties also agreed on the applicable exchange rates, which I adopted.

Although the court recognised that it was technically a matrimonial asset, the apartment was acquired by the wife only after the parties separated. They had by then lived apart continuously for at least three and a half years. The husband had also by then ceased to make contributions to the family, and had not contributed to the acquisition of the apartment, financially or otherwise (at [35] and [45]). In <span class="font-italic">Woon Wee Lee</span>, the court similarly exercised its discretion to exclude a flat which had been bought by the husband when the marriage had already broken down, shortly before the parties separated.

The Husband claimed that [B] had been formed with a view to dissipating matrimonial assets, namely the distributorship of [C] Software, at a time when divorce was imminent. Thus, the Husband submitted that this should be regarded as a wrongful dissipation and that the distributorship of [C] Software should be included in the pool of MAs.

In those cases, the assets were added back to the pool of MAs because the impugned conduct was carried out with the purpose of depleting the pool (see <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [68]). This situation is, however, very similar to that in <span class="font-italic">Lim Ngeok Yuen</span> and <span class="font-italic">Woon Wee Lee</span>, where an asset was acquired by a party after the marriage had already broken down and the other party did not make any contributions to the acquisition of that asset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 While the divorce proceedings were only filed in October 2018, the evidence was that the parties had been separated for some time by the time [B] was incorporated on 17 July 2018.

However, as the agreed date of valuation was the IJ date, I accepted the valuation set out in the Joint Summary as the closest in time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In <span class="font-italic">VMO v VMP</span> [2020] SGHCF 23 (“<span class="font-italic">VMO</span>”), the court considered (at [54]–[56]) a submission by the husband for the exclusion of the wife’s liabilities from the pool of MAs. The husband argued that the wife should not have incurred the credit card debt and personal loan constituting the liabilities and, as such, she should be made to bear these liabilities herself. The court in <span class="font-italic">VMO </span>found that the principle in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL</span>”) at [24] in relation to substantial sums that are expended by one spouse during the period in which divorce proceedings are imminent was similarly applicable to such a contention on the exclusion of liabilities. In <span class="font-italic">TNL</span>, the Court of Appeal held that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24  … with respect to items (c) to (g), the issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. <span class="font-italic">We are of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool </span><span class="font-italic">if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time.</span> Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full. In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill expenses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A decision to exclude liabilities from the pool of MAs (thereby preventing a deduction from the pool) is the same in substance as a decision to return expended sums into the pool (<span class="font-italic">VMO</span> at [55]).

In the absence of consent, the party “who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full” (<span class="font-italic">TNL</span> at [24]). Applying the principle in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span>, the court in <span class="font-italic">VMO</span> found that there was nothing unusual about the transactions that made it appropriate to exclude the liabilities.

She produced valuation reports (valued as of 12 August 2022) to justify the increase in valuation. While the parties had agreed in the Joint Summary that non-monetary assets were to be valued as of the date of the AM hearing (13 July 2022), the AM hearing had not concluded as of the time of the updated valuation. The AM hearing had amongst other things, been adjourned for parties to file their (updated) Joint Summary.

The converse, however, is true where an asset is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span><span class="font-underline">not</span> a matrimonial asset.

</div> The Husband submitted that, at that time, the Wife had no cash or substantial CPF funds to assist in the purchase, as she was a student (or a fresh graduate) who was not drawing a salary. The Husband’s evidence was that shortly after selling Marbella in 2006 at a profit of approximately $300,000, he “went on a property buying spree”. Sanctuary, which had been purchased by the Husband prior to the marriage and in his sole name, was sold in 2007 at a profit of approximately $200,000 (but see [42] below). His case was that he had relied on profits earned from the sale of Marbella and Sanctuary to purchase the subsequent properties.

To arrive at his claimed contribution of 97%, the Husband took sole credit for the $840,000 bank loan, on the basis that the loan had been applied for and approved based solely on his income and work experience given that the Wife was a fresh graduate and unemployed at that time.

The Husband, however, did not provide evidence that satisfactorily supported his claim that he contributed 97%.

</div>
</div> However, the Husband appeared to take the position that because the rental income had been derived from properties which should be credited solely to him, the rental income should therefore also be attributed to him solely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It has been held that rental income earned from jointly held properties, if used to pay for mortgage instalments during the marriage, could be attributed to both parties as their contributions. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Ngeok Yuen</span>, the court held that rental moneys would belong to the parties in the same proportions as which they had contributed to the purchase of the property (at [47]). In that case, there had been sufficient evidence before the court to determine the parties’ respective contributions to the acquisition. Conversely, in <span class="font-italic">Toh Buan Eileen</span> <span class="font-italic">v Ho Kiang Fah</span> [2013] SGHC 66, there was insufficient evidence to establish with precision each party’s respective financial contributions to the acquisition of an investment property (at [24]). Nevertheless, in so far as the rental proceeds from that property had been applied towards the repayment for the mortgage, the court apportioned the amount of rental income credited as direct contributions equally between the parties, since it was found that the parties each owned a half share in the property (at [26]). Similarly, in this case, neither party could clearly establish their precise contributions to each property. I repeat my findings above (at [46], [51] and [55]) that the parties were jointly entitled to the profits from the sale of Marbella and that both parties jointly managed the Companies which profits were used to fund the purchase of the parties’ properties. In light of this, the Husband did not provide any explanation why the rental income from their properties so acquired should not be attributed to both parties equally. I accordingly found that the rental income should be jointly attributed to both parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As emphasized at the start of my analysis, the courts take a broad brush approach, rather than undertake a detailed arithmetical investigation that seeks to trace each and every minutiae of the parties’ respective contributions. In a case where the documentary evidence falls short of establishing exactly who made what contribution and/or the extent of such contribution, the court must take a “rough and ready approximation” (<span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> at [23]).Taking into consideration all the evidence before the court, I found that the Wife’s direct financial contributions were broadly proportionate to the Husband’s, with the exception of their CPF contributions, which the Wife acknowledged.

She had not provided any evidence to support this submission. At the same time, the Husband had not provided any evidence above a bare assertion to refute the Wife’s claim that she did in fact contribute to the running of the Companies or to show that he had contributed more to the running of the Companies. In any event, the Wife’s evidence was that the profits from the Companies were directed also towards the purchase of their properties, which I had taken into consideration as part of assessing the parties’ direct financial contributions. In addition, while the Husband has been retired since 2005, he testified that he has contributed to the finances of the family through income from his investments. This was not challenged by the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Examining the evidence on the whole, I found that both the Husband and Wife had contributed to raising their three children over the years, although the extent of their involvement differed during different periods of their children’s lives.

Hence, on the evidence before the court, I found that it would be appropriate to assess the parties’ indirect contributions at 50:50.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Final division of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Wife submitted that the MAs should be divided 40.5:59.5 (Husband:Wife) in her favour, based on her submission of 51:49 (Husband:Wife) for direct financial contributions and 30:70 (Husband:Wife) for indirect contributions. The Husband asked that a broad-brush approach be taken in the division and that 20% be awarded to the Wife.

That case involved a husband who was largely the sole breadwinner and most of the assets were acquired by him. The court regarded the marriage there as effectively being a “single-income marriage” (at [63]). In contrast, as set out above, I found this to be a dual-income marriage. In addition, even in <span class="font-italic">VIG</span>, the court had awarded 30% to the wife for the 12-year marriage (at [61] and [75]). In this case, the marriage lasted 15 years. In other words, the Husband sought a lower percentage for the Wife here compared to in <span class="font-italic">VIG</span>, which he relied on, despite the marriage here being longer than in <span class="font-italic">VIG</span>.

</div> Second, the bank statement that the Husband exhibited to show the rental collected was a bank statement from a bank account which had not been declared when he had filed his 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means.

I also did not find any factor to warrant shifting the weightage of the ratios and hence applied equal weightage to the ratios. Following from this, I divided the MAs of the parties according to a ratio of 50.5:49.5 in favour of the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Transfer of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Wife’s share computed to $4,395,426.49.

When the parties appeared before the court for directions regarding the transfer of assets, the Wife had already received $650,000 from the proceeds of the sale of the River Valley Apartment.

</div>
</div> First, the Wife’s valuation was based on a valuation report. The Husband had every opportunity to obtain his own valuation report. He chose not to do so. Hence, the fact that the Malaysian Pontian Land was valued at a certain amount did not necessarily mean that it must be transferred to the Wife. Second, there was no precedent for allowing parties to pick and choose which assets in sole names should be transferred to the other party. By and large, unless there were special circumstances, parties were to retain all assets in their sole name and only jointly held properties were to be divided or sold. To allow parties to nitpick in this way would invite endless arguments and open the floodgates of litigation on such issues. Further, transferring such properties involved time, costs, and expenses. It should therefore be avoided in the absence of special reasons. Third, the Husband had not provided a Bizfile/ACRA equivalent showing the shareholding of [G]. The Wife submitted that the other shareholder of [G] was the Husband’s friend and this may impede the Wife’s attempts to deal with the land. The Husband’s friend may also favour the Husband’s interest over the Wife’s. Fourth, foreigners were not allowed to own property in Malaysia and there was nothing to suggest that the Wife can legally take over and own the land. The Husband had admitted in his 2nd Affidavit of Assets and Means that foreigners were not eligible to buy or own property in Malaysia, which was why the Wife’s mother had to own Malaysian property in the Husband’s name. The Wife also highlighted that foreign ownership of Malaysian land and properties involved multiple restrictions and obstacles, and cited potential issues with the Malaysian National Land Code and Real Property Gains Tax rates for non-citizens.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I did not find there to be a principled, just, or equitable reason to order that the Husband’s 50% share in [G] be transferred to the Wife. When asked why the Husband could not sell his share in [G] and thereafter transfer the proceeds to the Wife, his counsel explained that this was because the Husband felt that since the Pontian Land was valued on the basis of the Wife’s valuation report, she should be made to accept it.

</div> However, I agreed with the Wife’s submission that the Husband had chosen not to take the opportunity to provide a valuation report to dispute the Wife’s valuation. Neither was there any principled basis for a party to select particular assets from different jurisdictions for transfer to the other party. I agreed with the Wife that the more principled approach would be to resolve the joint assets first, before considering what needed to be transferred from the solely owned assets. In addition, there were clearly regulatory concerns for the Wife, as a Singaporean, in holding or acquiring a 50% share of [G], which was a Malaysian company. While the Husband offered to file further affidavits to show that these concerns could be addressed, I did not consider that this was a fruitful approach given the lack of a principled basis for the very premise of the transfer, and given that the Wife would then have to negotiate with a third party on the management of [G].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Following the approach of considering first the parties’ joint assets, I examined the parties’ four jointly held properties situated in the United States (“US”). The Husband had proposed that his share in one of these properties, US Cleveland House 1, be transferred to the Wife. I was prepared to order for the sale of all four of their US properties and for the sale proceeds to be given to the Wife, should the Wife have been unwilling to receive the Husband’s share of these properties. However, the Wife informed me at the hearing that she was prepared to have the Husband’s share in those four properties transferred to her. I hence ordered for such transfer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The remaining joint asset of the parties involved the sale proceeds from the sale of the River Valley Apartment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Husband and Wife had already received $650,000 each, out of the sale proceeds of $2,134,407.02 for the River Valley Apartment. The remaining sale proceeds were held by their solicitors. If this sum was shared equally between the parties, it would have meant $417,198.51 for each party. When the Husband made his proposal that the Wife receive the Pontian Land, he had also proposed that the Wife’s share of the $417,198.51 be transferred to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 At the hearing, the Wife proposed that she be allowed to retain the $417,198.51 held by her solicitors, while the Husband would retain $295,788.60 out of the $417,198.51 held by his solicitors, and that the balance of $121,409.91 be transferred to the Wife. The Husband’s solicitor informed me that this arrangement had been discussed with the Wife’s solicitor, but that the Husband’s consent had not been obtained.
