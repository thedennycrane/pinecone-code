The defendant filed a counterclaim for the price of goods which the plaintiff failed to take delivery of. On 3 October 2017, I gave judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $52,111.37, and judgment to the defendant on its counterclaim in the sum of $78,087.60. The defendant then raised its defence of set-off. Although it had been pleaded in the defence, neither party had made submissions on the defence of set-off in closing submissions. I agreed to hear further submissions from both parties on the defence of set-off.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 12 March 2018, I heard further submissions and decided in favour of the defendant on its defence of set-off. Accordingly, I varied the previous orders that I made on 3 October 2017 to the following orders instead: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed with costs; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) judgment was entered for the defendant on its counterclaim in the amount of $25,976.23 with interest and costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On the question of costs, it turned out that the defendant had made offers to settle the plaintiff’s claim and the counterclaim. The offer to settle the plaintiff’s claim exceeded the amount that I found the plaintiff was entitled to, whilst the offer to settle the counterclaim was less than the amount that I found the defendant was entitled to. I awarded the defendant costs on the standard basis until the date of the offer to settle and costs on an indemnity basis thereafter. I fixed the costs at $96,200 plus disbursements to be fixed by me, if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Both parties have appealed against my decision. The plaintiff’s appeal is against the whole of my decision given on 12 March 2018. The defendant’s appeal is against my decision awarding $52,111.37 to the plaintiff (which was then set-off against the defendant’s counterclaim), and the costs order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The plaintiffs were in the business of manufacturing and assembling products for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, including asthma inhalers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In 2003, the plaintiff was approached by IVAX Pharmaceuticals UK Limited (“IVAX”) through the Economic Development Board. IVAX was looking into the manufacture and assembly of asthma inhalers in Singapore.

The plaintiff contacted the defendant regarding the manufacture and supply of the Springs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Both the plaintiff and the defendant held discussions with IVAX’s representatives. IVAX required both the plaintiff and the defendant to undergo a pre-qualification process. From around 2003 to 2004, the defendant took part in this process. The defendant had to show that it would be able to meet the requirements set out in the following documents:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Component Vendor Specifications (“CVS”) for the Springs.

According to the defendant, these Drawings only required the Springs to undergo passivation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my judgment, the evidence supports the plaintiff’s claim that although the Agreement did not have the schedules attached to it, the defendant had agreed to carry out the 100K Cleaning Process and the parties agreed that it could do so through Alantac. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 First, the defendant’s assertion that the Quotation Terms were the only terms agreed to between the parties, made no commercial sense at all. The Springs were to be used in the manufacture and assembly of asthma inhalers, and as such had to meet stringent standards of cleanliness. This was known to the defendant. The defendant (and Alantac) had to undergo a rigorous pre-qualification process and was approved as a supplier only after IVAX was satisfied that the defendant was able to supply the Springs in accordance with the stringent requirements (including the 100K Cleaning Process). It was completely illogical that the parties would have agreed that the defendant would thereafter no longer be required to comply with these requirements. In my view, the inescapable conclusion was that the parties agreed to proceed on the basis that the defendant would supply the Springs in compliance with the requirements set out in the QP Checklists and the CVS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, the defendant’s alternative defence that it was required to comply only with the Drawings, also made no commercial sense for the same reasons given at [27] above. In addition, the defendant’s claim that it was bound only by the Drawings but not the QP Checklists and the CVS was also illogical. All these documents were made available to the defendant during the pre-qualification process. The defendant admitted that the Drawings were provided to it by the plaintiff during the period from 2003 to 2004 when the defendant was undergoing the pre-qualification process.

As stated at [11] above, the COC was a requirement under the Agreement. There was no reason for the defendant to issue the COCs unless it had agreed that the Springs were to undergo the 100K Cleaning Process. The defendant even went to the extent of issuing COCs for compression springs which had not been sent to Alantac to undergo the 100K Cleaning Process. In my view, the issuance of the COCs clearly indicated the existence of the defendant’s agreement that the Springs had to undergo the 100K Cleaning Process requirement. The defendant’s issuance of false COCs was even stronger evidence of such agreement as it testified to the importance that the parties attached to the COCs and the 100K Cleaning Process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The defendant’s explanation for these false COCs was that they were issued as a result of an oversight.

Again, there was no reason for the defendant to have done so unless it had agreed that the Springs had to undergo the 100K Cleaning Process. The defendant denied having sent the Springs to Alantac for purposes of the 100K Cleaning Process. I rejected the defendant’s denial for the reasons set out below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The defendant gave inconsistent explanations as to why it had sent the Springs to Alantac.

The defendant had to know that dirty compression springs could result in loss of profits to the plaintiff. The defendant knew that the Springs were components which the plaintiff used in manufacturing and assembling asthma inhalers for sale to its own customers. The defendant asserted that it did not know whether IVAX was the plaintiff’s customer or manufacturing partner. In my view, this did not exonerate the defendant. It was sufficient that the defendant knew that the plaintiff was manufacturing the inhalers for sale to its own customers. In any event, I found the defendant’s assertion difficult to believe given that the defendant had participated in IVAX’s rigorous pre-qualification process from 2003 to 2004. Further, in at least one of its emails to the defendant, the plaintiff had referred to IVAX as its customer.

</div> As stated earlier, this constituted a breach by the defendant. The plaintiff’s internal investigations found that its own machines and assembly lines were not the cause of the compression springs being stained. In my view, it was a reasonable inference that the defendant’s breach was the cause of the dirty compression springs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Cleanliness was clearly an important requirement in the manufacture of the inhalers. In my view, it was also within the reasonable contemplation of the parties that any discovery of stains on the compression springs would necessarily call for an investigation into the cause. The plaintiff acted reasonably in carrying out its internal investigations and this led to the missed shipment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I concluded therefore that there was a sufficient causal link between the defendant’s breach and the plaintiff’s missed shipment. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to claim damages in the form of its loss of profits arising from the missed shipment. Nevertheless, the plaintiff still had to prove its loss of profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, the plaintiff failed to prove its loss of profits. The plaintiff was unable to substantiate how it came to the sum of $315,398.55 that it claimed. In any event, that amount did not represent its true loss of profits. It was clear that in computing that amount, the plaintiff had not deducted all of its expenses. One glaring example was that the plaintiff had not deducted labour costs.

Set-off is only available in respect of debts or liquidated demands due between the same parties in the same right: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure  2018 </span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">SCP 2018</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 18/17/3.

I agreed with the defendant that it was entitled to rely on any of these set-offs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 A legal set-off involves a debt or liquidated sum due from the plaintiff to the defendant that is capable of being liquidated or ascertained with precision at the time of pleading: <span class="font-italic">SCP 2018</span> at para 18/17/4. In this case, the defendant’s counterclaim for $78,087.60 in respect of the Outstanding Orders clearly satisfied this requirement and entitled the defendant to a legal set-off against the plaintiff’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 An equitable set-off may apply whether the amount is ascertained or not, so long as the cross-claim arises from the same transaction as the plaintiff’s claim or is closely connected with it such that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the plaintiff to enforce payment without taking into account the cross-claim: <span class="font-italic">Pacific Rim Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong &amp; another</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 643 at [35]. In the present case, the defendant’s counterclaim did not arise out of the same transaction as the plaintiff’s claim but it was sufficiently closely connected with the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim such that it would be manifestly unjust not to take it into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Set-off by judgment arises under the Court’s inherent jurisdiction to set-off cross-liabilities which have been established by judgments, leaving one single liability for the balance sum: <span class="font-italic">Longyuan-Arrk (Macao) Pte Ltd v Show and Tell Productions Pte Ltd and another suit</span> [2013] SGHC 160 at [66]. In the present case, the set-off clearly involved cross-liabilities established by judgments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present case, the amount found due to the defendant on its counterclaim exceeded the amount found due to the plaintiff on its claim. This meant that the defendant succeeded in its defence to the plaintiff’s claim and was therefore entitled to an order that the plaintiff’s claim be dismissed. As the amount awarded on the counterclaim exceeded that awarded on the plaintiff’s claim, the defendant was also entitled to judgment for the balance of its counterclaim after the set-off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The plaintiff argued that even if the defence of set-off succeeded, the plaintiff’s claim should not be dismissed because the plaintiff had succeeded in proving breach by the defendant. The plaintiff urged me to exercise my inherent jurisdiction to prevent an unjust result.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I disagreed with the plaintiff. In my view, the inherent jurisdiction of this Court did not allow me to disregard the principles of set-off or the consequences of a successful defence of set-off. In any event, it could not be said that there was anything unjust in the result. A successful defence of set-off against the whole of the plaintiff’s claim necessarily meant that the plaintiff had succeeded in establishing its claim, but that that claim was extinguished by the defendant’s successful cross-claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Accordingly, my final orders were that the plaintiff’s claim be dismissed and that judgment be entered for the defendant for the balance of its counterclaim. It follows from the error described in [43] above that the judgment on the counterclaim should be for the balance sum of $25,958.77

There was no reason why costs should not follow the event. The defendant was therefore entitled to costs of defending the plaintiff’s claim. In addition, the defendant had succeeded in obtaining judgment for the balance of its counterclaim after the set-off and was therefore also entitled to costs on its counterclaim, see: <span class="font-italic">Hanak v Green</span> [1958] 2 WLR 755, at pp 767 and 770 cited in <span class="font-italic">Yong Mok Hin v United Malay States Sugar Industries Ltd</span> [1966] MLJ 286.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The defendant then informed me that on 25 August 2015, it had made two offers to settle. The first was an offer to settle the plaintiff’s claim on the following terms (“the Claim OTS”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant shall pay the plaintiff $100,000.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff shall pay the defendant’s costs up to the date of the acceptance of the offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The second was an offer to settle the counterclaim on the following terms (“the Counterclaim OTS”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff shall pay the defendant $70,000.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff shall pay the defendant’s costs up to the date of the acceptance of the offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The plaintiff did not accept the offers. The defendant submitted that pursuant to O 22A r 9 of the Rules, it was entitled to costs on a standard basis (“standard costs”) up to the date the offers to settle were served and on an indemnity basis (“indemnity costs”) thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 O 22A r 9 provides for two situations where an offer to settle is not accepted:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where an offer to settle is made by a <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span> and he obtains a judgment not less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle.

</div> on its claim and the defendant was entitled to recover $78,087.60 on its counterclaim (“the underlying findings”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Applying O 22A rr 9(1) and 9(3) to the two final orders would have meant that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the plaintiff would have to pay standard costs for the dismissal of its claim up to the date of service of the Claim OTS and indemnity costs thereafter, since the final order dismissing the claim was clearly not more favourable than the terms of the Claim OTS, and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the defendant would only be entitled to standard costs on its counterclaim since the final order on the counterclaim was less favourable than the terms of the Counterclaim OTS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 However, in my view, the result at [85(b)] above would be unfair to the defendant. After all, I had found that the defendant had succeeded in proving its counterclaim of $78,087.60 and this finding was more favourable to it than the terms of the Counterclaim OTS. The defendant should be entitled to indemnity costs on its counterclaim from the date of service of the Counterclaim OTS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 On the other hand, applying O 22A rr 9(1) and 9(3) to the underlying findings meant that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the plaintiff would be entitled to standard costs for its claim until the date of service of the Claim OTS and the defendant would be entitled to indemnity costs thereafter; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the defendant would be entitled to standard costs for its counterclaim until the date of service of the Counterclaim OTS and indemnity costs thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The result in [87(a)] above would be unfair to the defendant because it would have defeated the purpose of its defence of set-off. Having succeeded in its defence of set-off which extinguished the plaintiff’s claim, the defendant was entitled to have the plaintiff’s claim dismissed with costs. The defendant should not have to pay the plaintiff any costs in respect of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 A strict application of O 22A rr 9(1) and 9(3) in the present case therefore would not produce a fair result that would be consistent with the intent of O 22A r 9. Fortunately, the drafters of the Rules in their wisdom saw it fit to preserve the court’s discretion to order otherwise in O 22A rr 9(1) and 9(3). This overriding discretion is also preserved in O 22A r 9(5).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In my view, taking into consideration the terms of the offers to settle, the underlying findings and the final orders, the fair order to make was that the plaintiff was to pay the costs of the dismissal of its claim and the costs of the counterclaim on the standard basis up to the date of service of the offers to settle and on the indemnity basis thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The plaintiff pointed out that although the Claim OTS provided for the defendant to pay $100,000 to the plaintiff, it also required the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs up to the date of acceptance of the offer. The plaintiff submitted that the Claim OTS was not valid because </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it did not comply with O 22A r 9(3) which provides that the plaintiff is entitled to standard costs to the date the offer was served; and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it was not a serious and genuine offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I disagreed with the plaintiff’s submissions. First, O 22A r 9(3) merely provides for the cost consequences if a plaintiff obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle. It does not prescribe what terms as to costs may be included in an offer to settle. A defendant is free to include such terms as to costs that it considers appropriate in its offer to settle. Second, it is true that an offer to settle must be a serious and genuine offer and that for it to be a serious and genuine offer, it should also contain reasonable terms: <span class="font-italic">Ram Das V N v SIA Engineering Co Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 267 at [23]. However, in my view, the term in the Claim OTS requiring the plaintiff to pay costs did not mean that the offer was not a serious and genuine offer. There was no other reason to doubt that the Claim OTS was a serious and genuine one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As for the quantum of the costs, the plaintiff submitted that defendant costs for its counterclaim should be awarded on the State Courts scale pursuant to O 59 r 27(5) of the Rules. I disagreed. The plaintiff had commenced this action in the High Court. The counterclaim was closely connected to the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim. Clearly, there was sufficient reason for the counterclaim to be brought in this action and there was no reason to deny the defendant costs on the High Court scale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The trial took about four and a half days. Taking into consideration the issues, the fact that some of the issues had been decided against the defendant, and that the defendant was entitled to indemnity costs after the date of service of the offers to settle, I ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant total costs fixed at $96,200 plus disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The plaintiff succeeded in proving that the defendant had breached its contractual obligations. However, it was only able to prove losses suffered in the amount of $52,111.37.
