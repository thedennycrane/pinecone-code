</div> The order appointed the plaintiffs jointly as his trustees in bankruptcy (“the Trustees”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiffs have formed the view that the Bankrupt entered into ten transactions with one or more of the defendants before his bankruptcy which: (a) are fraudulent transactions calculated to put assets out of the reach of his creditors; (b) are transactions at an undervalue or unfair preferences; or (c) give the Bankrupt a cause of action for a civil remedy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Trustees have therefore commenced this action against the defendants seeking orders requiring the defendants to restore the bankrupt’s estate to the position it would have been in if these transactions had not taken place or for a civil remedy arising from the Bankrupt’s cause of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The bankruptcy order against the Bankrupt was made under s 59 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). It is common ground, therefore, that the subject matter of this action, insofar as it involves the statutory law of insolvency, is governed by the Act rather than by its successor statute, the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018. In any event, the provisions of both statutes have identical effect insofar as they are material to the Trustees’ claims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Bankrupt and the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Bankrupt </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Bankrupt is not a party to this action.

In September 2015, there was a 70% collapse in the price of IHC shares. In his affidavit in support of his bankruptcy application, the Bankrupt traces the beginning of his financial distress to this event in September 2015. The collapse in the price of IHC shares affected the Bankrupt’s financial position most directly and most obviously by reducing the value of his substantial shareholding in IHC. But it also reduced the value of his substantial shareholding in HMC, a major shareholder in IHC. As a result, from September 2015, the Bankrupt was exposed to actual or apprehended defaults and cross-defaults and a cascade of litigation and arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Bankrupt’s financial distress appears to have come to a head in the first quarter of 2017. On 8 March 2017, the Bankrupt filed an application to have himself adjudicated bankrupt. He no doubt intended thereby to protect himself and his estate from further unilateral creditor action. In his application, the Bankrupt nominated the three plaintiffs to be his trustees in bankruptcy. The Trustees were duly appointed his trustees on 30 March 2017. Upon the making of the order, all of the Bankrupt’s property vested in the Trustees under s 76(1) read with s 36(2) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Trustees commenced this action in December 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The defendants initially named the Bankrupt as a witness for the defence at trial.

She gave evidence at trial, therefore, not just for herself but also for the two corporate defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 One of the issues in dispute in this action is whether, and if so for what periods, the Bankrupt was a director of the two corporate defendants. In my view, I need not make any findings of fact on this issue. That is because I am satisfied on the totality of the evidence adduced at trial, and despite any oral evidence from the Bankrupt or the second defendant to the contrary, that the Bankrupt has at all material times been a person in accordance with whose directions the second defendant (as the sole authorised representative of the sole corporate director of the two corporate defendants) was accustomed to act in relation to their affairs. In other words, I find that the Bankrupt was what is commonly called a shadow director of both the first and third defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Three documents dated 28 February 2010</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The starting point in analysing the claims and defences in this action are three documents.

It is signed by the Bankrupt and the second defendant in her capacity as a director of the first defendant.

Mr Aathar features prominently in the Bankrupt’s business dealings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The SLA contains three key provisions.

Third, if the first defendant terminates the loan, the Bankrupt is obliged to transfer to the first defendant either 401m HMC shares or equivalent securities worth $63m within one business day of the first defendant’s demand to that effect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Shareholder Agreement for Minority Protection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Like the SLA, the SAMP is, on its face, a formal document obviously drawn up by a lawyer or adapted by a lay person from a <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> agreement drawn up by a lawyer.

First, it makes an express connection to the SLA by reciting that the Bankrupt and the first defendant were also entering into the SLA under which the first defendant would lend the Bankrupt 401m HMC shares worth $63m. Second, the SAMP gives the second defendant an option to purchase all 58 of the Bankrupt’s shares in the first defendant for $1 if the first defendant terminates the share loan in accordance with the SLA and the Bankrupt breaches his obligation to transfer 401m HMC shares or equivalent securities worth $63m to the first defendant within one business day of a demand to that effect.

That left only a further 301m HMC shares for the first defendant to lend to the Bankrupt. The first defendant duly lent these 301m shares to the Bankrupt or to his order in eight tranches: one tranche in February 2010, one tranche in April 2010, one tranche in July 2010, one tranche in February 2011, two tranches in March 2011 and two tranches in June 2011.

</div> The POA is like the SLA and the SAMP in three respects. First, it bears the date 28 February 2010. Second, it bears the signature of the Bankrupt and the second defendant and is impressed with the first defendant’s company stamp. Third, it contains language which reflects the substance of all six of the key terms of the SLA and the SAMP (see [25] and [27] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The POA is unlike the SLA and the SAMP in four respects. First, the POA is a single document comprising only six numbered paragraphs set out over two-thirds of a single page. Second, the POA does not bear the hallmarks of having been drawn up or adapted from an agreement drawn up by a lawyer. It is recorded in the language of a layperson. Thus, the six key points of the SLA and the SAMP are expressed in the POA in very different language from that found in the SLA and the SAMP. Third, the signatures of the Bankrupt and the second defendant on the POA are not witnessed. Finally, the second defendant signed the POA only once, with no designation of the capacity in which she did so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendants’ case now rests on the POA and not the SLA or the SAMP. In her affidavit, she explains that it was the POA – not the SLA and the SAMP – that was signed at the conclusion of the negotiations for the share loan (see [36] above). Her evidence now is that: (a) the Bankrupt and she signed the POA in February 2010 to record the terms on which the first defendant would lend the 401m shares to the Bankrupt while protecting her interest as a minority shareholder in the first defendant; and (b) that she and the Bankrupt created the SLA and the SAMP in September 2016 as a “long form agreement” to “regularize” the POA which they had already signed on or about 28 February 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 This is how the second defendant puts it in her affidavit of evidence in chief (internal references omitted):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40. [The Bankrupt] suggested that there should be something in writing to protect my position as a shareholder of [the first defendant]. The [POA] was drawn up and executed on 28 February 2010 …. On or about 7 September 2016, a "long form" agreement … was prepared and signed …. The LFA was dated 28 February 2010 to "regularize" what [the Bankrupt] and I had already accomplished on 28 February 2010 the [POA] [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]. I do not wish to rely on the LFA in the Defence. l accept that the LFA executed on 7 September 20l6 is null and void and of no effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This paragraph refers only to the “long form agreement” being null and void and devoid of legal effect. That could be taken as a reference only to the SLA and not to the SAMP. Indeed, the defendants’ closing written submissions proceed on that basis. But the second defendant accepted in cross-examination that the SAMP is also null and void and devoid of legal effect, and that the defendants’ case now rests principally on the POA.

</div> This reliance on the POA is consistent with the defendants’ presentation of their case in their closing submissions after trial. In any event, if a finding is required, I find that the Bankrupt and the second defendant created the SAMP together with the SLA in September 2016 and at that time falsely dated it 28 February 2010. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In April 2019, together with the POA, the defendants disclosed a second set of notices and demands purportedly sent between 2011 and 2015 pursuant to the POA.

</div> Even then, they did abandon the false narrative out of genuine remorse or a genuine desire to present the truth. They did so only because the Trustees sought particulars of the defendants’ pleading and were about to reveal their deception by commissioning a forensic examination of the SLA and the SAMP. I find that the defendants had every intention of maintaining the false narrative until judgment in this action. They abandoned it only because they realised that the Trustees’ forensic examination of the SLA and the SAMP was about to reveal the false narrative. More egregiously, the Bankrupt and the defendants did not disclose even then that the notices and demands allegedly issued under the SLA and the SAMP were also falsely backdated.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I have no hesitation in finding that the Bankrupt and the second defendant hatched a deliberate plan in September 2016, a time when the Bankrupt had already been in financial distress for a year, to create and falsely date documents to serve as evidence supporting a false narrative. Their intention was (in anticipation of bankruptcy) to deceive the Official Receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy and (in anticipation of litigation) to deceive a court. It bears reiterating that the Bankrupt was adjudicated bankrupt on his own application and not that of a creditor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The defendants’ deception is, in one sense, a continuing deception. They made false statements of fact in their defence knowing them to be false. Despite admitting that these statements are false, the defendants have never applied to amend their defence to withdraw the statements and to rest their defence on the truth. Procedurally, the false statements in the defence continue to form the backbone of the only formal basis on which the defendants ask me to exonerate them from liability in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Further, because of the scope and audacity of this deception, I consider both the Bankrupt’s evidence and the second defendant’s evidence to be highly unsatisfactory, not just on the SLA, the SAMP, the POA and the notices and demands allegedly issued under them, but on every issue which I have to decide in this action. I therefore treat their oral evidence on every contested issue of fact with the utmost caution and the greatest scepticism, save only to the extent that their oral evidence amounts to an admission within the meaning of s 17 read with s 19 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) or is corroborated by contemporaneous and independent documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 None of these findings are intended to cast any aspersions on the defendants’ solicitors who drafted the defence or who were the medium by which the defendants made their disclosure of documents. The defendants’ solicitors were no doubt as much a victim of the Bankrupt’s and the defendants’ deception as the Trustees and the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendants’ current position</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The defendants’ position, taken in the second defendant’s evidence and in their closing written submissions, is that the SLA and the SAMP are null and void and devoid of legal effect. They therefore expressly disavow any reliance in this action on those documents, or on the notices and demands allegedly issued under them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendants do, however, now rely on the POA and the notices and demands allegedly issued under it on every issue of fact for which their pleaded defence relies on the SLA, the SAMP and the notices and demands allegedly issued under them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Trustees submit that the defendants’ case should stand or fall on the case pleaded in their defence, and not on their case as advanced through the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s evidence at trial and closing written submissions. They submit that the Trustees should succeed in this action <span class="font-italic">in limine</span> on a point of pleading alone: (a) because the defence which the defendants now advance through the evidence of the Bankrupt and the second defendant and in their closing written submissions is a fundamental and impermissible departure from their pleaded defence; (b) because the defendants now admit that the two agreements which form the centrepiece of their defence are null and void and devoid of legal effect; and (c) because the defence rests on statements of fact which the defendants pleaded knowing that they were false and which the defendants maintain as their pleaded case despite admitting they are false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Trustees, quite rightly, do not press this point strongly. I prefer not to decide this case on a point of pleading. That remains my view despite the very serious deception and abuse of process which the defendants practised on the court by filing and leaving unamended a defence they know to be false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As an indulgence to the defendants, I will analyse the Trustees’ claims and the defendants’ defences on the merits. I do so on the assumption that: (a) the defendants put forward the POA as a truly dated document recording a genuine agreement reached between the plaintiff, the first defendant and the second defendant in February 2010; (b) the defendants’ defence now relies on the POA on every issue of fact for which their pleaded defence relies on the SLA and the SAMP; and (c) the defendants’ defence now relies on the notices and demands allegedly issued under the POA on every issue of fact for which their pleaded defence relies on the notices and demands allegedly issued under the SLA and the SAMP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I now turn to consider whether the POA is a truly-dated agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My findings on the POA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I find that the POA, like the SLA and the SAMP, is a falsely backdated agreement. I come to that conclusion for five reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 First, given the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s admitted propensity for creating and falsely backdating self-serving documents, I accord only the slightest weight not just to their oral evidence but also to any document emanating from them. On the issue of whether the POA was created and signed in February 2010, they have every incentive to lie. One obvious incentive is simply to avoid liability on the merits of the plaintiff’s case. A more subtle incentive is that, facing the exposure of their deception practiced through the SLA and the SAMP, they had an incentive to minimise the scope of the deception by maintaining that the substance of their case is true and it is only through the documents tendered in support of their case that they sought to deceive the Trustees and the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Second, the defendants produced the POA and the notices and demands allegedly issued under it for the first time in April 2019. The Bankrupt did not produce these documents to the Trustees when they made a specific request for this class of documents in 2017. The defendants made no reference to these documents in their defence, which was filed in January 2018 and amended in June 2018. The defendants did not disclose these documents in their initial round of disclosure in this action in February 2019. All of these failures cause especial concern given the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s admitted propensity for creating and falsely backdating self-serving documents. These omissions strongly suggest to me that the POA and the notices and demands allegedly issued under it are a recent fabrication and not truly dated documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Third, even if I accept the defendants’ case that the first defendant lent 100m out of the 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt in July 2009,

</div>
</div>
</div> there is no evidence that the first defendant had any basis in February 2010 to expect that it would acquire a further 301m HMC shares with which to discharge its obligation to lend a total of 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Indeed, the available objective evidence militates against any such finding. The first point I make is that I have thus far rounded off the number of HMC shares which the first defendant undertook a contractual obligation to lend to the Bankrupt under the POA. The POA states that the first defendant’s contractual obligation is to lend the exact figure of 401,359,748 HMC shares to the Bankrupt. As I have mentioned, it is the defendant’s case that when the first defendant lent the last tranche of HMC shares to the Bankrupt in June 2011, that left the first defendant with zero HMC shares. The first defendant’s obligation to the Bankrupt under the POA was therefore fully discharged in June 2011 with the first defendant having lent the Bankrupt a total of exactly 401,359,748 HMC shares between July 2009 and June 2011.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 This means that the Bankrupt, the first defendant and the second defendant somehow, in February 2010, foresaw that exactly 301,359,748 more HMC shares would be transferred, allotted, declared by way of scrip dividend or vested by way of a rights issue or bonus shares in the first defendant between February 2010 and June 2011, not one share more or one share less. That is highly improbable. It is more likely to me that this figure of 401,359,748 was inserted into a falsely dated POA after it was calculated in June 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I also reject the defendants’ case that the first defendant in fact lent 401m shares to the Bankrupt in July 2009. It is true that the first defendant transferred 100m HMC shares to the Bankrupt in July 2009. But HMC’s substantial shareholder disclosure records that the first defendant was transferring these 100m HMC shares to the Bankrupt for no consideration because he already owned the shares beneficially. The contemporaneous documents show that the first defendant was a bare trustee of these 100m HMC shares for the Bankrupt, not a lender of these 100m HMC shares to the Bankrupt.

</div> This contradicts the defendants’ explanation that the transfer was a loan. I reject the Bankrupt’s explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Further, this explanation finds no support in the terms of the SLA or the POA. Neither record that the first defendant had already fulfilled in part its obligation to lend 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt. On the face of these documents, the first defendant would be in breach if its obligations if lent the Bankrupt only 301m HMC shares in or after February 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The defendants’ submission in response is that the terms of HMC’s substantial shareholder disclosure in July 2009 was mistaken. The Bankrupt claims that another director of HMC simply cut and pasted into this disclosure the text of the other director’s own and unrelated disclosure from an earlier transfer.

</div> I reject this explanation. There is no contemporaneous documentary evidence or even the oral evidence of any officer of HMC to support the Bankrupt’s oral evidence. It is supported only by the Bankrupt’s own self-serving assertion. Further, the earlier disclosure is not, in fact, identical to HMC’s disclosure of the first defendant’s transfer of 100m shares. It is materially different in that the disclosure of the Bankrupt’s transfer expressly says that the transfer is for zero consideration.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q. … You have agreed to it earlier, but just for the            record, again, you agree with [the second defendant] that the [SLA] was dated on 28 February 2010 to regularise what had already been accomplished on 28 February 2010?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A. Yes.  Can I elaborate?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q. Go ahead.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A.    I think when [the first defendant] took on to get a long form agreement, it was intended to be more comprehensive, and I understand that [the first defendant] has now been advised by its lawyers that this document is less suitable than the [POA], and therefore it does not fulfil what was intended by [the first defendant] to achieve.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I do not accept that either the first defendant, the second defendant or the Bankrupt could ever have been advised by any lawyer to create more than six years after the fact and falsely backdate a more “suitable” and “comprehensive” agreement which simply restated in more formal language the key commercial terms of an earlier genuine agreement in the form of the POA which was entered into in February 2010 and truly dated. The conduct of the Bankrupt and the defendants in drawing up the SLA and the SAMP in September 2016 suggests to me very strongly that the POA was not in existence when the SLA and the SAMP were created.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Finally, as the Trustees point out, the POA and all of the notices and demands allegedly issued under it which contain the first defendant’s company stamp (being four of the seven documents) show the first defendant’s name entirely in uppercase. These four documents were, on the defendants’ current case, created, signed and stamped on four different dates between 2010 and 2015. There is evidence that the first defendant had another company stamp in use during this period in which the first defendant’s name was spelled with initial capital letters only. The fact that four documents said to have been created at different times over a span of five years use the same version of the first defendant’s two (or possibly more) company stamps also suggests that these four documents were, in fact, created, signed and stamped on a single occasion. That, in turn, suggests that all seven documents were created on one occasion and falsely backdated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I therefore reject the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s oral evidence that the POA was created and signed in February 2010. Further, they have put in evidence only a copy of the POA. They maintain that the original POA is no longer available. A copy cannot, obviously be submitted for any meaningful forensic analysis. Their oral evidence therefore cannot be corroborated or contradicted by a forensic analysis of the POA. There is therefore, quite conveniently for the Bankrupt and the second defendant, no independent means by which to verify their oral evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The findings I have made so far mean that the POA is, like the SLA and the SAMP, a document which is null and void and devoid of legal effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In any event, even if the POA was in truth created and executed in February 2010, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was a sham agreement. I find that the Bankrupt, the first defendant and the second defendant had no intention whatsoever that the POA should create the legal rights and obligations which it gives the appearance of creating (<span class="font-italic">Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd v Sheagar s/o T M Veloo</span> [2014] 1 SLR 24 (“<span class="font-italic">Belfield</span>”) at [33]); <span class="font-italic">Zulaikha Bee bte Mohideen Abdul Kadir v Quek Chek Khiang and others</span> [2014] 4 SLR 532 (“<span class="font-italic">Zulaikha</span>”) at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It is true that the burden of proving that a document is a sham rests on the party alleging it to be a sham. It is also true that there is a strong presumption that parties intend to be bound by the provisions of the agreements they enter into (<span class="font-italic">Belfield </span>at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Zulaikha</span> at [58]). But it remains the case that a party who alleges a document to be a sham need only discharge that burden on the balance of probabilities. Given the peculiar features of this case and in particular my findings about the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s dishonesty, I am satisfied that the Trustees have discharged that burden. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at all material times the Bankrupt used the second defendant as well as the companies which he or the second defendant owned or controlled as his nominees in connection with his business affairs, and more particularly in connection with his substantial shareholding in HMC and IHC. The companies which the Bankrupt used as his nominees include but are not limited to the first defendant and the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 By the term “nominee”, I do not mean that the Bankrupt used the defendants and other nominees to hold assets on bare trust for him. Who holds the beneficial interest in any assets as between the Bankrupt and the nominee remains a separate question of law to be determined on the specific facts relating to a specific asset. By the term “nominee”, I mean simply that the Bankrupt used the defendants and other legal persons to hold assets subject to his direction, with the intention and the expectation that the nominee would comply with his directions to transfer these assets to himself or to his order without question; and even though his nominees were under no legal obligation to do so and even if they held full title to the assets at law and in equity. And I am also satisfied that the defendants and his other nominees did in fact comply with the Bankrupt’s directions to this effect without question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Therefore, while I accept that the first defendant transferred 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt or to his order between July 2009 and June 2011, I do not accept that the first defendant did so pursuant to any legal obligation, whether under the POA or any other agreement. Further, while I accept that the first defendant did not intend these 401m HMC shares to be a gift to the Bankrupt, I find that the first defendant intended the Bankrupt to have full title to these HMC shares at law and in equity, so that the Bankrupt could deal with them as though they were his own absolutely, and be subject to no legal obligation to return the HMC shares or to account for their value to the first defendant. The first defendant transferred the 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt purely on the strength of the first defendant’s faith in the Bankrupt that he would return the shares or account to the first defendant for the value of the shares at some time and in some way, despite having no legal obligation to do so. I do not accept that the Bankrupt ever intended to give the second defendant an option to acquire his shares in the first defendant if he failed to return to the first defendant 401m HMC shares or equivalent securities worth $63m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I find further that the first defendant transferred these 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt at the direction of the Bankrupt, where necessary exercised through the medium of the second defendant. In other words, the Bankrupt directed all of these transfers totalling 401m HMC shares, as well as the transactions which form the subject matter of this action, both for the transferor and the transferee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 On those findings, even if the Bankrupt and the defendants are telling the truth when they say that they created and signed the POA in February 2010, the POA was and is a sham. The Bankrupt, the first defendant and the second defendant intended it to be devoid of legal effect and to be nothing more than a pretence to mislead third parties (<span class="font-italic">iTronic Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Swee Leon</span><span class="font-italic"> and another suit</span> [2016] 3 SLR 663 (“<span class="font-italic">iTronic</span>”) at [63]). Even if truly-dated, it is therefore devoid of legal effect. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Bankrupt’s solvency at the material times</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The transactions which the Trustees challenge in this action took place during two broad periods of time in 2016 and 2017. Although I will explain the significance of these periods in the course of my analysis, it suffices for now to say that the two broad periods are: (a) between February and May 2016; and (b) February 2017, shortly before the Bankrupt was adjudicated bankrupt.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The Trustees’ case is that the bankrupt was insolvent in both of these broad periods. The relevant test of insolvency which I must apply to ascertain the Bankrupt’s solvency or insolvency is found in s 100(4) of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  … [A]n individual shall be insolvent if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) he is unable to pay his debts as they fall due; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the value of his assets is less than the amount of his liabilities, taking into account his contingent and prospective liabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In summary, I find that the Bankrupt was insolvent during both of these periods. Indeed, I am prepared to go so far as to say that he was insolvent from the time that IHC share price collapsed in September 2015 onwards. Before setting out the reasons for these findings, I make some preliminary findings on the reliability of the evidence of solvency which the parties have presented.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidence of solvency</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 There are only three categories of evidence available as to the Bankrupt’s solvency during these three periods: (a) the evidence of the Bankrupt, both in his affidavit of evidence in chief and in cross-examination; (b) the evidence of the second defendant, both in her affidavit of evidence in chief and in cross-examination; and (c) the contemporaneous and independent evidence which the Trustees have gathered on the matters in issue in the course of administering the Bankrupt’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For reasons which I have already set out, I approach the evidence of both the Bankrupt and the second defendant with the utmost caution. I therefore place the greatest weight on the third of these three categories, and on the inferences to be drawn from the inherent probabilities arising from this category of evidence and from the undisputed and indisputable facts and circumstances surrounding this category of evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I now set out some additional reasons for treating the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s evidence of the Bankrupt’s solvency during these two periods with the utmost caution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Bankrupt’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For two reasons, I treat the Bankrupt’s evidence as to his solvency during these periods with the utmost caution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 First, the Bankrupt drew up his affidavit of evidence in chief and gave his evidence in cross-examination in a self-serving and defensive manner. Apart from some introductory material about his commercial background, his affidavit of evidence in chief is confined to denying any wrongdoing on his part, denying selected elements of the Trustees’ case on insolvency as well as on the substance of the impugned transactions and to making minor and ultimately immaterial complaints about the conduct of the Trustees and their solicitors in interviewing him and in interpreting his answers in those interviews. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 It is obvious from the content of his affidavit of evidence in chief and the manner in which he answered questions in cross-examination that he was determined merely to respond to the Trustees’ case rather than to be forthcoming. In other words, he was content to limit his evidence to finding fault with the Trustees’ case and intent on not revealing any information about his assets or liabilities which the Trustees did not already know. He gave his evidence to advance his and the second defendant’s interests, not to assist the court to ascertain the truth. It is particularly telling that the Bankrupt does not elaborate on his liabilities during these periods. Section 100(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) requires me to take into account the Bankrupt’s contingent and prospective liabilities in ascertaining whether he was insolvent within the meaning of s 100(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Second, whether the Bankrupt was or was not solvent between 2013 and 2017 is a matter especially within the Bankrupt’s knowledge. It is true that the Bankrupt is not a party to this action. Section 108 of the Evidence Act cannot, therefore, operate to cast on to him or on to the defendants the burden of proving his solvency. However, there is much force in the Trustees’ point that the Bankrupt could quite easily have included in his affidavit of evidence in chief a rough balance sheet setting out his assets and liabilities between 2013 and 2017, all from his personal knowledge and supported by the contemporaneous and independent documentary evidence which he almost certainly must have.

</div> He is, after all, obliged under s 81 of the Act to submit his statement of affairs and under s 82 of the Act to submit accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 It is telling that the Bankrupt did not deign to provide any such accounts or balance sheets. Instead, he chose either to rely on general assertions about his solvency or to quibble with elements of the Trustees’ case on solvency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I therefore consider the Bankrupt’s oral evidence of only the slightest assistance in ascertaining whether he was solvent during these two periods.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The second defendant’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The second defendant’s evidence of the Bankrupt’s solvency is even more unsatisfactory than the Bankrupt’s. After introducing herself, the second defendant begins her affidavit of evidence in chief by saying this:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. I have personal knowledge of the matters stated in this affidavit except where I say otherwise. As to matters which are not of my personal knowledge, I depose to them on the basis of the information which I believe to be true and which are contained in the records of the 1st Defendant which I have kept as a director of the 1st Defendant from I February 2006 until 18 August 2017, and from conversations with my husband Fan Kow Hin, the Bankrupt in B.479/2017. Where statements in this affidavit consist of propositions of law, these are based on advice given by the Defendants' solicitors, Ang &amp; Partners, which l believe are correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 A paragraph like this has no place whatsoever in an affidavit of evidence in chief. Under O 38 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed), an affidavit of evidence in chief stands at trial in the place of a witness’s oral evidence in chief. O 38 r 2(5) provides that nothing in O 38 r 2 makes any evidence admissible at trial which would be inadmissible if given orally. Section s 62(1) of the Evidence Act provides that evidence at trial on issues of fact must be direct evidence. In order for the oral evidence of a witness of fact to be admissible at trial, it must be evidence of a fact which the witness perceived through her own physical senses (whether sight, hearing or any other sense) or in any other manner. That is what is meant by the shorthand term “personal knowledge”. Section 62(1) of the Evidence Act is the hearsay rule stated in the Evidence Act’s customary inclusionary form rather than in the common law’s customary exclusionary form. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The direct evidence rule from the Evidence Act is reflected not only in the provisions of the Rules of Court which deal with affidavits of evidence in chief, but also in the provisions of the Rules of Court which deal with affidavits generally. Under O 41 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court, an affidavit is permitted to contain only those facts which the deponent is able to prove of his own knowledge. This is subject only to the exceptions set out in O 41 r 5 itself. One of those exceptions is found in O 41 r 5(2) of the Rules of Court. That subrule permits an affidavit to contain statements of fact which the deponent makes on information and belief. But that exception applies only to an affidavit sworn or affirmed for use in interlocutory applications. An affidavit of evidence in chief is, by definition, sworn or affirmed for use at trial (see <span class="font-italic">Beijing Sinozonto Mining Investment Co Ltd v Goldenray Consortium (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 814 at [51]). Order 41 r 5(2) cannot apply to an affidavit of evidence in chief, which is governed by the general rule in O 41 r 5(1), O 38 r 2 of the Rules of Court and in s 62(1) of the Evidence Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The mere fact that the second defendant’s statements of fact about the Bankrupt’s solvency during these periods are based on her conversations with the Bankrupt cannot therefore render them admissible at trial. Furthermore, the second defendant has not applied under O 38 r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) for leave to give evidence on information and belief about the Bankrupt’s solvency during these periods. Nor has she even attempted to comply with the notice procedure under O 38 r 4. That procedure is a condition precedent to admitting her evidence of the Bankrupt’s solvency during these periods under any of the exceptions to s 62(1) of the Evidence Act which are set out in s 32(1) of the Evidence Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Even more egregiously, there is no evidential or procedural scope whatsoever for a witness of fact, such as the second defendant, to give evidence of propositions of law in an affidavit of evidence in chief, whether upon information and belief or otherwise (see the concluding sentence in paragraph 2 of her affidavit of evidence in chief, set out [103] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The defendant’s evidence about the Bankrupt’s solvency during these periods comprises statements of fact about his assets and liabilities at various times. These statements include two tables in her affidavit of evidence in chief.

</div> Her evidence that the Bankrupt was solvent at any given time is not direct evidence on that issue within the meaning of s 62(1) of the Evidence Act. She has not brought that evidence within any of the exceptions to that rule of admissibility. The second defendant’s evidence is wholly inadmissible to prove that the Bankrupt was solvent at any time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In any event, even if I am wrong on this, or even if the second defendant had secured an order under O 38 r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or complied with the notice procedure under O 38 r 4 and brought her evidence on this issue within an available exception to s 62(1) of the Evidence Act, I would have attached only the slightest weight to her evidence. I say that for three reasons. First, as I have already stated and as the second defendant herself accepts, she has no personal knowledge of these facts. Second, the best evidence of the Bankrupt’s solvency comes from the Bankrupt himself. The Trustees have made the Bankrupt’s evidence available to me, albeit under subpoena. The second defendant herself concedes that her evidence of the Bankrupt’s debts, assets and liabilities originates from the Bankrupt himself. Given that I have the Bankrupt’s evidence on these matters before me (for whatever it may be worth), there is no reason for me to attach any weight to the second defendant’s second-hand evidence of the Bankrupt’s evidence.

</div> For reasons set out below, I find that the Bankrupt continued to hold 58 shares in the first defendant until February 2017. So, at most 58% of this value can be attributed notionally to the Bankrupt’s balance sheet in September 2015 or as at February to May 2016. Further, the Bankrupt admitted that the first defendant had liabilities which would have to be deducted from the first defendant’s assets before deriving a national value to be attributed to the Bankrupt’s 58 shares in the first defendant.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Trustees’ case in response rests on three points. First, the POA is a sham agreement. I have already accepted this submission. Second, the Bankrupt transferred these shares to the second defendant for no consideration or for only nominal consideration, intending to put those assets out of the reach of his creditors. This transaction should therefore be set aside as a fraudulent conveyance, as a transaction at an undervalue or an unfair preference. Finally, the transfer was the result of a conspiracy between the defendants and the Bankrupt to injure the Bankrupt’s economic interests by unlawful means, rendering the defendants liable to pay damages to the Bankrupt’s estate in tort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 For the reasons which follow, I accept the Trustees’ submission that the Bankrupt’s transfer of these shares to the second defendant was a fraudulent conveyance and a transaction at an undervalue. But I do not accept their submission that they are entitled to recover damages from the defendants for an actionable conspiracy between the Bankrupt and the defendants in respect of these shares. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fraudulent conveyance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The Trustees first submission is that the Bankrupt’s transfer of his 58 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant was a fraudulent conveyance within the meaning of s 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1886 (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the CLPA”). To succeed in that submission, the Trustees must establish the following five elements:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The transfer of these shares was a conveyance of property.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That the Bankrupt conveyed the shares with the intent of defrauding his creditors.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Bankrupt’s creditors were prejudiced by the conveyance of the shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Bankrupt did not dispose of his interest in the shares for valuable consideration and in good faith or upon good consideration and in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The second defendant did not have, at the time of the transfer, notice of the Bankrupt’s intent to defraud his creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Of these five elements, there can be no doubt on the first, third and fourth elements. The shares are property. The Bankrupt’s transfer of the shares to the second defendant was a conveyance of that property. The conveyance of the shares has prejudiced the Bankrupt’s creditors because it took these shares out of the pool of the Bankrupt’s assets available to repay his creditors <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span>. The consideration which the second defendant paid for the transfer of the Bankrupt’s shares was $1, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was purely nominal. The SLA, the SAMP and the POA all having been admitted or found to be devoid of legal effect, the Bankrupt was under no obligation whatsoever to transfer the shares to the second defendant. Further, for the reasons set out at [158]–[171] below, I accept that shares in the first defendant had substantial value at all material times. The Bankrupt therefore did not convey the shares to the second defendant for valuable consideration or upon good consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Only the following two elements remain in issue: (a) whether the Bankrupt transferred these shares to the second defendant with intent to defraud his creditors; and (b) whether the second defendant had notice of the Bankrupt’s fraudulent intent. For the following reasons, I accept the Trustees’ case on both points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Whether the Bankrupt had the necessary fraudulent intent and whether the second defendant had notice of it is to be tested at the time of the transfer. The first question then, is when the Bankrupt transferred his 58 shares to the second defendant. It is the Bankrupt’s and the defendants’ case that the Bankrupt did so in a single tranche of all 58 shares. The Bankrupt and the defendants thereby admit that the transfer took place on a single date. The question is whether that date is in November 2013, as the Bankrupt and the defendants submit, or on a date after 17 February 2017, as the Trustees submit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 For the reasons which follow, I accept the Trustees’ submission that the Bankrupt transferred these shares to the second defendant on a date after 17 February 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">When were the Bankrupt’s 58 shares in the first defendant transferred to the second defendant?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 On 17 February 2017, IHC made a substantial shareholder declaration. This declaration described the Bankrupt as a substantial shareholder of the first defendant. IHC disclosed that the Bankrupt had a deemed interest in the IHC shares which the first defendant then owned. IHC made this disclosure expressly on the basis that the Bankrupt then owned shares in the first defendant. IHC did not make this disclosure on the basis that the Bankrupt was the spouse of the second defendant, who owned all of the shares in the first defendant. Further, this declaration would have been necessary only if the Bankrupt was entitled to exercise or control the exercise of more than 20% of the voting shares in the first defendant.

</div> The defendants’ case is that, after November 2013, the Bankrupt controlled no voting rights in the first defendant whatsoever. IHC’s disclosure on 17 February 2017 directly contradicts the Bankrupt’s and the defendants’ evidence. I reject their evidence and hold that the Bankrupt continued to own 58 shares in the first defendant as late as 17 February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Bankrupt’s evidence in response is that IHC’s substantial shareholder disclosure was somehow mistaken. I do not accept this evidence. The Bankrupt is an experienced businessman. He has long experience of being an executive and a non-executive director of listed companies and of the regulatory regime covering them. The evidence shows that over 100 substantial shareholder declarations had been made over the years in respect of his holdings in public companies. I find it unlikely that he or a company which he led would have made such a fundamental mistake. The Bankrupt and IHC were assisted in making these substantial shareholder disclosures by IHC’s Catalist sponsor as well as IHC’s regulatory and compliance staff. I find it equally unlikely that any of these regulatory and compliance professionals would have made such a fundamental mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The defendants offered no independent evidence of any such mistake, for example by calling a representative of the Catalist sponsor or of IHC’s regulatory and compliance staff.

</div>
</div> For reasons I have already given, I treat the Bankrupt’s evidence with the utmost caution. I therefore reject the Bankrupt’s uncorroborated evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I now turn to consider the Bankrupt’s intent and whether the second defendant had notice of that intent in February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Bankrupt’s fraudulent intent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I have no hesitation in finding that the Bankrupt had the necessary fraudulent intent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 First, I have found that the Bankrupt and the second defendant hatched a deliberate plan in September 2016 – a time when the Bankrupt had already been in financial distress if not insolvent for a year – to create and falsely date documents to support a false narrative in anticipation of bankruptcy and litigation. I find also that the purpose of this plan was to create a plausible and fraudulent paper trail to take the Bankrupt’s 58 shares in the first defendant out of the pool of the Bankrupt’s assets available to satisfy creditors’ claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 It is true that September 2016 is about six months before the Bankrupt’s bankruptcy order. But, as I have also found, his fraudulent intent was a sustained deception which continued even after he was adjudicated bankrupt and up to trial. I therefore have no hesitation in finding that he was acting pursuant to this fraudulent intent at all times in and after September 2016, including at the time these shares were transferred to the second defendant, which I have found to be at some point after 17 February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Second, and in any event, on my findings, the Bankrupt is presumed to have acted with fraudulent intent. He conveyed the shares to the second defendant for nominal consideration at a time when the Bankrupt was insolvent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, February 2017. If a person conveys property to another for no consideration or for nominal consideration and that person is then insolvent or becomes insolvent by reason of the conveyance, a fraudulent intent for the purposes of s 73B of the CLPA will be irrebuttably imputed to that person, even if he did not subjectively intend to defraud his creditors: <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ong and Co Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 (“<span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee</span>”) at [21]–[37]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 I have found that the Bankrupt was insolvent in February 2017. The circumstances of this case therefore warrant imputing irrebuttably to the Bankrupt an intent to defraud his creditors regardless of his subjective intent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The second defendant’s fraudulent intent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 As for the second defendant, she actively participated in the Bankrupt’s fraudulent intent in two ways. First, she participated in creating and signing the SLA, the SAMP, the POA and the notices and demands allegedly issued under all three agreements. Second, she adopted the Bankrupt’s false narrative by pleading it as her defence, knowing it to be false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Indeed, I am prepared to find that the second defendant had more than simply notice of the Bankrupt’s fraudulent intent. I find that the Bankrupt’s fraudulent intent was in fact the common fraudulent intent of both the Bankrupt and the second defendant at all times in and after September 2016 up until the trial of this action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on fraudulent conveyance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 For the foregoing reasons, I accept that the Bankrupt’s conveyance of 58 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant took place after 17 February 2017, and therefore at a time when he was insolvent. I further accept that the conveyance took place pursuant to the Bankrupt and the second defendant’s common fraudulent intention. It was a fraudulent conveyance within the meaning of s 73B of the CLPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Undervalue transaction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The Trustees’ alternative submission is that the Bankrupt’s transfer of his 58 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant was a transaction at an undervalue within the meaning of s 98 of the Act. I accept this submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I have found that the transfer took place after 17 February 2017. I have also found that the Bankrupt was then insolvent. In any event, the Bankrupt is presumed to be insolvent at the time of the transfer. That is because the second defendant is the Bankrupt’s wife and therefore an associate of his within the meaning of s 101(2) of the Act. As such, by reason of s 100(3) of the Act, the Bankrupt is presumed to have been insolvent at the time he transferred the 58 shares to the second defendant or to have become insolvent by reason of the transfer. The burden is on the second defendant, as the transferee of the shares, to disprove the Bankrupt’s insolvency. The second defendant has failed to discharge that burden.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The Bankrupt’s transfer of the 58 shares to the second defendant was at an undervalue. The second defendant paid only nominal consideration of $1 for the shares. Furthermore, I have found that the POA is a sham and devoid of legal effect. Therefore, the Bankrupt was not obliged to sell those shares to the second defendant for $1 or indeed at any price. The transfer of the shares was, in economic substance, a gift by the Bankrupt to the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In response, the defendants submit that shares in the first defendant were worthless because it had been insolvent from 2013 onwards.

The second defendant’s own conduct therefore suggests that shares in the first defendant had some value at the time of transfer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Second, there would have been no reason for the Bankrupt and the second defendant to hatch a deliberate plan in September 2016 to create and falsely date documents to serve as evidence supporting a false narrative to explain the transfer of these 58 shares if the first defendant was indeed insolvent from 2013 onwards, thereby rendering its shares worthless. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Third, the evidence shows that the Bankrupt conveyed assets to the first defendant on nine occasions between 2013 and 2017. If the first defendant was truly insolvent from 2013 onwards, there would be no reason for the Bankrupt to do this and every reason for him not to do this. Doing this would simply put assets within the reach of the first defendant’s creditors to which those creditors would not otherwise have had access. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Fourth, I do not accept that the defendants have produced any or any sufficient evidence to establish that the first defendant was insolvent from 2013 onwards. It is the defendants who assert that the first defendant was insolvent from 2013 onwards. Further, the financial state of the first defendant is a matter especially within the knowledge of the first defendant and of the second defendant, as a director of the first defendant. They bear the burden of proof on this issue under ss 103 and 108 of the Evidence Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The defendants have produced a statement of the first defendant’s assets and liabilities drawn up as at 4 November 2013. This statement allegedly shows that the first defendant’s liabilities exceeded its assets by $22.6m as at that date. I reject this statement. This statement self-servingly understates its assets and overstates its liabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 This statement shows that the first defendant held only 8.1m IHC shares worth $2.9m in November 2013. In fact, IHC’s contemporaneous substantial shareholder declarations show that the first defendant held 19.3m IHC shares worth $5.8m at that time. The defendants attempted to explain this discrepancy on the basis that the first defendant transferred 11.2m IHC shares to the Bankrupt in September 2013. But IHC’s substantial shareholder declarations in October 2013 and January 2014, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after September 2013, show that the first defendant continued to hold 19.3m IHC shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 This statement is contradicted by the defendants’ own case on what they refer to as “the IHC Dividend Agreement”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defence at para 13.1.3, SDB Tab 10, p 280 at p 305.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> According to the defendants, the Bankrupt held 33.03m IHC shares worth $15.8m on trust for the first defendant under the terms of the IHC Dividend Agreement. The defendants’ case on the IHC Dividend Agreement is as follows. When IHC was listed in July 2013, HMC distributed a special dividend of 82.29 IHC shares <span class="font-italic">in specie </span>from HMC’s shareholding in IHC for every 1,000 shares held by a shareholder of HMC. At that time, the first defendant had transferred a total of 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt between July 2009 and June 2011. As such, the Bankrupt was entitled to and did receive 33.03m IHC shares by way of an <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">specie</span> dividend from HMC. In July 2013, the second defendant in her capacity as the first defendant’s agent agreed orally with the Bankrupt that the Bankrupt would hold these 33.03m IHC shares on trust for the first defendant. This agreement is what the defendants refer to as the IHC Dividend Agreement. I find below that there was never any agreement to this effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In any event, it suffices to say for present purposes that, for the defendants’ own case to be internally consistent, these 33.03m IHC shares worth $15.8m should be reflected in the first defendant’s balance sheet as at 4 November 2013. That is because their case is that these 33.03m IHC shares were an asset beneficially owned by the first defendant, albeit with legal title held by the Bankrupt. But these IHC shares are omitted entirely from this statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The defendants’ only explanation for this omission is that the 33.03m IHC shares covered by the IHC Dividend Agreement are represented by 8.1m IHC shares held in the first defendant’s own name which the second defendant has included in this statement. As the Trustees point out, this explanation is unsatisfactory. If the Bankrupt were holding 33.03m shares on trust for the first defendant, as the defendants claim, why would 8m of them be held in the first defendant’s own name? And in any event, this explanation fails to account for the remaining 24.93m IHC shares alleged to be subject to the IHC Dividend Agreement. These 24.9m IHC shares appear nowhere in this statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Fifth, this statement is materially inconsistent with the first defendant’s unaudited accounts which the defendants have produced. The unaudited accounts show that the first defendant had assets as at December 2013 of $13.5m whereas this statement shows assets as at November 2013 of only $4.7m. There is no satisfactory explanation for this material discrepancy over such a short period. The unaudited accounts show that the first defendant owes the second defendant $1.57m whereas this statement shows that the first defendant owes the second defendant $1.71m. Again, there is no satisfactory explanation for this material discrepancy. The unaudited accounts show an asset of $71m, being a receivable said to be due from the Bankrupt under the POA. This receivable does not appear in this statement. Again, there is no satisfactory explanation for this material discrepancy. The unaudited accounts write down this receivable by $70m on account of the Bankrupt’s financial distress. But it remains the defendants’ position that the Bankrupt was solvent right up to February 2017. There is no satisfactory explanation for this contradictory position. The unaudited accounts include the 33.03m shares which the Bankrupt allegedly held on trust for the first defendant under the IHC Dividend Agreement. This statement, as I have already pointed out, does not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 All of these discrepancies leave me in no doubt that this statement and the first defendant’s unaudited accounts as at December 2013 are no more satisfactory and no more reliable as evidence than the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s oral evidence. Neither document assists the defendants in discharging their burden on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Sixth, the only two liabilities of the first defendant disclosed in this statement are loans allegedly due to the first defendant and to a company known as Silver Wave. The defendants have produced no evidence that either creditor ever actually advanced any money to the first defendant. They have also produced no evidence as to what the first defendant did with the money advanced. From this statement, it appears that the first defendant has dissipated the proceeds of the loan with no assets to show for it. I draw the adverse inference that there are other assets of the first defendant, connected to the first defendant’s use of these loans, which the defendants have failed to disclose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 For all of these reasons, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the first defendant was indeed insolvent at any time from 2013 until the Bankrupt’s bankruptcy. I therefore accept the Trustees’ case that the consideration of $1 paid by the second defendant for the Bankrupt’s shares in the first defendant was an undervalue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unfair preference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The Trustees’ alternative claim is that the Bankrupt’s transfer of his 58 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant is an unfair preference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 One of the conditions precedent for this transfer to be challenged as an unfair preference is that the second defendant was a creditor of the Bankrupt at the time of the transfer. The Trustees’ claim fails on this ground. On my findings thus far, the second defendant was not a creditor of the Bankrupt in February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The Trustees submit that the second defendant was a creditor of the Bankrupt because she had an unsecured claim against the Bankrupt for damages arising from his failure to transfer his shares in the first defendant to her. However, I have found the POA to be a sham and devoid of legal effect. The Bankrupt was therefore never under any obligation to transfer these shares to the second defendant. She could therefore never have had any claim against the Bankrupt for breach of any such obligation. The second defendant is not a creditor of the Bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 As a result, one of the conditions precedent for this transfer to be challenged as an unfair preference has not been met. The Trustees’ challenge on this ground must fail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The Trustees’ further alternative claim is that the Bankrupt transferred his 58 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant pursuant to sham agreements as a result of which the second defendant holds these shares on trust for the Trustees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The defendants have admitted that the SLA and the SAMP are null and void and devoid of legal effect. Further, I have found that the POA is a sham and devoid of legal effect. On that basis, the Trustees seek a declaration that the second defendant holds these 58 shares in the first defendant on trust for the Bankrupt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The proposition of law on which the Trustees rely for this claim is as follows: where a transferor transfers assets to a transferee pursuant to a sham agreement, the transferee holds the assets on trust for the transferor in the first instance; and on trust for the transferor’s trustee in bankruptcy if the transferee continues to hold the property when the transferor is adjudicated bankrupt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 As authority for this proposition, the Trustees rely on two English cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The first case is <span class="font-italic">Eric Stonham (Trustee in Bankruptcy of Sebastian Ramrattan</span><span class="font-italic">) v Sebastian Ramrattan and another</span> [2010] EWHC 1033 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Stonham</span>”). In that case, the bankrupt conveyed property to his wife by use of a transfer in which he forged the signature of his wife as well as of the witnesses. At first instance, the court characterised the transfer as a “sham” intended to remove assets from the reach of the bankrupt’s creditors. On appeal, Mann J (as he then was) held that the transfer was effective at least, as a matter of English law relating to registered land, to convey legal title to the property to the bankrupt’s wife. But because the transfer was a forgery and devoid of any legal effect, it could not convey the beneficial interest in the property to her. The result was that she held the legal title to the property on trust for the bankrupt in the first instance and, upon his bankruptcy, for his trustee in bankruptcy (at [27]). The appeal from Mann J’s decision is reported as <span class="font-italic">Stonham v Ramrattan </span><span class="font-italic">and another</span> [2011] 1 WLR 1617. The appeal turned on a different point and the English Court of Appeal summarised without comment Mann J’s reasoning on the point on which the Trustees now rely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The second case is <span class="font-italic">Godfrey v Torpy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2007] Bus LR 1203; [2007] All ER (D) 181 (Apr) (“<span class="font-italic">Godfrey</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>). In that case the plaintiff argued that two properties which a bankrupt had transferred to a third party were either: (a) transferred pursuant to sham agreements and therefore held on trust for the bankrupt; or (b) transactions at an undervalue (at [11]). The court found that the bankrupt had used forged documents (at [93], [138] and [142]) to transfer both properties to the third party before she was adjudicated bankrupt. As a result, the court declared that the third party held both properties as bare trustee for the bankrupt (at [158]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I do not accept that <span class="font-italic">Stonham</span> and <span class="font-italic">Godfrey</span> stand for the very wide proposition which the Trustees advance. These cases did not turn on the nature of the bankrupt’s intent in effecting the transfer but on a fundamental defect in the means by which the bankrupt effected the transfer. The bankrupts in both cases used forged documents to effect a purported transfer of property. The court held that the forged documents were devoid of legal effect. That left the property rights in the properties unchanged. But the properties were land, and therefore the defective transfers were effective to convey ownership under the applicable law. But because the means of transfer were devoid of effect, being forgeries, equity intervened to separate the beneficial interest in the property from the legal title to the property. That is why a trust arose in those two cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 In the present case, the Bankrupt’s intent in carrying out the transfer of his 58 shares in the first defendant, as I have found, was to defraud his creditors. This fraudulent intent did not detract from his intent to convey title to the shares to the second defendant. In fact, it reinforces his intent do so. It was his intent to put the shares out of reach of his creditors by vesting title to the shares to the second defendant. He carried out his intent by means of a share transfer form. His fraudulent intent does not render the share transfer form devoid of legal effect. It was not a sham. Further, there is no suggestion that the share transfer form was devoid of legal effect by reason of forgery or some other fundamental defect. The fact that he was motivated by a fraudulent intent directed at third parties (the Trustees and the Bankrupt’s creditors) and the fact that he was under no contractual obligation to transfer the shares to the second defendant does not, in itself, operate in equity to separate legal title to the shares from the beneficial interest in the shares. The transfer was therefore effective to vest title to the shares in the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The result is no different even if I take the broader view and recognise that the Bankrupt and the second defendant created the POA as a sham document expressing an illusory contractual obligation as a plausible pretext for the transfer. The only result of my finding that the POA is a sham and devoid of legal effect is to render the Bankrupt’s transfer of the shares to the second defendant a gift rather than a sale. It does not, in itself, effect a separation of the legal title from the beneficial interest in the shares. And to the extent that his intent constitutes a constructive fraud, that is the basis of the law relating to s 73B of the CLPA, on which the Trustees have already succeeded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 If the Trustees’ submission were correct, every gift by a transferor with a fraudulent intent towards his creditors would permit the transferor, before he was adjudicated bankrupt, to secure a declaration that the transferee holds the gift on trust for the transferor. And it would permit every trustee in bankruptcy, after the transferor is adjudicated bankrupt, to secure such a declaration. That cannot be correct. It would create intolerable instability in property rights pre-bankruptcy. And it would render otiose the law on fraudulent conveyances and undervalue transactions post-bankruptcy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I therefore do not accept that the second defendant held the Bankrupt’s 58 shares in the first defendant on trust for the Bankrupt before 30 March 2017 or on trust for the Trustees after that date. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Restitution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The Trustees’ next alternative claim is that the second defendant is liable to make restitution of the Bankrupt’s 58 shares in the first defendant to the Trustees in the law of unjust enrichment because the shares were transferred to her on a total failure of consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 This claim cannot succeed. This claim asserts a cause of action which accrued to the Bankrupt before his bankruptcy, and which has now vested in the Trustees by reason of the Bankrupt’s bankruptcy. It does not assert a claim which vests in the Trustees by reason of the bankruptcy or under the law of personal insolvency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The effect of my findings on the Bankrupt’s transfer of these shares is no different from finding that the Bankrupt made a gift of his 58 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant. In those circumstances, the Bankrupt would not have had a cause of action to recover the shares from the second defendant pre-bankruptcy. Nor does a transfer of property without legal basis, in itself, give rise to a cause of action for restitution in unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 There is a cause of action for restitution on a failure of consideration only if the property was transferred on a basis which has failed. There is no such basis here. The Trustees can be in no better position than the Bankrupt in relation to pre-bankruptcy claims such as this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The mere fact that the Bankrupt and the second defendant acted pre-bankruptcy with intent to defraud his creditors does not give the Trustees a post-bankruptcy cause of action in restitution, whether on a total failure of consideration or otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The Trustees’ final alternative claim is that the Bankrupt, the first defendant and the second defendant conspired to act to the detriment of the Bankrupt’s creditors by unlawful means, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by wrongfully seeking to transfer the Bankrupt’s shares in the first defendant to the second defendant as a fraudulent conveyance contrary to s 73B of the CLPA or a transaction at an undervalue contrary to s 98 of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 This claim cannot succeed. Insofar as the Bankrupt acted contrary to his own economic interests by transferring his shares in the first defendant to the second defendant for no consideration, that is not actionable by the Bankrupt because he suffered no injury. As I have found, the effect of what the Bankrupt did was no different from making a gift of these 58 shares to the second defendant. He did that of his own free will, albeit motivated by a desire to defraud his creditors contrary to the law. That intent does not, in itself, vitiate his intent to make the gift. Making a gift in the exercise of one’s own free will cannot be economic injury to the person giving the gift. It does not give that person a cause of action in the tort of conspiracy against the recipient of the gift, even if they were both acting with intent to default the gift giver’s creditors. Suppressing that mischief is what the law of fraudulent conveyances and undervalue transactions is addressed towards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In any event, insofar as the alleged conspiracy did cause economic injury to the Bankrupt’s creditors, and even assuming injury to a third party to be actionable in the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means (as opposed to the tort of causing loss by unlawful means), the Bankrupt’s creditors are not the plaintiffs in this action. And rights of action which accrue to a bankrupt’s creditors by reason of his conduct do not, by that reason alone, vest in his trustee in bankruptcy. Those rights can be asserted only by the creditors themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 The Trustees’ claim in conspiracy therefore fails. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged trust over 29 of the Bankrupt’s 58 shares in the first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The second defendant alleges that the Bankrupt holds 29 of his 58 shares in the first defendant on trust for the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 I reject this submission for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 First, this aspect of the defendants’ case is pleaded nowhere. The defence does plead that, upon the first defendant allotting and issuing 58 shares to the Bankrupt in 2007, he initially held 29 of the shares on an express oral trust for the second defendant. But nowhere does the defence plead that the Bankrupt continued to hold 29 out of his 58 shares in the first defendant on trust for the second defendant at the time he transferred those shares to the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Second, this submission is contrary to the defendants’ pleaded case. The defendants’ pleaded case is that this alleged express oral trust which the Bankrupt declared in favour of the second defendant over 29 of his 58 shares in the first defendant was “settled” by the Bankrupt procuring two of his business associates to transfer their 42 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 This allegation is a pure afterthought. It is rejected. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 For all of the foregoing reasons, the Trustees are entitled to an order: (a) that the Bankrupt’s transfer of his 58 shares in the first defendant to the second defendant is a fraudulent conveyance and a transaction at an undervalue and (b) that the second defendant transfer the 58 shares to the Trustees or to their order.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Second transaction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The second transaction which the Trustees raise is the first defendant’s transfers in April 2010 and June 2011 of 233.6m shares said to be owned by the Bankrupt into the first defendant’s accounts with DMG &amp; Partners Securities Pte Ltd (“DMG”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The origin of the 233.6m HMC shares</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 As I have mentioned, it is the defendants’ pleaded case that the first defendant transferred 401m HMC shares to the Bankrupt between July 2009 and June 2011 by way of a loan pursuant to the POA in eight tranches. It is also the defendants’ pleaded case that, at the Bankrupt’s direction, the first defendant appropriated to this loan a total of 194.7m HMC shares which it held and transferred those 194.7m shares into one or more brokerage accounts which the first defendant maintained with DMG. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 The Bankrupt gave a slightly different number in his interviews with the Trustees’ solicitors.

I have already found that the POA is a sham and devoid of legal effect; and that the first defendant transferred the 401m shares to the Bankrupt or to his order at his direction, and without any contractual obligation to do so. That finding in itself suffices to establish that title to these shares vested in the Bankrupt before his bankruptcy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 In any event, I will analyse the defendants’ case as it has been presented.  For the purposes of the remaining analysis, I assume that the first defendant transferred the 233.6m shares to the Bankrupt as a loan under the terms of the POA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The commercial purpose of the POA was to vest title in the Bankrupt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 I accept the Trustees’ submission that title to the 233.6m shares vested in the Bankrupt in April 2010 and June 2011 when the first defendant appropriated the 233.6m shares to the loan. That is simply the commercial purpose of a loan of shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 The commercial purpose of a loan of shares is to allow the borrower to deal with the shares as though they were his own during the period of lending with only a personal obligation to the lender to return an equivalent number of the borrowed shares at the end of the borrowing period. A typical but by no means exclusive reason for borrowing shares is to allow the borrower to short sell the shares, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to benefit from a downward movement in the price of the shares by selling and delivering the shares to a purchaser, hoping to buy the shares back at a lower price before the borrowing period ends and the borrower’s personal obligation to return equivalent shares arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 It is fundamental to the commercial purpose of a share loan that the borrower acquire full and good title to the shares and be able to deliver full and good title to the shares (see <span class="font-italic">Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited</span> (2008) 246 ALR 361 at [45]). Further, it is antithetical to the commercial purpose of a share lending agreement for there to be any separation of legal title from the beneficial interest in the shares (see <span class="font-italic">CMG Equity Investments Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd</span> (2008) 65 ACSR 650 at [13]–[14]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Despite all this, a share lending agreement is simply a contract. It is therefore, of course, open to a lender and a borrower of shares to agree in their contract that the lender will retain some proprietary interest in the shares during the period of borrowing. But there is no such provision in the POA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The Bankrupt well understood that this was the commercial purpose and effect of lending the 401m HMC shares. In his interviews with the Trustees’ solicitors, he accepted that he considered himself at liberty to deal with these shares as he saw fit, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without the first defendant’s knowledge or consent.

But HMC’s contemporaneous substantial shareholder disclosures do not record any such change in OOPL’s shareholding in HMC. Part of this difference can also be attributed to OOPL appearing to have disposed of 1m IHC shares and a number of other shares in unlisted companies between these two dates. But OOPL appears to have acquired nothing in return as a result of these transactions.

</div> I consider the value of $2.18m shown in OOPL’s formal financial statements as at 31 December 2015 to be by far the more reliable evidence of the value of OOPL’s shares in December 2015. These are OOPL’s formal financial statements. It chose to lodge these financial statements with ACRA as a matter of public record. The first defendant must have been satisfied then that these formal financial statements represented a true ad fair view of the first defendant’s financial position. Because they were lodged with ACRA in March 2016, these financial statements are also the only evidence of OOPL’s financial position in or about February 2016 which could not have been produced for or in the course of this litigation. I cannot ignore the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s propensity to produce and falsely date self-serving documents for or in anticipation of this litigation. To that extent, I reject all of the other figures which the defendants now put forward for OOPL’s value as self-serving afterthoughts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241  It is true that the value of $2.18m to be derived from OOPLs formal financial statements does not take into account loans and advances of $1.9m from OOPL’s shareholders.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 I have found as a fact that the Bankrupt was insolvent in February 2016. In any event, the Bankrupt is presumed to have been insolvent at that time or to have become insolvent by reason of the transaction. That is because the third defendant is an associate of the Bankrupt within the meaning of s 100(3) of the Act. The Bankrupt is taken to have control of the third defendant through his control of the first defendant. As I have mentioned, the third defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of the first defendant. The Bankrupt was therefore at all material times “entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one-third or more of the voting power” of the first defendant. This makes the third defendant an associate of the Bankrupt within the meaning of s 101(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 On any view of the facts as I have found them to be, this was a transaction at an undervalue. As against the third defendant, he received only nominal consideration of US$1. As against the first defendant, he either had no liability at all to the first defendant under the POA or he agreed to set off against that liability a sum which was substantially less than what I have found the true value of his shares in OOPL to be.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unfair preference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 It is not the Trustees’ case that the third defendant was a creditor of the Bankrupt in February 2016. I have also found that the POA was a sham and devoid of legal effect. As a result, the first defendant was also not a creditor of the Bankrupt. There is no scope, therefore, to treat the Bankrupt’s transfer of 1,000 OOPL shares to the third defendant as an unfair preference to either the first defendant or the third defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Remedy </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 On the basis that the assets of OOPL may have been dissipated between February 2016 and the date of this judgment, the Trustees seek as a remedy a declaration that the third defendant holds the sum of $2.18m on trust for the Bankrupt, being the value of his 1,000 shares in OOPL at the time of the undervalue transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 I accept this submission. Section 98(2) of the Act empowers me, upon finding that a transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, to make such order restoring the estate’s position to what it would have been if the Bankrupt had not entered into that transaction. I therefore consider that I am not confined to making an order requiring the third defendant simply to transfer the 1,000 shares in OOPL to the Trustees for and on behalf of the Bankrupt <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 I consider that I have the power to order the third defendant to pay to the Trustees for and on behalf of the Bankrupt the sum of $2.18m. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fifth transaction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 Yet another of the Bankrupt’s nominees was a company known as Golden Cliff.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 This balance sheet is unreliable for several reasons. First, there is no evidence that it is a historical record, drawn up on or about the date that it bears, March 2016, or at some other time contemporaneously with the transfer. Second, the balance sheet is unaudited. There is therefore no independent verification of the truth of its contents. Given the Bankrupt’s and the defendants’ established propensity to create self-serving documents to advance their interests in ongoing or anticipated litigation, I consider my suspicions to be entirely justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 The third reason the balance sheet is unreliable is because it is contradicted by what little contemporaneous and independent evidence is available. The balance sheet purports to record that Golden Cliff held 76.75m IHC shares as at 31 March 2016. But IHC’s substantial shareholder disclosures contradict this. In January 2016, IHC disclosed that Golden Cliff held 192m IHC shares as at that date and that the Bankrupt had a deemed interest in those shares.

On that day, he reduced his shareholding in IHC from 23% to 4.67%. That triggered a change of control provision in the bonds. This provision gave bondholders the option to redeem the bonds at par. The Bankrupt knew that his decision to reduce his shareholding in IHC would trigger this change of control provision and the bondholders’ option to redeem the bonds.

I accept the defendants’ submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">317 The subscription agreement did not create or convey any property to the Bankrupt. It merely gave him a contractual right to call on the first defendant to allot and issue five RCPS to him upon paying the final instalment of the subscription price on 31 December 2016. Until and unless the first defendant allotted and issued the RCPS, the Bankrupt would not own any property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">318 When the first defendant exercised its right to terminate the subscription agreement, all it did was to extinguish the contractual rights which the subscription agreement conferred upon the Bankrupt. There was no property in existence for the first defendant to convey to anyone. And no property was conveyed by extinguishing a contractual right. Section 2 of the CLPA defines “conveyance” to include “assignment, appointment, lease, settlement and other assurance made by deed on a sale, mortgage, demise or settlement of any property, and on any other dealing with or for any property; and ‘convey’ has a corresponding meaning”. Nothing of the sort occurred in February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 In light of this finding, it is not necessary to consider any of the other elements necessary to establish a fraudulent conveyance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">320 The first defendant’s termination of the subscription agreement may entitle the Bankrupt to relief from forfeiture in equity.

Similarly, the first defendant’s termination of the subscription agreement was the unilateral exercise of a valid contractual right to terminate the subscription agreement. It was not a transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 Given this finding, it is not necessary to analyse the other elements of a transaction at an undervalue. I hold that the first defendant’s termination of the Bankrupt’s right to be allotted five RCPS in the first defendant was not a transaction at an undervalue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The termination of the five RCPS was an unfair preference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 The Trustees’ alternative submission is that the first defendant’s exercise of its right to terminate the subscription agreement in February 2017 was an unfair preference in favour of the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 The second defendant was not a creditor of the first defendant.

It was part of the Bankrupt’s and the second defendant’s fraudulent common intention to place assets, in this case the 57.8m HMC shares, beyond the reach of the Bankrupt’s creditors in anticipation of his bankruptcy.

In any event, there is a presumption of insolvency because the first defendant is an associate of the Bankrupt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">337 I have already found that the first defendant’s shares have value. The Bankrupt received nothing of value in exchange for the 57.8m HMC shares.
