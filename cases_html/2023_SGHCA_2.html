This was not seriously contested. Neither did Deluge dispute that the value of  the main works that had been completed at the time Vim left the site (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 February 2018) was $1,742,537.74, which was $7,462.26 less than the contractually stipulated value of $1.75m.

In closing submissions, however, Deluge claimed to have paid Vim $1,293,104.90 (and so $449,432.84 remained outstanding).

Since the value of main works up to the point Vim left the site was $1,742,537.74 (see [7] above), Deluge owed Vim the balance of $1,742,537.74 - $1,288,624.80 = <span class="font-weight-bold">$453,912.94</span> in respect of main works.

</div> Furthermore, Deluge’s representatives had signed the variation works forms. In these circumstances, the requirement of Deluge’s written instructions under cl 16 had been waived or, alternatively, that Deluge was estopped from enforcing the writing requirement because Vim had relied, to its detriment, on representations made by Deluge that the latter would pay Vim in respect of the variation works. In this regard, Vim tendered in evidence its variation works forms which Deluge’s representatives had signed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Deluge mounted two complete defences to liability and one defence to quantum in respect of the variation works claim. First, Deluge contended that the claimed “variation works” were actually main works falling within the scope of cll 2, 4, and 5 of the Subcontract or rectification works (see [16] below). This was contended to be consistent with Deluge’s conduct because it had never accepted the works disclosed in Vim’s variation works invoices to be variation works.

Finally, even if Vim had a valid claim for variation works, the quantum should be confined to $106,579.51 owing to Vim’s: (a) baseless 15% “admin charge”; (b) wrongful inclusion of works disclosed in 17 of 49 variation works invoices/forms that had already been completed; and (c) excessive rates and man-hours spent in its variation works invoices.

At trial, both of Vim’s witnesses, Arun Meyyappan (“Mr Arun”) and Muruganandham Mathi Selvan (“Mr Anand”), admitted that Vim did not receive written instructions for the alleged variation works:

Deluge claimed that it subsequently incurred costs of $7,200 in completing the outstanding main works and a further $105,300 in attending to works during the DLP after Vim had left the site. These costs, totalling $112,500, exceeded the outstanding Subcontract sum of $7,462.26 by $105,037.74. Thus, Deluge asserted a counterclaim of $105,037.74 for rectification works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On the other hand, Vim contended that it was not liable for any rectification works because Deluge, having ordered Vim to leave the worksite, was responsible for its own losses.

Given that the remaining balance of uncompleted main works valued at $7,462.26 was not disputed, the Judge allowed Deluge’s counterclaim and set-off in the sum of 7,200 – $7,462.26 + $105,300 = $105,037.74.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Counterclaim 2: back-charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In relation to Deluge’s counterclaim for <span class="font-weight-bold">back-charges</span>, Deluge sought $870,507.09 and Vim contested liability.

</div>
</div> The allegations that Deluge had caused its own delays by delaying its supply of materials were also rejected because Vim had placed orders for materials on short notice and so the delays were its own doing (at [78] and [85] of the GD). Vim had its own project supervisor, Mr Manikandan, and could not therefore blame Deluge’s Mr Tamil for not supervising workers. Even if such defects or delays were minor, Deluge’s contractual right to levy back-charges did not depend on the delays and defects being major or minor (at [86] of the GD).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the documentation that Vim objected to was supported by the testimony of its witnesses, such as Mr Tamil and Mr Sundar. Further, they were in the nature of business records for which s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(iv) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) makes an exception to the hearsay rule. The hearsay rule was not contravened in so far as Deluge’s reliance on documents issued by Samsung and SER was not for the truth of the contents but the fact that the documents were issued (at [89] of the GD). In any event, the admission of the toolbox records into evidence was not objected to at trial (at [90] of the GD).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As to the quantum of back-charges put forward by Deluge, the Judge found that Deluge had substantiated its claims save for the 15% admin charge that Deluge added to the back-charge invoices (at [100] of the GD). Deluge did not explain why the 15% admin charge should be allowed for “supervision and/or overhead” as nothing extra was claimed by Deluge for completing Vim’s works. Thus, the Judge allowed Deluge’s claim for back-charges in the sum of $116,722.93 (initial back-charges) + $870,507.09 (further back-charges) - 128,625.66 (15% admin fee) = <span class="font-weight-bold">$858,604.36</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Setting-off the claims against the counterclaims, the Judge held that Vim was liable for a net sum of $105,037.74 + $858,604.36 – $453,912.94 = <span class="font-weight-bold">$509,729.16</span>. The Judge later explained in his GD, that he had adjusted that figure given in his earlier oral judgment because in preparing his GD, he discovered that in determining Deluge’s claims for 15% “admin” charges based on its back-charge invoices No. 5, 8 to 15, he found that invoices No. 8 and 10 had themselves included certain amounts as “admin fee”;  he therefore reduced Deluge’s claim to $509,377.26<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>(at [114] of the GD).

As set out in Stephen Furst and Sir Vivian Ramsey, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Keating</span>”) at para 4-043:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A contractor frequently carries out, or is asked to carry out, work for which it considers it is entitled to payment in excess of the original contract sum. To recover such payment it must be shown that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) it is extra work not included in the work for which the contract sum is payable;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) there is an express or implied promise to pay for the work;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) any agent who ordered the work was authorised to do so; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) any condition precedent to payment imposed by the contract has been fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Variation works were expressly provided for in the Quotation, which states that “…any additions/alterations to the works specified in this quotation, consider as variation” (see [11] above). It is not disputed that cl 16 contains an implied promise on Deluge’s part to pay Vim for extra work, that is, variation work. But Deluge argues that it never requested Vim for such work to be carried out since cl 16 of the Subcontract stipulates that variation works “shall be carried out <span class="font-italic">only </span>with written instruction[s] from [Deluge’s] Project Manager” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On appeal, Vim argues that those same words “shall be carried out <span class="font-italic">only </span>with written instructions” must be regarded not as a condition precedent but rather as a procedural provision. In this regard, Vim relies on the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Co</span><span class="font-italic">mfort Management v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 979<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>”) at [89] that “it is not invariably the case that the absence of writing, or more generally, the failure to follow the prescribed procedure, will disentitle the party who has performed the variation works from claiming payment for those works”. In response, Deluge contends that cl 16 should be construed strictly, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Mansource Interior Pte Ltd v CSG Group Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 5 SLR 203 (“<span class="font-italic">Mansource</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In our judgment, cl 16 is not drafted in a stringent manner requiring strict compliance failing which a variation claim will fail. For example, a clause may expressly state that a written authorisation of work done or written confirmation of an oral order is a condition precedent for any right to additional payment or it may specify a time within which the contractor is to inform the architect or owner in writing that it considers the instruction or direction or request to do certain work, as a variation with time and cost consequences: see Nicholas Dennys and Robert Clay, <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2015)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Hudson’s</span>”) at paras 5-040 and 5-044. Similarly <span class="font-italic">Keating </span>at para 4-072 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A frequent requirement is that there must be a written order signed by the architect and that <span class="font-italic">no extras will be paid for unless so ordered</span>. In such a contract a proper written order is a condition precedent to payment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the risk allocation exercise inherent in any engineering and construction contract, this approach is justified on the ground that employers and architects “… may legitimately require an opportunity to reconsider and possibly withdraw an instruction or mitigate its effect by giving a still further or different instruction if the first is found to provoke a claim to additional payment or too costly a variation, see <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s </span>at paras 3-074 and 5-040.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The kind of stringent language is missing from cl 16. Clause 16 does not state that if there are no written instructions for variations from Deluge’s project manager, Vim will forfeit the right to any payment or is otherwise barred from claiming payment for work that it considered a variation. In <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s</span>, the learned authors opine at para 5-047:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A clause as to orders in writing may be so worded that such orders will in any event not be a condition precedent to the Contractor’s right to payment. For example, where a clause provides that the Contractor shall execute such alterations as the Architect may direct in writing, <span class="font-italic">but does not expressly exclude any claim for work not so ordered.</span> In such a case there is clearly nothing to prevent the Employer being liable under general law on a separate contract express or implied. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Such a separate contract can be inferred from circumstances which show that the Employer requested or knew of a variation which was for their benefit, which the builder had been asked to carry out, and which the Employer must as a reasonable person have realised would involve extra expense.    </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The standard authoritative texts on construction law, like <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s </span>(at para 5-044), also recognise that in spite of cases which uphold provisions stipulating variation orders in writing as a condition precedent to the right of payment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the anxiety of the courts to avoid injustice to contractors caused by strict wording requiring an order in writing has led them to rationalise reasons enabling Contractors to recover without such an order in a number of different ways. Thus, apart from wherever possible interpreting such requirements as merely administrative and not a condition precedent, they have achieved this result by “implied contract” or “unjust enrichment” reasoning; by giving a wide interpretation to the Arbitrator’s power of review; by treating a particular variation agreed to by the Employer as outside the scope of the contract or <span class="font-italic">by finding that there was a waiver of the required formalities</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Similarly <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> at paras 4-074, 4-075, and 4-076 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4-075 The courts have held that there are certain exceptions to the rule that a contractor could not recover without a written order or other formality which is a condition precedent to payment …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4-076<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Implied promise to pay.</span>   When there is a condition in the contract that extras shall not be paid for unless ordered in writing by the architect and the employer orders work which they know, or are told, will cause extra costs there may be an implied promise by the employer that the work should be paid for as an extra and especially so in cases where any other inference from the facts would be to attribute dishonesty to the employer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4-077 Such a promise to pay may be implied <span class="font-italic">where there has been a waiver of the condition</span>. In order to constitute a waiver, there must be conduct which leads the other party reasonably to believe that the strict legal rights will not be insisted on. Thus, in principle, a written waiver by the employer would be effective, and even an oral waiver would be sufficient if it were a clear undertaking not to rely on the condition.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Every contract has to be construed on its particular terms and where necessary within the context in which it was entered into (see [2] above). In the present case,  we do not, with respect, agree with the Judge that cl 16 is meant to “avoid…this kind of dispute” (GD at [51]), by serving as an absolute bar to a right to claim for payment of the variation. As noted above, cl 16 does not contain any words to this effect. Unlike some standard form contracts, there are also no provisions in this Subcontract Vim to give written confirmation of verbal instructions given by Deluge’s project manager for variation works. If Vim is able to make out a case on the facts that Deluge’s project manager <span class="font-italic">did</span> verbally ask or otherwise requested or required Vim to carry out “variation” or “additional” works, then such works are perfectly capable of constituting “additional” works outside the Subcontract or requested under an implied promise to pay for such additional work.  We note Deluge has run a defence against Vim’s claims for variation only on the threshold point that there was no written instruction from its project manager. Deluge has not run a case that, for example, it had suffered damage because Vim had failed to comply with the strictures set out in cl 16.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span>, the plaintiff was the subcontractor to the main contractor for interior fitting out works to a section of the project and the defendant was a sub-subcontractor to the plaintiff for the wall finishes and joinery works under two sub-contracts. Each of these sub-contracts between the plaintiff and defendant expressly provided that the sub-contracts were back-to-back with the main contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. The court there held that as a consequence, the defendant was precluded from advancing a variation claim under either sub-contract unless the main contractor authorised and approved the variations. It is evident that the relevant clause, cl 17, (see <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span> at [7]), is quite specific and quite different from cl 16 in the appeal before us: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Sub-Contract shall be on a back-to-back basis to the contract between [the plaintiff] and [the main contractor] and there shall be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no claim whatsoever unless</span> it is a variation work <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">authorised and approved</span><span class="font-italic"> by [the main contractor] </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold italics added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is important to note that although the court in <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span> held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the defendant was unable to claim for variations, despite the plaintiff’s representative, Ms Lee, confirming at trial that instructions on variations were generally given verbally and that works under a particular variation order were in fact carried out, the court stated at [101] and [104] that the defendant had not pleaded an alternative basis for its counterclaim for variations on the basis of <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> in the law of unjust enrichment. The court in <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span> also stated there was no attempt by the defendant to make good its submissions on the basis of a waiver. This case is therefore of limited assistance to Deluge, as it accepts that despite the stringent drafting, there may still be a claim on alternative bases, except that they had not been pleaded.  <span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Waiver</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 We now turn to address the issue of waiver. We first note that Deluge had accepted in its submissions, correctly in our view, that the contractual stipulation of written notice may be departed from to permit a claim for variation work where there is sufficient proof of waiver or estoppel.

</div> The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>explained at [89]–[90]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89     … We recognise that standard form construction contracts, which may be said to reflect industry practice, generally require variations in the contract to provide for a change in the scope of construction work contemplated to be effected in writing. However, it is not invariably the case that the absence of writing, or more generally, the failure to follow the prescribed procedure, will disentitle the party who has performed the variation works from claiming payment for those works. Thus it is said in Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts</span>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2012) at para 5.25:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The effect of contractual provisions such as those cited here is that, except for situations which have been specifically exempted, a written variation order serves as a condition precedent for payment of the variation work. If a contractor ignores the requirement for a written variation order, as a general principle, he cannot be found to complain subsequently if he is not paid for the varied work, nor can he contend that he should be paid a reasonable sum for the work merely on the premise that the employer had the benefit of the variation work. However, in a suitable situation, the employer may be estopped by his conduct from denying liability to pay notwithstanding the non-compliance with the formalities stipulated in the contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90     This passage suggests that the absence of documents that demonstrate formal compliance with the contractually prescribed procedure for variation works is not necessarily fatal to a claim for variation works. That gives the impression that such absence does not inexorably translate into a patent error in the payment claim. All it means is that the contractor bears the risk of proving that the variation was ordered by the employer in the absence of a written variation order. This observation finds support in the position in English law on this issue, which is that a term of a contract which states that the contract can only be varied in writing will not prevent there being an oral variation; instead, the effect of such a term is at best to raise a rebuttable presumption that, in the absence of writing, there has been no variation: Sean Wilken QC &amp; Karim Ghaly, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Waiver, Variation, and Estoppel</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2012) at p 26 fn 131, citing the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">I-Way Ltd v World Online Telecom UK Ltd</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 413 (see [11]–[12] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sedley LJ and [17] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Schiemann LJ); see also the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">MWB Business Exchange Centres </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 553 at [34] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Kitchin LJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The most recent iteration of Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts</span>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2021) at para 5.029 similarly affirms that the law permits the application of principles of waiver or estoppel in meritorious cases despite non-compliance with requirements of written notice: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.029</span> Under the SIA 2016 a variation may be ordered by way of a direction or instruction issued pursuant to clause 1(1)(b) or 1(1)(c) of the Conditions.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,239,1)"> </span>The debate in practice with the SIA provisions on variations frequently revolves around whether a variation order should be characterised as an instruction or a direction because an instruction is considered in principle to entitle the contractor to additional payment or compensation while this is not the case with a direction.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,239,1)"> </span>Clause 1(2)(b) provides for all directions and instructions to be given in writing and verbal directions or instructions given by the architect are required to be confirmed in writing. In the absence of such confirmation, the contractor is not entitled to be compensated for an expense incurred with the compliance of the relevant direction or instruction.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,239,1)"> </span>The effect of contractual provisions such as those cited here is that, except for situations which have been specifically exempted, a written variation order (or in the case of the SIA Form, a verbal instruction or direction which the architect has not expressly denied) serves as a condition precedent for payment of the variation work. If a contractor ignores the requirement for a written variation order, as a general principle, it cannot be found to complain subsequently if it is not paid for the varied work, nor can the contractor subsequently contend that it should be paid a reasonable sum for the work notwithstanding that the employer had the benefit of the variation work. However, in a suitable situation the employer may be estopped by its conduct from denying liability to pay notwithstanding the non-compliance with the formalities stipulated in the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This proposition is similarly elucidated in <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s </span>at para 5-024:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As has been seen, the general rule is that a Contractor who has been requested to do work which is in fact a variation will be able to recover payment for it if the Employer has expressly or impliedly requested the work knowing it to be such. The Contractor, therefore, is unlikely to be in a difficulty in advancing a variation claim unless either:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  the Employer does not know of and so has not authorised the variation; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the contract has been so worded as to deny legal effect to any request or authorisation by or on behalf of the Employer or Contract Administrator acting for the Employer which is relied on by the Contractor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Additionally the courts have not been slow to apply principles of waiver or estoppel, implied promise or unjust enrichment, so as to prevent an Employer in appropriate circumstances from setting up a defence of non-compliance with contractual requirements of form for varied work.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Broadly speaking, therefore, it will only be in cases where the Employer in the sense defined above does not know of and has not authorised a variation, or where the person who has authorised it is some official or representative of the Employer whose authority has been expressly denied by the contract, that it will then become necessary, at least in so far as the question of liability to pay an additional price is concerned, for contractors to bring themselves within the terms of a contractual variation clause. So far as valuation under the terms of that clause is concerned, however, if that is desired, both Contractor and Employer will usually have to show compliance with any formal requirements of the contract, except in cases of waiver or estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Such an approach comports with an additional commercial reality that intermediate contractors and sub-contractors in large-scale building projects are engaged in complex and overlapping scopes of work set out in “back-to-back” contracts. In the present case, cl 16 stipulates that variation work claims shall be on a “back-to-back” basis. As noted by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation Pte Ltd v Deluge Fire Protection (SEA) Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 918 (“<span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span>”) at [35] and [45]–[50], a “back-to-back” provision, while not uncommon in many sub-contracts in the construction industry, is not a term of art and must be construed in the light of the factual matrix known to the parties at the time they contracted and the contract as a whole. More importantly, the effect of such a provision is to enable an intermediate contractor “who has undertaken certain obligations under a head contract … [to] pass on those obligations to a sub-contractor” and thereby avoid exposure under either contract (<span class="font-italic">GIB Automation </span>at [45]). But as the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span> at [50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 Just what is incorporated will depend in each case upon such things (among others) as what was objectively known to the parties at the time they entered into the contract, what specific references were made to the main contract document, and whether the terms of the main contract relevant to the back-to-back provision were of such a nature that they should have been and were specifically brought home to the sub-contractor or whether they were sufficiently general that they would fall within the general appreciation and knowledge of the parties. By way of example, it may be generally known to a sub-contractor that the main contractor would in due course make an application for payment to the employer in respect of works done by the sub-contractor. <span class="font-italic">On the other hand, it may not be generally known to the sub-contractor that requests have to be in a very particular format.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Clause 16 of the Subcontract provides that any variation works, (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, additions, omissions or modifications), shall be on a back-to-back basis with Deluge’s subcontract with Samsung but it goes on to provide that “[s]uch variation” shall be carried out “…only with the written instruction from [Deluge’s] Project Manager…”. Deluge thus reserves to itself control over sanctioning of variations and Vim has to base its claims on the unit rates in accordance with the Schedule of Rates in the sub-subcontract with Deluge; where the unit rates are not so contained in the Schedule of rates in the sub-subcontract, then the amount shall be such sum as “...in all circumstances be reasonable and agreed between the parties”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Deluge’s approach that variation claims would be subject to Samsung’s approval of such claims as forwarded to Samsung by Deluge is problematic on two levels. First because this is not provided for in the Subcontract and secondly, the main contract between Samsung and Deluge was not in evidence and Vim was not privy to any of Samsung’s criteria for the approval of variation work claims. Even if Samsung had approved the variation work claims, nothing would have prevented Deluge from pretextually denying Vim for the same. It is therefore clear that Deluge “would have been obliged to make such applications in good faith and in a timely manner”: <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation </span>at [54]. More importantly, although Mr Tamil and Mr Sundar repeatedly stated in writing that Vim’s claims for variation works would be subject to Samsung’s approval, it is not evident that Deluge ever conveyed to Vim whether Samsung had approved the variation work claims that Deluge had purportedly submitted on Vim’s behalf. As the appellant points out, it is telling that Deluge does not in these proceedings rely on the “back-to-back” mechanism to argue that its approval of the variation works claims were subject to Samsung’s approval and that Samsung had not approved those claims. This is relevant to the question of the clarity of the acknowledgment where Vim’s argument of waiver by election is concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The requirements for waiver by election are settled. When a party unequivocally chooses not to exercise one of two inconsistent rights, and he is aware of the circumstances giving rise to the existence of that right, he would be deemed as having elected to waive that right. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction v Kian Hiap Construction </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317 at [54]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54     As Lord Goff of Chieveley observed in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Motor Oil Hellas (Corinth) Refineries SA v Shipping Corporation of India (The </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">“Kanchenjunga”)</span> [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 391 (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Kanchenjunga</span>”) at 397 col 2, “the expression ‘waiver’ is one which may, in law, bear different meanings” and “[i]n particular, it may refer to a forbearance from exercising a right or to an abandonment of a right”. In the true sense of the word, however, waiver means a voluntary or intentional relinquishment of a known right, claim or privilege: Sean Wilken QC and Karim Ghaly, <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Wilken and Ghaly: The Law of Waiver, Variation, and Estoppel</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Wilken and Ghaly</span>”) at para 3.14. On this definition, the only form of waiver that befits that label is waiver by election. This doctrine concerns a situation where a party has a choice between two inconsistent rights. If he elects not to exercise one of those rights, he will be held to have abandoned that right if he has communicated his election in clear and unequivocal terms to the other party. He must also be aware of the facts which have given rise to the existence of the right he is said to have elected not to exercise. Once the election is made, it is final and binding, and the party is treated as having waived that right by his election: see <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Kanchenjunga</span> at 397–398, which was approved by this court in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chai Cher Watt v SDL Technologies Pte Ltd</span> [2012] 1 SLR 152 at [33].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Quite aside from the fact that Deluge’s representatives Mr Tamil and Mr Sundar signed 32 of the 34 variation work claims, what was of particular significance was the fact that, Deluge’s employees made written comments on 24 of the 32 signed forms stating that the claims would be subject to Samsung’s approval. Against the backdrop of the operating “back-to-back” mechanism as noted above, this was a clear acknowledgment that Deluge was not disallowing the claims on the basis of not having given written instruction under cl 16 of the Subcontract to carry out such work. Subsequently, even when the claims passed into the domain of Deluge’s administrators, there was no evidence that the administrators rejected the variation work claims on the basis of the requirement of written notice nor did they appear to regard Mr Tamil and Mr Sundar to be in error for receiving and accepting the same invoices and forms. In fact, for variation work claims UIC/DE/007, UIC/DE/008 and UIC/DE/009, the handwritten comments directed Vim to “clarify” or “discuss with [the] contract department”. Thereafter, from form UIC/DE/012 onwards, the comments were ostensibly made with greater confidence as they stated that the claims would be subject to Samsung’s approval. If any inference is to be drawn, it would be that on balance, Mr Sundar and Mr Tamil had sought such clarification and understood that such invoices/forms would be subject to Samsung’s approval. Deluge’s administrators must be taken to have known of the notice requirement in cl 16 and their silence amidst the passage of time indicates to us that there had been a voluntary relinquishment of this right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In our judgment, it was irreconcilable for Deluge’s representatives to sign the variation work claims <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">include </span>written<span class="font-italic"> comments</span> <span class="font-italic">that these would be subject to Samsung’s approval</span>, and then for them to subsequently insist that the work ought to have been carried out only under written instructions from Deluge pursuant to cl 16 of the Subcontract. This is not to say that these acknowledgments, on their own, amounted to an acknowledgment that Vim would be paid for these works (given that this was subject to Samsung’s approval). But we are amply satisfied that Deluge, by the totality of circumstances, had – in at least 24 of Vim’s variation works claims – by election waived the requirement of written notice and could not now demand its strict adherence. As for Samsung’s approval, Deluge did not at trial contend that Samsung had denied Vim’s variation work claims. It is not open to Deluge to mount this argument now. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Authority of Mr Sundar and Mr Tamil</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the present appeal, Vim argues that Deluge had not pleaded a want of authority on the part of either Mr Sundar or Mr Tamil, and that accordingly, the Judge’s finding that Mr Sundar and Mr Tamil did not have any authority to waive the written instruction requirement (at [36] of the GD), was unsustainable.

</div> In reply, Deluge does not deny that the issue of whether Mr Sundar or Mr Tamil had the authority to waive the written instruction requirement was not pleaded, only that this was an issue which had been raised at trial. In any case, the contention that neither Mr Sundar nor Mr Tamil had the authority of waiver was in line with the position Deluge had taken, that Vim had proceeded to carry out variation works without written instruction.

Although this general rule may be departed from in the limited circumstance where no prejudice would be caused to the other party or where it would be clearly unjust not to do so (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span> at [40]), this is clearly not the case in the present. The Judge’s reasons appear to be the salutary objectives of a provision like cl 16 and appears to have been reasoned on the basis that a contract administrator has no usual authority to vary a contract beyond his authority as stipulated for in the contract itself, (see [37] and [38] of the GD), for which no authorities were cited.

</div> Vim repeated the essential allegation of acceptance of those works in para 11, and states at para 14: “…Deluge are now estopped from denying the validity and quantum of the claim herein, since the same was never refuted by Deluge at any time with any cogent or supporting evidence.” With these allegations raised in the Statement of Claim, if Deluge wanted to take the point that Mr Sundar and Mr Tamil did not have the authority to waive compliance with the written instructions requirement in cl 16, then, it was incumbent on them to plead the same. Deluge did not do so. It is clear that Deluge chose to defend Vim’s claims for variations only on the ground that the variations were not approved in writing as required by cl 16.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is not in dispute that Mr Sundar was Deluge’s Project Manager and Mr Tamil was its site engineer. Significantly therefore, Mr Sundar was the Project Manager with the authority to issue written instructions under cl 16. As he had signed on the hard copies of Vim’s variation claims and later wrote comments as those set out in [53] below, Deluge is in no position to now contend that Vim’s claims were invalid because they were not pursuant to written instructions under his hand. Mr Sundar was the one person who should have, but did not, reject Vim’s variation claims at the material time as not being carried out pursuant to his written instructions. Neither did he protest or reserve Deluge’s position in accepting them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Moreover, Mr Sundar and Mr Tamil signed on Vim’s printed forms which had the words “VARIATION WORK” on a bold strip across the top of the form, just under Vim’s name, address, contact details, UEN number, and its logo and on some of the accompanying sheets of photographs or drawings, there were the printed words “ABORTIVE WORK” or sometimes in manuscript “ADDITIONAL” Work. There was no mistaking what they were signing. Mr Sundar’s actions were cogent evidence of waiver of the requirement in cl 16. Mr Sundar testified that Mr Tamil’s signatures on the variation work forms were as good as his signature.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As for context, and as referenced in [2] above, Deluge was under pressure for being behind schedule and it engaged Vim, a sanitary and plumbing contractor (and who Deluge had previously used for part of its work, viz, the specific installation and testing of pipes from the 20th storey upwards) to help carry out <span class="font-italic">only a specified </span><span class="font-italic">part</span> of their work. Mr Pradhan is correct to characterise this as a subset of Deluge’s work. This is evident from the detailed work items set out in the Quotation. They were quite specific. Given this context of the kind of work Deluge and Vim were to carry out, Mr Sundar’s and Mr Tamil’s authority at the site here, as Project Manager and Site Engineer, was certainly a far cry from, for example, an unsigned sketch made by an architect’s assistant which was argued unsuccessfully to be a “direction” by the architect’s hand in writing, (see <span class="font-italic">Myers v Sarl </span>[1860] 3 E. &amp; E. 306). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 An examination of the evidence shows that in 32 of the 34 variation claims, (UIC/DE/001 to UIC/DE/036), submitted over a period of time, Mr Sundar or Mr Tamil had signed the same (UIC/DE/027 and UIC/DE/036 were not signed), and on 24 of these 32 variation claims, Mr Sundar or Mr Tamil had a handwritten comment to the effect that the variation claims would be submitted to Samsung and either “wait for [Samsung] respond” or “upon approval respond to Vim.” In our judgment, this was a clear waiver of the written instruction requirement in cl 16. For the purposes of this appeal, we therefore find that Mr Sundar and Mr Tamil had waived the requirement of written instructions for variation claims, which waiver was binding on Deluge; Deluge was, for the reasons set out above, not entitled to raise a lack of authority of Mr Sundar or Mr Tamil to waive this requirement as it had not pleaded the same. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Scope and quantum of Vim’s variation works claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the decision below, the Judge found it unnecessary to find which of Vim’s variation claims concerned true “variations” outside the original scope of works, since the reason for the written notice requirement under cl 16 was to obviate this sort of dispute and Vim’s witnesses Mr Arun and Mr Anand were not well placed to testify as to oral instructions given for such works to be carried out (at [51]–[52] of the GD). As to quantum, the Judge found that Vim failed to give credit for a stipulated 10% discount and had, outside the bounds of the agreement, imposed a 15% admin charge (at [60] of the GD) and that the reference to rates listed in an email by Ms Ngu dated 31 May 2017 was not an agreed schedule of rates and were purely for reference only (at [61] of the GD).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In this appeal, Vim takes issue with both the Judge’s findings on the scope and quantum:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On the issue of scope, Vim refers to the Quotation, which it says is the authoritative guidance on the original scope of works.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On the issue of quantum, Vim accepts the Judge’s observations as regards the 10% discount and the 15% admin charge, but nevertheless submits that the “Star Rate” applied by Vim to its variation work claims was the rate that had been provided by Deluge in a sample form which Deluge’s contracts department had forwarded to Vim to permit Vim a second opportunity to “substantiate” its manpower claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The scope of the 24 variation works claims (see [53] above), as well as the quantum of each claim as asserted by the appellant and the respondent, are set out in the table below:

</div> for the design, supply and installation, engineering, project management and testing and commissioning of plumbing, sanitary and gas works, for the entirety of the redevelopment project, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, both the office building and residential tower. As referenced above, because of Samsung’s complaint on 23 February 2016, that Deluge had a “severe schedule delay” in carrying out its work, Deluge engaged Vim, sometime in March or April 2016 to help it carry out <span class="font-italic">some</span> of its work, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a limited scope of its work; this was the installation and testing of sanitary pipes of the residential tower from the 20th floor upwards. To address the delays, Deluge entered into negotiations with Vim for a sub-subcontract. This resulted in Purchase Order (No. P020017880) of 8 April 2016 (the “PO 17880”), a Tender Clarifications dated 25 July 2016, Vim’s Quotation (VIM/QU/1408/Rev 3) dated 30 July 2016, and the Subcontract dated 3 August 2016. There is no explanation whether the PO 17880, which clearly specified works on a per unit basis, at a cost of $2,550, (and with a much earlier date compared to the other Subcontract documents), belonged to the earlier limited scope of work carried out by Vim or the Subcontract in question because the cost and scope of work in PO 17880 differs somewhat from those set out in the Quotation. We also note that Vim’s first quotation is dated 11 March 2016,

Nonetheless, Vim’s scope of works was clearly only part of Deluge’s scope of work <span class="font-italic">vis-</span><span class="font-italic">à-vis</span> Samsung. It cannot be disputed, for example, that Vim did not undertake any design work, or any work in relation to the gas work in Deluge’s subcontract with Samsung.  This is a very relevant when one considers the validity or otherwise of the Variation Works, the Rectification Works and the back charges.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The scope of main works is set out in the Subcontract, the Tender Clarifications and the Quotation. As referenced above, clause 1 of the Subcontract provides that, if there was a discrepancy in the terms and conditions of the documentation, the Subcontract would take precedence, followed by the Purchase Order, the Tender Clarifications and the Quotation. Clause 4 of the Subcontract specifies that the main works include the work tabulated in the Quotation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4 SCOPE OF WORKS</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Sub-Subcontractor’s scope of work shall include, but not be limited to:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.1 Provide construction management, site supervision and safety supervision</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">4.2 Scope of works as tabulated in the quotation</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.3 Provide air testing and pressure testing</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.4 Assist in testing and commissioning</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5 SUPPLEMENTARY WORKS</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Sub-Subcontractor shall also provide the following supplementary works as part of this Contract:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.1 Marking of pipe sleeves</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.2 Installation of pipe sleeves</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.3  Loading and unloading of all materials and equipment at site</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.4 Site co-ordination</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.5 Housekeeping and clearing of waste and debris daily</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.6 Insurance and workmen compensation for all site personnel</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.7 Attendance to daily meetings</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.8 Attendance to safety meetings / tool box meetings</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.9 Attendance to all tests and inspections</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.10 To provide markings on the drawings for works installed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Quotation tabulates with particularity how the $1.75m fee would be split among 20 enumerated heads of the main Subcontract works. This tabulation could, on one view, be seen as a strong limiting factor as to what constitutes “main Subcontract works”, given that the table in the Quotation particularises how the agreed fee of $1.75m would be divided among all the works that Vim promised to undertake. We note that Deluge strenuously disputes this. Deluge contends that the broad language of cll 4 and 5 of the Subcontract provide that the Main Subcontract Works include but are not limited to the works enumerated in the Quotation. The Quotation also provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Contract terms:-</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1) Defect liability 12 months from TOP.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">2) If any additions/alterations to the works specified in this quotation, consider as variation.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3) Scaffolding, lifting equipments &amp; working platform by client (above 4m only).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4) Authority submission, Machineries &amp; Materials by client.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5) We are not liable, which occurred progress related late charges prior VIM take over.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6) Any contract termination required 30 days[’] notice period with valid reason &amp; all outstanding payment need to be clear with in notice period.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Tender Clarifications provide at item 17 that “[a]ny additional or omission work not stated in the contract is consider[ed] as Variation Order subject for evaluation and claim”. We reject Deluge’s case that cll 4 and 5 of the Subcontract means that the Main Subcontract Works are not limited to the works enumerated in the Quotation. This extravagant construction of Vim’s scope of works goes against the plain meaning of the general words used in cll 4 and 5 and defies the context of the Subcontract. For example, cl 4.1 cannot mean that Vim is to provide construction management, site supervision and safety supervision for the entirety of Deluge’s work given the differences in the scope of works between the two subcontracts pointed out above. Neither does cl 4.4, which provides for “Assist in testing and commissioning” mean that Vim has to assist in the testing and commissioning of Deluge’s work that is not within Vim’s scope of works, for example, testing and commissioning of gas works. These provisions can be read harmoniously, the obligations under cll 4 and 5 only relate to associated or related work in relation to Vim’s scope of work. Deluge cannot construe these clauses in such a way as to create a conflict when there is no discrepancy in the terms and conditions to start with. Indeed, this is quite clear from cl 4.2 which states that the “Scope of works as tabulated in the quotation” and the use of the word “supplementary” in cl 5. The nature of the items under cl 5 was agreed supplementary works, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, associated or auxiliary work connected to the main Subcontract work, for example<span class="font-italic">,</span> the installation and marking of pipe sleeves, loading and unloading of all Vim’s materials and equipment on site and its site co-ordination work. These are often spelt out in specifications in the more comprehensive construction contracts, which are not found in this Subcontract, hence the need to specifically set them out in cll 4 and 5. This includes making clear that Vim was to have its own insurance and workmen’s compensation for all their site personnel at cl 5.6. Vim was also not entitled to charge, for example, for its time in attending site meetings or safety meetings as these were supplementary to its scope of Subcontract works. However, its supplementary daily housekeeping and clearing of debris, (which necessarily includes disposal), can only relate to Vim’s work and not the entirety of Deluge’s work.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Quotation, as referenced above, sets out with great particularity the works Vim had agreed with Deluge to carry out. For example, in serial number 1 of the Quotation, it states that for levels 9 to 20, “Supply manpower and Hand tools for Installation, Commissioning and Testing only. Unit Type: 1 Toilet + 1 Kitchen.” The three sub-items are “Copper pipe corridor &amp; DMC”, “Floor trap insulation” and “Sanitary wares Installation only”; for which the quantity (“Qty”) was 84, the rate was $990.00 and the amount was $83,160.00. The descriptions of Vim’s variation claims (see Table at [56] above) have not been shown to fall within that scope. The descriptions in many documents were for the making good of damage caused by others (“… damaged by [Samsung] archi team...”) or carrying our changes like “… Washing Machine outlet pipe relocation Twr RB-L52 Unit PH1&amp;2 instructed by [Samsung]” (UIC/DE023), which would be beyond the scope of the main Subcontract Works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In our judgment, Deluge’s own conduct suggests that it did not consider this work to be part of the main works. We reiterate the point made earlier at [44] and [53] above that Mr Sundar and Mr Tamil had both signed the forms and further made written comments that such claims would be subject to Samsung’s approval. This is a compelling indication that Deluge did not regard these works to be part of the main works. If they had in fact regarded such works to be part of the main works, then one would have expected Mr Tamil, Mr Sundar or the contracts administration team to reject the claims summarily on this basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Additionally, on the face of the documentation, it is not evident to us that the description of the works at [56] above can be shoehorned into any of the heads of main works set out in cll 4 and 5 of the Subcontract or the Quotation. The exception perhaps, on the face of the document, might be UIC/DE/012

We note that Deluge has not put forth any sufficient elaboration for its case.

</div> As Mr Arun explained in cross-examination, Vim relied on Deluge’s sample form for Vim’s subsequent submission and re-submission of its variation work claims. In particular, Vim relied on the specific “star rates” mentioned in Deluge’s sample invoice which, according to Mr Arun, was $20/hr for supervising manpower and $18/hr for general manpower.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Before us, Mr Pradhan acknowledged that Vim did not have evidence to show that the star rates in the variation work claims were rates that had actually and already been paid or were not in dispute. Nevertheless, in our view, Deluge did not and has not put forward an explanation as to what those “star rates” were or ought to be, despite the fact that this was an expression utilised in its own sample form. At any rate, we emphasise that Mr Tamil and Mr Sundar acknowledged the forms in such a way as to indicate to a reasonable observer that the claims were forwarded to Samsung for approval. This again suggests to us that Deluge did not, in principle, object to the “star rates”. Nor could they object, since these rates originated from the documentation which they had sent to Vim to follow. Indeed, if Deluge had further complaints as to the rates set out in the variation work claims, it had every opportunity to raise them but did not do so. We now proceed to consider each of the variation work orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">UIC/DE/005</span>: $54,528.00. This work on sanitary and water pipes at Tower A Level 9 to 20 was clearly intended to rectify damage caused by Samsung’s other contractors, namely the architecture team. Mr Tamil wrote “please take note that we had submitted to [Samsung] waiting for [a] reply”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">UIC/DE 006</span>: $45,720.00. This work on sanitary and water pipes at Tower B Level 9 to 20 was a result of Deluge’s incorrect installation, and Mr Tamil wrote that “those attached photos only able to accept” and Vim provided photos for works on Levels 9, 14–20. Accordingly, Deluge must have accepted these works to these levels at the very least.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">UIC/DE/012</span>: $37,242.00. This was housekeeping work – “clean up debris from other contractors” - done at Samsung’s request and Deluge’s instruction at Tower A from Levels 25 to 33. Mr Tamil wrote on the form that “based on your submission we will submit to [Samsung] upon [Samsung’s] confirmation will move forward if cost confirmation by contract department”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-underline">UIC/DE/013</span>: $6,900.00. This housekeeping work – “Housekeeping Twr RAB NEA stop work order for other contractor” - was completed at Samsung’s request and Deluge’s instruction. Mr Tamil wrote “we will submit to [Samsung] accordingly based on the [Samsung] respond [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] will move forward”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-underline">UIC/DE/014</span>: $492.00. This work was for the rectification or reparation of sanitary pipes on Tower B Level 52. The damage was caused by Samsung’s “Archi Team (Kobe)”. Photos indicated that pipe damage was occasioned by another contractor dealing with the wall.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) <span class="font-underline">UIC/DE/015</span>: $22,176.00. Vim was tasked to clear choke on floor traps on Tower A and B Levels 9–15. This extra work required the use of a vacuum machine, as Samsung’s “Archi team” had removed the protection on the pipes and had thrown construction debris into the floor trap.

It is clear that Mr Cheo’s evidence, as it stood, was a bare allegation without any of the necessary particulars like what part of Vim’s work was defective, why or how was it defective, how it was rectified or repaired, by whom it was rectified and why Deluge required a full-time supervisor and worker on site for 9 months. This is insufficient on its own to discharge Deluge’s burden of proof. Deluge did not furnish any <span class="font-italic">legible</span> documentary evidence of the man-hours it spent attending to specific defects occasioned by Vim’s work, in stark contrast to Vim’s approach in documenting invoices and forms with respect to the variation work claims. We note Mr Cheo was the managing director of Deluge. The persons who should be able to provide and attest to such necessary evidence in support of this claim were most probably Mr Sundar and/or Mr Tamil. Under cross-examination, Mr Sundar was unable to point to any evidence of defective works.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Insofar as it is implied in Mr Cheo’s evidence set out in his AEIC at para 120, that since Vim walked off the site, Deluge had to pay a supervisor and a worker for 9 months during the DLP to carry out Defects Rectification Works, we not only reject this as evidence supporting such a claim, we also reject this for the following reasons. First, we note that the TOP was obtained on 20 October 2017, DLP commenced on that date, and Vim left the site on 5 February 2018. Secondly, we agree with Vim that it is not common industry practice, especially for a sub-subcontractor like Vim, to maintain a presence by way of a supervisor and worker on site during the DLP to deal with complaints and rectification works. Thirdly, such sub-subcontractors are obliged to return to the site when called by their upstream subcontractor to attend to a complaint of a defect. It is therefore highly questionable, in addition to the foregoing reasons, whether Deluge had incurred the cost of a supervisor and a worker continuously for 9 months to attend to defects during the DLP due to its own obligations to Samsung upstream or whether it was genuinely in relation to defects caused by Vim or within Vim’s Subcontract works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 We also note it was common ground that a <span class="font-italic">small</span> amount of Subcontract works had not been completed by Vim, contractually valued at $7,462.26, Deluge completed this at a slightly lower cost of $7,200 and gave credit for the $262.26 difference to Vim. This claim was therefore allowed by the Judge (see [63] and [64] of the GD). However, with respect, for the foregoing reasons, we cannot agree with the Judge’s finding that based on Mr Cheo’s evidence in his AEIC set out above, he was able to come to the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 Deluge also claimed $105,300 for rectification of defects during the balance of the DLP after Vim left the site. Deluge assigned one supervisor and two workers for that purpose, which I accept as reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 Accordingly for completing Vim’s works, I found that Deluge had a good counterclaim and set-off in the sum of $105,037.74, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-underline"> </span>7,200 - $7,462.26 + $105,300.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 We hold that Deluge has not made out its claim of $105,037.74 for alleged rectification works during DLP. We allow the appeal on this issue and the Judge’s award for this sum is set aside. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the Judge was correct in awarding Deluge $858,604.36 for back-charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 We first set out the list of back-charges claimed from Vim by Deluge.

It was submitted that Deluge did not satisfy either of these requirements:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Deluge failed to: (i) notify Vim to “correct defective or non-conforming Subcontract works” under cl 19.1; (ii) notify Vim of “any work performed or procured by it pursuant to [Clause 19.1]” under cl 19.2; and (iii) provide “written notice … of the redesign, repair, rework or replacement of nonconforming or non-performed Subcontract works” under cl 19.1.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, under cl 6, which had to be read with cl 19 because cl 19 referred to the “Subcontract’s Programme”, (we note the reference to the “Main Contractor and the Subcontractor’s construction schedules in cl 6 of the Subcontract), proof of delay and causation was necessary for Deluge to succeed in claiming back-charges (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, if Vim failed to meet the work schedule <span class="font-italic">and</span> Vim was solely responsible for this failure). </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) As to the delay, Vim argues that it was never behind schedule and there was thus no cause for the imposition of back-charges. The minutes of two site meetings dated 21 December 2016 and 3 February 2017 were an insufficient basis for the Judge to conclude that Vim was in delay because it was not evident that that work was Vim’s work rather than Deluge’s work. Samsung’s schedule provided to Vim in February 2017 was simply a plan and nothing else. Contrary to the Judge’s holding that Vim had placed insufficient manpower onsite, Vim’s email to Deluge dated 13 February 2017 stated that Vim was complying with requirements ahead of Samsung’s schedule and thus did not require Deluge to furnish additional manpower. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) As to causation, even if there had been delays, any purported delays were caused by Deluge or other subcontractors’ and not Vim’s. Deluge had delayed its provision of materials to Vim, while Vim’s email dated 6 April 2017 notified Deluge that some works were delayed because “[s]caffolding not yet ready” and “[w]ater heater not yet ready”; these latter works were said to be outside Vim’s scope of works.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Deluge rejected both submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) With regard to written notice, Deluge pointed out that Vim’s insistence on a strict construction of cl 19 is inconsistent with its request for a broader interpretation as regards cl 16. In any event, Deluge did comply with the notice requirement in cl 19.1. The first “notice” mentioned in cl 19.1 as well as the notification mentioned in cl 19.2 did not specify that such notice be <span class="font-italic">written</span>. The second “notice” mentioned in cl 19.1, that is “written notice”, however, was asserted to be optional rather than mandatory as denoted by the word “may”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) With regard to delay and causation, Deluge argued that the numerous site memoranda considered by the Judge substantiated the conclusion that there had been delays. First, Samsung’s schedule of works dated 12 January 2017 covered only the period from January to May 2017 and did not show that Vim had been timely in performing its works throughout the project. Vim relied on self-serving emails and Vim did not address the site memoranda. Secondly, the Judge had also accepted that Vim had put insufficient manpower onsite; Deluge’s evidence was that based on toolbox meeting records, Vim only placed an average of 27 workers on-site each day, with a peak attendance of 53 workers. Thirdly, as to Vim’s suggestion that Deluge had tarried in providing materials, Deluge’s log of Vim’s material requisitions dated 19 March 2019 showed that Vim had placed orders on extremely short notice and occasionally after the fact. Despite the fact that cl 8 of the Subcontract required Vim to provide its own consumables, Vim placed orders for these on 94 occasions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Written notice under cl 19 of the Subcontract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 We deal first with the issue of written notice under cl 19 of the Subcontract. At the outset, we note that the analysis here is not constrained by our findings at [32] above on cl 16. As the Judge noted at [92] of the GD, clauses 16 and 19 are drafted differently:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">92 Clause 16 and clause 19 are drafted differently. Clause 16 says variation works ‘shall be carried out <span class="font-italic">only</span> with written instructions from [Deluge’s] Project Manager’ [emphasis added]. Clause 19, on the other hand, does not say that Deluge can take action to redress defects and delays in Vim’s works <span class="font-italic">only</span> upon written notice. Clause 19.1 says that ‘[Deluge] may, <span class="font-italic">upon written notice</span>, perform or procure the performance of the redesign, repair, rework or replacement of nonconforming or non-performed Subcontract works by any reasonable means available at the [Vim’s] cost’ [emphasis added] and clause 19.3 states that ‘[Deluge] shall have the right to retain, deduct, withhold or set-off the cost thereof from any payment to be made by [Deluge] to [Vim] or otherwise claim such amount from [Vim]’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The construction of cl 19 depends upon the words used in the clause and must be construed in its proper context. This is an issue of mixed fact and law. As a matter of construction, Mr Pradhan argued that cl 19, when taken as a whole, had to be interpreted as comprising two distinct notifications: (a) under a first notification, Deluge was to notify Vim to correct defective works; and (b) only after Vim indicated that it was unable or unwilling to comply, then Deluge “may, upon written notice, perform or procure the performance …” under a second notification. Neither of these, Mr Pradhan said, had been done. On the other hand, counsel for Deluge, Mr Namazie Mirza Mohamed (“Mr Namazie”), argued that, if anything, cl 19 was less onerous than cl 16 because there was only one notice requirement and that the permissive “may” in the second half of cl 19.1 denoted that the notice requirement did not have to be given by writing; oral notice sufficed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 We do not, with respect, quite agree with either Mr Pradhan or Mr Namazie’s construction of cl 19. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The requirement for notice to be given in relation to defects clauses is a fairly standard procedure adopted in construction contracts where notice is given downstream to the contractor (or in the present case, the subcontractor) thereby giving the contractor an opportunity to cure or remedy the defect. However, while failure to comply with a stipulation to provide notice in a defects clause may preclude an employer from relying on the defects clause as against the contractor (see <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> at para 11-031), in the absence of clear and express words or by a clear and strong implication from the words used, the employer’s right to damages in respect of the cost of repairs is not extinguished (see <span class="font-italic">Pearce and High v Baxter</span> [1999] BLR 101 at 104, cited with approval in  <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1933 v Liang Huat Aluminium Ltd</span> [2001] 2 SLRI 91 at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The requirement of notification is necessary to balance the consequence that any other party who carries out such remedial work, is likely to do so at a greater cost. This is because the contractor is in the best position to carry out such remedial work, if justified, at the lowest cost. There is an element of the upstream party having to take reasonable steps to mitigate its damage. Where no notice is given and such remedial work is carried out, it is open to the subcontractor to argue that it should not be liable for the greater cost of remedial work but only to the lower cost it would have incurred in carrying out such remedial works if due notice had been given. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Thus, where the employer does not provide the contractor with a contractual opportunity to rectify defects during the defect liability period, the employer can still recover the cost of repairing the defects, but the sum that the employer can recover may be limited to how much it would have cost the contractor to rectify the defects. These well-known considerations are set out in <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span><span class="font-italic">’s</span> at para 4-100: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…failure to give notice under the clause or carrying out repairs by another contractor will not prevent a claim for damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">as well as in <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> at para 11-031: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the absence of notice, it would seem that the employer cannot recover more than the amount that it would have cost the contractor to remedy the defects. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Turning to the present case, we first make the observation that cl 19 is worded more permissively in nature than cl 16. The intent of cl 19.1 is also clear:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, if Vim is notified by Deluge, and there are no strictures on what the mode of notification should be: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) to correct defective or non-conforming Subcontract works, or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) perform Subcontract works in accordance with Deluge’s programme; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Vim indicates again there are no strictures on whether this should be in writing or orally, or by its actions, that it is unable or unwilling to proceed with the Subcontract works or corrective action or otherwise fails to take the necessary action within a reasonable time; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Secondly, Deluge may then, upon “written notice”, proceed to perform or procure the re-design, repair, rework or replacement of non-conforming or non-performed Subcontract work by any reasonable means available, and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Thirdly, that will be at Vim’s cost, including, any cost for supervision and overheads.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Under cl 19.1, the first step is for Deluge to notify Vim of the defective or non-conforming Subcontract work. To notify someone means to tell or to let someone know something or to inform or to communicate something to someone. The use of the word “notified”, in the past tense, means that Deluge has to give prior notice of the same and that notice can be in writing or given orally so long as Vim is informed that Deluge considers an item or Subcontract works to be defective or requires rectification or that Vim has not adhered to Deluge’s programme. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 If, after it has been notified of an alleged defect, Vim states in writing or by its actions indicates that it is unwilling to remedy the defects or does not do so within a reasonable time, then Deluge may proceed to the next step, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, give written notice. Two things should be noted. First, the parties have chosen to use different phrases, “is notified” and in contradistinction, “upon written notice”. That must have been for a purpose and the obligations attached to those phrases are not identical. The use of “notified” indicates that there has to be an effective notification, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the notification must be brought to the attention of the subcontractor; what is an effective notification must be measured by what is reasonable on all the relevant facts and circumstances. The use of “upon written notice” means that written notice must be given and served in accordance with the notice provisions of the relevant contract. Secondly, it should be noted that the giving of notice in writing is a contractual obligation, the breach of which may sound in damages. The use of the word “may” in cl 19 does not qualify or attach to the obligation of written notice but to Deluge’s option to perform or secure performance of the remedial work by any reasonable means available and that cost will be recovered from the subcontractor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Clause 19.2 provides that Deluge will “notify” Vim of any work performed or procured by it pursuant to cl 19.1, (the stated reference to cl 18.1 being a clear error). The use of the word “notify” similarly does not impose any particular mode of notification, as in the use of the word “notified”, in the past tense, first used in cl 19.1. Again, this is a contractual obligation, not a condition precedent, and the breach of which sounds in damages, if any. Clause 19.2 also states that Deluge’s performance or procurement of such remedial work will not relieve Vim of any of its responsibilities under the Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Finally, cl 19.3 gives Deluge the contractual right, if it has performed or procured remedial work under cl 19, to retain, deduct, withhold or set off the cost against any payment to be made to Vim or otherwise claim such amount from Vim without the need for a notice or an order of court or tribunal sanctioning the intent of any such notice.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 On the facts, the Judge held at [96] of the GD that “Deluge had given Vim written notice that action would be taken if Vim did not redress defects and delays in its works”. Notwithstanding this finding, the Judge reasoned that cl 21 of the Subcontract, which does not mandate any requirement of notice as a condition precedent to a claim for extra work, permits Deluge to claim against Vim for a breach of contract where Vim is liable for any delay in the completion of its services (see [93]–[95] of the GD). However, as we made clear to Mr Namazie, we are not inclined to reason on this basis since, as Mr Pradhan pointed out, it was a line of argument going beyond Deluge’s pleaded case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Turning first to Deluge’s Closing Submissions, para 172 laconically states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A simple perusal of the Agreed Bundle of Documents shows the sheer number of site memorandums issued by the main contractor, [Samsung], identifying delays and defects in the plumbing and sanitary portion of the UIC Project.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The footnote of para 172 in turn refers to documents within 56 Tabs in the Agreed Bundle of Documents (“ABD”). This kind of submission is particularly unhelpful to a first-instance court or an appellate court dealing with back-charges in a construction dispute as there has been no separation of the wheat from the chaff. Turning next to the Judge’s findings, the Judge appeared to have accepted Deluge’s evidence at [100] of the GD where he states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the evidence, I found that Deluge had substantiated its claims against Vim in respect of the back-charges asserted and/or damages, save for the 15% admin charge which Deluge added to some of its back-charge invoices. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, the Judge did not further elaborate on how he arrived at that finding. As can be seen in this judgment, Vim has appealed against the numerous items grouped under twenty back-charges. It is a very difficult task for an appellate court to assess if the challenge is valid or not when the finding is at the level set out above and without counsel providing any useful assistance whatsoever. As we have alluded to at [69] above on the claim for defective work carried out by Deluge during the DLP, there must be relevant details furnished to substantiate a claim. By the same token, the same kind of relevant detail is required for the back-charges. Generalisations are unhelpful. The relevant details should include, for example, with sufficient specificity and particulars what is comprised in the back-charge being levied, a relation back to the reference to the relevant “notification”, the details in the notification and distinguishing clearly between Deluge’s Scope of works and Vim’s scope of works, what the alleged incomplete or defective or incorrectly or badly done work is, the justification for the same, or, where relevant, show when the work should have been started and completed, why it was not done in a timely manner and how the amount in the back-charge relates to the same with details relating to the manpower deployed to carry out the rectification or incomplete work.            </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is therefore not surprising that Vim submits, in its Appellant’s Reply, at para 42, that it is not evident that the Judge applied his mind to “all the available evidence” (in answer to the Respondent’s Case at para 57). Vim is able to undermine the Judge’s finding by referring to the following Samsung Site Memos found in the 56 Tabs of the ABD which are, on the evidence as it stood, unrelated to Vim’s works: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) site memorandum 03519, which relates to “B2 Putty Patch Up” when Vim did not work in B2; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) site memorandum 03629 which relates to “All involved Sub-contractors” and relates to “Architectural Work Milestone” but where no mention is made of plumbing and sanitary works; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) site memorandum 0690 relating to housekeeping for electrical wiring, which is not part of Vim’s work; site memoranda 04088 which relates to shower mixer brackets provided by Samsung to Deluge, which does not concern Vim because Vim had no material supply obligations apart from providing consumable items such as wiring tapes, screws, bolts, nuts, washers, terminal lugs, and labelling tapes;

</div> that the “global” approach by Deluge and the Judge does not distinguish between delays caused by Vim and delays caused by Deluge or others. This is especially relevant where the sub-subcontract is but a subset of the subcontract works. There is unfortunately no short-cut to assessing back-charges of this nature. We pause to state that whilst we recognise that the time and cost spent on such detail in court may not be commercial or feasible, given the amounts at stake, the parties could and should have explored hiving off this detailed fact finding to a mutually acceptable mediator or neutral evaluator at a case management conference.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Having noted the foregoing, and doing the best we can in the circumstances, we nevertheless agree with the Judge that there was <span class="font-italic">some</span> evidence to show that the requirement of written notice had been satisfied as regards the most substantial back-charges. Deluge sent fourteen emails to Vim between 15 March 2017 and 4 January 2018 giving written notice that Vim needed to redress defects and delays in its works and, in those emails, warned that Vim would be held responsible if these were not carried out. Some of the emails enclosed site memoranda and Samsung’s back-charges imposed on Deluge, while others particularised specific defects. A complete list of these emails and a brief summary of their contents are set out in a table in the appendix to this judgment labelled <span class="font-weight-bold">Annex </span><span class="font-weight-bold">I</span>. We refer to these emails collectively as the “Annex I Emails” For present purposes, it suffices for us to state that we are satisfied that the two most substantial back-charges – <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17</span> and the part of <span class="font-weight-bold">BC19</span> concerning “PPR Pipe” (see the table at [73] above) – as well as <span class="font-weight-bold">BC13</span> had been supported by some form of written notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In particular, we are prepared to accept that, on balance, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC13</span> (supply of manpower for installation of pipes at level 34) correlates with the email dated 28 April 2017 (email at s/n 4 of the Annex I Emails):

In this regard, we note, from our examination of the record, that the earliest email emanating from Deluge giving written notice of any sort was sent to Vim on 15 March 2017 (email at s/n 1 of the Annex I Emails). This email appended various site memos from Samsung stating the reasons why Samsung was issuing back-charge notices to Deluge.

In this regard, we would also express our disquiet with the quality of the documentation provided, which was for the most part undecipherable and required a significant measure of guesswork. It is also pertinent to note that BC1, BC2, and BC3 (all of which were dated 10 February 2017) were issued before Vim was even informed by Deluge (by way of the 15 March 2017 email) that Samsung would be imposing back-charges on Deluge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Although the 10 December 2017 email (see [93] above) (which was submitted to constitute written notice) is, at first glance, problematic because the various back-charge invoices in <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17</span> were dated between 7 June 2017 and 7 December 2017

We nonetheless note that the necessary details and correlation were not set out in the AEICs.

In any case, it was not argued by Deluge that any of the Annex I Emails provided written notice of these back-charges.

</div>
</div> As noted at [9] of the GD, the initial back-charges were offset by Deluge in the progress payments UIC/S13030/VIM/PC/10, UIC/S13030/VIM/13, UIC/S13030/VIM/14, and UIC/S13030/VIM/15 that were made to Vim. Before us, Mr Namazie repeated an argument rejected by the Judge that because Vim had issued the invoices for progress payments that included a computation setting-off initial back-charges totalling $116,722.93, it was no longer open to Vim to dispute its liability with regard to this sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In our judgment, however, Vim’s receipt of the progress payments did not mean that it accepted that Deluge was entitled to levy the back-charges. We agree with the Judge that “[Vim] was simply invoicing the amounts that Deluge indicated it would pay (which Deluge then paid)” (GD at [70]). Progress payments are only interim payments and a sub-subcontractor who issues invoices to enable it to get the monies from a subcontractor who signifies what it is prepared to pay, does not, without more, compromise the sub-subcontractor’s right to dispute the set off. The payment certificates were only signed by Deluge’s personnel and did not signify anything more. This is a crucial point because Deluge could not direct us to any site memoranda substantiating the claims for <span class="font-weight-bold">BC1</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC2</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC3</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC4</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC5</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC8</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC9</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC10</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC11</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC12</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC13</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC14</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">BC15</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Returning to the main question, in order to establish Vim’s liability for the back-charges, the burden of proof was on Deluge to provide sufficient evidence to establish its claim for the back-charges imposed on Vim (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Longyuan-Arrk (Macao) Pte Ltd v Show and Tell Productions Pte Ltd and another suit</span> [2013] SGHC 160 at [104]). In this regard, we find the case of <span class="font-italic">Impact Painting Ltd v. Man-Shield (Alta) Construction Inc</span> [2018] AWLD 582 (“<span class="font-italic">Impact Painting</span>”) particularly instructive. Man-Shield (Alta) Construction Inc (“Man-Shield”) was the main contractor in a construction project and had engaged Impact Painting Ltd (“Impact”) as a subcontractor in respect of painting works and the installation of wallpapers. During the course of Impact’s work, the relationship between the parties broke down completely, and the parties had difficulties meeting the construction deadlines. Similar to the present case, Impact’s inability to meet the timelines was attributed to a lack of manpower on Impact’s part. Man-shield then informed Impact that it would be engaging workers to assist with Impact’s work. Man-shield subsequently issued several back-charges to Impact, claiming costs for the supply of the additional manpower as well as other rectification work related to Impact’s scope of work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In determining the question of whether Impact was liable for the various back-charges, B. R. Burrows J held at [28]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, the onus is on the party claiming a back charge to prove that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The back charge is for an expense actually, necessarily and reasonably incurred by the party claiming the back charge. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. By the terms of the subcontract, or by some other agreement between the parties, the charge is one, or is in relation to some task, for which the subcontractor undertook responsibility.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. The general contractor incurred the expense because the subcontractor defaulted on the responsibility to which the charge relates.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. Prior to incurring the charge, the general contractor gave notice to the subcontractor of its default and a reasonable opportunity to cure it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In our view, such a pragmatic approach to the issue of whether a claimant is able to discharge its evidentiary burden in relation to the legal question of causation is the correct approach to be adopted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 That being said, the present case has one notable feature. As we shall see below, there was, in effect, no elaboration on or explanation of these back-charges by the witnesses as one would have expected to see in a construction dispute involving back-charges. In such circumstances, at the appellate stage, the only other recourse available was to examine the documentary evidence parties had adduced before the court below, and as will become evident in the course of this judgment, this would often entail educated guesswork which tested the boundaries of acceptable evidentiary examination. Notwithstanding, as a matter of practical application, we briefly set out the order in which we examined the evidence to determine the issue of whether Vim was liable for the said back-charges: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Deluge has to first be able to provide sufficient evidence to show that back-charges were an expense that had actually been incurred by it. In the present case, such evidence would be either the relevant site memoranda or other documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the relevant back-charge was indeed incurred by Deluge, the court should then consider if the scope of the back-charge fell within the terms of the Subcontract or the Tender Clarifications. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Should Deluge be able to cross both the threshold requirements above, the court should then consider if the evidence was also sufficient to show that the claimed loss had been caused solely by Vim. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Should all the preceding requirements be met, the burden then shifts to Vim to provide evidence to persuade the court why the respective back-charge should not be imposed on it. And should Vim be unable to provide any evidence to rebut the evidence of Deluge whether in respect of the existence of the back-charge, the scope of the back-charge or causation of the claimed loss, liability would then be imposed on Vim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 We are reinforced in the approach we have set out above by the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> at para 9-096 in relation to the issue of causation: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The burden of proof approach </span>The burden of proof approach requires a claimant to show what part of the claimed loss has been caused solely by the defendant in order for substantial damages to be recovered in respect of it. It therefore presupposes that the claimant may only recover damages insofar as the relevant loss has not been caused by the claimant’s own default. Of course, in the event of concurrent causes of delay/loss in a claim under a building contract (one the contractor’s responsibility, the other the employer’s), it would follow that no recovery would be permitted if this approach were followed—because by definition the claimant contractor would be unable to show which part of the loss was exclusively the defendant employer’s responsibility. To this extent it would therefore support the same result that would be achieved by a simple application of the “but for” test to the assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 With these principles in mind, we turn first to consider if the Judge had erred in his approach to the question of liability in the present case. In his GD at [75] the Judge had held that “[t]he evidence show[ed] that there were delays and defects in Vim’s works, about which there were various [Samsung] site memoranda.” The Judge then went on to hold at [76]–[78] of the GD that: (a) there was an insufficient placement of manpower on-site as an average of 27 of Vim’s workers were ever on site at any given day and that Vim would have needed 80 or more workers on site per day to carry out its works; and (b) that Vim had placed orders for materials on very short notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In particular, at [80]–[81] of the GD, the Judge had made reference to site minutes and a memorandum which referred to <span class="font-italic">Samsung’s</span> complaints regarding the delays and defects in plumbing and supervision works. From these documents, he concluded that Vim knew that if the manpower situation did not improve, Samsung would be deploying manpower to rectify the resulting delays, and would in turn look to Deluge for the costs of doing so, and that Deluge would in turn look to Vim (GD at [82]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 With respect, we find this approach unsatisfactory for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 First, to answer the question as to whether the claims of defects and delays had been substantiated by the contemporaneous notes made in the site memoranda, we agree with counsel for Vim, Mr Pradhan, that we cannot rely on one or two memoranda to conclude, in sweeping generalisations, that all the alleged defects and delays had been or had not been made out on the evidence. Significantly, the minutes and memoranda by Samsung were addressed <span class="font-italic">to Deluge</span>, not Vim. Deluge still had to link these complaints to Vim’s work and for which Vim was liable. In such claims, a more detailed approach is required to make out a claim for a back-charge. As Mr Pradhan pointed out, the Judge had adopted a global approach at [82] of the GD to ascertain whether there had been any delays or defects, when, as referenced above, a detailed analysis was called for, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, an examination of each back-charge and description of that work, correlation to a defect and delay mentioned in the site memoranda and linking it to Vim’s scope of works and liability therefor. Deluge had the legal burden of establishing this on the facts (see [101] – [103] above). We agree with Mr Pradhan’s submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 On the other hand, Mr Namazie’s contention on this aspect was laden with difficulties. Although we note that Deluge did file a defects rectification table in evidence, this table was <span class="font-italic">completely</span><span class="font-italic"> unreadable</span> given the minuscule font and the dismal quality of the printing and/or photocopying. Aside from his submission of that table, Mr Namazie was not able to shed further light on how this table supported the imposition of the respective back-charges when we asked him to clarify or explain the same. In the absence of counsel’s assistance, the only recourse we had was to what was available in the Record of Appeal. This comprised of three main categories of documents: (a) the documents found in the ABD; (b) the documents found in the AEICs; (c) Deluge’s written closing submissions filed on 17 September 2020.

</div> However, as stated above at [100], Vim’s receipt of the progress payments did not mean that the relevant back-charges were accepted, and in failing to properly justify those back-charges as a fall-back measure, Deluge ran the risk of failing to discharge its evidential burden in the event it failed in its threshold argument of acceptance of the back-charges by Vim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Fifthly, we agree with Mr Pradhan’s submission that the Judge’s reliance on Vim’s apparent staffing deficiencies may not have been the appropriate approach because the need for the workers’ presence at the worksite varies; it may not be constant throughout the subcontract period but may vary according to the stage of subcontract works, the inter-phasing with the rest of the works being carried out and generally subject to the needs of each project. What was evident from the catch-up schedule dated 20 February 2017 was that many aspects of work that Vim needed to complete were “[b]ased on archi work schedule”. It was also not clear that Mr Tamil’s opinion on the matter could be accorded much weight given that he was not a plumbing expert. In any case, while we accepted that in certain instances Vim had placed orders for consumables on short notice and could, in those instances, be held responsible for delays occasioned in consequence, Deluge did not identify which of the works had been adversely affected as a result of and for which  a back-charge had been imposed. In our judgment, the presence of manpower or the lack thereof as well as Vim’s tardiness in placing orders for consumables, do not adequately address the issue of whether Vim was the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> <span class="font-italic">cause</span> of these delays and defects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 By the same token, however, Vim’s email to Deluge dated 13 February 2017 notifying that it was in compliance with Samsung’s schedule ahead of time was a bare statement and equally insufficient to conclude that Vim was not responsible for any delays or defects. We also agree with the Judge’s finding at [84] of the GD that Vim’s suggestion that Samsung’s workers had damaged its completed pipe work “purposely” in order to incriminate Vim, without providing a reason why Samsung’s workers would wish to do so, rendered Vim’s account highly questionable. It might have been different if Vim ran the argument that Samsung’s workers had damaged Vim’s pipework through carelessness, negligence or callous onsite behaviour (like clogging up toilet bowls or sinks or floor traps with carelessly discarded rubbish or food waste or wrapping). Moreover, as the Judge accepted at [85] of the GD, Vim did not claim that it had delayed its works because of payment issues and, in any event, “progress claims 6 through 11 [had] no delays”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The issue of causation in this case could not be argued and dealt with at a generalised level of abstraction; it had to descend into the details with regard to every back-charge and to every defence raised.

Also appended were six photographs of such bad quality that nothing could be made out other than varying shades of white to darker black, purporting to show the work done. We find this kind of evidence unacceptable and of no evidential value whatsoever. In his AEIC, Mr Tamil states, at para 96:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I set out a brief description of / justification for each back-charge invoice as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">BC/S13030/UIC/VIM-001</span>: The Defendant had to utilise its own manpower to perform plumbing and sanitary works for the installation and extension of water pipes on the 9th to 25th storeys of UIC Building, which works should have been carried out by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In our judgment, this could not be considered adequate substantiation from Deluge to impose a back-charge by any stretch of the imagination, even on a <span class="font-italic">prim</span><span class="font-italic">a facie</span> basis so as to shift the evidential burden on to Vim to give an explanation. The phrase “kitchen &amp; WB water pipe and WP extinction” used in Mr Tamil’s email dated 8 February 2017 does not tell us what those items meant and it is not the court’s function to guess or make assumptions, for example, as to what “WB” and “WP” or “extinction” means. There is no evidence to either explain how or why this is within Vim’s scope of works or why it was Vim’s responsibility, for example, because it was defective work, and how it was defective, so that Vim had to carry out the “kitchen &amp; WB pipe and WP extinction”. Nor is the court expected, in the absence of any explanation from Mr Tamil to guess what the word “extinction” meant, for example, was it an error in using that word for “extension”. If indeed that was the case, then there was no explanation why any pipes needed to be “extended” and why that was the fault of Vim. There was no allegation, for example, that Vim installed water pipes that were too short or shorter than required, thereby necessitating extensions.

</div> There is no evidence on the “copper pipe corridor” and whether or how it is related to the alleged defect claimed in BC1, nor is there any explanation of what “DMC” was. One would have expected evidence to the effect, for example, why the particular pipes fell within Vim’s scope of works, how they had to be extended, why this was the fault or defective work of Vim and that Vim failed or refused to rectify its defective work after being given an opportunity to do so, thereby causing Deluge to take over such rectification work. There was also no reference to work schedules as to when Vim should have carried out the works, no evidence of Vim’s shortage of manpower on site at the relevant time in relation to this back-charge, if that was the allegation and why they were in delay in doing so. In this respect, Deluge has failed to discharge its evidential burden of showing that additional manpower that had to be supplied for the scope of works in BC1 was the result of delay or a defect in pipe works attributable to Vim. Why this is a defect for which Vim is liable on the evidence as it stands, has not been made out even on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis, let alone as being substantiation therefor. In our judgment, Deluge has failed to discharge its evidential burden in relation to BC1 and it is open to Vim to successfully take the position that with Deluge not having made out its claim on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis, so that the evidential burden has not shifted to Vim to rebut the same.

In the email, Mr Tamil states that the back-charge to be imposed should be higher due to the height of the work taking place at more than 13 metres, requiring additional manpower and scaffolding. Attached to BC2 were what appears to have been two pages of un-readable schematic drawings which again, like the photographs in BC1, were of no evidential value. There were also no site memoranda produced by Deluge to substantiate the claimed back-charge in BC2. In his AEIC, Mr Tamil’s justification for this back-charge is as follows:

Given the state of the evidence, in our view, Deluge has not even made out its claim in BC2 on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis, and so the evidential burden has not shifted to Vim to rebut the same. We additionally observe that, even if BC2 were properly substantiated as such, Deluge still faces one more hurdle in making out its claim on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis. This is because, on Mr Tamil’s evidence, BC2 also seeks to recover from Vim the additional costs associated with high level scaffolding. Under item 30 of the Tender Clarifications, however, it was Deluge’s obligation to “provide scaffolding and lifting equipment” for works above 4m in height.

The evidential burden is on Deluge to establish what part of BC2 consisted of manpower costs but quite clearly, it has not done so (the sum of $45,540 is claimed as a lumpsum with no breakdown between the scaffolding costs and manpower costs) Thus, even if Deluge had provided some substantiation for BC2, it would still have failed to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case as it failed to isolate or establish the part of BC2 that was attributable to manpower costs and for which Vim could be liable.

We note that Vim did ask for further and better particulars as to “[w]hat was the basis for the alleged backcharges imposed” and that Deluge “[p]rovide itemised details or breakdown of the alleged cumulative backcharges”. Deluge did respond with the requested particulars but they were largely in the nature of reiteration of what had already been pleaded in its D&amp;CC.

</div> We should emphasise that this part of the invoice (as well as of the rest of it) was barely decipherable. We note that the pipe works referred to in BC17-1 can be said to fall within item 16 of the Quotation, which provides for the “installation of sanitary riser hubless pipe @ level 21 to Roof (Tower A &amp; B)”. However, we accept, as Vim has submitted, that Site Memo 03331, which is relied on by Deluge in support of BC17-1, makes no reference to the installation of copper pipes at the locations specified in BC17-1.

Although site memorandum 03886 refers to the “final vent pipe riser” for Tower A level 53 and Tower B level 52 (and not hubless pipes), we accept that when the site memorandum is read together with the SER invoice also adduced by Deluge in support of BC17-3, on the whole, there was sufficient documentary evidence to justify this back-charge. However, we observe that the back-charge in BC17-3 as formulated by Deluge <span class="font-italic">only</span> covers the works for Tower A. This is in contradistinction to the amount of $31,222.80 invoiced by SER, which covers works for <span class="font-italic">both</span> Tower A and Tower B. In our view, the sum relating to Tower B as set out in the SER invoice should be excluded since that was not the subject of BC17-3 as claimed by Deluge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In summary, having examined the record, we accept that the works in BC 17-3 come within the ambit of the Quotation and this creates a rebuttable presumption that Vim had been the cause of the claimed loss. Accordingly, the burden is now shifted to Vim to show why it should not be held liable for the claimed loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In this respect, Vim makes three contentions. First, it argues that the delay in the installation of hubless pipes was due to Deluge’s delay in delivering the necessary materials. It points to site memorandum 03886 in which Samsung stated, “You must provide material as attached to us by 30th of MAR”. Secondly, Vim points out that Samsung’s SER invoice provides completely no breakdown, quantity, or unit price for the hubless pipe installation, and is also defective for other reasons like absence of proof of payment. Thirdly, Vim also argues that there is no evidence that it was ever notified of site memorandum 03886 by Deluge.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 We see no merit in Vim’s first argument, which takes the quoted words in site memorandum 03886 out of context. The reference by Samsung to Deluge “providing material” is in the event that Deluge (as subcontractor) still fails to ensure that the relevant works were completed by the stated date (29 March) so that Samsung has to complete those works itself, and in that event, Deluge was to provide materials, otherwise Samsung would purchase those materials itself and then back-charge Deluge.  As for Vim’s second argument, there is no requirement that the materials supporting a back-charge must provide an exhaustive itemised breakdown of what is claimed by the back-charge; the only question is whether the evidence as adduced demonstrates that the back-charge had been incurred and whether the evidence shows that the claimed loss has been caused by Vim (see [103(c)] above). As we have explained, the SER invoice <span class="font-italic">read together </span>with site memorandum 03886 provides sufficient evidence in this regard. If Vim wishes to challenge this, or seek a justification by examining the breakdown, they could have done so in cross-examination of Mr Tamil, but Vim did not adopt this course of action. Finally, we do not see any merit in Vim’s third argument. Logically, if the state of affairs were such that Samsung had to bring in its own sub-contractor (SER) to complete works that otherwise fell within the scope of the Subcontract and/or Quotation and which Vim was to perform, then Vim surely must have been aware that there has been a significant delay with its works. The fact that Vim had never been specifically notified of the site memorandum is neither here nor there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In our view, Vim has not rebutted Deluge’s case on BC17-3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Accordingly, the back-charge that Deluge should be allowed to recover in respect of BC17-3 must exclude the cost of works relating to Tower B; the Tower A back-charge for BC17-3 works out to $15,922.80 (being $31,222.80 - $12,767.40 - $2,532.60).

</div> First, Vim argues that it was only informed by Deluge of the need to expedite the “RWDP installation” works for the “Upperstack” on 17 October 2016, and prior to that date, Samsung had already deployed its own manpower for those “RWDP installation” works. Secondly, any delay to the “RWDP installation” works was a result of Deluge’s delay in delivering the material required for the installation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the rainwater down pipes. Vim points to the correspondence in which it had complained to Deluge on 14 October 2016 about this delay in the supply of material.

</div> was caused by two factors: a “delay of work” in respect of levels 41 to 50 and a “shortage of material” for levels 29 to 33. On the evidence, the “delay of work” in respect of levels 41 to 50 would appear to be attributable to Vim’s default (items 5 to 7 of the Quotation cover various plumbing and sanitary works from levels 37 to 51 of the project). Indeed, Vim does not dispute that, but it argues that Samsung had deployed its own contractor to perform those works early. However, Vim has not referred us to any evidence of a works schedule in those arguments to show that the rectification works forming the subject of BC17-4 had been done ahead of time. We therefore reject the first contention made by Vim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 However, we accept that the documentary evidence identified by Vim, taken together with the terms of site memorandum 01856, indeed shows that the delay in the “RWDP installation” works from levels 29 to 33 (coming within items 3 and 4 of the Quotation) was the result of a shortage of materials. As referenced above, Vim’s obligations under the Subcontract did not include the provision of material, it was Deluge’s obligation to supply the material. Thus, we find Vim has discharged its evidential burden of proving that it was <span class="font-italic">not </span>entirely responsible for the delay in the “RWDP installation” works from levels 29 to 33 complained of in BC17-4, in that that part of the delay had been the result of a shortage of materials for which it is not liable under the Subcontract. On the existing evidence, however, it is unclear to us what part of the claimed loss BC17-4 is attributable to the “RWDP installation” works from levels 41 to 50 and levels 29 to 33. The onus is on Deluge to establish this, and if not, it must prove that, notwithstanding the Subcontract which shows that Vim ought not be liable for any delay arising from shortage of material, Vim had caused the entirety of the claimed loss in BC17-4. As Deluge has not done so, there is no evidential basis for us to determine what part of BC17-4 Deluge should be allowed to recover. We therefore only award a nominal sum of $100 for this back-charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) BC17-5 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-5</span> is a back-charge of $32,850 for<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>“sanitary floor trap (“S trap”) rectification work”.

</div> Vim also points out that Samsung had already complained of the delay with such works two weeks before site memorandum 04137. It is not apparent to us what the substance of Vim’s contention is, for example, whether it is Vim’s case there had been no delays with those works, or that Samsung had gone ahead of schedule to perform those works. The fact that Deluge only notified Vim to complete the relevant works on 28 April 2017 was neither here nor there - Vim’s obligation to perform works under the Subcontract cannot be contingent on when Deluge comes to remind Vim to rectify its delayed or outstanding works. Vim has not adduced evidence of any schedule of works to show that by 28 April 2017 the time for the completion of those works complained of in site memorandum 04137 was not yet up. In fact, it will appear from site memorandum 04137 that the delay with the “RWDP installation” works had begun some time <span class="font-italic">before </span>28 April 2017.

On the state of the evidence, we find that Deluge has not even established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for the back-charge claimed in BC17-8 and we therefore disallow it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(I) BC17-9, BC17-10 and BC17-11</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-9</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-10 </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-11 </span>are each back-charges for plumbing and sanitary works carried out by skilled workers, the cost of which had been charged to Deluge for three time periods: 29 April to 15 May 2017; 16 May to 31 May 2017; and 1 June to 15 June 2017. For these three back-charges, Deluge relies on site memorandum 03331 (see [141] above) in support, as well as the timesheets signed by the various workers that have performed these works. On its face, site memorandum 03331 does refer to a delay in plumbing and sanitary works in the project, which Deluge had promised Samsung to expedite. Although the claimed periods and rates were not necessarily supported by the documentary evidence, we are satisfied that, on balance, by a reference to “Plumbing and Sanitary Works”, site memorandum 03331 can be said to refer to the plumbing and sanitary works claimed in BC17-9, BC17-10 and BC17-11. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 However, we also note that site memorandum 03331 states in no uncertain terms that Deluge had “acknowledged the delay…and committed to [Samsung] to…expedite and catch up with the work”. This included “improv[ing] site work progress and supervision for P&amp;S works” and to “increase the manpower (currently 47)”. Site memorandum 03331 does not in any way state that Vim was at fault for the manpower shortages, and apart from the fact that several of Vim’s employees were present at the site meeting, Vim was not in any way implicated in the delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In order for Deluge to establish its claim against Vim, it was incumbent on Deluge to provide clear and cogent evidence linking Vim to the claimed loss in BC17-9, BC17-10 and BC17-11. Without more, the site memorandum 03331 itself does not provide sufficient description or particularisation as to who had performed the plumbing and sanitary works that required rectification and who had caused or were responsible for the delays in rectification. In our view, Deluge has not been able to show that the claimed loss had been caused solely by Vim. Failing which, the burden does not shift to Vim to rebut Deluge’s evidence. Accordingly, as Deluge has been unable to substantiate the back-charges in BC17-9, BC17-10 and BC17-11, they are therefore disallowed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(J) BC17-12 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-12</span> is a back-charge of $8,000 for<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>“safety fine”. Deluge relies on site memorandum 03331 (see [141] above) and various HSE Forms in support of this back-charge. While the HSE Forms proved the existence of $3,300 worth of fines (corresponding to the amount of the back-charge claimed in BC17-12), site memorandum 03331 did not even mention the safety fines. Also, the HSE Forms do not actually mention Vim at all, and it is not clear on the face of the documentation whether it was Deluge’s or Vim’s personnel who committed the safety breaches. We should also add that several of the HSE Forms post-dated site memorandum 03331. It follows that Deluge has not established Vim’s liability for the back-charge claimed in BC17-12 and it is therefore disallowed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(K) BC17-13 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-13</span> is a back-charge of $7,720 for “Waste disposal (Mar to July)”. Deluge relies on site memorandum 03331 (see [141] above) in support of this back-charge. Again, there is nothing in site memorandum 03331 referring to waste disposal whatsoever. It follows that Deluge has not even established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for the back-charge claimed in BC17-13 and it is therefore disallowed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(L) BC17-14 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 <span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-14</span> is a back-charge of $65,852.15 for: “[Samsung] Direct Workers”. It is undisputed that the works referred to in BC17-14 are those works that Samsung had back-charged to Deluge and which Deluge in turn sought to back-charge to Vim in respect of manpower. There is no breakdown of this sum of $65,812. Deluge relies on various site memoranda in support. They include site memorandum 03331, which stated that “[Samsung] with no other alternative had to mobilize our workforce to rectify your faulty pipe installation and to catch up delay work which had caused ‘bottle neck’ to other subsequent works” (see [141] above), as well as the following information: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Main Contractor’s Direction No 0690 dated 18 April 2017, which stated, among other things:

We accept that site memorandum 03331 does refer to Samsung mobilising its own workers to perform delayed plumbing and sanitary works. However, Deluge has not provided any breakdown of the sum of $65,852.15 it claimed Samsung had back-charged to it, and whether this sum covered the cost of plumbing and sanitary works that Samsung had stated in site memorandum 03331 it would mobilise its own workers to perform. It is for Deluge to make good its claim on this back-charge and not for the court to engage in guesswork. As for the other documents relied on by Deluge in support of this back-charge (see [177(a)]-[177(b)] above), there is no mention at all of the plumbing and sanitary works. Several of these documents appear to us to be <span class="font-italic">general </span>site memoranda addressed to all sub-contractors of the project. Even if we were to accept for the sake of argument that the works contemplated in each of these documents were indeed plumbing and sanitary works, there is simply nothing on the face of the documents to show that the defects or rectification works related to works coming within the scope of the Subcontract and which are attributable to Vim. We do not see how, by any stretch of the imagination, those documents can be said to provide substantiation for the back-charge claimed in BC17-14.

</div> Given the conclusion that we have reached at [178] above, it is strictly speaking unnecessary for us to address this submission by Vim. However we point out that these documents were in fact <span class="font-italic">not </span>the ones relied on by Deluge in support of BC17-14; it appears to us that Vim came to that conclusion because these documents were located some pages after a Samsung invoice to Deluge dated 2 November 2017 in which Deluge was invoiced a sum of $62,397.10 for “[w]ork done by third party” and $633.80 for “[s]upply of direct workers”.

Deluge relies solely on site memorandum 03331 in support of this back-charge. We note, however, that Deluge has already claimed $22,080 by way of BC17-10 for providing skilled workers for plumbing and sanitary works for this same period (16 May to 31 May 2017). We do not see how the same site memorandum 03331 can lend support to <span class="font-italic">both </span>BC17-10 and BC17-16 when the claim pertains to works for the identical time period.

We therefore accept that the bulk of the PPR pipe issues complained in that memorandum, in so far as they pertained to levels 9 to 20, do not come within the Subcontract. For Deluge to make out its claimed back-charge in BC19-1, it must go further and show that the PPR pipe works identified in site memorandum 03075 were indeed performed by Vim, for instance, as part of the rectification works which Vim accepts that it had performed for Deluge.

In other words, the bulk of the back-charge pertains to PPR pipe works for the upper stack of the project.

Thirdly there is nothing in the site memorandum to suggest that the defective pipe installation resulted in rectification works comprising the removal and reinstallation of a kitchen appliance; site memorandum 04560 only states that the installation of “floor marble, wall finishing and kitchen back panel” has been affected. As in the many of the back-charge claims made, Deluge has made disparate complaints and references but has not connected these references into a comprehensible complaint in relation to defective or incorrect Subcontract works by Vim requiring rectification.

</div> Site memorandum 05053 itself makes no mention of the modification of base cover for floor drain work. The list of outstanding defects attached to site memorandum 05053 does set out various plumbing and sanitary defects, but the most part of these defects were associated with plumbing and sanitary accessories and there is no specific mention of any base cover of the defective floor drain work. It is not for the court to engage in guesswork and speculate that “floor drain work” somehow came in the list of outstanding defects accompanying site memorandum 05053; the legal burden is on Deluge to make good its claim on the back-charges. We therefore also find that Deluge has not discharged its evidential burden for the back-charge claimed in BC19-4 and therefore disallow it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary on the back-charges that Deluge has made out a claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 To summarise, we are of the view that Deluge has only been able to show that the following back-charges were attributable to Vim: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Back-charge </span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Scope of works </span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount (S$) </span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">BC13</span> </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">“Supply manpower” for “rainwater pipe installation”, “vent pipe installation” and “cold water riser pipe installation” at “RESIDENTIAL TOWER (L34 MEP Level)”</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">14,966</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-3</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">“Hubless pipe installation resi Tower A from high level 52 &amp; 53”</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">15,922.80</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-4</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">“RWDP installation at residential balcony”</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">100</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">BC17-7</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">“RWDP installation at MEP Level”</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">10,800.00</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="Table-Text text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Total </span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">41,788.80</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 In this regard, we are content to adopt the Judge’s reasoning to exclude the additional 15% admin charge that Deluge had levied (see [104] and [105(p)] of the GD).

Pte Ltd (“Deluge”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 In around July 2015, Samsung C&amp;T Corporation (“Samsung”) had subcontracted the plumbing, sanitary and gas works for a construction project to Deluge. Due to delays in Deluge’s work, Deluge engaged Vim sometime in March or April 2016, to carry out certain plumbing and sanitary works for the sum of $1.75m. This agreement was set out in a subcontract (“the Subcontract”), which made reference to a purchase order (“the Purchase Order”), a set of tender clarifications (“Tender Clarifications”) and a quotation (“the Quotation”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 On 20 October 2017, the temporary occupation permit (“TOP”) for the construction project was obtained. On 5 February 2018, Vim left the project site and did not do further work there. On 20 October 2018, the defects liability period (“DLP”), which ran for 12 months from the date the TOP was obtained, expired. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Vim subsequently brought a suit against Deluge for payment of: (a) $450,550.02 as the balance amount payable for the main works under the Subcontract (“main works”); and (b) $697,130.58 for variation works (“variation works”). Deluge accepted that it owed Vim an even greater balance amount for the main works than that sought by Vim, but denied liability for all the variation works claims. Deluge also counterclaimed for: (a) costs of $7,200 incurred in completing the remaining main works and costs of $105,300 for rectifying defects (“rectification works”); and (c) a total of $870,507.09 that it was purportedly entitled to back-charge the appellant under the Subcontract (“back-charges”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Judge held that Deluge had paid Vim a total of $1,288,624.80, leaving $453,912.94 due to Vim in respect of the main works. However, the Judge rejected Vim’s variation claims on the basis that, among other things, the Subcontract provided that variation works could only be carried out with written instructions from Deluge’s project manager. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 As for Deluge’s counterclaims, the Judge held that Deluge was entitled to the sums of $7,200 and $105,300 for rectification works (this was later determined to be $105,037.74). The Judge also allowed Deluge’s counterclaim for back-charges amounting to $858,604.36. After offsetting the sums due to Vim, the Judge found that a net sum of $509,729.16 was to be paid by Vim to Deluge.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 On appeal, Vim argues that the Judge should not have rejected its variation claims because, inter alia, the variation works had been approved by Deluge’s staff and the documentary bases for its claims were well-founded. As for Deluge’s counterclaims for rectification works and back-charges, Vim argues that these should have been disallowed because, inter alia, Deluge had not given it the requisite notice of the charges incurred and that there was no evidential foundation for Deluge’s claims. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 In general, to claim for work as a variation under a contract, the claimant needs to establish that (a) the work is an “extra”; (b) there is an express or implied promise to pay for the work; (c) the work was instructed by a person with authority to vary the contract; and (d) any condition precedent to payment has been fulfilled: at [29]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Every contract has to be construed on its particular terms and where necessary within the context in which it was entered into. Unless it is stated that strict compliance with the contract is required failing which a variation claim will fail, failure to comply with a contractual clause may not amount to an absolute bar against a right to claim for payment of the variation: at [33] to [35]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 In the present case, cl 16 of the Subcontract required written instructions from Deluge’s project manager in order for variation works to be carried out. However, cl 16 does not state that in the absence of written instructions Vim would forfeit payment. It was therefore open to Vim to show that compliance with cl 16 had been waived by Deluge: [30] to [35].  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 When a party unequivocally chooses not to exercise one of two inconsistent rights, and he is aware of the circumstances giving rise to the existence of that right, he would be deemed as having elected to waive that right: at [43].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Deluge’s representatives had signed on the majority of the variation work claims by Vim, and written comments on the forms that the claims would be subject to Samsung’s approval, this was a clear indication that Deluge was waiving compliance with having to obtain written instruction under cl 16 of the Subcontract to carry out variation works. In addition, it was not Deluge’s contention at trial that Samsung had denied Vim’s variation works claims: at [45]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 As Deluge had not pleaded a want of authority on the part of its representatives who had signed Vim’s variation works claims, it could not raise the argument that they had no authority to waive compliance with the written instruction requirement in cl 16:  at [46] to [53]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 As Deluge does not contest that the variation works had been completed by Vim the evidential burden was on Deluge to show how the works completed come within the scope of main works under the Subcontract. The scope of main works as set out in the Subcontract, the Tender Clarifications and the Quotation, were limited to the works enumerated in the Quotation which had set out with great particularity the works Vim had agreed with Deluge to carry out. In this regard, Deluge’s conduct indicated that it did not regard the variations works to be main works: at [58] to [63].  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 As Vim’s variation claims had been adequately substantiated, the appeal against the Judge’s decision to reject its variation claims in the sum of $388,428 was allowed: at [67]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Deluge’s counterclaim against Vim for rectification works for $105,037.74 was not supported by the documentary or other evidence save for a bare assertion. As Deluge has not made out its claim in respect of the rectification works, Vim’s appeal on this issue was allowed: at [68] to [72]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The requirement for notice to be given in relation to defects clauses gives the contractor an opportunity to cure or remedy the defect. This requirement of notification is based on the fact that  based on the fact that the contractor is usually in the best position to carry out any remedial work at a lower cost. Failure to comply with a stipulation to provide notice in a defects clause may preclude an employer from relying on the defects clause as against the contractor, although the employer’s right to damages in respect of the cost of repairs is not extinguished. Where the employer does not provide the contractor with a contractual opportunity to rectify defects during the defect liability period, the employer can still recover the cost of repairing the defects, but the sum that the employer can recover may be limited to how much it would have cost the contractor to rectify the defects: at [80] to [82]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 Under cl 19 of the Subcontract, Deluge was required to first notify Vim of the defective work, should Vim  indicate its unwillingness to remedy the defects or does not do so within a reasonable time, Deluge could then proceed to give written notice of its intention to perform or secure performance of the remedial work. After which, Deluge would notify Vim of any work performed, and has the contractual right to claim such amounts from Vim: at [84] to [87]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 There was some evidence to show that the requirement of written notice had been satisfied as regards the most substantial back-charges. While some of the back-charges were not supported by any form of notification from Deluge to Vim, Vim did not argue that had it been informed of the back-charges that it would have performed those works more cost-effectively. Deluge’s failure to comply with cl 19 did not materially affect its claims: at [91] to [98]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 In order to establish Vim’s liability for the back-charges, the burden of proof was on Deluge to provide sufficient evidence to establish its claim for the back-charges imposed on Vim. In order to do so, Deluge had to first be able to provide sufficient evidence to show that back-charges were an expense that had actually been incurred by it, that the scope of the back-charge fell within the terms of the Subcontract or the Tender Clarifications, and that the evidence was sufficient to show that the claimed loss had been caused solely by Vim. Should all the preceding requirements be met, the burden then shifted to Vim to provide evidence to rebut Deluge’s case, failing which liability would be imposed on Vim: at [101] to [104]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 The Judge’s approach to the issue of liability was too generalised, had failed to consider the fact that Deluge’s claim lacked the requisite particulars, and had placed reliance on Vim’s lack of manpower which did not adequately address the issue of whether Vim was the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> <span class="font-italic">cause</span> of these delays and defects. The proper approach was not to rely on a generalised level of abstraction, rather recourse must be had to the details with regard to each back-charge alleged by Deluge and to every defence raised by Vim in defence: at [106] to [116].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 Having considered all of the evidence, Deluge was only able to show that a limited number of the back-charges were attributable to Vim. Accordingly, Deluge’s entitlement to the back-charges was reduced to the sum of $41,788.80. Setting-off the claims (inclusive of Vim’s claim below for main works that was not the subject of appeal) against the counterclaims, Deluge was liable to Vim for a net sum of $453,912.94<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>(main works)<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>+ $388,428 (variation works) – $41,788.80 (back-charges) = <span class="font-weight-bold">$800,552.14</span>: at [195] to [197]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
