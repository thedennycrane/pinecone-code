        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is the second action arising from the sale
                    of shares in the defendant company, WBL Corporation Limited
                    (“WBL”). The plaintiff here is Kevin Lew Chee Fai
                    (“Lew”). The sale of shares took place on 4 July
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the first action before this court (<em>i.e</em>. Suit No. 71 of 2009), the Central Bank of Singapore
                        <em>viz</em> the Monetary Authority of Singapore
                    (“MAS”) claimed a civil penalty from Lew under s 232(2), read
                    with s 218, of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“the SFA”). There, MAS alleged that Lew had contravened the
                    rules prohibiting insider trading under s 218 of the SFA by selling 90,000
                    WBL shares on 4 July 2007. For convenience, I will refer to the sale of
                    shares by Lew on 4 July 2007 as the “Insider Trade”. In my
                    earlier judgment (see <em>Monetary Authority of Singapore v Lew
                        Chee Fai Kevin</em> [2010] SGHC 166 (“<em>MAS v
                        Lew</em>”)), I held that Lew had contravened the relevant
                    provisions of the SFA by entering into the Insider Trade and ordered him to pay
                    a civil penalty amounting to $67,500. In the present action, Lew claimed for
                    shares to be issued to him pursuant to an employee share option scheme that was
                    operated by WBL, as he claimed to have validly exercised various options on
                    9 July 2007. WBL denied Lew’s claims primarily on the grounds of
                    illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>

                    (“ESOS”) to motivate and retain its key executives. The following

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I have already set out the facts giving rise to
                    the Insider Trade in <em>MAS v Lew</em> and will not repeat
                    them here. Lew received a total of $446,773.26 from the Insider Trade. Lew does
                    not now dispute that the loss which he avoided was $27,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 9 July 2007, Lew submitted two notices
                    to WBL (as required under clause 8(a) of the ESOS, see above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) (“the “Notices”). The
                    first notice was to exercise the share option granted on 21 January 2000 to
                    purchase all the WBL shares allotted to him under that option. The second notice
                    was to exercise the share option granted on 6 January 2004 to purchase
                    130,000 WBL shares. Lew tendered two cheques totalling $485,110 as payment for
                    exercising those share options (the “Cheques”). It is not disputed
                    that Lew had used the funds received from the Insider Trade to pay for the
                    exercise of the options. Lew informed Tan Swee Hong (“Tan”),
                    WBL’s Group General Manager (Legal and Compliance) and Company Secretary,
                    that he had sold the shares under the Insider Trade on the very same day
                        (<em>i.e</em>., 9 July 2007). After Tan informed
                    Lew that his actions could be construed as an insider trading, Lew told Tan that
                    he had executed the Insider Trade to “raise cash to exercise my WBL
                    options”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 19 July 2007, Lew resigned from WBL. In
                    his letter of resignation, Lew highlighted that he had applied to exercise
                    options to receive a total of 167,500 WBL shares on 9 July 2007 and sought
                    confirmation that he was entitled to exercise the remaining share options which
                    were either unexercised or unvested. WBL did not respond to Lew’s question
                    on the share options. As a result, on 27 December 2007, Lew wrote to the
                    company seeking a response. WBL replied on 8 January 2008 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…we are bound by legal restrictions from taking any action with
                        respect to your attempt to exercise these options using the proceeds of your
                        trades.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to your request for the vesting/exercising of the
                        options/SARs, the company will reserve any decision pending the final
                        outcome of the proceedings against you initiated by the authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Subsequent letters were exchanged between
                    WBL’s and Lew’s solicitors on this matter. WBL took the position
                    that it was not in breach of any contract or liable in any way to Lew for the
                    167,500 WBL shares, and that Lew was not entitled to any of the unexercised or
                    unvested options. Disagreeing with WBL, Lew commenced the present action to
                    claim for the 167,500 shares and for damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arguments before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I will now summarise the parties’ main
                    arguments, starting with Lew’s case. He took the position that he was
                    entitled, on 9 July 2007, to exercise the share options that had been
                    granted to him on 21 January 2000 and 6 January 2004. Having submitted
                    the Notices and Cheques on 9 July 2007, he had therefore accepted
                    WBL’s offer to issue and allot WBL shares to him and had consequently
                    exercised those share options within time. As a result, Lew claimed that WBL was
                    in breach of contract in refusing to allot and issue the 167,500 WBL shares to
                    him. Lew sought specific performance of the share options that he exercised as
                    well as damages (<em>viz</em> dividends that were declared
                    by WBL after Lew had submitted the Notices and Cheques and the lost opportunity
                    to sell those WBL shares at a higher price than prevailing at the time of the
                    issue and allotment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     WBL did not deny that Lew had submitted the
                    Notices and Cheques on 9 July 2007. However, it took the position that Lew
                    was not entitled to purchase the shares under those share options because Lew
                    was in breach of s 218 of the SFA (which sets out the rules prohibiting
                    insider trading) as well as of his common law, contractual and statutory
                    fiduciary duties. WBL highlighted that Lew had used the proceeds of his Insider
                    Trade to exercise the share options on 9 July 2007. It contended that it
                    would be in contravention of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious
                    Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (the
                    “CDSA”) if it was to allot and issue those 167,500 WBL shares to
                    Lew. As a result, WBL’s position was that under the ESOS, performance of
                    the share options was unenforceable or illegal, as it was impliedly prohibited
                    by the CDSA, and/or would offend the conscience of the court and/or was contrary
                    to public policy to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For the reasons stated in <em>MAS v Lew</em>, I had found that Lew had contravened s 218 (read
                    with s 232) of the SFA (although I should state that he has been granted
                    leave to appeal and has done so in Civil Appeal No 123 of 2010). For present
                    purposes, there is no dispute that Lew was involved in some wrongdoing. Neither
                    is there any doubt that Lew had used the proceeds from the Insider Trade to fund
                    the exercise of his share options on 9 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The main thrust of WBL’s case was that
                    it would infringe s 44(1) of the CDSA by allotting and issuing the 167,500
                    WBL shares to Lew pursuant to his exercise of the share options on 9 July
                    2007. Section 44(1) of the CDSA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                            benefits from criminal conduct</b>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Before I turn to consider whether WBL would be
                    in contravention of s 44(1) of the CDSA had it acted on Lew’s
                    exercise of his share options, it would be useful for me to set out the exact
                    parameters of the dispute in order to distil the issues that are before this
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     First, there is no dispute that the ESOS
                    itself is legal. There is also no allegation that either party had any nefarious
                    intentions at the time of entering into the ESOS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It follows that what is, in truth, at the
                    heart of the dispute is whether the performance of the ESOS by WBL would have
                    been illegal. If it would have been illegal for WBL to perform its obligations
                    to allot and issue the WBL shares, this court cannot hold WBL in breach of
                    contract for failing to do so, or order WBL to specifically perform the ESOS (as
                    Lew requested in his statement of claim): see <em>Treitel on the
                        Law of Contract</em> (Peel gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed,
                    2007) at para 11-108.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Where one party forms a contract with an
                    intention of performing it illegally at the outset and the other party is
                    unaware of such an illegal intention (the “innocent party”), the
                    innocent party is entitled to refuse to perform the contract if he becomes aware
                    of the illegality subsequently, but before the contract is performed: see
                    Buckley, <em>Illegality and Public Policy</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009) at para 4.25. In <em>Cowan v
                        Milbourn</em> (1867) LR 2 Exch 230, the court had little
                    hesitation in dismissing the plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract
                    arising from the defendant’s refusal to perform the contract by hiring his
                    rooms to the plaintiff. The defendant was not aware of the plaintiff’s
                    illegal purpose when the contract was formed and came to realise that the
                    plaintiff had intended to use those rooms to deliver lectures of an illegal
                    nature at a later time. In my view, it should make no difference that, on the
                    facts of the case here, the intention to perform the contract illegally came
                    into being <em>after</em> the contract was legally
                    formed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This is supported by the UK Court of Appeal
                    case of <em>K Ltd v National Westminster Bank plc (Revenue and
                        Customs Commissioners and another intervening)</em> [2007]
                    1 WLR 311 <em>(“K Ltd”</em>).
                    There, the customer gave its bank certain instructions to pay various sums of
                    money out of its account. The bank suspected that the money in the
                    customer’s account represented criminal property. By way of background,
                    under the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c 29) (the “POC
                    Act”), it would have been an offence (under s 328) for the bank to
                    be concerned in:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... an arrangement which [it, i.e. the bank] knows or suspects facilitates
                        (by whatever means) the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal
                        property by or on behalf of another person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The POC Act also provides that no offence
                    would be committed if the bank had made a disclosure and received authorised
                    consent to do so. I observe in passing that a similar provision exists under the
                    CDSA (at s 44(3)). As such, the bank could not legally act on the
                    customer’s instructions without making the required disclosure and
                    receiving authorised consent to do so. However, this was exactly what the
                    customer sought against the bank in court. The customer applied for an interim
                    injunction requiring the bank to comply with its instructions. It was in this
                    context that Longmore LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal,
                    observed (in relation to the injunction) that (at [10]–[12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    If the law of the land makes it a criminal offence
                            to honour the customer’s mandate in these circumstances <em>there can, in my judgment, be no breach of contract for the
                                bank to refuse to honour its mandate</em> and there can,
                            equally, be no invasion (or threat of an invasion) of a legal right on
                            the part of the bank such as is required before a claimant can apply for
                            an injunction. If that is right, there would be no issue to be tried in
                            any later legal proceedings and any application for an interlocutory
                            mandatory injunction has to be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    It could be said that this puts the matter
                            over-legalistically or overdramatically in the sense that it is not
                            usually a defence to a claim for a breach of contract that the
                            contract-breaker would, by performing the contract, be in breach of the
                            criminal law. That is not, however, correct. <em>The
                                conventional view is that, if a statute renders the performance of a
                                contract illegal, the contract is frustrated and both sides are
                                discharged from further performance</em>. <b><em>In a case, however, where a statute makes it temporarily illegal to
                                perform the contract, the contract will only be suspended until the
                                illegality is removed. That still means that, during the suspension,
                                no legal right exists on which any claim to an injunction must
                                depend</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    Even if, for any reason, the above analysis is open
                            to objection, the fact still remains that during the seven-working-day
                            or 31-day period, as the case may be, the bank would be acting illegally
                            by processing the cheque. <em>It would be entirely
                                inappropriate for the court, interlocutorily or otherwise, to
                                require the performance of an act which would render the performer
                                of the act criminally liable</em>. As a matter of discretion
                            any injunction should be refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is therefore clear that there can be no
                    breach of contract where it would have been illegal to perform one’s
                    obligations under that contract. However, it seems to me that this proposition
                    will depend on two factors. The first factor is whether there are any other ways
                    of performing the contract legally. The second is whether the illegality can be
                    removed subsequently at some point of time. In the latter circumstance, the
                    contract will be suspended until the illegality is removed: <em>K
                        Ltd</em> at [11]. Pertinently, both Lew and WBL relied on <em>K Ltd</em> in their submissions and did not disagree with
                    Longmore LJ’s observations. As such, the issues which I have to address
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Would it have been illegal for WBL
                        to have allotted and issued shares to Lew?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so, could the illegality have been removed
                        subsequently at some point or were there other legal means of performing the
                        ESOS?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will consider each issue in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Would it have been illegal for WBL to have allotted and issued shares
                to Lew?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     From its submissions, it appeared that WBL was
                    relying on s 44(1)(b)(ii) of the CDSA to establish its illegality defence.
                    Based on the wording of that provision (see above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>), WBL would have to show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     It entered into or was otherwise
                        concerned in an “arrangement” with Lew;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     It knew or had reasonable grounds to
                        believe that, by that arrangement, Lew’s benefits of criminal conduct
                        were used for Lew’s benefit to acquire property;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     It knew or had
                        reasonable grounds to believe that Lew had engaged in “criminal
                        conduct” or had “benefited from criminal
                        conduct”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I accept WBL’s submission that it would
                    have entered into an “arrangement” with Lew by issuing the shares
                    to Lew. Lew’s argument was basically that an “arrangement”
                    within the meaning of the CDSA had to involve an <em>agreement</em> between the accused person and the perpetrators of
                    criminal conduct. It is noted that the term “arrangement” has been
                    “frequently used in statute to describe the widest possible class of
                    action in a particular context” (see <em>Jowitt’s
                        Dictionary of English Law</em>, vol 1 (Greenberggen Ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010) at p 159). If Parliament had intended only for agreements
                    to be caught, it would have used express words to that effect. In any case, if
                    WBL was to issue those shares to Lew, there would have been an agreement between
                    the two. I therefore take the view that the first element had been made
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Lew did not dispute that WBL knew that he had
                    used the proceeds from the Insider Trade to fund the exercise of his share
                    options. WBL also knew that Lew was in possession of information that was not
                    generally available at the time of the Insider Trade. As such, if the proceeds
                    Lew received from the Insider Trade were his “benefits from criminal
                    conduct”, a point which I will consider in greater detail below, the
                    second element would be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In respect of the third element, Lew argued
                    that the Insider Trade was not criminal conduct within the meaning of the CDSA.
                    Lew highlighted that he was sued by MAS in a <em>civil</em>
                    action (for payment of a civil penalty under s 232 of the SFA) and was
                    never <em>charged</em> under s 221 for an offence.
                    Under s 2 of the CDSA, “criminal conduct” is defined as doing
                    or being concerned in a “serious offence”. In turn, a serious
                    offence is defined any of the predicate offences set out in Schedule 2 of the
                    CDSA (the “List”). The List provides that “Section 221 for
                    contravention of s 218” is a serious offence. However, the List does
                    not refer to an action brought under s 232 read with s 218 of the SFA
                    as a serious offence. As a result, Lew contended that since MAS had chosen to
                    proceed under s 232 of the SFA, WBL could not maintain that he <em>could</em> have been punished under s 221 of the SFA.
                    WBL’s response was that there was no requirement for the perpetrator to be
                    charged before it can amount to a “serious offence”, and whether
                    there was a “serious offence’ would depend on whether an offence
                    had been <em>committed</em> instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I agree with WBL’s submissions. The
                    objectives of the CDSA would be defeated if the perpetrator needs to be charged
                    before the CDSA provisions can apply. It would allow a person to knowingly deal
                    with the tainted property of a criminal until he is charged. I cannot accept
                    that the Parliament could have intended for a person who assists a criminal, who
                    is successful in evading arrest from the authorities and is never charged for
                    the predicate offence, to fall outside the purview of s 44(1) of the CDSA.
                    Notably, s 44(1) merely requires a person to know or have reasonable
                    grounds to believe that the other person is engaging or has <em>engaged</em> in criminal conduct. It does not provide that a person
                    must know or have reasonable grounds to believe that the other person has been
                        <em>charged</em> for criminal conduct. In my view,
                    where a person knows or has reason to believe that another person has committed
                    an offence, it would fall squarely within the purview of s 44(1), and that
                    person could be liable for assisting the other person in money laundering if the
                    other elements are made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The present case is unique, as a person who
                    infringes the rules prohibiting insider trading under the SFA can face either
                    civil or criminal proceedings. This is distinguishable from the other offences
                    which attract criminal consequences only. On 9 July 2007, when Lew
                    exercised the two share options, it would not have been possible for WBL or even
                    Lew himself to know if he would be charged for criminal insider trading or sued
                    for payment of a civil penalty instead. However, given the present
                    circumstances, WBL knew that Lew had sold shares while in possession of material
                    non-public information. It would, at the very least, have had reasonable grounds
                    to believe that Lew had committed an offence and could be punished under
                    s 221 of the SFA. In those circumstances, I am of the view that WBL would
                    (at least) have reasonable grounds to believe that Lew had engaged in criminal
                    conduct within the meaning of the CDSA. If, however, the issue relating to these
                    share options were to arise today (<em>i.e</em>., after Lew
                    has been found liable by this court for the payment of a civil penalty under
                    s 232 of the SFA), it would not be possible to classify the money that Lew
                    received from the Insider Trade as being the benefits of his criminal conduct,
                    since s 221(2) of the SFA provides that no criminal proceedings can be
                    instituted against him once the court has ordered him to pay a civil penalty
                    under s 232 of the SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Another point raised by Lew was that the
                    quantum of the “benefits of criminal conduct” should be assessed
                    with reference to s 8 of the CDSA, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Assessing benefits derived from
                                criminal conduct</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>8. —(1</b>)    Without prejudice to
                            section 28, for the purposes of this Act —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the benefits derived by any person from
                                criminal conduct, shall be any property or interest therein
                                (including income accruing from such property or interest) held by
                                the person at any time, whether before or after 13th September 1999,
                                being property or interest therein disproportionate to his known
                                sources of income, and the holding of which cannot be explained to
                                the satisfaction of the court; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the value of the benefits derived by him from
                                criminal conduct, shall be the aggregate of the values of the
                                properties and interests therein referred to in paragraph (<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Lew took the position that under s 8 of
                    the CDSA, his benefits from criminal conduct, <em>i.e</em>., the income disproportionate to his known sources of income and
                    which cannot be explained to the court’s satisfaction, were limited to the
                    $27,000 loss that he avoided from the Insider Trade. WBL however maintained that
                    the benefits of Lew’s criminal conduct were the entire $446,773.26 he
                    received from the Insider Trade. Even if the benefits were limited to the
                    $27,000 loss that Lew avoided, WBL argued that an offence under s 44(1) of
                    the CDSA would likewise be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I accept WBL’s submission. Notably,
                    s 44(2) of the CDSA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this section, references to any person’s benefits from criminal
                        conduct include a reference to any property which, <em>in
                            whole or in part</em>, directly or indirectly, represented in his
                        hands his benefits from criminal conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis italicised]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In turn, s 2 of the CDSA defines property as including
                    “money”. It is not disputed that the money received from the
                    Insider Trade was used by Lew to fund the exercise of share options. As such, at
                    least a part of the money which WBL received for the exercise of the share
                    options represented Lew’s benefits from criminal conduct, whether such
                    benefits referred to the entire $446,773.26 proceeds he received or the $27,000
                    loss he avoided. As a result, I find that Lew had used his benefits from
                    criminal conduct to exercise the two share options on 9 July 2007. I would
                    therefore hold that WBL has satisfied the third element of the offence under
                    s 44(1) of the CDSA. Therefore, it would have been illegal for WBL to have
                    allotted and issued its shares to Lew on 9 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Could the illegality have been removed subsequently at some point or
                were there other legal means of performing the ESOS?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As highlighted earlier, however, even if
                    s 44(1) of the CDSA rendered it illegal for WBL to issue shares on
                    9 July 2007, it did not mean that WBL would necessarily be absolved of
                    liability under the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     First, I would highlight that (as Lew pointed
                    out) the CDSA provides an alternative and legal mean for WBL to perform its
                    contractual obligations. Section 44(3) of the CDSA states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)   Where a person discloses to an
                        authorised officer his knowledge or belief that any property, funds or
                        investments are derived from or used in connection with criminal conduct or
                        any matter on which such knowledge or belief is based —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    if he does any
                                act in contravention of subsection (1) and the disclosure relates to
                                the arrangement concerned, he shall not be guilty of an offence
                                under this section if the disclosure is made in accordance with this
                                paragraph, that is —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    it is made before he does the act
                                    concerned, being an act done with the consent of the authorised
                                    officer; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   it is made after he does the act, but is
                                    made on his initiative and as soon as it is reasonable for him
                                    to make it;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the disclosure
                                shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the
                                disclosure of information imposed by law, contract or rules of
                                professional conduct; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    he shall not be liable in damages for any loss arising out of
                                —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    the disclosure; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   any act done or omitted to be done in
                                    relation to the property, funds or investments in consequence of
                                    the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, if WBL had disclosed
                    its knowledge (or reasonable grounds for believing) that the Cheques were
                    derived from the proceeds of Lew’s Insider Trade to the authorised officer
                    and received consent to proceed with the transaction, WBL would have been able
                    to perform its obligations legally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I note that the scope of the CDSA is
                    undoubtedly wide, targeting the proceeds of a wide range of crimes which may be
                    financially motivated. The threshold for triggering the operation of
                    s 44(1) is set at a low level. One needs only to show that he has
                    “reasonable grounds to <em>believe</em>”
                    [emphasis added] that the other party had engaged in or benefited from criminal
                    conduct. However, given the subjective threshold employed by s 44(1) of the
                    CDSA, it would not be difficult for a person to rely on s 44(1) of the CDSA
                    to establish an illegality defence. I pause here to state that I am not at all
                    suggesting that WBL had adopted such a stance here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is clear that s 44 of the CDSA is
                    capable of causing transactions to reach a standstill, where one has reasonable
                    grounds to believe that the counterparty is engaging or has engaged in criminal
                    conduct and that the proceeds of such criminal conduct are involved in the
                    transaction. Parliament was certainly mindful of the need not to adversely
                    affect the operations of financial institutions in Singapore in passing the CDSA
                    (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (6 July 1999) vol 70 at col 1733
                    (Mr Wong Kan Seng, Minister for Home Affairs)). In my view, it was for this
                    reason that companies and institutions were provided with an alternative method,
                    under s 44(3) of the CDSA, to perform their contractual obligations legally
                    even where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the money or property
                    received is tainted. As such, any company or individual that is unable to
                    perform the contractual obligations should make the relevant disclosures to the
                    authorities and seek the requisite consent from those authorities to proceed.
                    Only where no such consent is given by the authorities can it then be said that
                    the performance of the contract is illegal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On the facts of the case, I note that the ESOS
                    deems the share options to be exercised once the notice and remittance has been
                    submitted to WBL (see cl 8(a) of the ESOS (reproduced at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above)). In other words, Lew had validly exercised his share
                    options on 9 July 2007 by submitting the Notices and Cheques. More
                    importantly, under cl 8(b) of the ESOS, while WBL was obliged to allot and issue
                    its shares “as soon as practicable”, this time limitation was
                    subject to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... such <em>consents</em> or other required action
                        of any competent authority under regulations or enactments for the time
                        being in force <em>as may be necessary</em> ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Quite plainly, the ESOS contemplated the situation whereby WBL would
                    need to obtain the consent of any of the authorities before it could issue
                    shares. In my judgment, this obligation extends to seeking the consent of the
                    relevant authorities under s 44(3) of the CDSA. Such consent was plainly
                    necessary in the circumstances of the case for the reasons already explained
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Although a Suspicious Transaction Report was
                    filed by WBL under s 39 of the CDSA on 17 July 2007, there was no
                    evidence that it had sought the consent of any authorities to carry out the
                    issuance of shares at the material time which it could and should have been
                    done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the reasons given above, I find that WBL
                    was in breach of the ESOS in failing to seek the appropriate consents from the
                    relevant authorities to issue the 167,500 WBL shares to Lew at the material
                    time. I would therefore direct WBL to disclose Lew’s exercise of his
                    options to the relevant authorities and to seek their consent to issue him
                    167,500 WBL shares. If WBL does not obtain the requisite consent to issue the
                    shares and hence is unable to do so, it would not be in breach of contract in
                    refusing to issue the shares to Lew. To that extent, it would not be required to
                    issue the 167,500 WBL shares to Lew. I also allow the parties liberty to apply
                    in implementing this order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Lew shall have his costs of the action which
                    are to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.</p>
