The first was for trafficking in not less than 3.56 grams of diamorphine (“the non-capital charge”), and the second was for trafficking in not less than 34.94 grams of diamorphine (“the capital charge”). At the conclusion of the trial the Appellant was convicted on both the charges and the court was informed that the Public Prosecutor had decided not to issue the Appellant with a certificate under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. Accordingly, he was sentenced to suffer the mandatory death penalty for the capital charge. He was also sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for the non-capital charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 We pause to note that the Appellant had chosen to act in person for the appeal, and had discharged the two free legal counsel assigned to him under the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences. At trial, the Appellant had already been assigned, and then discharged, a total of four other free legal counsel. At the hearing before us, the Appellant applied for the same two counsel, who were in attendance, to assist him as McKenzie friends (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, persons present in court to advise and explain things to the Appellant, but not to represent him). We allowed the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After hearing oral arguments from the Appellant and the Prosecution, we reserved judgment. Subsequently, of his own accord, the Appellant submitted three sets of further written submissions dated 3, 23 and 29 May 2017. It is highly unusual for parties to submit unsolicited further submissions after the oral hearing has concluded, and such submissions would generally not be entertained if they were submitted without the court’s leave. Out of an abundance of caution, and being mindful that this was a capital case and the Appellant was acting in person, we exercised our discretion to consider the Appellant’s unsolicited further submissions in arriving at our decision. This should not be taken as a precedent by future appellants acting in person to conduct themselves in a similar fashion as the Appellant has. We emphasise that even in the present circumstances, the Appellant <span class="font-italic">should</span> have sought leave, and this court would have been entitled to wholly disregard the unsolicited further submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Having considered the matter, we have decided to dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The arrest of the Appellant with drugs in his car</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the morning of 7 October 2010 at about 8.45am, the Appellant left his flat at Block 83 Commonwealth Close #12-167 (“the Flat”) and drove his car (“the Car”), bearing licence plate number SJV 4311S, to City Square Mall along Kitchener Road. He parked the Car at City Square Mall’s car park and walked to a coffeeshop at Shing Hotel also along Kitchener Road, where he met one Ahad Bin Salleh (“Ahad”). The Appellant passed Ahad a white envelope containing $3,000 in $10 denominations.

Upon entry, the CNB officers found one Rosli Bin Sukaimi (“Rosli”) inside the bathroom of the Flat, and arrested him. CNB officers searched the Flat. A digital weighing scale belonging to the Appellant was found in the kitchen. A luggage bag was also found in the Appellant’s bedroom, of which he was the sole occupant. The main compartment of the luggage bag was locked by a padlock, which was cut open by CNB officers. (It was later discovered that the padlock matched two keys which were found in the wardrobe drawer of the Appellant’s bedroom, and were capable of unlocking the padlock.) The luggage bag was found to contain three plastic bags, which in turn contained a total of 193 packets of granular substance and which granular substance was, upon subsequent analysis, established to contain not less than 34.94g of diamorphine.

This included the presence of the Appellant’s DNA on the interior and exterior of the plastic bags found in the Car and in the Flat and which contained the drugs, as well as the several drug paraphernalia found in the Flat. The Appellant’s DNA was also found on the heat sealer which had been used to heat-seal the plastic packets containing the drugs found in both the Flat and the Car. The Judge also rejected the Appellant’s allegations that he was framed by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), or that the drugs were planted in the Car and in the Flat by various different people whom he had accused, at different points during the trial, of having done that. The Judge viewed these allegations as “a desperate attempt” by the Appellant to distance himself from the drugs found in the Car and in the Flat (the GD at [43] and [47]–[48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 As the Judge found that the Appellant possessed the drugs in the Car and in the Flat, and having regard to the quantity of the drugs, the Appellant was presumed to have possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking: s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA. The Judge found that the Appellant had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and that, in any event, given the drug paraphernalia found in the Flat, the Judge was satisfied that the Appellant possessed the drugs for the purposes of trafficking even without resorting to the presumption (at [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Appellant was also found by the Judge to be “severely lacking in credibility” in light of the Appellant’s “widespread pattern of extensive internal and external inconsistencies” (the GD<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]).

The Judge held that these four <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies corroborated the “already-strong evidence” against the Appellant, and that he did not require to rely on the lies in the four statements to reach his decision to convict the Appellant on the charges (the GD at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Appellant’s main contentions on appeal were that the drugs were planted by or belonged to others, and that the CNB officers (in particular, the Investigating Officer, Deputy Superintendent Tan Seow Keong (“DSP Tan”)) had framed him by tampering with the evidence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, planting the Appellant’s DNA on the relevant exhibits) in order to cover up two alleged assaults committed against him by the CNB officers. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the Judge was correct to have convicted the Appellant on both the charges in light of the “significant objective scientific evidence.”

He appeared content to rest his case on his claims that the drugs were planted by others and that he was framed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, allegations that negated the element of possession rather than the element of possession for the purposes of trafficking. In any event, there was no indication, nor any assertion, that he possessed, or could have possessed, the drugs for other purposes, such as consumption. Indeed, there was evidence to suggest that the drugs were not for his own consumption: we note that he tested negative for diamorphine use, and that the quantity of drugs found in his possession appeared far greater than the quantity which an individual drug user could have needed for his own consumption.

As described by the Judge in the GD at [29]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This was allegedly done by sending a team of CNB officers to his Flat in Commonwealth while they had his keys on 7 October 2010, while another team of CNB officers escorted him to another flat in Eunos Crescent to “buy time” to plant the luggage bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We note that the Appellant’s version of events (being taken from the City Square Mall car park to Eunos Crescent so that CNB officers could plant the luggage bag in the Flat) was not accepted by the Judge. Instead, the Judge found that the Appellant was taken straight from City Square Mall to the Flat (see GD at [41(c)], [42(b)] and [45]). On the hearing of this appeal before us, it was not entirely clear to us whether the Appellant maintained, on appeal, the position that the CNB officers had planted the drugs in the Flat as his submissions focused on Rosli’s responsibility for the drugs. He also maintained that he was first taken to Eunos Crescent after his arrest at City Square Mall.

</div> In light of the foregoing, the Prosecution suggests that such actions indicate a guilty mind and invited this court to infer that the Appellant knew of the existence of the drugs found in the Car.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Appellant’s explanation for the presence of the drugs in the Car was that the drugs were planted by someone else. However, what is particularly significant is the fact that throughout the trial, he had identified different people as responsible for planting the drugs, and at times retracted his allegations. This shows that the Appellant was firing off baseless accusations as opposed to making allegations which he believed to be true. As recounted by the Judge at [28] of the GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The accused claimed that he suspected that “someone” had planted the ‘Choices’ plastic bag in his car. In his long statement dated 12 October 2010, the accused claimed that he suspected Hashim, someone he met the evening before the date of his arrest, on 6 October 2010, to have planted the controlled drugs in his car. On the fifth day of trial, he suspected that [Woman Staff Sergeant Jenny Woo Yoke Chun] or her colleagues from CNB were the ones who planted the drugs in his car. Later on in the trial, the accused changed his mind and stated that he no longer believed that it was Hashim or CNB officers that planted the drugs. Instead, the accused claimed that it was a “mystery” as to how the drugs appeared in the car, and that some unknown person could have planted the drugs in the car.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Even at the hearing before us, it was not clear what the Appellant’s position was. The Petition of Appeal (which was filed while the Appellant was still represented) stated that “the drugs found in the [C]ar could easily have been planted whilst the Appellant was away from his car meeting his friend, [Ahad]”.

</div> This claim did not seem to be pursued by the Appellant after he discharged his lawyers. We thus need not dwell on it (although, for the avoidance of doubt, we find that it has no merit in any event), and will instead focus on his latest position, which is to be found in his handwritten submissions. There, the Appellant claimed that Rosli and Rosli’s drug trafficking contacts “could be” the ones who planted the drugs in the Appellant’s car, by taking the Appellant’s car key while the Appellant was sleeping at night. In support, the Appellant referred to the DNA found on the swabs of various exhibits recovered from the Car.

His allegation that the rubber band was similar to those used to package the drugs found in the Choices Bag appears to be nothing more than a bare (and desperate) allegation.

</div> This argument seems to us to be creating issues where none exists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We also find the Appellant’s criticism of DSP Tan’s alleged failure to investigate further to be groundless. It is not clear to us what further investigations the Appellant thought DSP Tan should or could have undertaken. He could have meant that DSP Tan should have investigated further to find the person whose DNA matched the DNA of the “unknown person” found on the rubber band. If so, this was a misguided criticism, rooted in a failure to appreciate what the DNA report meant when it indicated that “unknown person[‘s]” DNA was found. This point was usefully explained during the trial by Dr Christopher Syn Kiu-Choong (“Dr Syn”), who had prepared the relevant reports. According to Dr Syn, a marking of a DNA finding as that of an “unknown person” meant that it would <span class="font-italic">not </span>be possible to match this DNA finding, <span class="font-italic">even if a reference was provided</span>.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Be that as it may, we are unable to accept the Appellant’s assertion that the drugs were planted by Rosli and his drug trafficking contacts. We do not see how this assertion can explain away the fact that the plastic packets of drugs were heat-sealed by a heat-sealer that contained the Appellant’s DNA, and which was found locked inside the luggage bag in the Flat. While another person (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>“unknown male 2”) could have had contact with the drugs, that possibility is neither here nor there. It only indicates that another person was involved in that packet but that can in no way raise reasonable doubts about the Appellant’s knowledge of the existence of the drugs found in his car, given the existence of his DNA found on some of the packets. Indeed, it is not unusual for multiple people to handle drugs (or the packaging of the drugs) at various stages of their manufacture, packing, transportation and distribution, and different people may or may not leave traces of their DNA behind. The relevant question is whether the Appellant was one of those people, and not whether others may at some point have been involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 We accordingly agree with the Judge that the Appellant had actual knowledge of the drugs found in the Car. It is thus unnecessary to rely on the presumption under s 21 of the MDA to prove that the appellant had possession of the drugs in the Car. Had it been necessary to apply s 21 of the MDA, we would have found that the presumption of possession under that provision has not been rebutted by the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to make one concluding observation on the interaction between the various presumptions under the MDA. As this court held in <span class="font-italic">Tang</span> at [18]–[19], in order to make out the elements of possession and trafficking, the court may <span class="font-italic">either</span> prove actual possession and then rely on the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, <span class="font-italic">or</span> rely on the presumption of possession under s 18 of the MDA and then positively prove trafficking. The two presumptions <span class="font-italic">cannot be combined</span>. The same reasoning that applies to the presumption of possession under s 18 of the MDA also applies to the presumption of possession under s 21. Thus, if the Judge had relied on the presumption under s 21, it would have been an error for him to combine that with reliance on the presumption under s 17 (specifically, s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Despite having some initial concern that the Judge may have erroneously combined the two presumptions, we are of the view, having examined the GD more closely, that the Judge did not in substance do so. Although the Judge did refer to the Appellant’s failure to rebut <span class="font-italic">both</span> presumptions in [47] and [49] of the GD, it is clear from the same paragraphs that the Judge also found as a matter of fact that possession as well as trafficking had been <span class="font-italic">positively proven</span> on the evidence before him. Effectively, the Judge decided the case (rightly, in our view) on the basis that both elements had been positively proven, and referred to the presumptions more for the sake of completeness. In general, however, it would be advisable for the sake of clarity to set out expressly and distinctly which elements had been positively proven and which had been satisfied by recourse to a statutory presumption.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the result, we concur with the finding of the Judge that the evidence against the Appellant established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant had actual possession of the drugs found in the Flat and in the Car. Accordingly, we need not delve into the issue of the Appellant’s possible <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies, which were in any event merely supplementary and not a necessary part of the Judge’s decision to convict the Appellant (as noted above at [13]). We proceed now to examine specifically the Appellant’s allegation that the drugs in the car and in the Flat were planted by others as well as his assertion that the DNA evidence against him was tampered with by others.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Appellant’s allegation that he had been framed, through the planting of the drugs and tampering of the evidence, raised any reasonable doubts about his convictions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The CNB officer’s alleged motives for tampering with the evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 According to the Appellant, the CNB officers planted the drugs in the Flat and tampered with the DNA evidence against him in order to hide two “aggravated assaults” which they had committed on him on the day of his arrest.

During that short journey the Appellant was asked where his car key was, to which he responded with a vulgarity.

</div> This left some ambiguity as to what “mild tenderness” meant, but unfortunately the doctor who examined the Appellant was not called to give evidence. In oral arguments before us, the Prosecution suggested that the statement of “mild tenderness” could be a result of self-reporting by the Appellant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “when the doctor examines [the Appellant], [he] says it is pain[ful] when the area is touched”.

</div> to frame him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 We would also wish to make these further observations on the alleged motivation of the CNB in wanting to frame the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 First, even if we assume for the sake of argument that the assaults took place and the Appellant wanted to cover up those assaults, it is difficult to understand how framing the Appellant with either or both of the two charges would help in covering up the assaults. Indeed, by framing the Appellant, the CNB officers would be laying the groundwork for the Appellant to be prosecuted in court, and in turn the Appellant would be sure to raise these assaults with the trial judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Further, it will be recalled that the Appellant had alleged (at least at trial, if not also before this court) that the CNB officers had planted the drugs in the Flat (see above at [29]–[30]). The planting of drugs in the Flat would raise the stakes insofar as it set the stage for a <span class="font-italic">capital </span>charge to be proceeded with against the Appellant. This was bound to invite further scrutiny into the acts of CNB officers, and was not something that CNB officers would do if all that they wanted was to cover up the alleged assaults.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Furthermore, the sequence of events also casts doubts on the Appellant’s allegations: on the Appellant’s case, the second alleged assault took place while he and the CNB officers had already come into the Flat. On his account of the events, the Appellant was saying that the planting of the incriminating evidence against him by CNB officers was done before he was brought to the Flat. So such planting of the incriminating evidence in the Flat could not have been motivated by the second assault which allegedly took place later at the Flat.  The assertion as regards the alleged second assault is thus flawed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Moreover, the time lapse between the moment the Appellant was arrested up to the time he was brought back to the Flat was just a matter of a few hours. As mentioned above at [23], several things in the Flat relating to drug trafficking had his DNA, including some of those things in the locked main compartment of the luggage bag. It defies common sense and logic that CNB officers who were on standby and tailing him, presumably following a tip-off, would plan to “fix him up” even before knowing whether he would be cooperative or otherwise. It would have made no sense for them to have wanted to undermine the propriety or legality of their own actions. Equally importantly, there is nothing to suggest that any of the CNB officers had any cause to want to frame or fix him. Thus, in our judgment, the alleged assaults were very implausible sources of motivation for the alleged planting of drugs and tampering of evidence. The incoherence of the Appellant’s allegations suggest that it is far more likely that neither the planting of the drugs, nor the alleged assaults occurred. We draw a similar conclusion with regard to the claim regarding tampering with the DNA evidence. We would only add this. It is likely that based on what the CNB officers said, what transpired was not that the Appellant was assaulted, but that the Appellant’s aggressive behaviour towards the officers required him to be restrained. The overall picture that emerges – based not on only on the CNB officers’ testimony, but also the Appellant’s own statements that he was uncooperative and used vulgarities on the CNB officers – is that the Appellant was trying to be difficult and might even have been hoping to cause an altercation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61  In any case, the evidence given by the CNB officers was not consistent with that of men who were trying to frame the Appellant and cover up the alleged assaults. It will be recalled that SSI Heng candidly admitted that he could not confirm that the white bundle that he saw the Appellant carrying was in fact the Choices Bag (see above at [36]). DSP Tan and other CNB officers also accepted that the Appellant had fallen in the Flat (see above at [53]). Further, there was no attempt to prevent or delay the medical examination of the Appellant (which occurred only two days after his arrest), even though this would have uncovered any significant injury which the Appellant would have suffered had he been physically attacked.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In sum, we are not persuaded that the CNB officers were motivated to frame the Appellant. We note as well that the Judge also found the Appellant not to be a credible witness at all. Nevertheless, we shall proceed to examine the precise allegations of tampering of evidence that the Appellant has raised.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Allegations of evidence-tampering by the CNB officers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Appellant alleged that DSP Tan and other CNB officers (and at times with the assistance or at least acquiescence of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”))

The Appellant submits before us that “any one of [DSP Tan’s] contamination exactly contain the number nine, each and every one of them”.

</div> In other words, the number nine and its permutations were – according to the Appellant – a sort of calling card left by the CNB officers to mark their handiwork. This notion was referred to by the Judge as the Number Nine Theory (see GD at [27]), and we will adopt the same terminology.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 We wish to state that the Number Nine Theory is absurd on its face, runs counter to common sense, and could justifiably be rejected out of hand. It relies on arbitrary and inconsistent methods of manipulating the characters used to mark the exhibits in order to arrive at the number nine. Moreover, if indeed the CNB officers had tampered with the evidence, the last thing they would have wished to do would have been to mark the exhibits in a manner which would point to a pattern of tampering. Despite these obvious weaknesses, we consider that given the great lengths to which the Appellant went in advancing his argument, it may be worth analysing the Number Nine Theory in greater depth in order to dispel all doubt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As a starting point, we acknowledge that if it could be shown that the incriminating exhibits were all consistently marked in a certain manner which was unusual and departed from the usual practice of the CNB, and if no explanation was forthcoming, that might raise serious concerns. However, upon close scrutiny, we find the Number Nine Theory to be nothing more than a fanciful theory that was haphazardly constituted by applying different methods of calculation for different exhibits, with the sole aim of contriving to arrive at the number nine. The whole theory is baseless. We shall elaborate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70  According to the Appellant, there were “exactly nine exhibits” with the Appellant’s DNA on them.

</div> We understand this to mean that the Appellant considered these three exhibits to be of the same series because “D1” appears in the markings of all three exhibits. Yet if this is the rationale, many other exhibits should have been included in this calculation too, such as  the exhibits marked “B1E1D1”, “B1E4D1”, “B1E5D1”, “B1E6D1” and “B1D1”.

</div> Thus, we could find no good reason why the three exhibits selected by the Appellant could be considered of the same series.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In addition, the method of calculation used for these three exhibits was also inconsistent with prior methods. Unlike the method of calculation for the nine exhibits, the method of calculation here did not add up the quantity of exhibits. As compared to the method of calculation for B1E2F1, which also added up the values (and values assigned to the letters) of the exhibit’s marking, there were at least three inconsistencies. First, as mentioned, the values from the markings of different exhibits were now calculated together, instead of considering only one exhibit’s marking at a time. Second, when calculating the values for B1E2D1 and B1E3D1, the Appellant added the values for all six characters, despite only adding the values for the last three characters for B1E2F1. Third, this method of calculation involved a new step of adding the constituent numbers of the final sum (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 3 + 6) to arrive at nine, instead of just settling on the final sum (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 36). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The foregoing analysis clearly shows that the Number Nine Theory is either a consciously contrived excuse or – if the Appellant truly believes in its accuracy – a mere figment of his overactive imagination. In either case, the Number Nine Theory serves only to create an appearance of suspicion and/or doubt where none, in fact, exists. There was no uniformity in the way the Appellant analysed the characters used to mark the exhibits. His analysis was merely a discordant patchwork of calculation methods that strained to arrive at the figure nine. We accordingly do not consider the Number Nine Theory to have raised any reasonable doubt, or any doubt at all, about the Appellant’s convictions. To put it mildly, it is a fanciful conspiracy theory concocted to support his unfounded assertion that the CNB officers were intent on framing him for an offence he had no part in.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The alleged missing statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 At the oral hearing before us, the Appellant placed particular emphasis on the allegation that there was a long statement of his that was concealed by DSP Tan (although the Appellant did maintain that all the statements he had made were important). This alleged missing long statement was said to be important for the Appellant because he claimed to have said in that statement that when he left his flat on that fateful morning, the luggage bag was not at the position in which it was eventually found.

It was clear to us that the Interpreter herself was unsure of her answer in the passage cited above, for she had begun her answer with “I can’t really remember”. In addition, we note that the question of “how many lines were cancelled” was a matter of fine detail. The Interpreter could not have been expected, in a matter such as this, to recall with clarity when close to four years had elapsed since the event. In the nature of her job, undertaking such interpreting work would be routine. This was corroborated by the Interpreter’s own evidence, which she subsequently gave when recalled to the stand to clarify her evidence. She testified as follows:

</div> No basis was provided for this allegation, and we are unable to give it any credit. We would emphasise that there is no suggestion that something unusual had occurred on those two occasions when the Interpreter was involved in the recording which would have made her remember the happenings on those two days. Common experience will tell us that that the inability to remember things which are routine is completely mundane and banal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In addition, looking at the matter more broadly, it is hard to understand why the CNB officers would conceal the allegedly missing long statement. It is quite clear that the four long statements adduced in evidence are “negative statements”, in that the Appellant denied guilt in these long statements. The Appellant’s denials were dutifully recorded by the CNB officers in all four long statements (as well as in the two cautioned statements). Having done so, it was inconceivable that the CNB officers would conceal that particular long statement as alleged by the Appellant, just to suppress one particular denial regarding the luggage bag. It is senseless. We are satisfied that, like the Number Nine Theory, this alleged missing long statement is a desperate attempt to cast any possible doubt, however fanciful, on the way the CNB officers carried out their work. There was simply no basis to allege that the officers did suppress or would have wanted to suppress any of the information contained in the Appellant’s statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Accordingly, this allegation of the Appellant also does not raise any reasonable doubts as to the Appellant’s conviction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other allegations of evidence-tampering</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Appellant has also made numerous other allegations of evidence-tampering.

The Judge, too, was accused of intimidating the Appellant (although the Appellant stopped short of asserting that the Judge was an actual member of the conspiracy), when all the Judge had done was ask a prisons officer present in the courtroom about what disciplinary measures could be used to deter the Appellant from persistently misbehaving himself during the trial.

</div> The Appellant would have this court believe that <span class="font-italic">all</span> these men and women, whether related to CNB or not, somehow agreed to frame the Appellant in a <span class="font-italic">capital case</span> just to suppress two alleged assaults committed by CNB officers in which the Appellant allegedly suffered “mild tenderness”.

The Appellant’s entire defence consisted of scurrilous accusations and wild, irrational, and unfounded theories which appeared to have been calculated to raise illusory doubts. It is of interest to note that in the Appellant’s written submissions for this appeal (which were prepared by his lawyer, Mr Amolat Singh, before he was discharged and re-appointed as a McKenzie friend as noted at [2] above), in a passage seeking to explain the Appellant’s inconsistent evidence as to who could have planted the drugs to frame him, it is stated that “[the Appellant’s] guess as to who might have planted the drugs necessarily entails a great degree of speculation on his part”.

Given that (in the absence of a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor) the death penalty is mandatory for the capital charge, we are satisfied that it was correctly ordered. This renders the appeal against the sentence on the non-capital charge academic. In any event, we also find no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed for that charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 We therefore dismiss the appeal in its entirety.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In closing, we wish to record our appreciation for the efforts of the various lawyers who served as the Appellant’s McKenzie friends and appointed counsel at trial and in the appeal before us.
