        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellants (“the Appellants”)
                    are a group of 21 investors in derivative credit-linked notes called “DBS
                    High Notes 5” (“the HN5”) which were issued by the
                    respondent, DBS Bank Ltd (“the Respondent”). In Originating
                    Summons No 774 of 2009 (“the OS”), they brought proceedings
                    against the Respondent, on behalf of themselves as well as 192 other plaintiffs
                    listed in the Schedule to the OS (“the 192 other plaintiffs”), for
                    the refund of the entire capital sum which they and the 192 other plaintiffs had
                    lost in investing in the HN5 (less the amount of interest received thereon)
                    consequent upon the bankruptcy on 15 September 2008 of Lehman Brothers
                    Holdings Inc (“Lehman”), one of the reference entities to which
                    the HN5 were linked. The High Court judge (“the Judge”) dismissed
                    the Appellants’ action (see <em>Soon Kok Tiang and others v
                        DBS Bank Ltd and another matter</em> [2011] 2 SLR 716
                    (“the HC Judgment”)). The Appellants then brought the present
                    appeal. We should mention, as a preliminary point, that prior to the hearing of
                    this appeal, two of the 192 other plaintiffs withdrew from the appeal. The
                    Appellants accordingly applied to this court (via Summons No 2274 of 2011)
                    for leave to amend the OS by deleting the names of those two plaintiffs from the
                    Schedule to the OS. We allowed the application (which the Respondent consented
                    to) with costs to the Respondent fixed at $300.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The launch of the HN5</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The material facts as pleaded by the parties are
                    not in dispute. The Respondent launched the sale of the HN5 on 30 March
                    2007 in two tranches, one in Singapore dollars (“the SGD Tranche”)
                    and one in US dollars (“the USD Tranche”). The Respondent’s
                    offer of the HN5 was expressed to be made on the basis of the information
                    contained in a 93-page pricing statement dated 29 March 2007 (“the
                    Pricing Statement”) and a 168-page base prospectus dated 22 December
                    2005 as amended by a supplementary base prospectus dated 5 April 2006
                    (collectively referred to hereafter as “the Base Prospectus”).
                    These documents set out in great detail, <em>inter
                        alia</em>: (a) the terms and conditions applicable to the HN5;
                    (b) the manner in which the Respondent and its related entity,
                    Constellation Investments Ltd (“Constellation”), would use the
                    funds of purchasers of the HN5 (“HN5 holders”); and (c) the
                    risks involved in investing in the HN5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The sale of the HN5 was effected by the
                    Respondent accepting applications made by prospective HN5 holders on prescribed
                    application forms (“Application Forms”). Each Application Form
                    contained an acknowledgement by the prospective HN5 holder that he:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     “agreed [to] the Terms and
                        Conditions on the reverse of this form and the Terms and Conditions set out
                        in … [the] Pricing Statement”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     “ha[d] assessed [the]
                        suitability of the product against [his] risk attitude, financial means, and
                        investment objectives”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the time the
                    HN5 were marketed, it was not possible to assess the probability of default by
                    any of the reference entities to which the HN5 were linked, except on the basis
                    (since discredited) of the credit ratings given to them by the credit rating
                    agencies relied on by the Respondent, <em>viz</em>,
                    Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The nature and structure of the HN5</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Pricing Statement described the HN5 as
                    “structured notes”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and warned
                    prospective HN5 holders that “if a Credit Event [as defined at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> below] … occur[red] before the Maturity
                    Date [<em>viz</em>, 16 November 2012], [they might]
                    lose their entire investment and [might] not receive any principal amount on the
                        [HN5]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original
                    omitted]. The circumstances in which and the reasons why this might happen were
                    not clarified or explained. Prospective HN5 holders were also warned that the
                    purchase of the HN5 involved certain risks, and that they should:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… ensure that they understand the nature of the [HN5] and should
                        carefully study the matters set out in the Base Prospectus (and in
                        particular, the section on “Risk Factors” in the Base
                        Prospectus) and the contents of [the] Pricing Statement (and in particular,
                        the section on “Risk Factors” in [the] Pricing Statement)
                        before they invest in the [HN5]. [emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Pricing Statement described the HN5 as
                    “5.5-year structured credit notes designed for investors seeking enhanced
                    yield by providing exposure to a first-to-default basket of geographically
                    diversified investment grade credits”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The credit basket
                    (“the HN5 credit basket”) consisted of seven banks and one
                    sovereign entity as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">These eight reference entities (collectively, “the Reference
                    Entities”) were stated to have been selected with the following
                        objectives:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    reducing the likelihood of a Credit Event by
                            choosing only investment grade credits;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  reducing mark-to-market risk by selecting highly
                            rated [r]eference [e]ntities, as investment grade rated credits
                            typically tend to be more stable, compared to sub-investment grade
                            credits;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  enhancing the basket yield by selecting higher
                            yielding reference obligations (by choosing less senior debts,
                            especially for banks/investment banks) of these highly rated [r]eference
                            [e]ntities; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iv)  reducing liquidity risk by selecting [r]eference
                            [e]ntities whose debt securities are among the more commonly traded in
                            the credit market as opposed to choosing higher rated [r]eference
                            [e]ntities whose debt securities are less liquid and do not trade
                            commonly thereby resulting in wider bid/offer spreads.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The HN5 were structured such that the Respondent
                    would use the funds raised from the sale of the HN5 to purchase two structured
                    notes issued by Constellation, a special purpose Cayman Islands trust company
                    established by the Respondent in 2003. These two structured notes (collectively,
                    “the Reference Notes”) were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Structured Retail Notes
                        Series 75 (“SRN Series 75”) <em>vis-à-vis</em> the SGD Tranche of the HN5; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Structured Retail Notes Series 76
                        (“SRN Series 76”) <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                        the USD Tranche.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Pricing Statement explained
                    Constellation’s role and the function of the Reference Notes as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Constellation is a special purpose trust company established by [the
                        Respondent] in 2003. It is owned by a charitable trust and incorporated
                        under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Its primary objective is the issuing
                        of various credit-linked and other structured notes to both retail and
                        institutional investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Constellation uses the funds raised in issuing notes to invest in high
                        quality bonds or structured securities with a rating of AA or better (as
                        rated by Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch) to secure its
                        obligations under its notes and enters into derivative contracts with [the
                        Respondent] in order to generate the relatively high yields under its notes.
                        Constellation has issued 70 different structured notes to investors in Hong
                        Kong over the past 4 years under its US$5,000,000,000 Limited Recourse
                        Structured Note Programme (the Constellation Programme). To date, no credit
                        event has occurred in respect of any of its issuances and all interest
                        payments under its notes have been paid in full to investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The proceeds of the [HN5] will be used to purchase … the Reference
                        Notes … to be issued by Constellation under the Constellation
                        Programme. The performance of the [HN5] is directly linked to the Reference
                        Notes. Therefore, in addition to the Reference Entities [as defined at
                            <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above], the [HN5 holder] is
                        exposed to the credit risk of Constellation in relation to the Reference
                        Notes, in particular, to the high quality bonds or structured securities
                        purchased by Constellation to secure its obligations under the Reference
                        Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It should be noted that although the Pricing
                    Statement stated that Constellation would use the funds raised from the issue of
                    the Reference Notes (“the Reference Notes funds”) to invest in
                    “high quality bonds or structured securities with a rating of AA or
                    better (as rated by Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s or
                        Fitch)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> to secure its obligations
                    under the Reference Notes, it did not say that those funds would be used to
                    purchase, specifically, what we will hereafter term “the Reference
                    Obligations” (<em>ie</em>, the bonds or structured
                    securities issued by the Reference Entities as set out in Appendix D of the
                    Pricing Statement), all of which were rated lower than “AA” (or
                    the equivalent). The Pricing Statement also did not explain what bearing
                    Constellation’s investments would have on the risks undertaken by HN5
                    holders. To date, the Appellants have no knowledge of the identity of the actual
                    high-quality bonds and/or structured securities purchased by Constellation to
                    secure its obligations under the Reference Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Pricing Statement stated that HN5 holders
                    would receive:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     quarterly interest of 5% per annum
                        and 6.5% per annum for, respectively, the SGD Tranche and the USD Tranche of
                        the HN5 until 16 November 2012, which was the scheduled maturity date
                        of the HN5 (“the Maturity Date”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     on the Maturity Date, 100% of the

                    <em>ie</em>, an event of default in respect of any of the
                    Reference Entities – occurred prior to the Maturity Date. If a Credit
                    Event occurred, the Reference Notes (which were stated to be linked to the
                    performance of the Reference Entities) would terminate, and would also cause the
                    HN5 to terminate. HN5 holders would then receive an amount equivalent to what
                    the Respondent would receive as the “Credit Event Redemption
                    Amount” (“CERA”) under the Reference Notes. This was
                    explained in the Pricing Statement as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a Credit Event (e.g. a default on existing debt) in relation to a
                        [r]eference [e]ntity occurs under the Reference Notes, the Reference Notes
                        will terminate. Consequentially, the [HN5] will also terminate and investors
                        in the [HN5] will receive a SGD amount (in relation to the SGD Tranche
                        Notes) or USD amount (in relation to the USD Tranche Notes) equivalent to
                        what the [Respondent] will receive as the [CERA] under the Reference
                        Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Pricing Statement stated that the Respondent, as the calculation
                    agent under both the Reference Notes and the HN5 (“the Calculation
                    Agent”), “ha[d] the sole discretion to determine whether a Credit
                    Event ha[d] occurred in relation to any [r]eference

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Pricing Statement highlighted that the
                    termination of the HN5 upon the occurrence of a Credit Event was on a
                        “first-to-default”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> basis, <em>ie</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The HN5] are linked to the Reference Notes and, in turn, the credit of

                        “first-to-default” basis. This means that the Credit Event
                        that triggers the credit linked redemption of the Reference Notes is the
                        first default of any of the Reference Entities under the Reference
                        Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As for what would constitute a Credit Event,
                    this was defined in Appendix D of the Pricing Statement as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, “Failure to Pay” was defined as the
                    failure of a reference entity to pay any amounts due under (<em>inter alia</em>) the Reference Obligation associated with it as
                    specified in Appendix D of the Pricing Statement. In Lehman’s case,
                    the relevant Reference Obligation consisted of US$1.25bn worth of 5.75%
                    subordinated notes due on 1 March 2017 (ISIN Code:

                    Note”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Features of the HN5</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The HN5 were credit-linked notes and not
                    asset-linked notes, and were a novel financial product in Singapore’s
                    financial market at the time they were launched. From the foregoing survey of
                    their nature and structure, the following features can be seen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     First, the HN5 had some features of an
                    ordinary bond, but they were not bonds as HN5 holders, apart from being exposed
                    to the credit risk of the Reference Entities, were also exposed to the credit
                    risk of Constellation and that of the issuer(s) of the high-quality bonds and/or
                    structured securities purchased by Constellation to secure its obligations under
                    the Reference Notes. As stated in the Pricing Statement:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The performance of the [HN5] is directly linked to the Reference Notes.
                        Therefore, in addition to the Reference Entities, the [HN5 holder] is
                        exposed to the credit risk of Constellation in relation to the Reference
                        Notes, in particular, to the high quality bonds or structured securities
                        purchased by Constellation to secure its obligations under the Reference
                        Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition, HN5 holders were exposed to the credit risk of the
                    Respondent, foreign exchange rate risks, liquidity risks and general market
                    fluctuations. <em>Vis-à-vis</em>, specifically, the risk of
                    default by one or more of the Reference Entities (<em>ie</em>, the risk of a Credit Event occurring), it would appear, at
                    the time the HN5 were launched, that this risk was not likely to materialise,
                    having regard to the high credit ratings given to the Reference Entities (we
                    note in particular that at that time, Lehman had a credit rating of
                    “A+” from Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch, and a credit
                    rating of “A1” from Moody’s).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Pricing
                    Statement also stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Constellation has issued 70 different structured notes … over the
                        past 4 years [<em>ie</em>, since 2003] under its
                        US$5,000,000,000 Limited Recourse Structured Note Programme … To
                        date, no credit event has occurred in respect of any of its issuances and
                        all interest payments under its notes have been paid in full to
                        investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Again, this would give the impression that it was unlikely that a
                    Credit Event would occur <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Reference
                    Notes, to which the performance of the HN5 was directly linked. The Pricing
                    Statement nonetheless warned prospective HN5 holders that the credit ratings
                    assigned by credit rating agencies might not fully reflect the true risks of
                    investing in the HN5. In comparison, the Respondent assumed no risk in the event
                    of a Credit Event occurring (and, consequently, the HN5 terminating before the
                    Maturity Date) as the Pricing Statement expressly stated (at pp 2, 4 and
                        14)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> that the Respondent’s
                    liability under the HN5 in that event was only to pay to HN5 holders what it
                    would receive from Constellation as the CERA under the Reference
                Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Second, the components for calculating the
                    CERA were such that if a Credit Event occurred, there was a high likelihood that
                    HN5 holders would receive a zero payout under the HN5 because there was an
                    equally high likelihood that the Respondent would receive a zero payout from
                    Constellation under the Reference Notes. In fact, as it turned out, the
                    computation of the CERA to be paid upon Lehman’s bankruptcy (the Credit
                    Event in the present case) actually yielded a negative figure. In practical
                    terms, this translated into a zero payout for HN5 holders since their losses
                    were limited to the principal amount which they had invested in the HN5. Thus,
                    stripped to their bare essentials, the HN5 were in substance a bet or wager (in
                    legal jargon) that no Credit Event would occur during the 5.5-year tenure of
                    these notes: if HN5 holders “won” this bet, they could potentially
                    receive at the end of the 5.5-year period an aggregate return of 27.5% and
                    35.75% on, respectively, the SGD Tranche and the USD Tranche. In reality, the
                    HN5 were a bet dressed up and marketed as an
                “investment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Third, the explanation given at p 1 of
                    the Pricing Statement for selecting eight reference entities (<em>viz</em>, the Reference Entities) to make up the HN5 credit basket
                    – namely, to (<em>inter alia</em>) “reduc[e]
                    the likelihood of a Credit Event”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) – could give an unwary HN5 holder
                    a false sense of security that the risk of a Credit Event occurring was low. It
                    was only at p 9 of the Pricing Statement that the aforesaid explanation was
                    qualified by the statement that “all else being equal, the greater the
                    number of [r]eference [e]ntities in the [HN5] credit basket, the riskier the
                    [HN5] are”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In this connection, we note that
                    before both the Judge and this court, the Appellants did indeed labour under the
                    misapprehension that having eight reference entities in the HN5 credit basket
                    would provide diversification benefits. This was evidenced by their argument
                    that they should not have lost their entire investment in the HN5 as Lehman was
                    only one of eight reference entities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The collapse of Lehman</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, the HN5 were launched on 30 March 2007.
                    Altogether, the Respondent accepted 1,127 applications for the HN5, totalling
                    S$91.915m for the SGD Tranche and US$7.93m for the USD Tranche. The HN5 were
                    issued on 16 May 2007. Between 16 August 2007 and 18 August 2008,
                    the Appellants received five payments of quarterly interest, amounting to
                    S$128,303.27 for the SGD Tranche and US$22,741.07 for the USD
                Tranche.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Unfortunately for HN5 holders, on
                    15 September 2008, Lehman became the first reference entity in the HN5
                    credit basket to default (“the Defaulted Reference Entity”) when
                    it filed a voluntary petition under ch 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code
                    (Title 11, USC). By a Credit Event notice dated 17 September 2008, the
                    Respondent informed HN5 holders of the occurrence of this Credit Event and the
                    termination of the HN5. Subsequently, by a letter dated 28 October 2008,
                    the Respondent informed HN5 holders that the CERA under the Reference Notes was
                    zero and, thus, the CERA under the HN5 would likewise be zero. The letter was
                    accompanied by an appendix explaining how the CERA under the Reference Notes was
                    calculated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Respondent also issued a public statement
                    on 27 October 2008 setting out a list of questions and answers in relation
                    to the Credit Event triggered by Lehman’s bankruptcy (“the
                    FAQs”) (see
                    &lt;http://www.dbs.com/dbsgroup/announcements/Pages/20081028HN5_Final_Valuation_Issuer_FAQ.pdf&gt;
                    (accessed 31 October 2011)). It is pertinent to note the answer to the
                    question as to why the CERA under the Reference Notes (and, in turn, the CERA
                    under the HN5) was zero:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    What was the major contributing factor to the
                            substantial reduction or the reduction to zero of the
                        [CERA]?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The major factor that contributed to the substantial reduction or the
                        reduction to zero of the [CERA] was the substantial <em>notional loss</em> on the [R]eference [O]bligation of Lehman
                            [<em>ie</em>, the Lehman Note] … resulting
                        from the substantial drop in the price of such [R]eference [O]bligation. The
                        bankruptcy of Lehman … has caused the [Lehman Note] to trade at
                        values close to zero.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It should be mentioned that although the FAQs
                    stated that the CERA was zero because of the “notional loss” on
                    the Lehman Note, the Pricing Statement did not expressly highlight that the link
                    between the CERA and the Defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation
                    was “notional”. This fact becomes clear only upon a close analysis
                    of the terms of the Pricing Statement. For the purposes of calculating the CERA
                    to be paid upon the occurrence of a Credit Event, any loss sustained on the
                    Defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation might only be a notional
                    loss as the Pricing Statement did not require Constellation to use the Reference
                    Notes funds to purchase that particular Reference Obligation or, for that
                    matter, any of the Reference Obligations, and, thus, Constellation would not
                    have suffered any loss if it had not invested the Reference Notes funds in the
                    Defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation, whose value would have
                    fallen upon the Defaulted Reference Entity’s default. In other words, the
                    HN5 were structured such that it was not necessary for Constellation to have
                    suffered any <em>actual</em> loss on the Defaulted
                    Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation before a Credit Event could occur.
                    All that was necessary was for one of the Reference Entities (by definition, the
                    Defaulted Reference Entity) to (<em>inter alia</em>)
                    default in paying any amount due under the Reference Obligation associated with
                    it, which Reference Obligation might not even form part of Constellation’s
                    actual investment portfolio. In this connection, we note that it is not known
                    whether Constellation had in fact invested the Reference Notes funds in the
                    Lehman Note (the Defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation in the
                    present case).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the light of the terms and conditions of
                    the contract governing the HN5 (“the HN5 contract”), the
                    Appellants had little or no legal basis to argue that they were entitled to
                    receive anything other than (as will be seen) a zero payment from the Respondent
                    when the Credit Event triggered by Lehman’s bankruptcy occurred. They
                    could not claim that they were not bound by the terms and conditions of the HN5
                    contract since (as mentioned at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above)
                    they had expressly agreed to those terms and conditions in the Application Forms
                    which they submitted to the Respondent. They also could not rely on the usual
                    vitiating factors in contract law, such as fraud, mistake, misrepresentation,
                        <em>non est factum</em>, <em>etc</em>. In particular, the Appellants could not claim that they did
                    not understand the true risks of investing in the HN5 as they had acknowledged
                    in their Application Forms that they “ha[d] assessed [the] suitability of
                    the product against [their] risk attitude[s], financial means, and investment
                        objectives”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Appellants then discovered, probably to
                    their surprise, that the Pricing Statement contained four different descriptions
                    of the CERA (“CERA Descriptions”), which they interpreted to be
                    inconsistent and irreconcilable with one another (and in the case of the fourth
                    description, manifestly inconsistent with the third). This interpretation, if
                    correct, would lead to different CERA payouts under the HN5, depending on which
                    CERA Description was applied. Armed with this discovery, the Appellants
                    commenced the OS against the Respondent for, in the main: (a) a declaration
                    that the HN5 were void; and (b) a consequential order that the Respondent
                    pay to each of them (as well as to each of the 192 other plaintiffs), <em>inter alia</em>, the principal amount invested in the HN5.
                    The Appellants’ basis for seeking these reliefs was that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he terms and conditions governing the [HN5] were uncertain
                        when it came to the calculation of the CERA. The uncertainty arose because
                        the [Pricing Statement] contained 4 possible formulae for calculating the
                        CERA which were different, inconsistent and irreconcilable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above, the Judge dismissed the OS. The Appellants then
                    brought the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The four CERA Descriptions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Before we proceed to analyse the Judge’s
                    reasons for dismissing the Appellants’ claim, we will first set out the
                    four different CERA Descriptions in the Pricing Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The first CERA Description, which appears at
                    p 2 of the Pricing Statement, reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [CERA] under the Reference Notes will be <em>based

                        Entity’s Reference Obligation less Charged Asset Adjustment Amount and
                        less Hedging Costs. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this connection:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     “Charged Asset Adjustment
                        Amount” is defined at p 14 of the Pricing Statement as
                        “the shortfall of the market value of the Charged Assets over the
                        Principal Amount of the Charged Assets”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> (the

                        Constellation in terminating, adjusting or re-establishing etc the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second CERA Description, which is at
                    p 4 of the Pricing Statement, provides as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [CERA] is <em>in summary</em> the amount

                        Reference Notes less the amount of loss suffered on the Reference Obligation
                        of the Defaulted Reference Entity less any depreciation of the market value
                        of the collateral [<em>ie</em>, the Charged Assets] and

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before the Judge and his decision thereon </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The issues raised by the parties and dealt
                    with by the Judge in the court below can be summarised into two main issues. The
                    first concerned the terms and conditions of the HN5 contract. The second was
                    whether the four CERA Descriptions were different, inconsistent or
                    irreconcilable, or otherwise unworkable such that they rendered the HN5 contract
                    void for uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With respect to the first main issue, the
                    Judge held that the HN5 contract was governed by “the terms and
                    conditions set out on the reverse side of the Application Form and <em>the entirety</em> of the … Pricing Statement,
                    including but not limited to the section of the Pricing Statement entitled
                    ‘Terms and Conditions of the Notes’ and Appendix A”
                    [emphasis added] (see [36] of the HC
                    Judgment). The Respondent has not appealed against this finding, even though it
                    is contrary to its argument in the court below that the terms and conditions of
                    the HN5 contract consisted of only the terms and conditions on the back of the
                    Application Form and <em>certain portions</em> of the
                    Pricing Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     With respect to the second main issue, the
                    Judge rejected the Appellants’ contention that the CERA could not be
                    ascertained due to the four inconsistent CERA Descriptions present in the
                    Pricing Statement, and that the HN5 contract was thus void for uncertainty. His
                    reasons for so ruling are set out in the HC Judgment as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    The
                            [Appellants’] position in relation to the first three CERA
                            Descriptions is as follows. It is evident … that all three
                            formulae require the deduction of the CAAA and HC. Nevertheless, the
                            three are inconsistent because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    The [f]irst and [s]econd CERA Descriptions can
                                only be consistent if the prevailing market price of the Lehman Note
                                is always equal to the nominal value of the Reference Notes less the
                                loss suffered on the Lehman Note. However, this is not necessarily
                                always the case as [the] CERA would be zero under the [f]irst CERA
                                Description if the market value of the Lehman Note were zero, but
                                not necessarily zero [under] the [s]econd CERA Description as the
                                Lehman Note was only one of eight Reference [Obligations] that the
                                HN5 were linked to.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    The [t]hird CERA Description materially
                                differs on its face from the [f]irst and [s]econd CERA Descriptions
                                as the component factors it uses are completely different from the
                                latter. It also requires the aggregate principal amount
                                (“APA” or face value) of the Reference Note[s] to be
                                multiplied by the price of the Lehman Note expressed as a
                                percentage. Yet it fails to say what the price of the Lehman Note
                                should be expressed as a percentage of – effectively rendering
                                the [t]hird CERA Description unworkable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    The
                            [Respondent]’s rebuttal of the [Appellants]’ submissions is
                            made on several levels. Firstly, it argues that the [f]irst, [s]econd
                            and [t]hird CERA Descriptions are entirely consistent as they clearly
                            convey that the CERA is:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Directly related to the market value of the
                                [D]efault[ed] [R]eference [E]ntity’s Reference Obligation (in
                                this case, the Lehman Note).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Inversely related to the shortfall in market
                                value of the CAAA and HC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the [Respondent] argues that the three descriptions relied on by
                        the [Appellants] were never intended to be comprehensive formulae. In the
                        event of any uncertainty or inconsistency, the Pricing Statement provides a
                        clear mechanism for its resolution: the [t]hird CERA Description is
                        expressly designated the prevailing one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    I agree with the
                            [Respondent]’s position for the following reasons. The
                            [Appellants’] reasoning flows from their having reduced the
                            [f]irst and [s]econd CERA Descriptions, both expressed in the form of
                            words, into the precise mathematical formulae reproduced in the table at
                            [[27]] above. However, a proper construction of the [f]irst CERA
                            Description does not convey that level of precision. … The words
                            “based on” do not normally mean “equal to”
                            and the [f]irst CERA Description, in the context of the paragraph in
                            which it appears[,] does not in fact convey that meaning. What it simply
                            means is that the “prevailing market value of the [D]efaulted
                            Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation” will be an
                            important factor in the computation of [the] CERA: it does not specify
                            the exact mathematical relationship between the
                            two.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    The same reasoning
                            applies in the case of the [s]econd CERA Description. This is found on
                            the fourth page of the Pricing Statement, in the context of the
                            following paragraph (with the [s]econd CERA Description
                            emphasised):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">For illustrative purposes only, the process adopted upon the
                            occurrence of a Credit Event under the Reference Notes is outlined
                            below. This is to illustrate how the [HN5] work and should be treated as
                            an illustration only.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Step 1  …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Step 4  Following Step 3 above, the
                                Calculation Agent in respect of the Reference Notes will determine
                                the [CERA] payable to the [Respondent], as the holder of the
                                Reference Notes. <em>The CERA is in summary the
                                    amount equal to the nominal value of the Reference Notes less
                                    the amount of loss suffered on the Reference Obligation of the
                                    Defaulted Reference Entity less any depreciation of the market
                                    value of the collateral, and less cost and expenses associated
                                    with the termination of the hedging arrangements in respect of
                                    the Reference Notes</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Step 5  ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the word “equal” is used in this case, this has to
                        be seen in the context of the entire paragraph, particularly the repeated
                        caveats in the two opening sentences that it is for “illustrative
                        purposes” or “illustration” only and the words
                        “in summary” used in the [s]econd CERA Description itself.
                        Furthermore, the expressions “loss suffered”,
                        “depreciation of the market value of the collateral” and
                        “costs and expenses” are not defined at all. It is therefore
                        not correct to reduce it to the second formula in the table at [<a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above] as the [Appellants] have done. As
                        with the [f]irst CERA Description, it [<em>ie</em>, the
                        second CERA Description] is no more than a general description of the manner
                        in which [the] CERA will be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    The [t]hird CERA
                            Description appears under the section “Summary of the
                            Offering” and it is the only one of the three descriptions that
                            sets out an exact formula based on terms that are fully defined.
                            Further, in the section entitled “Glossary” at p 37
                            of the Pricing Statement, the following appears:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Terms used in the sections on ‘Summary of the Programme’
                            and ‘Summary of the Offering’ in the Base Prospectus and the
                            Pricing Statement respectively, as the case may be, shall bear the same
                            meanings when used elsewhere in the Base Prospectus and [the] Pricing
                            Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    The foregoing leads
                            to the ineluctable conclusion that the [t]hird CERA Description is the
                            operative one under the [HN5]
                            contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    I turn now to the
                            [f]ourth CERA Description. … [T]his is actually the inverse of
                            the [t]hird CERA Description as well as the general scheme under the
                            [f]irst and [s]econd CERA Descriptions. The [Respondent]’s case is
                            that this is an obvious clerical mistake, which can and should be
                            corrected by construction. It submits as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    The [f]ourth
                                CERA Description contains a formula that is identical to the [t]hird
                                CERA Description except for one thing: instead of stating that the
                                APA should be multiplied by the “Final Price”, it
                                stated that the APA should be multiplied by “(1 –
                                Final Price)”. It is plain from the other CERA [D]escriptions
                                in the Pricing Statement and the Application Form that the CERA
                                should directly correlate to the market value of the [D]efaulted
                                [R]eference [E]ntity’s Reference Obligation (<em>ie</em>, the Final Price). The additional
                                “1 –” in the [f]ourth CERA Description
                                would result in a negative correlation between the CERA and the
                                Final Price. It is also patently apparent from the other parts of
                                the Pricing Statement that the CERA should be calculated by
                                multiplying the APA with the Final Price and not
                                “(1 – Final Price)”:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    At p 9 of the Pricing Statement,
                                    under the section entitled “Risk Factors”, the
                                    Pricing Statement highlights that [a] HN5 [holder] would be
                                    subject to the credit risk of the eight reference entities in
                                    the [HN5] credit basket and goes on to elaborate that the value
                                    of the HN5 “may be affected by the activities undertaken
                                    by the Reference Entities and any financial or economic
                                    difficulties the Reference Entities may face”. It is
                                    clear that one of the risks faced by [a] HN5 [holder] is that
                                    “any financial or economic difficulties the Reference
                                    Entities may face” would have a negative effect on the
                                    value of the HN5 (and, therefore, the CERA, if a [C]redit
                                    [E]vent occurs); and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   The illustrations provided at p 8 of
                                    the Pricing Statement under “Scenario Analyses”
                                    put the issue beyond doubt. It is explained in Scenario 3
                                    (Worst Case Scenario) that if a [C]redit [E]vent occurs under
                                    the Reference Notes, and if the market value of the relevant
                                    Reference Obligation is zero, the HN5 will terminate immediately
                                    and the [HN5 holder] will receive a zero payout. This can only
                                    be true if the CERA is calculated by multiplying the APA with
                                    Final Price (<em>ie</em>, the market value
                                    of the relevant Reference Obligation which is zero) and not
                                    “(1 – Final Price)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    A literal reading of the formula contained in
                                the [f]ourth CERA Description would give rise to an absurdity. The
                                CERA under the Reference Notes (and therefore the CERA for the HN5)
                                would have an inverse correlation to the Final Price. As a result,
                                the lower the prevailing market value of the [D]efaulted [R]eference
                                [E]ntity’s Reference Obligation, the more the [Respondent]
                                would receive as the Reference Notes CERA and the higher the amount
                                each HN5 [holder] would receive upon the occurrence of a [C]redit
                                [E]vent. This could not by any stretch of the imagination have been
                                the intention of the [Respondent] or the HN5 [holders] when the HN5
                                contract was entered into. In fact, the [Appellants] do not make any
                                such suggestion. In investing in [the] HN5 and in return for the
                                higher interest yield of the HN5, the [HN5 holder] agreed to take on
                                the risk, <em>inter alia</em>, of any financial
                                difficulties which the eight reference entities in the [HN5] credit
                                basket may face. If the HN5 [holder]’s returns increased with
                                the depreciation of the market value of the [D]efaulted [R]eference
                                [E]ntity’s Reference Obligation, that would completely turn
                                the risk which was undertaken and accepted by the HN5 [holder] in
                                the HN5 contract on its head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    I agree with the

                            conditions for correcting an obvious clerical mistake by the process of
                            construction were laid down by Brightman LJ in <em>East v Pantiles (Plant Hire) Ltd</em> [1982] 2 EGLR 111

                            conditions are satisfied, then the correction is made as a matter of
                            construction …</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In summary, the Judge accepted the
                    Respondent’s arguments and held that the third CERA Description was the
                    operative CERA Description because it was precise and was expressed in the form
                    of a mathematical formula, whereas the first and second CERA Descriptions were
                    verbal formulations and were therefore imprecise. The Judge also accepted the
                    Respondent’s argument that contextually, the fourth CERA Description
                    contained an obvious clerical mistake, in that a literal reading of the formula
                    set out therein would give rise to an absurdity. The Judge further held that the
                    clerical mistake could be corrected simply by construing the fourth CERA
                    Description by removing “1 –” (which was the cause of
                    the mistake). Applying the formulation set out in the third CERA Description,

                    (collectively, “the Issues”) before us for decision. The first was
                    whether the Judge was right in ruling that the third CERA Description was the
                    operative CERA Description (“the First Issue”). The second was,
                    regardless of whether it was the third or the fourth CERA Description (these
                    being the only two CERA Descriptions addressed by the Appellants on appeal)
                    which was the operative CERA Description, whether the HN5 contract was void for
                    uncertainty because both the third and fourth CERA Descriptions were unworkable
                    in that they did not provide any agreed basis for calculating the CERA
                    (“the Second Issue”).</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     under that formula, in the event of
                        a Credit Event occurring, a HN5 holder would sustain significant losses of
                        approximately 72% of the principal sum invested; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     upon the occurrence of a
                        “Constellation Event” (<em>ie</em>, early
                        redemption of the Reference Notes for any reason other than the occurrence
                        of a Credit Event or an “Issuer Call” (<em>viz</em>, the exercise by the Respondent of its right of early
                        redemption of the HN5)), assuming the same factual conditions as those in
                        the present appeal applied, the payout which a HN5 holder would receive
                        would be the same as that which he would receive under the fourth CERA
                        Description.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, the Appellants contended, the fourth
                    CERA Description did not contain any obvious clerical mistake. It followed that
                    the Judge was not entitled to correct or rectify that CERA Description to make
                    it consistent with the third CERA Description as the conditions for correction
                    by construction as laid down in <em>East v Pantiles (Plant Hire)
                        Ltd</em> [1982] 2 EGLR 111 were not satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Appellants further argued that regardless
                    of whether this court were to uphold the Judge’s decision that the third
                    CERA Description was the operative CERA Description or, alternatively, rule that
                    the fourth CERA Description was the operative one, neither of these CERA
                    Descriptions was workable as one of the elements common to both descriptions
                    –
                    <em>ie</em>, the Final Price – could not be
                    calculated and, therefore, the CERA could not be ascertained. The reason, the
                    Appellants explained, was that “Final Price” was defined under
                    both the third and fourth CERA Descriptions as the price of the Defaulted
                    Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation “expressed as a
                        percentage”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> However, as
                    the phrase “expressed as a percentage”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>
                    was nowhere defined in the Pricing Statement, there was no denominator that
                    could be used to express the price of the Lehman Note (the Defaulted Reference
                    Entity’s Reference Obligation in the present case) as a
                percentage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In support of their legal arguments on the
                    issue of uncertainty, the Appellants referred to <em>Foley v
                        Classique Coaches, Limited</em> [1934] 2 KB 1 and also
                        <em>May and Butcher, Limited v The King</em> [1934]
                    2 KB 17. In the latter, the House of Lords held (<em>per</em> Viscount Dunedin at 21) in the context of a contract of
                    sale:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [U]ndoubtedly price is one of the essentials of sale, and if it
                        is left still to be agreed between the parties, then there is no
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Appellants’ counsel contended that
                    the present case was one of conceptual uncertainty and not mere difficulty of
                    application, relying on Megarry J’s analysis in <em>Brown v Gould and Others</em> [1972] 1 Ch 53 at 56–57
                    (citing the unreported case of <em>In re Lloyd’s Trust
                        Instruments</em> (24 June 1970)) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I think the starting point on any question of uncertainty must be
                        that of the court’s reluctance to hold an instrument void for
                        uncertainty. … The second question is that of the types of
                        uncertainty. The basic type (and on one view the only true type) is
                        uncertainty of concept, as contrasted with mere difficulty of application
                        … In <em>Fawcett’s case</em> [<em>viz</em>, <em>Fawcett Properties Ltd v
                            Buckingham County Council</em>] [1961] A.C. 636, 670,
                        Lord Keith of Avonholm said: ‘The point is one of uncertainty of
                        concept. If it is impossible, on construction of the condition, to reach a
                        conclusion as to what was in the draftsman’s mind, the condition is
                        meaningless and must be read as pro non scripto.’ Putting it another
                        way, the question is one of linguistic or semantic uncertainty, and not of
                        difficulty of ascertainment …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     According to the Appellants, the present case
                    was one of uncertainty of concept because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     the third and fourth CERA
                        Descriptions were inconsistent with each other;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was no way to determine conclusively which
                        of these two CERA Descriptions was intended by the parties to be the
                        operative CERA Description; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     both of these CERA Descriptions were unworkable because
                        they referred to the Final Price, which could not be determined as it had
                        been expressed as a <em>percentage</em> without a
                        denominator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Respondent’s arguments on the Issues
                    were likewise substantially a reiteration of their arguments in the court below.
                    It was contended that the threshold to be satisfied before a court would declare
                    a contract (particularly a fully-performed one such as the HN5 contract) void
                    for uncertainty was very high and, as such, voiding a contract for uncertainty
                    should be a measure of last resort. Reference was made to <em>G Scammell and Nephew, Limited v H C and
                        J G Ouston</em> [1941] AC 251, where the House of
                    Lords held that it was only where the words of a contract, “considered
                    however broadly and untechnically and with due regard to all the just
                    implications, fail[ed] to evince any definite meaning on which the court [could]
                    safely act … that the court ha[d] no choice but to say that there [was]
                    no contract” (at 268 <em>per</em> Lord Wright).
                    The Respondent also referred to <em>Sudbrook Trading Estate Ltd v
                        Eggleton and Others</em> [1983] 1 AC 444 in support of its
                    contention that the threshold for voiding a contract was even higher in the case
                    of executed (as opposed to executory) contracts. In that case, Lord Fraser
                    of Tullybelton, quoting a passage from the English Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment in the same case, said (at 484):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an agreement which would otherwise be unenforceable for want of
                        certainty or finality in an essential stipulation has been partly performed
                        so that the intervention of the court is necessary in aid of a grant that
                        has already taken effect, the court will strain to the utmost to supply the
                        want of certainty even to the extent of providing a substitute
                        machinery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On the basis of these authorities, the
                    Respondent argued that the high threshold for voiding a contract for uncertainty
                    had not been satisfied <em>vis-à-vis</em> the HN5 contract
                    for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first and second CERA
                        Descriptions were no more than general descriptions and were never intended
                        to be comprehensive formulae.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     In any event, the first, second and third CERA
                        Descriptions were accurate, consistent and reconcilable with each
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Pricing Statement expressly designated the formula contained in the third
                        CERA Description as the prevailing formula to resolve any
                        uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was ample basis for correcting the obvious clerical mistake in the
                        fourth CERA Description through construction by removing
                        “1 –” from the description such that it would
                        become consistent with the first, second and third CERA
                    Descriptions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_e"></a>(e)     There
                        was no uncertainty about the fact that the CERA to be received by HN5
                        holders would be an amount equal to the CERA under the Reference Notes as
                        calculated by the Respondent (as the Calculation Agent) and received by the
                        Respondent (as the holder of the Reference Notes).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_f"></a>(f)     In any event, the Pricing Statement
                        stated that the calculation of the CERA by the Respondent was, in the
                        absence of manifest error, binding on both the Respondent and HN5
                        holders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the Issues </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The First Issue: The four CERA Descriptions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     With respect to the First Issue, which stems
                    from the alleged inconsistencies between and among the four CERA Descriptions in

                    Descriptions are verbal descriptions, but we do not agree that they are

<p class="Judg-1">So expressed, it is clear that the first CERA Description is different
                    from the second CERA Description, and both are different from the third CERA
                    Description and also the fourth CERA Description.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It should be noted that before both the Judge
                    and this court, the Respondent did not expressly disagree that the first, second
                    and third CERA Descriptions were expressed differently from one another. Rather,
                    its argument, as summarised by the Judge in the HC Judgment at [41] and which it reiterated before us, was
                    that these three CERA Descriptions clearly conveyed that the CERA was:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     directly related to the market value
                        of the Lehman Note (the Defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference
                        Obligation in this case); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     inversely related to the shortfall in the market value of
                        the CAAA and the HC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the other hand, the Respondent
                    insisted that the fourth CERA Description was inconsistent with the third CERA
                    Description as the former implied an inverse relationship between the CERA and
                    the market value of the Lehman Note, which made the relationship absurd and,
                    therefore, one that could not have been intended. Hence, the Respondent argued,
                    the fourth CERA Description must contain a clerical mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In our view, the Respondent’s arguments
                    as summarised in the preceding paragraph have not addressed the point that the
                    first, second and third CERA Descriptions are formulated differently from one
                    another, in that although they use (in substance) the same factors to calculate
                    the CERA, they phrase these factors differently. Consequently, an issue does
                    arise as to whether these three CERA Descriptions may produce different CERAs
                    (or payouts) in the event of a Credit Event and, if so, which would be the
                    operative CERA Description even if the fourth CERA Description were disregarded
                    for this purpose. We will now analyse the four CERA Descriptions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first CERA Description</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In our view, given that the market value of
                    the Lehman Note was only 0.005% of its nominal value, it is clear that the
                    application of the first CERA Description would in effect result in a zero
                    payout for HN5 holders as the computation of the CERA would yield a negative
                    figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second CERA Description</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In contrast, we are of the view that the
                    literal application of the second CERA Description would not result in a zero
                    payout for HN5 holders <em>if</em> Constellation had not
                    invested the Reference Notes funds in the Lehman Note as, in that event, it
                    would not have suffered any loss arising from Lehman’s bankruptcy. In that
                    scenario, the CERA payout would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the above calculation, the second CERA
                    Description would result in a CERA of S$1,392.52 for each HN5 under the SGD
                    Tranche and a CERA of US$1,407.50 for each HN5 under the USD Tranche.
                    Coincidentally, if Constellation had not actually invested any of the Reference
                    Notes funds in the Lehman Note, the CERA under the second CERA Description would
                    be the same as the CERA under the fourth CERA Description. It follows that the
                    second CERA Description would contain a mistake in the same way that the fourth
                    CERA Description is alleged by the Respondent to contain a clerical
                    mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The difficulty with the literal application of
                    the second CERA Description is that it assumes that the Pricing Statement
                    required Constellation to invest all or substantially all of the Reference Notes
                    funds in one or more of the Reference Obligations as it is only in this scenario
                    that the CERA under the Reference Notes (and, in turn, the CERA under the HN5)
                    would have a direct one-to-one correlation with the value of the Reference
                    Obligations. This is, however, not the case as nowhere in the Pricing Statement
                    was it stated that Constellation was required to invest the Reference Notes
                    funds in any of the Reference Obligations. The Reference Obligations were used
                    only for the purpose of triggering a Credit Event. In other words, the Reference
                    Obligations were merely notional obligations and not real obligations. But, as
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above, this is clear only
                    upon a close analysis of the terms of the Pricing Statement.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The application of the third CERA Description
                    actually gives a negative result for the CERA, which, in practical terms, means
                    a zero payout for HN5 holders. The absurdity of this theoretical result can only
                    be explained on the basis that the third CERA Description is so constructed as
                    to virtually guarantee that on the occurrence of a Credit Event, HN5 holders
                    will get nothing back on their capital “investment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The fourth CERA Description</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is the Respondent’s case that the
                    fourth CERA Description contains a clerical mistake because the application of
                    the formula set out therein would lead to an absurd result, in that the lower
                    the value of the Defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation (as
                    assessed by prospective investors in the relevant security), the higher the CERA
                    to be paid to HN5 holders. Before both the Judge and this court, the Respondent
                    did not explain how the mistake came about – an omission which we find
                    surprising, given that the Respondent’s army of advisers would presumably
                    have examined the Pricing Statement, especially the CERA Descriptions therein,
                    with meticulous care. We earlier examined the second CERA Description, and found
                    that it too could be said to contain a mistake as it would, if applied
                    literally, give the same result as the fourth CERA Description. It seems
                    incredible that in the context of such a humongous structured note programme as
                    the HN5, the Respondent could have failed to detect two serious errors in the
                    description of the CERA, which may be said to lie at the heart of HN5
                    holders’ “investment” in the event of a Credit Event
                    occurring and which formed a key part of the basis on which the Respondent
                    invited applications for the HN5.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Which is the operative CERA Description?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Appellants’ case is based entirely
                    on principles of contract law and not on facts. It rests, in essence, on two
                    arguments, namely: (a) the four CERA Descriptions are inconsistent with one
                    another, thereby rendering the CERA uncertain; and (b) in any event,
                    regardless of whether it is the third or the fourth CERA Description which is
                    the operative CERA Description, the CERA is unascertainable because the formulae
                    in both the third and fourth CERA Descriptions are unworkable. Consequently, it
                    is contended, the HN5 contract is void <em>ab initio</em>
                    for uncertainty. We are unable to accept both arguments for the reasons given
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     We have established that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     the first CERA Description is in
                        substance the same as the third CERA Description in so far as both will
                        give, for practical purposes, a zero payout;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     the second CERA Description, if applied
                        literally, will give the same payout as the fourth CERA Description in the
                        circumstances of this case; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     the first and third CERA Descriptions are therefore
                        inconsistent with the second and fourth CERA
                Descriptions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In our view, the Pricing Statement can only
                    stipulate one operative CERA Description for the purposes of the HN5 contract,
                    and the question of which of the four (or two sets of) CERA Descriptions is the
                    operative one is a question of fact that can and should be ascertained from the
                    evidence which has been or can be made available to the court. In our view, it
                    would not be wise or correct for us to decide the First Issue on the basis of
                    preferring one set of legal arguments to another when the real dispute between
                    the parties is really a question of fact as to what the operative CERA
                    Description is. We know that the Pricing Statement states clearly that the CERA
                    which HN5 holders will get upon the occurrence of a Credit Event is the CERA
                    which the Respondent will get under the Reference Notes (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). We know that the Reference Notes exist,
                    although their full terms have not been disclosed to the court. We know that the
                    Respondent has alleged that the fourth CERA Description contains a clerical
                    mistake. Hence, to ascertain whether the Judge was right in ruling that the
                    third CERA Description was the operative CERA Description, all that we need to
                    do is to look at the terms and conditions of the contract applicable to the
                    Reference Notes to see whether the formula for calculating the CERA under the
                    Reference Notes (which, as we have just reiterated, is also the CERA to be paid
                    to HN5 holders) is the same as the formula set out in the third CERA
                    Description. In short, the operative CERA Description can be conclusively
                    established by examining the material facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In this connection, neither the Appellants nor
                    the Respondent appeared to be keen to have the Reference Notes and the relevant
                    accompanying documents (collectively, “the Reference Notes
                    documents”) disclosed to this court, even though we suggested, in the
                    course of hearing this appeal, that such disclosure would be helpful to the
                    court. We made this suggestion as we were effectively being asked to decide an
                    issue of fact (albeit presented by the parties as an issue of law) without
                    having before us all the material evidence pertaining to that issue of fact.
                    There were other factors which prompted us to make this suggestion. Firstly, the
                    HN5 are a novel and complex financial product. As such, the court should be slow
                    to decide what the operative CERA Description is based purely on legal
                    arguments. Secondly, the Pricing Statement (consisting of 93 pages of
                    explanatory statements), which forms a key plank of the HN5 contract, would
                    presumably have been carefully vetted by teams of lawyers and bankers. As such,
                    we were not prepared to accept, without further scrutiny, the Respondent’s
                    argument that the fourth CERA Description contained a clerical error. Thirdly,
                    it seemed to us that if the fourth CERA Description did indeed contain a
                    clerical mistake, then the second CERA Description would also contain a mistake
                    as the second CERA Description, applied literally, would give the same result as
                    the fourth CERA Description if Constellation had not actually invested the
                    Reference Notes funds in the Lehman Note (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above). That two mistakes could have been made in the
                    Pricing Statement seemed to us (as mentioned at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above) incredible and called for further inquiry. Fourthly,
                    if the formula for calculating the CERA as set out in the Reference Notes
                    documents is the same as the fourth CERA Description, then the fourth CERA
                    Description, and not the third CERA Description, would be the operative CERA
                    Description. This is because the Pricing Statement states very clearly that the
                    CERA to be paid to HN5 holders in the event of a Credit Event would be the same
                    as the CERA received by the Respondent under the Reference Notes. In that
                    scenario (<em>ie</em>, if the fourth CERA Description is
                    the operative CERA Description), given the undeniable and irreconcilable
                    inconsistency between the third and fourth CERA Descriptions, it would be the
                    third CERA Description, and not the fourth, which contains a clerical
                    error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In view of the above considerations, we
                    directed the Respondent (notwithstanding both parties’ apparent
                    reluctance) to produce for our consideration, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the Reference Notes documents. These documents, which were
                    furnished on 11 July 2011, included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     the pricing supplement dated
                        16 May 2007 for SRN Series 75;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     the pricing supplement dated 16 May 2007
                        for SRN Series 76;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     the swap confirmation dated 16 May 2007 for SRN
                        Series 75; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_d"></a>(d)     the swap confirmation dated 16 May 2007 for SRN
                        Series 76.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that when producing
                    the documents ordered by this court, the Respondent drew the attention of the
                    Appellants’ solicitors to the application of the principle laid down in
                        <em>Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd</em>
                    [1977] QB 881 as well as the implied undertaking: (a) not to
                    disclose the Reference Notes documents to any third party, and (b) not to
                    use them, without the consent of this court, for any purpose other than in the
                    present proceedings. In this regard, we confirm that the implied undertaking
                    subsists and is not to be breached in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Having perused the Reference Notes documents,
                    we observe that the formula for calculating the CERA under the Reference Notes
                    (and, thus, the formula for calculating the CERA under the HN5) is consistently
                    stated across several of the documents to be the formula under the third CERA
                    Description –
                    <em>ie</em>, the CERA Description with respect to the
                    Reference Notes is the same as the third CERA Description. Accordingly, we
                    conclude that the operative CERA Description for the purposes of the HN5 is
                    indeed, as the Judge held, the third CERA Description (which description, in our
                    view, the first CERA Description was intended to express, albeit in verbal and
                    less precise terms). We also accept the Respondent’s argument that the
                    fourth CERA Description contains a clerical mistake, although how this mistake
                    (and also the mistake in the second CERA Description) came about remains a
                    mystery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the circumstances, the legal arguments
                    advanced by the Appellants’ counsel on the issue of conceptual uncertainty
                    in the terms of the HN5 contract are not applicable. The Appellants’
                    allegation of uncertainty in a critical term of the HN5 contract (<em>viz</em>, the term relating to the CERA) must, therefore,
                    fail. The result is that owing to Lehman’s bankruptcy, the CERA payable to
                    HN5 holders on their investment is indeed zero.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Issue: The definition of “Final
                Price”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     We will now consider the Second Issue, which
                    concerns the Appellants’ argument that both the third and fourth CERA
                    Descriptions are not workable as the words “expressed as a
                        percentage”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> in the
                    definition of “Final Price” for both of these CERA Descriptions do
                    not specify a denominator to give the said percentage (“the FP
                    percentage”) a value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Appellants’ submissions on this
                    issue were as follows. First, there was no evidence that the parties intended,
                    knew or understood that the denominator for the FP percentage would be the
                    nominal value of the Lehman Note. Second, using the nominal value of the Lehman
                    Note as the denominator for the FP percentage would only make sense if it were
                    assumed that all of the Reference Notes funds were allocated to the Lehman Note;
                    otherwise, there was no logical reason to assume that the loss suffered on those
                    funds would be proportionate to the fall in value of the Lehman
                Note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In rebuttal, the Respondent contended that the
                    denominator for the FP percentage was the outstanding principal balance of the
                    Defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation (<em>ie</em>, the Lehman Note). This interpretation, the Respondent
                    submitted, was borne out by the definitions of “Final Price” and
                    other related terms in Appendix D of the Pricing Statement, which
                    definitions the third CERA Description expressly referred the reader to (see the
                    quotation at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), and was also based
                    squarely on the terms and definitions set out in the Pricing Statement. The
                    material terms and definitions in this regard are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     “Final Price”, which
                        is defined as “the price of the Reference Obligation of the Defaulted
                        Reference Entity expressed as a percentage, <em>determined in

                        business days from the “Credit Event Determination Date”,
                        which is the date on which a Credit Event notice, delivered in accordance

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     “Market Value”, which is defined as, essentially, the
                        arithmetic mean of “<em>Full

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     “Full
                        Quotation”, which is defined as “in accordance with the
                        Quotation Method [<em>ie</em>, the bidding method],
                        each firm quotation obtained from a Dealer at the Valuation Time [<em>viz</em>, approximately 11.00am Singapore time], to the
                        extent reasonably practicable, for an amount of the Reference Obligation
                            <em>with an Outstanding Principal Balance equal to the
                            Quotation Amount</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added];
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     “Quotation Amount”, which is defined as “the [APA] of
                        the Notes [<em>ie</em>, the Reference Notes]
                            outstanding”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In our view, in the context of the formulae
                    under the third and fourth CERA Descriptions, the FP (Final Price) is the market
                    value of the Lehman Note expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the
                    Lehman Note. Since the Lehman Note lost 99.995% of its nominal value, the FP
                    percentage would be 0.005% (of the nominal value of the Lehman Note). The words
                    “expressed as a percentage” in the definition of “Final
                    Price” mean expressed as a percentage of the Aggregate Principal Amount
                    (APA) of the Reference Notes, which the nominal value of the Defaulted Reference
                    Entity’s Reference Obligation is equated with. This interpretation is
                    consistent with the artificial and complex structure of the HN5, whose terms
                    provide that the entire principal amount of the Reference Notes (<em>ie</em>, all of the Reference Notes funds) is notionally
                    allocated to the Defaulted Reference Entity. In our view, the words
                    “expressed as a percentage” cannot mean anything else. This is not
                    a case of words having no meaning at all. It is, rather, a case of construing
                    the relevant contractual documents to determine the intended denominator to be
                    used for calculating the CERA under the HN5. Accordingly, we are of the view
                    that contrary to the Appellants’ submission, there is no conceptual
                    uncertainty in the words “expressed as a percentage” in the
                    definition of “Final Price”. We would also add that considering
                    the enormous number of words already used in the Pricing Statement to set out
                    the terms of the HN5, the Respondent’s advisers could and should simply
                    have added a few more words to give the phrase “expressed as a
                    percentage” greater clarity. This would have made the definition of
                    “Final Price” more intelligible, and would in turn have averted
                    the obfuscation which gave rise to the Second Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     For the reasons given above, we agree with the
                    Judge that the HN5 contract is not void for uncertainty. Accordingly, we dismiss
                    the appeal with costs (but not the costs of producing the Reference Notes
                    documents) and the usual consequential orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In view of our decision in this appeal, we
                    think it apposite and timely to remind the general public that under the law of
                    contract, a person who signs a contract which is set out in a language he is not
                    familiar with or whose terms he may not understand is nonetheless bound by the
                    terms of that contract. Illiteracy, whether linguistic, financial or general,
                    does not enable a contracting party to avoid a contract whose terms he has
                    expressly agreed to be bound by. The principle of <em>caveat
                        emptor</em> applies equally to literates and illiterates in such
                    circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>2 November 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Media Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Soon Kok Tiang and others v DBS Bank Ltd and another matter<br/>
</em>Civil Appeal No 6 of 2011 and Summons No 2274 of 2011 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Chan Sek Keong CJ)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background </strong></p>
<p>1     This appeal arose from a lawsuit by 21 investors (“the Appellants”) (representing 192 other plaintiffs, 2 of whom withdrew from the appeal) for the refund of the entire capital sum which they had lost in investing in derivative credit-linked notes called “DBS High Notes 5” (“the HN5”) issued by DBS Bank Ltd (“the Respondent”). Consequent upon the bankruptcy on 15 September 2008 of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (“Lehman”), one of the reference entities to which the HN5 were linked, the redemption amount (“the Credit Event Redemption Amount”) for the HN5 was assessed by the Respondent to be zero.</p>
<p>2     The Appellants’ primary argument was that the HN5 contract was void for uncertainty as its pricing statement dated 29 March 2007 (“the Pricing Statement”) contained four different descriptions of the CERA (“CERA Descriptions”), which they interpreted to be inconsistent and irreconcilable with one another.</p>
<p>3     The High Court judge (“the Judge”) held that the third CERA Description was the operative CERA Description, and that the fourth CERA Description contained an obvious clerical mistake as it would give rise to an absurdity. Therefore, applying the third CERA Description, the Judge held that the Appellants were entitled to only a zero payout.</p>
<p>4     The main issues raised in this appeal were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>whether the Judge was right in ruling that the third CERA Description was the operative CERA Description; and</li>
<li>whether the HN5 contract was void for uncertainty because both the third and fourth CERA Descriptions were unworkable in that they did not provide any agreed basis for calculating the CERA.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The operative CERA Description </strong></p>
<p>5     The Court of Appeal found that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>the first CERA Description was in substance the same as the third CERA Description in so far as both would give, for practical purposes, a zero payout; </li>
<li>the second CERA Description, if applied literally, would give the same payout as the fourth CERA Description in the circumstances of this case; and</li>
<li>the first and third CERA Descriptions were therefore inconsistent with the second and fourth CERA Descriptions. </li>
</ol>
<p>6     The Court observed that that the Pricing Statement stated clearly that the CERA which HN5 holders would receive was the CERA which the Respondent would receive under the two structured notes that were purchased with funds raised from the sale of the HN5 (“the Reference Notes”). Therefore, the question of which of the four (or two sets of) CERA Descriptions was the operative one could be answered by reference to the terms and conditions of the contract applicable to the Reference Notes to see whether the formula for calculating the CERA under the Reference Notes was the same as the formula set out in any of the four CERA Descriptions. As such, the Court directed the Respondent to produce for its consideration the Reference Notes documents, and found that the CERA Description with respect to the Reference Notes was the same as the third CERA Description. Therefore, the Court concluded that the operative CERA Description for the purposes of the HN5 was indeed the third CERA Description, and that the fourth CERA Description did contain a clerical mistake. The result was that owing to Lehman’s bankruptcy, the CERA payable to HN5 holders on their investment was indeed zero.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Whether the operative CERA Description was unworkable<br/>
</strong><br/>
7     The Court held that there was no conceptual uncertainty in the words “expressed as a percentage” in the definition of the term “Final Price” used in the third and fourth CERA Descriptions, as the intended denominator for the percentage could be determined by construing the relevant contractual documents. Therefore, the third, as well as the fourth, CERA Description was not unworkable.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
<br/>
8     For the reasons given above, the Court of Appeal held that the HN5 contract was not void for uncertainty, and dismissed the appeal with costs and the usual consequential orders.  </p>
