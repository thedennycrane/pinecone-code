        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal and cross-appeal concern a dispute
                    between a paint manufacturer and a painting subcontractor on whether latent
                    defects in the supplied paint led to the serious discolouration of the internal
                    surfaces at various parts of a building project. The subcontractor sued for
                    losses, <em>ie</em>, expenses which it had incurred in
                    repainting the affected surfaces. The manufacturer in turn made a counter-claim
                    for the balance sum due on the paint sold to the subcontractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       A High Court judge (“the Judge”)
                    dismissed the subcontractor’s claim and allowed the manufacturer’s
                    counterclaim for the sum of $72,676.62; see <em>Anti-Corrosion
                        Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 351 (“the judgment”). In dismissing the
                    claim by the subcontractor, the Judge found at [19] of the judgment that “the [appellant] has not proven
                    on balance of probability [<em>sic</em>] that the defects
                    in [the paint] had caused the discolouration”. Pertinently, at [21] of the judgment, the Judge also
                    determined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… that if I had to decide on the issue of the warranty, I would
                        have found that [the Respondent]] had warranted all its products used in any
                        of the plaintiff’s projects for a period of 5 years provided that the
                        use was based on a proposed paint system by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both parties now appeal against different aspects of the judgment
                    below. The subcontractor contends that the Judge had erred on the issue of
                    causation while the manufacturer is appealing against the above-mentioned
                        <em>dictum</em> of the Judge on a warranty purportedly
                    given by it to the subcontractor. We now give our decision and the reasons for
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The subcontractor is Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd
                    (“the Appellant”). It provides construction and renovation
                    services, which include paint application works. Its managing director is Lim
                    Choon Lin Vincent (“Vincent Lim”). Among the Appellant’s
                    personnel, he was the one who liaised most often with the Respondent’s
                    representatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Berger Paints Singapore Pte Ltd (“the
                    Respondent”) is the paint manufacturer and supplier. Its sales
                    representative, Joseph Yong, conducted the sale negotiations with Vincent Lim.
                    Rajeev Goel is the Respondent’s regional technology manager who was in
                    charge of the Respondent’s investigations after the paint discolouration
                    occurred. Its superior was Jaideep Nandi, the chief executive officer of the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Respondent supplied the Appellant with paint
                    on three separate occasions prior to the project in question. The first time it
                    did so was in 2005 for the painting of the external surfaces of a Toh Guan
                    dormitory. The project was completed without any complaints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, in January 2006, the Respondent
                    proposed to the Appellant and supplied a paint system for the Toh Guan Road East
                    Capital One project (“the Toh Guan project”). Unlike the earlier
                    project, the painting works were for external and internal surfaces. The
                    Respondent’s Decora Emulsion paint (“the paint”) was used
                    for the internal surfaces. The Respondent’s product data sheet stated,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that the Appellant was to
                    “[a]pply a suitable sealer coat such as Berger Plastaseal or Berger
                    Water-Based Sealer” prior to the application of the paint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    Despite this, the Respondent’s proposed paint system for internal surfaces
                    did not include a sealer coat. It merely stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">On receipt of the Respondent’s proposal, Vincent Lim
                    expressed concerns over the necessity of applying a sealer coat. His concerns
                    were quickly brushed aside by Joseph Yong, <em>vide</em> a
                    letter dated 12 January 2006:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Toh Guan project was completed uneventfully.
                    After this, the Respondent supplied paint to the Appellant for a third project
                    at No 2 Toh Tuck Link (“the Toh Tuck Link project”). For
                    this, it did not submit a proposal for a paint system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Respondent then supplied the Appellant with
                    the same Decora Emulsion paint for a project at Bukit Batok Street 23
                    (“the Bukit Batok project”) - the subject
                    matter of the present appeals. We set out now the circumstances that led to this
                    supply of paint for the Bukit Batok project. The Appellant had been awarded the
                    contract to paint the internal and external surfaces of the buildings by the
                    main contractor, Eng Siang Lee Construction Co Pte Ltd (“ESL”), on
                    15 August 2007. As before, the Respondent’s proposal for the paint
                    system made on its official notepaper and captioned “<b><font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Proposed Paint System for Bukit Batok St
                    23</font></b>” did not include a sealer coat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Again, the Respondent’s
                    Decora Emulsion paint was the only paint identified as appropriate for the
                    painting the internal surfaces. There was absolutely no suggestion that it was
                    not fit for the intended usage or that a sealer coat was necessary. However,
                    unlike the Toh Guan project, the Appellant did not receive additional written
                    confirmation from the Respondent that a sealer coat was
                unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Appellant’s account was that, having
                    learnt about the Appellant’s intended bid for the Bukit Batok project,
                    Joseph Yong approached Vincent Lim in July 2007 with a proposal to use the
                    Respondent’s paint. The Appellant asserts that it had relied on the
                    Respondent’s assurances on the suitability of the paint in submitting its
                    winning bid for the project. Joseph Yong, it maintains, gave similar verbal
                    assurances about the suitability of using the paint without the prior
                    application of a sealer coat to Vincent Lim. Vincent Lim testified that this was
                    the reason why he did not seek written confirmation from the Respondent that a
                    sealer coat was unnecessary. He was also led to believe the warranty, as stated
                    in the 13 January letter, would continue to apply to this
                project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Respondent disputed the Appellant’s
                    claim that Joseph Yong actively sought the latter’s business support or
                    that he advised the Appellant on the paint system. The Respondent claimed that
                    it supplied paint to the Appellant on a “supply-only”
                        basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> and that the Appellant
                    purchased the paint not because of Joseph Yong’s advice but because it was
                    cheap. Regrettably, we note that the Respondent did not take steps to ensure
                    that Joseph Yong testified in Court. All the Respondent could baldly state was
                    that its advice on the appropriate paint system for the Bukit Batok Project was
                    not given. We therefore accept Vincent Lim’s evidence on these
                    issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The requisite painting works were carried out
                    between September 2007 and April 2008. During this period, the Respondent
                    delivered the paint to the Appellant as and when the latter required it.
                    According to the Respondent, the paint came from several different production
                    batches. The Judge at [6] of the judgment
                    noted that the paint came from 31 batches but the Respondent now asserts that
                    the correct number of batches is 30. In the final analysis, it does not matter
                    which is the true number. However, what is clear is that the paint supplied came
                    from no less than 30 different batches. These constituted about 44,000 litres of
                    paint. The Appellant was required to sign a delivery order and would be given a
                    tax invoice every time the paint was delivered. The parties, we ought to
                    mention, disagree over whether the terms of these documents formed part of the
                    contract, in particular whether exemption clauses contained in them could be
                    used to limit the Respondent’s liability and/or exclude terms implied by
                    the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    (“SGA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Sometime in April 2008, it was observed that
                    there was serious pinkish discolouration of the paint on the internal surfaces
                    of the Bukit Batok Project. The Judge found, in the judgment at [12] that the discolouration was widespread
                    and occurred in most, if not all, of the surfaces<b>.</b>
                    There is no dispute over this finding of fact. On 16 April 2008, ESL (see
                    above, at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>) complained to the Appellant
                    that the paint on the internal surfaces had discoloured. The Appellant promptly
                    relayed this complaint to the Respondent in a letter dated 18 April
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In this letter, it alleged the
                    Respondent’s paint was defective and that it was “very worry
                        [<em>sic</em>] about [the Respondent’s]
                    products” as another complaint had surfaced in relation to the paint it
                    had used for the Toh Tuck Link project. It reiterated this allegation in a
                    further letter dated 21 May 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Respondent responded on the same
                    date denying its paint was defective. It emphatically asserted that Decora
                    Emulsion was a low cost interior emulsion. It added that “[o]ne of the
                    key criterion [<em>sic</em>] for the paint to be applied is
                    that a sealer coat is used prior to the application of the paint” and
                    while “[i]n certain cases, the paint may perform without the usage of
                    sealer … that is not a recommended practice...”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Respondent also stated that it
                    had commenced an internal investigation and offered to share the results of this
                    with the Appellant to show that the paint was not defective. Significantly, the
                    letter also stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our finding is in the presence of moisture if the surface is alkaline, the
                        pink colour comes out clearly if a sealer coat is not applied to seal the
                        substrate. This is hardly a problem with the paint but more an issue of
                        substrate preparation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant replied on the following day stating that its own
                    investigations ruled out the presence of moisture content. It bitingly
                        added:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although in your data sheet it is mentioned that a sealer coat is required
                        prior application of Berger Decora Emulsion [sic], you had proposed to us a
                        paint system which does not include a sealer coat, i.e. 2 coats of Berger
                        Decora Emulsion. <em>If you were aware that direct
                            application without sealer coat would result in a change of colour, your
                            representative should have known better than to propose this very same

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The parties tried to resolve their differences
                    through a series of meetings, on-site inspections and correspondence. However,
                    the dispute between the parties eventually became intractable. The Appellant
                    then carried out the repainting works on the Bukit Batok project, without
                    reference to the Respondent, using paint from a different manufacturer, Haruna
                    (S) Pte Ltd and incurred additional costs of $52,242.75.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the meantime, the Respondent continued
                    investigating the cause of the paint’s discolouration. Rajeev Goel led an
                    in-house team to inspect the Bukit Batok project site and conduct several tests
                    to pin-point the cause(s) of the discolouration. It also approached the
                    Construction Technology Division of Setsco Service Pte Ltd
                    (“Setsco”), one of Singapore’s largest industrial testing
                    and inspection companies, to assist in verifying its internal findings. Unknown
                    to it, the Appellant had already commissioned Lee Sweet Choong, Elizabeth
                    (“Elizabeth Lee”), who is presently the Divisional Director of
                    Setsco’s Biological and Chemical Technology Division, to investigate the
                    cause of the discolouration. At trial, she was its expert witness. As Setsco
                    declined to represent the Respondent, it then engaged Wong Chung Wan, a director
                    of MAEK Consultant Pte Ltd and part-time lecturer at the School of Design and
                    Environment of the National University of Singapore, to be its expert
                    witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of pleadings and the decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 23 November 2009, the Appellant filed
                    its claim for reimbursement of costs of supplies and labour incurred in
                    repainting the affected surfaces. It pleaded the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Respondent’s representations, express
                            and/or implied, were relied upon by the Appellant in choosing the paint
                            system. Since the paint systems were the same, the representations
                            Joseph Yong made in relation to the Toh Guan project – that a
                            sealer coat of paint was unnecessary – also applied to the Bukit
                            Batok project.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Respondent’s paint was not of
                            satisfactory quality, was not reasonably fit for use as internal paint,
                            and that it breached the contract’s implied term that the paint
                            would not disintegrate and cause discolouration after
                            application.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Respondent cannot rely on the exception
                            clauses; which were contained in its delivery orders, tax invoices and
                            product specifications as they were unreasonable under the Unfair
                            Contracts Term Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed).</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">By not bearing all the costs of the repainting
                            works, the Respondent was in breach of the warranty it had provided to
                            the Appellant.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">It had incurred costs of $1,258,222.22 in repainting the affected
                    surfaces. After setting off the Respondent’s invoice for paint materials
                    amounting to $72,676.62, the Appellant claimed $1,185,545.60 from the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Respondent’s pleadings in response
                    were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Joseph Yong did not advise the Appellant on a
                            paint system for the Bukit Batok project. Even if he had, the Appellant
                            did not or could not reasonably have relied upon them.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Appellant had not satisfied the burden of
                            proving the discolouration was caused by the Respondent’s paint,
                            rather than some other cause.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Its liability was contractually limited by the
                            delivery orders and tax invoices that it sent to the
                        Respondent.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It had not provided a warranty to the Appellant
                            in respect of the internal surfaces. In the usual course of business,
                            its warranties only covered external surfaces or whatever the parties
                            expressly agreed upon. There was no such agreement for the Bukit Batok
                            project.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Respondent also counter-claimed for
                    $72,676.62 owed by the Appellant for the paint and other related items sold to
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Judge dismissed the Appellant’s
                    claim and allowed the Respondent’s counterclaim. While he accepted that
                    the representations Joseph Yong made in relation to the Toh Guan project –
                    that a sealer coat of paint was unnecessary – also applied to the Bukit
                    Batok project he nevertheless found that the Appellant had not proved that the
                    defects in the paint caused the discolouration. His key findings were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     “[A]t the time of painting,
                        the internal surfaces of the Project probably did not have excessive
                        moisture levels” (the judgment at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     “It was the point on the alkalinity of the skim
                        coat that [the Judge] found much harder to rule out” (the judgment at
                            [16]). The Judge’s reasons
                        were that, during her tests, Elizabeth Lee used skim coats that were
                        unrepresentative of the ones used at the project. He was also unsure whether
                        the paint samples she tested on were representative of the paint used. He
                        also expressed concern that storage conditions and time lag may have
                        affected the composition or quality of the paint samples.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was unlikely that there was a
                        manufacturing problem for several reasons. First, the Appellant had used the
                        paint previously without encountering problems, and no defects were noticed
                        when the paint was mixed and applied. Second, he accepted the
                        Respondent’s evidence that the paint complied with the manufacturing
                        specifications. He also found it difficult to understand why the Appellant
                        took eight months to complain about the discolouration. Lastly, the Judge
                        felt that the discolouration occurring in patterns was “more
                        consistent with the explanation that [the paint] had reacted with the skim
                        coat” (the judgment at [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Appellant appeals against the
                    Judge’s decision that the defects in the Respondent’s paint had not
                    been established to be the cause of the discolouration. From the
                    Appellant’s and Respondent’s predominantly factual submissions, it
                    is clear the crux of both parties’ cases is that the Court should prefer
                    the testimony of their respective expert witnesses. As mentioned above at
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>, the Respondent is, in addition,
                    specifically appealing against the Judge’s alternative finding of fact
                    that it had warranted all of its products used in any of the Appellant’s
                    projects for a five-year period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The following issues arise in this
                    appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Has there been a breach of the
                        contract? Answering this question requires answering the prior question as
                        to whether Joseph Yong gave any assurances to Vincent Lim about the
                        suitability of its paint without a sealer coat, which formed part of the
                        parties’ contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     What was the cause of the discolouration of the
                        paint?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Is the
                        Respondent’s liability limited by exemption
                clauses?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue: Has there been a breach of the contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did Joseph Yong give any assurances to Vincent Lim that a sealer coat
                was unnecessary for the Bukit Batok project?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As stated above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>, the Appellant claimed Joseph Yong had approached Vincent
                    Lim with a proposed paint system for the Bukit Batok project, an account which
                    the Respondent hotly disputed. If Joseph Yong had indeed made statements to
                    Vincent Lim, these could form part of the contract between the parties. It is
                    thus necessary to determine whether such statements were ever
                made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Contrary to the Respondent’s
                    submissions, the paint proposal was not a mere formality which the Appellant
                    needed to submit to ESL. There was plausible evidence that Joseph Yong knew that
                    the Appellant was relying on the Respondent’s advice on the paint system.
                    Vincent’s Lim’s unequivocal testimony that Joseph Yong had made
                    representations about the suitability of the paint without a sealer coat and the
                    provision of a warranty remained unshaken. We also note that in a letter dated
                    22 May 2008, the Appellant stated that Joseph Yong had made paint proposals
                    to Vincent Lim for the Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan project. The
                    Respondent’s reply letter dated 23 May 2008 did not rebut the
                    Appellant’s assertions that it was Joseph Yong who actively sought the
                    Appellant’s patronage. That being so, and in light of the prevailing
                    evidence, we take these assertions as proved and infer that if Joseph Yong gave
                    assurances to Vincent Lim for the earlier projects, he probably did the same for
                    the Bukit Batok project as well. Further, Joseph Yong did not testify on behalf
                    of the Respondent during the trial. Taking into account this unsatisfactory
                    evidentiary position, we find that the Respondent was unable to effectively
                    rebut the Appellant’s contentions on this issue. We therefore decide that
                    it was likely that Joseph Yong had advised the Appellant on a paint system for
                    the Bukit Batok project, that he had verbally assured Vincent Lim a sealer coat
                    was unnecessary and that a warranty would be provided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Respondent submitted that it was
                    unreasonable for the Appellant to rely on the former’s paint system
                    without making cross checks of its own, in particular against the paint’s
                    data sheet, which stated a sealer coat ought to be used. However, during the
                    trial, the Respondent’s Jaideep Nandi had no alternative but to agree that
                    the Appellant was also entitled to rely on the paint proposal made in relation
                    to the Bukit Batok Project (see also above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). The relevant portion of the transcript is as follows:
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">… I put it to you that since [the
                            Respondent] did not face any discolouration problems in the Toh Guan
                            project, without using sealer, [it] was similarly entitled to rely on
                            your identical paint proposal for Bukit Batok; do you

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parol evidence rule does not preclude incorporation of Joseph
                Yong’s representations to Vincent Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It was undisputed that the tax invoices and
                    delivery orders formed part of the contract. However, an issue that arises is
                    whether Joseph Yong’s oral statements to Vincent Lim that a sealer coat
                    was not required and that a warranty was provided were incorporated into the
                    contract. This in turn raises two further issues. The first is whether
                    consideration of the evidence of these statements falls foul of the parol
                    evidence rule. In our opinion, it does not. In <em>Zurich
                        Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [112], this court
                    noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[T]he parol evidence rule only operates where the
                            contract was intended by the parties to contain all the terms of their
                            agreement.</em> Where the contractual terms are ambiguous on their
                        face, it is likely that the contract does not contain all the terms intended
                        by the parties. Furthermore, in order to ascertain whether the parties
                        intended to embody their entire agreement in the contract, the court may
                        take cognisance of extrinsic evidence or the surrounding circumstances of
                        the contract (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above). [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is trite that during the course of
                    negotiations leading to the conclusion of a valid and binding contract, a number
                    of statements may be made. Some may be intended to have contractual force;
                    others may not. On the facts of the present case (outlined at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>–<a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    above), we find that the tax invoices and delivery orders did not comprise the
                    entirety of the contractual relationship between the parties, and that the parol
                    evidence rule does not preclude the incorporation of Joseph Yong’s
                    statements to Vincent Lim into the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Joseph Yong’s statements formed part of the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The second issue, arising from our
                    ascertainment of the contractual terms, is whether Joseph Yong’s
                    statements were contractual terms or non-binding representations merely intended
                    to induce the other party to enter into the contract without imposing any
                    responsibility for breach of contract. As Lord Moulton observed in
                        <em>Heilbut, Symons &amp; Co v Buckleton</em>
                    [1913] AC 30 at 51, the true test of a statement having contractual
                    force is whether there is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... evidence of an intention on the part of either or both of the parties
                        that there should be contractual liability in respect of the accuracy of the
                        statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We agree that the proper inquiry should focus
                    on an objective assessment of the parties’ intentions and take note of two
                    particular factors. First, Joseph Yong’s statements to Vincent Lim were
                    clearly important to the latter, who was purchasing the paint for the purpose of
                    particular usage. Second, we are inclined to think that if the assurances as to
                    the warranty and sealer coat had not been given, Vincent Lim would not have
                    accepted the proposed paint system and entered into the contract with the
                    Respondent. In <em>Dick Bentley Productions Ltd and Another v
                        Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd</em> [1965] 1 WLR 623 at
                    627–628, Lord Denning MR with his customary acuity pointed
                    out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... if a representation is made in the course of dealings for a contract
                        for the very purpose of inducing the other party to act upon it, and
                        actually inducing him to act upon it, by entering into the contract, that is
                        prima facie ground for inferring that it was intended as a warranty. It is
                        not necessary to speak of it as being collateral. Suffice it that it was
                        intended to be acted upon and was in fact acted on. But the maker of the
                        representation can rebut this inference if he can show that it really was an
                        innocent misrepresentation, in that he was in fact innocent of fault in
                        making it, and that it would not be reasonable in the circumstances for
                        him to be bound by it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since the Respondent undeniably had greater expertise and knowledge of
                    its own products than the Appellant, the inference that Joseph Yong’s
                    statements were intended to be a warranty could not be rebutted. Joseph Yong
                    made his statements to Vincent Lim intending the latter to rely on them. We
                    therefore find the following assurances given by Joseph Yong were express terms
                    of the contract:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Respondent’s Decora Emulsion paint

                            below.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Has there been a breach of an express term of the contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We now consider whether there has been a
                    breach of the contractual terms based on Joseph Yong’s statements about
                    the Bukit Batok project. It was common ground that there were only three
                    possible causes of the paint discolouration, that is to say: defects in the
                    paint’s formulation, the condition of the internal surfaces being painted
                    and/or poor workmanship in applying the paint. However, we immediately rule out
                    the third possibility as a cause of the paint discolouration for two
                    uncontroversial reasons. Poor application of paint often manifests in blisters,
                    bubbles, craters, colour mismatch, gloss variations and/or peeling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> None of these were present on the
                    project’s internal surfaces.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, it was the Appellant’s
                    undisputed evidence that bonding between the different paint coatings, as well
                    as the bonding between coating and the surface, was good. This indicated that
                    the paint had been properly and uniformly applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A skim coat was used to smooth <em>certain</em> parts of the internal surfaces. It was the
                    Respondent’s case that it was the interaction between the paint and the
                    alkaline skim coat which caused an alkali attack that resulted in the
                    discolouration. This was also what the Judge appeared to regard as the most
                    likely cause of the discolouration (see above at [18(c)]). This in turn required
                    consideration of whether there was excessive moisture on the internal surfaces.
                    As water is needed as a carrier for alkali movement,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> its
                    absence would rule out such likelihood. Rajeev Goel testified that when he
                    placed his hand on the internal surfaces, he felt moistness. The Judge, quite
                    rightly, rejected this test because it was unscientific and, importantly, not
                    conducted contemporaneously. Instead, he preferred the testimony of Sundararajan
                    s/o Nadarajan (“Sundararajan”), the onsite supervisor from ESL,
                    the main contractor, testified that as a matter of invariable practice, 30 days
                    had to lapse before he would give permission for paint to be applied on the
                        surface.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> This was to ensure that the surface was
                    absolutely dry. Sundararajan also affirmed:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After I test on the surfaces to be painted to check that there is no
                        excess moisture, I then tell [the Appellant] to start painting works. If
                        there is excess moisture on the concrete then I will not allow [the
                        Appellant] to start painting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At trial, he further elaborated on ESL’s procedure for testing
                    for moisture:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We have the moisture gauge. We use it on the wall,
                            If the moisture gauge shows, the reading shows -- there are three
                            levels, one is green, one is yellow and one is red. So if the green
                            level is somewhere -- if the green level is somewhere 1 to 2, it’s
                            dry.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Even if it is green sometimes, it is 3, I will not allow it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     From this, it is clear that ESL had proper
                    procedures in place to ensure there was minimal moisture on the internal
                    surfaces before any paint application took place. On this issue, the Judge
                    correctly concluded that there was no excess moisture on the surfaces when the
                    painting works commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On the basis of this finding, the Judge could
                    have then ruled out surface conditions as a possible cause of the paint
                    discolouration. If there was inadequate moisture for there to be an alkali
                    attack, then the surface conditions could not have caused the paint
                    discolouration. However, surprisingly, he did not adopt this approach. One
                    reason he gave for not doing so was that Elizabeth Lee could not explain why the
                    discolouration was varied on most, but not all, of the surfaces. In his judgment
                    at [19], he noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the fact that the discolouration occurred in patterns rather than
                        random patches suggested interaction with an underlying substance, rather
                        than defects in [the paint] alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We have difficulty with the Judge’s thinking on this point. In
                    the first place, there was no satisfactory evidence that clearly proved that the
                    parts of the interior walls on which discolouration occurred were the same areas
                    as those on which the skim coat was applied. Furthermore, uncontroverted
                    evidence was adduced to establish that formwork was used to cast the plaster and
                    concrete into shape. This presence of formwork appears to be a plausible reason
                    for the rectangular patterns of discolouration on several of the affected
                    surfaces. Indeed, this is what the Respondent’s own expert, Wong Chung
                    Wan, opined as a possible cause of the patterned discolouration in his
                        report:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he regular (rectangular) patches of discolouration divided by narrow
                        “non-discoloured” strips on ceilings which infers that the
                        characteristics of the substrates had contributed to the phenomenon.
                            <em>The well formed and consistent configurations of the
                            discoloured patches are reminiscent of the formworks arrangement for
                            concreting</em>. Without first hand visual inspection, it is
                        difficult to ascertain the cause of such pattern. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Given this evidence adduced on behalf of the
                    Respondent, we are puzzled how the Judge ruled otherwise, <em>viz</em>, that the pattern of discolouration indicated reaction with
                    the substrate rather than an underlying defect with the paint: see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above. It seems to us that the good adhesion
                    between the different paint coats indicated that there was no alkali movement
                    between the various layers of paint. As explained in both Setsco reports by
                    Elizabeth Lee, an alkali attack is typically characterised by chalking,
                    blistering or efflorences, none of which were present.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In the light of the absence of any
                    credible evidence of excess levels of moisture before the paint was applied, we
                    are satisfied that an alkali attack had not occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Another reason the Judge proffered for not
                    accepting the Appellant’s case theory was that it had used the same paint
                    before without any complaints. We disagree with the Judge’s reasoning on
                    this point on two grounds. The Judge failed to appreciate that the Appellant had
                    earlier complained that the paint which it had used for the Toh Tuck Link
                    project was problematic: see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above. In
                    addition, given that the Respondent did not attempt to show that the paint used
                    in the different projects came from the same batches, the Judge could not and
                    should not have assumed that the paint used in the Toh Guan project, against
                    which there were no complaints, came from the very same batches of paint
                    supplied for the Bukit Batok project. As the paint used were not from the same
                    batches, this reason for not accepting the Appellant’s case theory is more
                    than questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We also do not accept the Respondent’s
                    submission that the compliance of the paint with its manufacturing
                    specifications indicated that the paint was free from defects. The
                    Respondent’s own evidence is that the paint came from 30 different
                    batches. It therefore had to show that the paint from all these batches were
                    free from defects. Here, the Respondent was unable to even begin to discharge
                    this burden as it did not show that all the paint samples it had tested were
                    representative of the paint from the 30 batches used for the Bukit Batok
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The final reason which the Judge gave for not
                    accepting the Appellant’s evidence was that he did not understand why the
                    Appellant took eight months to complain about the discolouration. The Appellant
                    explained that once a floor in the project building had been painted, it would
                    be handed over to ESL. It then immediately informed the Respondent of the
                    discolouration once it had learnt about it from ESL. This is not disputed. We
                    see no reason why this entirely logical explanation was not accepted. In the
                    result, we find that the surface conditions were plainly not the cause of the
                    paint discolouration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Having eliminated two of the three possible
                    causes, it seems to us that the paint discolouration was more likely than not
                    caused by defects in the paint’s formulation. This view is reinforced by
                    the settling effect or coagulation of the paint samples that Elizabeth Lee
                    tested. We preferred her evidence over the Respondent’s experts for
                    several reasons. With a sharp focus on determining the cause of the
                    discolouration, her inquiry was more comprehensive than the reports adduced on
                    behalf of the Respondent. The in-house report only had a narrow remit of
                    determining the alkaline resistance of the coated cement panels. This was not
                    decisive of the issue. Further, Wong Chung Wan’s reports were restricted
                    to evaluating Elizabeth Lee’s report. He had not conducted any independent
                    testing or analysis of his own and had not been to the building site. The Judge
                    did not accept Elizabeth Lee’s conclusions because she had not
                    “explain[ed] to [his] satisfaction how the disintegration of the paint
                    necessarily evidenced defects in [the paint]” and because “the
                    discolouration [occurring] in patterns rather than random patches suggested
                    interaction with an underlying substances [<em>sic</em>],
                    rather than defects in [the paint] alone” (at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> and <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> of the
                    judgment). However, as we noted above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>, the patterns could have been related to the formwork used
                    during the painting process. In addition, Elizabeth Lee’s findings have to
                    be considered in the light of the parties’ acceptance that the
                    discolouration could only have been caused by one or a combination of three
                    things: defects in the paint, poor workmanship and/or surface conditions. While
                    Elizabeth Lee did not <em>irrefutably</em> prove
                    scientifically that there were defects in the paint, she convincingly
                    established that the discolouration was not caused by poor workmanship or the
                    surface conditions and therefore <em>logically</em> proved
                    by the process of elimination that defects in the paint or its unfitness were
                    the root causes of the discolouration. The Respondent tepidly suggested that she
                    had not conducted her tests on representative samples. This conveniently glosses
                    over the fact she had tested two types of samples. The first type was paint
                    provided by the Appellant. The second type was dry samples which her team had
                    cut from the internal surfaces of the project. The Respondent’s criticism
                    could apply to the former, but not the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The legal burden is of course on the Appellant
                    to prove that defects in the paint or its unfitness led to its discolouration.
                    Its evidence eliminated surface conditions and poor workmanship as causes of the
                    discolouration, leaving defects in the paint or its unfitness as the probable
                    cause. On this issue we note that Jaideep Nandi acknowledged that when other
                    possible causes for discolouration were eliminated then paint failure could be
                    attributed to the paint itself:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I refer a paint system one of my basic criteria that I want to ensure
                        is that there is low moisture on the wall, low alkalinity on the
                        wall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If after that, the paint fails, I am clear that the paint is failing
                        surely because of the paint. I mean there is no doubt in my mind. And if you
                        ask me whether the paint does fail ever, yes obviously we have ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Once the evidence logically demonstrated that defective paint was
                        <em>prima facie</em> the likely cause of the
                    discolouration, the tactical burden shifted to the Respondent to show that this
                    was not correct on a balance of probabilities. We should explain that the
                    tactical burden is one that is borne by the opponent of the issue after the
                    proponent has discharged his evidential burden: see Colin Tapper, <em>Cross &amp; Tapper on Evidence</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    12th Ed, 2010) at p 126. The opponent must, in the words
                    of Denning J (as he then was), “call evidence or take the
                    consequences, which may not necessarily be adverse”: see <em>Presumptions and Burdens</em> (1945) 61 LQR 379 at 380.
                    What is needed in any particular case to assess whether this burden has been
                    discharged is a fact-centric exercise circumscribed by commonsense. The
                    Respondent could have, <em>inter alia</em>, adduced
                    evidence that it had not received any complaints from other customers about the
                    paint sold from the same 30 odd batches. Oddly, it failed to do so. Indeed,
                    there is no evidence on record of the paint from these batches being sold to
                    other parties and or that it been used. What happened to all this paint?
                    Instead, the Respondent adduced evidence that attempted to merely show that the
                    manufacture of the paint used for the Bukit Batok project would have, in the
                    ordinary course, complied with the paint’s technical specifications.
                    During cross-examination, Elizabeth Lee rightly accepted that if the paint
                    formulation conformed to standard procedure, there was unlikely to be a problem.
                    This evidence was relevant but not decisive of this issue, especially since the
                    Respondent did not adduce evidence to show the paint it conducted tests on were
                    from the very same batches of paint supplied to the Appellant. The Respondent
                    ought to have also shown that the paint was free from defects from stowage at
                    the point when it was handed over to the Appellant. Regrettably, it failed to do
                    so. Tellingly, we also note that the Respondent did not produce any
                    documentation to substantiate the findings of its internal investigations that
                    the substrate preparation was the root cause of the discolouration despite its
                    insistence that it maintained “detailed logs”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Accordingly, we find that the paint
                    discolouration was more likely than not caused by defects in the Decora Emulsion
                    paint supplied by the Respondent. There has therefore been a breach of the
                    express term of the contract that the Respondent’s paint would be free
                    from defects and fit for application on the internal surfaces of the Bukit Batok
                    project, without the need for a sealer coat (see [27(a)] above). This finding
                    obviates the need to consider whether there is a breach of the implied terms of
                    the SGA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue: What was the cause of the discolouration of the
                paint? </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Test of causation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The <em>but for</em> test
                    of causation in tort also applies in ascertaining whether there has been factual
                    causation for the purposes of contract law. In <em>Sunny Metal
                        &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 782, this court stated (at [63]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, there is no reason why the “but for” test in
                        tort cannot also be used in contract cases to determine the issue of
                        causation <em>in fact</em>... Accordingly, we adopted
                        the tortious test for causation in fact in considering the issue of
                        causation in SME’s claims in <em>both</em> tort
                        and contract. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We note that in his judgment at [19], the Judge held that “[the
                    Appellant] has not proven on balance of probability [<em>sic</em>] that the defects in [the paint] had caused the
                    discolouration”. Seen against the entire tenor of his judgment and how he
                    was singularly focussed in pin-pointing a single cause for the discolouration of
                    the paint, it appears the test of factual causation the Judge applied was
                    whether the defective paints were proven on a balance of probabilities to be
                        <em>the </em><em>only
                        possible</em> cause, rather than the <em>but
                        for</em> cause. This may seem to be a semantic splitting of hairs, but
                    the evidentiary burden on a party and the substantive threshold of a cause of
                    action are two different matters. The balance of probabilities lies in the
                    province of the law of evidence while the test for factual causation belongs in
                    the substantive law of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applying the test of factual causation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As the Judge seemed to have applied the wrong
                    test of factual causation, we have to consider afresh whether the Appellant
                    successfully showed on a balance of probabilities that defects in the paint
                    caused its discolouration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The causal inquiry overlaps with the inquiry
                    as to whether there were defects in the paint. Having eliminated poor
                    workmanship and surface conditions as possible causes of the paint
                    discolouration, we find that defects in the paint were the <em>but for</em> cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The third issue: Is the Respondent’s liability contractually
                limited?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">There is an express warranty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Whether there is a warranty in respect of the
                    Bukit Batok project is the subject of the Respondent’s cross-appeal. The
                    parties have adopted different interpretations of the 13 January 2006
                    letter to the Appellant (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). The
                    Appellant contends that it is an open warranty that applies to all future
                    projects. The Respondent has argued that it only applied to the Toh Guan
                    project. The Judge observed <em>obiter</em> that
                    “[the Respondent] had warranted all its products used in any of [the
                    Appellant]’s projects for a period of 5 years provided that the use was
                    based on a proposed paint system by [the Respondent]” (the judgment at
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We agree with the Judge’s finding that
                    the 13 January 2006 letter was a warranty. The phrase “in any of
                    your up coming project [<em>sic</em>]” clearly means
                    what it plainly states - the warranty was not limited to the Toh Guan project.
                    The Respondent submitted that a warranty cannot be so open-ended but did not
                    cite any authorities for this proposition. Even accepting the Respondent’s
                    argument on its face, the warranty was not <em>carte
                        blanche</em> since the warranty would only apply if the Appellant not
                    only purchased the Respondent’s paints, but also did so in compliance with
                    the latter’s proposed paint system.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The express agreement overrides the exemption clauses </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Our finding that there is a warranty raises
                    the question whether the Respondent is still entitled to rely upon the exemption
                    clauses in the tax invoices and delivery orders to limit its liability, if any,
                    to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In our view, the exemption clauses were not
                    effective in the light of the express warranty. It is well established that an
                    exemption clause contained in a written contract can be overridden by an express
                    warranty given at or before the time the contract was concluded: <em>Couchman v Hill</em> [1947] KB 554. For a concise
                    summary of the law in this area, one may turn to Edwin Peel, <em>Treitel: The Law of Contract</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed,
                    2011) at para 7-041 which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Overriding undertaking</b>. An exemption clause
                        in a document with reference to which the parties contract can be overridden
                        by an express inconsistent undertaking given at or before the time of
                        contracting. Thus a buyer of goods by auction can recover damages for breach
                        of an oral undertaking given at the time of sale although the printed
                        conditions of sale exempt the seller from all liability for defects. To
                        bring this rule into operation, there must be an “express specific
                        oral promise” which is inconsistent with the exemption clause
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We note that <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) vol 1 at para 14-134 also
                    emphatically states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Collateral warranties and guarantees.
                            </b>
<em>A party who would otherwise be entitled to
                            rely on an exempting provision will not be permitted to do so if he
                            gives an express oral warranty which runs counter to the tenor of the
                            written exemption.</em> A warranty given before the agreement is
                        entered into may also be enforced as a collateral contract the consideration
                        of which is the entering into of the written agreement. Thus in <em>Webster v Higgin</em> an oral warranty as to the present
                        condition of a car was enforced as a collateral contract in return for which
                        a contract of hire-purchase, which contained exempting provisions, was
                        signed. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In addition to finding that the
                    13 January 2006 letter was indeed a warranty intended to have contractual
                    force in relation to future projects such as the Bukit Batok project, we also
                    consider it to have been expressly incorporated into the parties’
                    contractual relationship since it was the Appellant’s undisputed evidence
                    that it relied on Joseph Yong’s statements and the 13 January letter
                    before entering into the contract with the Respondent. This warranty takes
                    precedence over any exemption clauses in relation to subject matter it embraces.
                    As such, the Respondent cannot rely on the latter to limit its contractual
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     To summarise, we depart from the Judge’s
                    ruling on the issue of causation. He had made an understandable but,
                    nevertheless, clearly demonstrable error. The parties had agreed that there were
                    three possible causes of the discolouration: defects in the paint’s
                    formulation, the condition of the internal surfaces being painted and/or poor
                    workmanship in applying the paint. For the reasons stated at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> and <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>, we eliminated poor workmanship and
                    the internal surfaces respectively as the likely causes of the discolouration.
                    With the Appellant <em>prima facie</em> proving that
                    defects in the paint had caused the discolouration, the tactical burden shifted
                    to the Respondent to show that the paint it supplied was not defective. It
                    failed to do so. Consequently, we find that the Appellant has proven on a
                    balance of probabilities that defects in the paint were the cause of the
                    discolouration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the
                    cross-appeal, with taxed costs here and below to the Appellant. The assessment
                    of the damages due from the Respondent to the Appellant is remitted to the
                    Judge. The usual consequential orders are to follow.</p>
