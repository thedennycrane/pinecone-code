In the context of this case, “right” can only mean a contractual right arising from or out of the Agreement. When the defendant breached the Agreement, the second plaintiff had the right to enforce the defendant’s secondary obligations arising from his breach of contract. But the choice of advancing further sums to the defendant had nothing to do with the parties’ rights and obligations under the Agreement. The advances took place entirely outside the contractual context of the Agreement. Making those advances could in no way be the second plaintiff’s exercise of a contractual right under the Agreement. That also means that there is no inconsistency sufficient to ground a waiver by election between pursuing the defendant for his breach of the Agreement and advancing further sums to the defendant outside the context of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 I also accept that the later correspondence between the parties with respect to the possibility of a joint venture and incorporating a new company was distinct from matters relating to INS and to the Agreement.

Indeed, as the second plaintiff and the defendant both accept that liability under the Agreement rests with the defendant personally and not with INS – who was not even a party to the Agreement –<span class="font-italic"> </span>the fact that INS had no money would have been wholly irrelevant to the defendant’s obligations under the Agreement and any decision the second plaintiff might have made to pursue or to waive those obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Breach of contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The second plaintiff’s primary basis for the Share Agreement Claim is as damages for breach of contract. The defendant failed to transfer 10% of INS’s shares to the second plaintiff by 24 April 2011. The defendant was therefore in breach of clause (c) of the Agreement. The second plaintiff’s cause of action for a breach of contract accrued on 24 April 2011. The second plaintiff commenced this action on 11 April 2018, more than six years after the cause of action accrued. Mr Wijaya therefore argues that the action is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> time-barred under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Mr Padman argues that the defendant made later payments which constitute part-payments resulting in a fresh accrual of a cause of action under s 26(2) of the Limitation Act. This argument is misconceived in so far as it relates to a claim in damages. Section 26(2) applies only to “a cause of action … to recover any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim”. A claim in damages is not a claim to recover a debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim. Section 26(2) cannot assist the second plaintiff on his claim in damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The second plaintiff’s claim in damages for a breach of the Agreement is not only <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> time barred but is in fact time-barred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 At this point, I observe that I find that the second plaintiff has suffered no recoverable loss by reason of the defendant’s breach of contract. This is not a reason for dismissing the second plaintiff’s claim. This finding – if the second plaintiff’s claim in damages were not time-barred – would entitle the second plaintiff to enter judgment against the defendant but limited to nominal damages. I make this point because it demonstrates the commercial pointlessness of the second plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Mr Padman submits that the second plaintiff has suffered loss and damage quantified at $375,000 as a result of the defendant’s breach.  I do not accept that he has.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> measure of damages in contract is as follows: “where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed” (<span class="font-italic">Robinson v Hartman </span>(1848) 1 Exch 850 at 855). Where a promisor’s breach has caused the promisee to lose something that the promisee would have gained<span class="font-italic"> but for the breach</span>, the promisee’s loss is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the value of the benefit that the promisor failed to deliver or provide. This is known as the promisee’s expectation loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23  In this case, if the defendant had transferred 10% of INS to the second plaintiff in compliance with the Agreement on or before 24 April 2011, the Agreement would have become an executed contract. However, soon after, the Order of Court would have cancelled the shares and the sale to the second plaintiff entirely. In effect, the position the second plaintiff would be in if the Agreement had been performed would have been to have his bargained-for benefit nullified by court order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Moreover, even if the transfer had not been nullified, the INS shares would also have soon after become worthless. INS went into insolvent liquidation in February 2013.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Notes of Evidence, 30 October 2019 at p 7(10) to 7(27); First Plaintiff’s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief at para 11.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The second plaintiff has led no evidence on which I can assess the value of INS shares on 24 April 2011, the date of the breach, or at any point after that date until February 2013, by which time it was manifest that the shares were worthless. If it had been necessary to make a finding on the value of the INS shares as at 24 April 2011, in the absence of any evidence from the second plaintiff to the contrary, my finding would be that they were already by then worthless because of the financial difficulties that INS was facing and the internal shareholder conflict which afflicted the company. On that basis, under the expectation loss metric, the second plaintiff would recover nothing at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The alternative measure of damages in contract is the promisee’s reliance loss. A claim for reliance loss allows a promisee to recover from the promisor the costs and expenses which the promisee incurred in reliance on the promisor’s performing his obligations under the contract, where such costs and expenses are then wasted by the promisor’s breach. A promisee cannot, however, elect reliance loss as the measure of its damages if it has made a bad bargain (<span class="font-italic">C &amp; P Haulage v Middleton </span>[1983] 1 WLR 1461). The burden is on the promisor to prove that the bargain was a bad one (<span class="font-italic">Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd </span>(1991) 17 CLR 64).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore”</span>) explain at para 21.052, this limitation on the recovery of reliance loss is to prevent overcompensating promisees. A promisee who has made a bad bargain would not have recovered its reliance expenditure in full even if the promisor had performed its obligations under the contract. When the contract is breached, to compensate that promisee by an award of its reliance loss would put the promisee in a position better than it would have been in had the contract been performed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Undoubtedly, the second plaintiff could frame his claim in damages for breach of contract as a claim for his reliance loss in the alternative to his claim for expectation loss. That would be a claim to recover the amount of money which the second plaintiff paid to the defendant under the Agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> $375,000. However, as the second plaintiff made a bad bargain, in that he agreed to lend $375,000 in exchange for what I have found to be worthless shares on 24 April 2011, the second plaintiff is unable to recover the $375,000 in damages as reliance loss either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In any event, this analysis is unnecessary for my decision. The claim for damages arising from the breach of the Agreement remains time-barred as stated at [19] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">An action in debt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The second plaintiff’s alternative basis for the Share Agreement Claim is a claim in debt, or a claim for a fixed sum as it is sometimes called. This claim is also unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 An action in debt is conceptually distinct from an action for damages.

The judicially-imposed remedy is performance of the promisor’s primary obligation under the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 But the defendant’s primary obligation under the Agreement was not to repay a fixed sum of $375,000 to the second plaintiff. There is certainly no express term in the Agreement to that effect. The only express primary obligation which the defendant had under the Agreement is set out in clause (c). That clause requires the defendant to transfer 10% of INS to the second plaintiff. Indeed, it would have been a clear breach of the Agreement for the defendant to repay $375,000 to the second plaintiff instead of transferring those shares. There is also no express obligation in the Agreement obliging the defendant to return the $375,000 to the second plaintiff <span class="font-italic">if</span> he fails to transfer the shares pursuant to clause (c). And the second plaintiff does not suggest that there is any implied obligation that the defendant repay $375,000 to the second plaintiff. There is therefore no contractual basis for the second plaintiff’s claim in debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Even if I am wrong to find that the Agreement gives rise to no claim in debt, I agree with Mr Wijaya’s submission that the second plaintiff’s claim in debt is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Mr Padman responds by arguing that the defendant made later payments which constitute part-payments of the $375,000 advanced under the Agreement, resulting in a fresh accrual of a cause of action under s 26(2) of the Limitation Act. The thrust of Mr Padman’s argument lies in the fact that (a) the first plaintiff entered into another agreement – in other words, separate from the Agreement – with the defendant on 25 March 2011 at the behest of the second plaintiff; (b) the funds paid by both plaintiffs pursuant to both agreements to the defendant on 25 March 2011 all came from the same source; and (c) repayments amounting to $40,000 which the defendant later made to the first plaintiff were not directed at any specific debt which the defendant owed to either plaintiff. Therefore, Mr Padman argues, all the repayments should be credited generally to the plaintiffs so as to engage s 26(2) in connection with the Agreement rather than to a particular debt owed to a particular the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I reject this argument. The defendant’s later payments were made to discharge other debts arising under separate agreements which the defendant <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> entered into with the first plaintiff.

As mentioned at [0] above, the Agreement obliged the defendant to transfer 10% of INS to the second plaintiff as his primary obligation under the Agreement within 30 days of the Agreement being signed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> on or before 24 April 2011. The defendant failed to transfer the shares on or before 24 April 2011. That was a clear breach of the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Further, this breach rendered it impossible for the defendant ever to perform his obligations under the Agreement. The defendant’s breach was a breach of a contractual time limit. Once that contractual time limit expired without the defendant having performed, the defendant could thereafter never perform <span class="font-italic">within that contractually stipulated</span><span class="font-italic"> time limit</span>. The defendant’s performance of the Agreement was impossible from 25 April 2011 onwards, given the time-delimited nature of the defendant’s obligation and as a result of his own breach. No doubt the defendant could attempt to transfer shares on or after 25 April 2011. That is the point that Mr Padman makes in his further submissions dated 14 February 2020. But that would not have been contractual performance under the Agreement. Even Mr Padman acknowledges that that would be “late performance”.

The rights issue intensified the pre-existing grievances and disputes which the other shareholders of INS had with the defendant.

</div> The risk of shareholder unhappiness resulting from the dilution of the dissenting shareholders’ shares must have been apparent to the defendant. The looming possibility of litigation to challenge or nullify the resolutions passed at the EGM was foreseeable by the parties on 25 March 2011. Indeed – although it is not necessary for this part of my analysis to make a finding which goes this far – this scheme seems to have been devised in order to entrench the defendant’s control of INS and to marginalise the other shareholders. No doubt, that is why OS 404 succeeded. Certainly, it was at the very least foreseeable for the second plaintiff as well as the defendant on 25 March 2011 that a shareholders’ dispute would arise to challenge the rights issue, resulting in OS 404 being filed in May 2011 and the Order of Court being made in August 2011.

The first defendant in OS 404 was the defendant himself. The second defendant in OS 404, was INS. INS was controlled and managed by the defendant at that time. The defendant therefore played a crucial part in the events which led up to OS 404, in defending OS 404 and in the events which resulted in the Order of Court.

</div> I therefore do not consider that OS 404 and the Order of Court which resulted from it was a supervening event outside the control of the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The purpose of the law of frustration is to release contracting parties from a contractual bargain that has been rendered radically different from that which the parties agreed to when they made their bargain. This suggests strongly that the supervening event must be outside both the contemplation and control of the parties. The Order of Court was neither. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In light of this, the claim based on frustration fails. The Agreement was not frustrated. The second plaintiff cannot recover the $375,000 under s 2(2) of the FCA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Total failure of consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The second plaintiff’s further alternative basis for the Share Agreement Claim is a restitutionary claim for money paid on a total failure of consideration. This claim too fails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 One of the requirements for establishing a total failure of consideration – or a total failure of basis as it is sometimes also called – is that the contract has ceased to be operative (<span class="font-italic">Guinness plc v Saunders </span>[1990] 2 AC 663 at 697). The reason for this, as stated by Professor Graham Virgo in <span class="font-italic">The Principles of the Law of Restitution </span>(Oxford University Press, Third Edition), is to provide a “safeguard against the abuse of the law of restitution by undermining the law of contract” (at 314). The law of restitution has no place in re-allocating risks which have been allocated by the parties’ agreement under a contract which remains operative. As Lord Goff of Chieveley succinctly put it in <span class="font-italic">Pan Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Creditcorp Ltd </span>[1994] 1 WLR 161 (at 164) in the context of an operative clause in the contract:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As between shipowner and charterer, there is a contractual regime which legislates for the recovery of overpaid hire<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">. It follows that, as a general rule, the law of restitution has no part to play in the matter; the existence of the agreed </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">regime renders the imposition by the law of a remedy in restitution both unnecessary and inappropriate. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[emphasis added in bold and italics]</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For this alternative basis, Mr Padman relies on the same facts that ground his claim under the FCA.

</div>
</div> In other words, the sole ground on which Mr Padman relies on to argue that the Agreement has been brought to an end so as to enable the second plaintiff’s restitutionary claim to succeed is that the Order of Court terminated the Agreement by frustration. However, I have already rejected that argument at [54] above. Mr Padman puts forward no alternative basis to wipe away the contract so as to permit recovery on a total failure of consideration. The restitutionary claim must therefore fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Moreover, it cannot even be said that the defendants’ breach of clause (c) of the Agreement has brought the Agreement to an end. A breach of contract brings a contract to an end if and only if:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “the consequences of the breach are such as to deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit that it was intended that the innocent party should obtain from the contract” (<span class="font-italic">RDC </span>at [107]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the aggrieved party accepts the repudiatory breach by “communication or conduct [which] clearly and unequivocally conveys to the repudiating party that the aggrieved party is treating the contract as at an end” (<span class="font-italic">Vitol SA v Norelf Ltd </span>[1996] AC 800 at 810). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The defendant’s failure to transfer the INS shares at all is undoubtedly a repudiatory breach of contract. The failure deprived the second plaintiff of substantially the whole of the benefit that the parties intended he should to obtain from the Agreement. But Mr Padman concedes that the second plaintiff has never accepted the defendant’s repudiatory breach of contract. The contract therefore continues in existence, never having been terminated in any way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The position therefore is that the Agreement remains operative. It is the Agreement and the law of contract which governs the allocation of risks between the second plaintiff and the defendant.

</div> The outstanding balance on the first plaintiff’s loan is therefore $4,000. The defendant has made no part-payments of the loans extended by the second plaintiff. The defendant therefore still owes $10,000 to the second plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiffs are entitled to judgments for these sums respectively.  </div><div class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Exhibition Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Exhibition Claim relates to two primary advances amounting to just under $29,469 and $3,990. The plaintiffs allege these advances are loans which they made to the defendant in January 2012 to cover expenses which he and his associates incurred in attending the Consumer Electronics Show in San Francisco and the Mac World Exhibition in Las Vegas. Mr Padman submits that these expenses were in fact loans by the plaintiffs to the defendant for the defendant’s benefit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendant’s position is that these advances were not loans and were actually part of the plaintiffs’ due diligence expenses. This is because the defendant was already familiar with the market and potential buyers and that it was the plaintiffs who wanted the defendant to attend the Consumer Electronics and Mac World exhibitions in Las Vegas.

It is clear from the degree of formality in the dealings between the plaintiffs and the defendant on the 25 March 2011 agreements and in connection with advances underlying the Repayment Claim that the parties quite conscientiously ensured that their legal obligations were reduced into writing and signed by the parties.

In particular, I bear in mind that the plaintiffs required the defendant to sign the four acknowledgments specifically to avoid the type of argument which the defendant is now raising in respect of this final head of claim.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 If the parties agreed that these two advances amounting to $29,469 and $3,990 were loans, I would have expected the plaintiffs to have recorded that in letters of acknowledgment and to have required the defendant to sign them. After all, this was the course they followed with respect to the Repayment Claim. The inference I draw that these advances were not loans is especially strong because these advances were made at or around the same time as the advances underlying the Repayment Claim <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in January 2012, but were treated so differently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The burden of proof in this action rests on the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence to explain satisfactorily why, if these advances were in fact loans, the plaintiffs treated them so differently from the advances underlying the Repayment Claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As the first plaintiff himself concedes, there are no similar letters of acknowledgment from the defendant regarding these advances. And there is similarly no document, letter or correspondence showing that these advances were in fact loans to the defendant from the plaintiffs.
