restrained the employer from requesting an extension of a performance bond from the bond issuer and also from receiving any money under that bond.  In February 2021, I had set aside the interim injunction pursuant to an application made by the employer.  In the course of the setting aside hearing, I was informed by counsel that the employer and the construction company were already engaged in arbitration over their various disputes.  But, in these present proceedings, parties are yet again before me on matters relating to the interim injunction, and re-treading familiar territory as to the effect and the proper construction of the performance bond.  One of the questions that is posed to me is whether I should grant a fresh injunction in relation to the performance bond to restrain the payment out of the bond sum to the employer, despite having set aside the previous injunction.  All this may sound rather confusing, so I shall start by explaining how parties ended up in this rather perplexing situation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the dispute    </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff in Originating Summons No 335 of 2021 (“OS 335”) and the first defendant in Originating Summons No 745 of 2021 (“OS 745”) is Goldbell Engineering Pte Ltd (“Goldbell”).

In its supporting affidavit for SUM 4652, Goldbell referred to Range’s audited financial statements filed on 2 January 2020 (that it had obtained with the assistance of its solicitors) which indicated that Range had suffered losses in the financial year ending 30 June 2018, which were significantly in excess of its assets, and so Range was balance-sheet insolvent and current-asset insolvent.   According to Goldbell, Range’s auditors opined that this was a “material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about [Range’s] ability to continue as a going concern”.

Mr Tan made some submissions that there was insufficient evidence to show that Range was insolvent.  I was not impressed with these arguments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 What was more persuasive, however, was Mr Tan’s main argument in RA 286 that, since Goldbell would be assured that the sum of $3.8m would be paid under the Bond if it were to succeed in defending Suit 1235, the court should not exercise its discretion to order any security for costs, even if the court was of the view that Range was insolvent.  This is because Goldbell was more than adequately secured.  In this regard, Mr Tan specifically referred to Etiqa’s confirmation, through Mr Phua, and as conveyed to the court by Mr Yim earlier, that it would pay the sum of $3.8m under the Bond to Goldbell if the application to set aside the interim injunction succeeded, or if Suit 1235 was eventually dismissed.

The second was whether Goldbell had behaved fraudulently by issuing the Extension Request.  The third was whether Range had been guilty of failure to make full and frank disclosure when it applied for the interim injunction on an <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> basis.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I rejected the arguments made by Range that the Extension Request was in truth a call on the Bond in full (see Judgment at [5]).  In my view, all Goldbell had done was to request for an extension of the Bond’s validity period until 13 February 2020.  This was in accordance with the terms of cl 6 of the Bond, which granted Goldbell the contractual right – as between itself and Etiqa – to “be at liberty to demand at any time … that [Etiqa] either extend the validity period of [the Bond] or, in lieu of such extension by [Etiqa], make payment forthwith”.  It was then up to Etiqa to choose to decide whether to extend, or make payment of that secured sum to Goldbell, which would then be held as security by Goldbell until the end of the maintenance period.  As such, I could not agree with Range’s argument that Goldbell had made a call on the Bond via the Extension Request.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I also did not accept Range’s arguments that Goldbell had acted fraudulently or unconscionably (see Judgment at [13]).  On the strength of the affidavit evidence before me, there was support for Goldbell’s case that the completion date had been agreed with Range to be on 14 February 2019 so as to “freeze” the accruing of liquidated damages due from Range for the delay in the completion of the Project.  This agreement was subject to the condition that Range would expeditiously carry out rectification of all outstanding defects (see [11] above).  There was therefore some basis for Goldbell’s belief that the maintenance period for the Project ran from 14 February 2019 to 13 February 2020, according to cl 20.1 read with Appendix 1 of the “REDAS Design and Build Conditions of Main Contract”, which was incorporated as part of the Contract’s terms.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Goldbell also referred to the minutes of the 22 Oct 2019 Meeting (see [12] above), where there appeared to be consensus between Goldbell and Range that the maintenance period was still ongoing, and that was why Range stated at the meeting that it was prepared to procure an extension of the Bond.  Under the terms of the Contract between Range and Goldbell, the Bond was required to remain in place until one month after the completion of the maintenance period.  It was also disclosed in the affidavits that, subsequent to the meeting of 22 October 2019, Range had approached Acorn, its insurance brokers, to ask for the premium that was payable to Etiqa for an extension of the Bond’s validity period to 13 February 2020 (see [13] above).  This extended validity date was the same as that in the Extension Request made by Goldbell on 29 November 2019.  Those facts lent credence to Goldbell’s arguments that the parties had indeed agreed to extend the Bond’s validity period until the end of the maintenance period (see Judgment at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I also noted that it was not open to Range to argue that the maintenance period had ended sometime in September 2019 because the Project had been completed in September 2018 (see Judgment at [15]).  This was because of adjudication proceedings between Goldbell and Range that took place after the grant of the interim injunction.  In SOP/AA 180 of 2020 (“SOP 180”) determined on 28 July 2020,

</div> which was an adjudication review lodged in respect of the determination in AA 180, the review panel found that the maintenance period expired on 22 March 2020, as the HOC should have been issued on 22 March 2019.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 There was no question that Goldbell and Range were bound by this determination because of s 21(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed).  Under that section, the binding effect of an adjudication determination on the parties includes a form of issue estoppel binding the parties in relation to the issues determined by the adjudicator, as the Court of Appeal confirmed in <span class="font-italic">Samsung C&amp;T Corp v Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2020] 2 SLR 955 (at [58]).     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In relation to the status of the defects in the Project, I stated as follows (see Judgment at [22]-[24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 [Range] has also set out a number of lengthy submissions as to the nature of the defects in the Project. Essentially, [Range] argues that the number and severity of defects at the time, and the costs of rectification involved, were not such as to justify a request for an extension of the validity period of the bond. This is hotly contested by [Goldbell]. I noted that parties have filed lengthy AEICs, including from experts, to deal with the nature and severity of the defects, and the estimated costs of rectification. However, I find that [Range’s] submissions about the defects miss the crucial point. Given that parties are bound to accept the finding in ARA8 that the maintenance period would not have ended until 22 March 2020, the nature of the defects and the estimated costs of their rectification are not critical to my determination of this application. This is because, under [the Contract] with [Goldbell], [Range] had an option of providing [Goldbell] a cash deposit of 20% of the contract value or a performance bond of that same amount. Whichever course of action was taken, that security was to remain in place until one month after the end of the maintenance period. In fact, as I have already mentioned, [Range] was obliged to ensure that [the Bond] remained valid until <span class="font-italic">at least </span>the end of the maintenance period, which would be 22 March 2020. That being the case, I cannot see how the … Extension Request on 29 November 2019 for [the Bond’s] validity to be extended until 13 February 2020 can be construed to be conduct which is lacking in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 The fact that [Etiqa] might choose to pay the secured sum to [Goldbell] instead of extending the validity of the bond simply brings the parties back to the position under [the Contract], in that any sum paid over will be held as cash security by [Goldbell]. It is of little use for [Range] to complain about such an outcome because that was what the parties had bargained for in [the Contract] as a possible way in which security would be held by [Goldbell]. If [Range] is of the view that the secured sum paid over is then wrongfully retained by [Goldbell] <span class="font-italic">after </span>the period to which it is entitled to hold that sum, then the onus is on [Range] to seek recovery of that sum (or any lesser amount) from [Goldbell] in the arbitration that it has now commenced. That was the allocation of risks to which the parties had agreed in their contractual bargain. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 In this regard, I noted the respective parties’ positions in relation to their claims and counterclaims against each other that will be raised in the arbitration. [Range’s] position is that it is not obliged to pay liquidated damages to [Goldbell] because there was no delay in the completion of the Project and that the costs of rectification any defects are not substantial. On the other hand, [Goldbell] has a potential claim for over S$5m in liquidated damages for delay in completion of the Project, which it is argued had been reinstated by Mr William Chua’s letter of 11 October 2019 because [Range] failed to rectify all the outstanding defects by then, allegedly in breach of the ‘in principle’ agreement reached on 14 February 2019. Added to this, [Goldbell] also has a claim for damages for rectification of defects. These various contentions will be resolved in the arbitration, which is the contractually agreed dispute resolution process. In the arbitration, all the findings in the previous adjudications can be re-visited. My point here is that, from my review of the chronology of events and the correspondence between the parties from the period of September 2018 to November 2019, I am far from being able to conclude that [Goldbell’s] conduct and complaints throughout this period leading to the Extension Request had a whiff of malodorousness, or that the high threshold for showing a lack in <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>had been met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In short, I noted that there were claims and counterclaims between Goldbell and Range about defects and delay.  The claims by Goldbell were substantial, and I was of the view that these issues between the parties should be fully and finally resolved in the ongoing arbitration proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In sum, I was not convinced by Range’s arguments that the high threshold of showing fraud or unconscionability has been demonstrated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Aside from the above, I also accepted Goldbell’s arguments that Range had not made full and frank disclosure of all material facts in its possession when it appeared before the duty judge on 29 November 2019 to argue its application for the interim injunction (see Judgment at [38]).  It is trite that an <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> applicant has a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts in its possession at the time of the application.  Any fact which the court should take into consideration in making its decision is material (see <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Vasiliy Golovnin”</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“<span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin</span>”) at [86]).  This duty of full and frank disclosure extends as well to defences that might be reasonably raised by the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin</span> at [87]).  Mere disclosure of material facts and documents without more or devoid of the proper context is also insufficient; it is for the applicant’s counsel to draw the judge’s attention to them in a fair manner (<span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin</span> at [91]-[94]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Upon a review of Mr Soh’s Affidavit (see [16] above), which Range filed in support of its <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>application for the interim injunction, counsel’s written submissions and the notes of hearing before the duty judge, I found that Range had not set out fairly Goldbell’s side of the story in relation to the maintenance period, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that there was an “in principle” agreement to deem completion as having taken  place on 14 February 2019, and that the maintenance period was thus still ongoing until 13 February 2020.  This was despite Range recognising that the maintenance period issue was material to the question of whether there was a proper request to extend the validity period of the Bond.  Counsel for Range also omitted to highlight to the duty judge the relevant contractual clauses which obliged Range to maintain the validity of the Bond until the end of the maintenance period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I also found that certain critical documents were not disclosed in Mr Soh’s Affidavit.  Chief amongst these was the minutes of the 22 Oct 2019 Meeting.  Those minutes record at para 2.1.11 that Range “is prepared to extend the Bond … and will discuss further with [Goldbell] and [Etiqa]”.  In his oral arguments before me, Mr Tan, on behalf of Range, had candidly acknowledged that these minutes were material, and that it might have been an oversight that the document was not disclosed (see Judgment at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I also found it significant that Mr Soh’s Affidavit did not disclose a WhatsApp message from Mr ES Tang, the quantity surveyor for the Project, dated 15 November 2019, reminding Mr Soh to get the Bond extended because at the “last meeting [referring to the 22 Oct 2019 Meeting] [he] mentioned he will extend [the Bond]” (see Judgment at [36]).  Further, while a series of email exchanges from 24 September to 28 November 2019 between Range’s staff and its insurance broker, Acorn, was exhibited to Mr Soh’s Affidavit (which ran to 987 pages), there was no reference or mention of these email exchanges with Acorn at all in the main body of Mr Soh’s Affidavit.  I was of the view that Range’s counsel ought to have specifically highlighted to the duty judge that these email exchanges indicated that Range had initially considered extending the Bond until 13 February 2020, and explained why that was the case (see Judgment at [36]).  In other words, I found that these material facts should been drawn to the attention of the duty judge for his consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I should add that I did not accept the omissions in relation to Range’s duty of full and frank disclosure were due to inadvertence (see Judgment at [38]).  This was because many of the material documents that were not disclosed dealt with the central issue of whether the Bond’s validity period ought to be extended, and that was at the forefront of the parties’ discussions in the period leading up to Range’s <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> application for an interim injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For the above reasons, I decided that the interim injunction ought to be set aside, and did so order accordingly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I did not make any order for Etiqa to make payment of the secured amount under the Bond (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Prayer 2 of SUM 4065: see [21] above).  This was only because of Etiqa’s undertaking, conveyed by Mr Phua to the court on 25 January 2021, that it would make payment under the Bond to Goldbell if the interim injunction is set aside (see [37] above).  In my view, it had been unnecessary for me to make any further order for Etiqa to make payment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 After receiving the oral judgment, counsel for Range immediately informed me that they had instructions to file an appeal, and they made an oral application for an <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span> injunction (see <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span><span class="font-italic"> Properties Ltd and another v Cheshire County Council </span>[1974] 2 WLR 749 at 755) to restrain any reliance on my decision in SUM 4065 pending the resolution of its appeal.  I declined to grant an <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span> injunction based on an application that was made orally.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The events after the interim injunction was set aside</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Suit 1235 is discontinued</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As it indicated, Range filed an appeal against my decision to set aside the interim injunction.  However, shortly thereafter, it withdrew its appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On 10 May 2021, parties appeared before me and I granted Range leave to discontinue Suit 1235 against Etiqa.  Range also wanted to discontinue the suit against Goldbell, but there was no agreement between parties on whether costs should be payable by Range to Goldbell, and if so, how much.  I thus gave directions for parties to file their respective submissions on costs.  On 16 August 2021, after hearing arguments, I granted Range leave to discontinue the action against Goldbell.  I also ordered Range to pay Goldbell costs and disbursements for Suit 1235, and fixed those amounts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Etiqa fails to pay the secured amount under the Bond</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the meantime, on 18 February 2021, after the court gave its decision ordering that the interim injunction be set aside, Goldbell’s solicitors sent a demand for payment under the Bond to Etiqa’s solicitors.

</div>
</div>  In that letter, Wong Partnership referred to the Judgment that I had delivered that morning and stated that the court had not ordered Etiqa to make payment of the sum of $3.8m under the Bond (see also [55] above).  Then, Wong Partnership proceeded to state in the 18 Feb 2021 Letter that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[w]e hereby put your client, [Etiqa], on notice that in the light of the outcome of SUM 4065, Ang J’s Oral Judgment, and the position taken by [Goldbell] that it did not make a call for payment of any monies guaranteed under [the Bond], your client should <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">not</span> make any payment to Goldbell.

This is because any such payment by Etiqa would not be “in connection with [the Bond]” and would not trigger the indemnity that had been given by Range to Etiqa.

These span from the effect of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> to the proper construction of cl 6 of the Bond.  All these issues, however, are subordinate to the main question which the court must answer.  To my mind, that central question is this – should a party who has taken a certain position before the court in relation to a dispute, which led to certain steps being taken by the other parties to the dispute, and which also led to certain decisions made by the court, be permitted to resile from that position in related proceedings, and take a diametrically different position instead?  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Range argues that Goldbell is taking such inconsistent positions and should be precluded from doing so by the doctrine of approbation and reprobation.  In its oral submission in reply, counsel for Goldbell contends that, on the contrary, it is in fact Range that is approbating and reprobating.  I also have to consider whether Etiqa is attempting a <span class="font-italic">volte-face</span> in respect of its undertaking to the court about its decision to pay over the secured sum under the Bond to Goldbell.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is to this issue of whether the parties are approbating and reprobating that I will first turn.  If and when it becomes necessary to do so, I will also deal with the various other issues raised by the parties. However, before I continue, I should add that it is undisputed that Goldbell’s demand for payment follows from the Extension Request of 29 November 2019 and what transpired thereafter; it was not a call on the Bond under cl 1 - this was made clear by Goldbell and acknowledged by Range in the affidavits which the parties have filed for these proceedings.

</div>
</div>
</div>  This is a point of significance, when considering the parties’ submissions, especially in relation to the position which Range seeks to adopt in the present applications. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Approbation and reprobation</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The doctrine of approbation and reprobation, which is also known as the equitable doctrine of election, precludes a person who has exercised a right from exercising another right which is alternative to and inconsistent with the right he has exercised and the benefits which he has taken before (<span class="font-italic">Treasure Valley</span><span class="font-italic"> Group Ltd v Saputra Teddy and another (Ultramarine Holdings Ltd, Intervener) </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 358<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]).  It originates from the principle of equity that a person who accepts a benefit under an instrument must adopt it in its entirety, giving full effect to its provisions and, if necessary, renouncing any other rights which are inconsistent with it (Piers Feltham, Daniel Hochberg &amp; Tom Leech, <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower: Estoppel by Representation</span> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2004) (“<span class="font-italic">Spencer</span>”) at para XIII.1.10).  As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">BWG</span><span class="font-italic"> v BWF </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1296 (“<span class="font-italic">BWG</span>”), this doctrine has extended into the context of litigation to preclude the adoption by a party of inconsistent positions asserted against the <span class="font-italic">same</span> party or <span class="font-italic">different</span> parties in <span class="font-italic">different</span> proceedings, as long as that party has received an actual benefit as a result of an earlier inconsistent position (at [103] and [118]).  While the doctrine does not - unlike the common law doctrine of election - necessarily require the electing party to make a conscious choice between alternative rights and remedies (see <span class="font-italic">Spencer </span>at para XIII.1.15), a party’s election which gives rise to a prior position must still be reasonably clear to be effective (<span class="font-italic">Aries Telecoms (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v ViewQwest Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 108 at [5]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The “benefit” that triggers the doctrine is generally constituted by a judgment which that party has obtained in his favour in reliance on his prior (and now inconsistent) position, but there is no further requirement that the resulting judgment debt has to be satisfied in order for the requisite benefit to be conferred (<span class="font-italic">BWG </span>at [119]).  The recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle 1 Pte Ltd v Industries </span><span class="font-italic">Chimiques Du Senegal and another appeal and another matter </span>[2021] 1 SLR 342 illustrates this point.  The appellant (“RV1”) was an assignee of debts of the respondent (“ICS”).  RV1 had commenced proceedings against ICS in the Singapore courts to enforce the debt and obtained leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction on ICS.  Subsequently, on ICS’s application, an AR set aside the leave order on the basis that RV1 was in breach of its duty to give full and frank disclosure.  Meanwhile, ICS also commenced proceedings against RV1 in the Senegalese courts seeking a “Declaration to Extinguish Debt”.  RV1 appealed against the AR’s decision, and the High Court allowed the appeal and restored the leave order.  In particular, the High Court held that RV1 had satisfied the relevant jurisdictional gateway under O 11 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) for service out of jurisdiction and that Singapore was the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>to try the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Before the High Court, RV1 argued that its claim against ICS had become time-barred under Senegalese law, a point which the court then considered in the context of assessing the availability of Senegal as an alternative forum in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis (at [96]-[97]).  Before the Court of Appeal, however, RV1 advanced the position that its claim against ICS was no longer time-barred under Senegalese law, in order to refute ICS’s submission on appeal that RV1’s claim lacked sufficient merit for the purposes of obtaining the leave order (at [100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Court of Appeal considered that the inconsistent positions taken by RV1 at first instance and on appeal would have attracted the doctrine of approbation and reprobation if the High Court had, in coming to its decision that Singapore was <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, accepted RV1’s submission that Senegal was an unavailable forum by reason of the time bar (at [101]).  A judgment on the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>issue in RV1’s favour which the High Court arrived at after taking into account RV1’s position on the time bar would constitute a “benefit” for the purposes of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation, and which would preclude RV1 from resiling from that position thereafter.  On the facts, however, since the High Court had found that RV1 could not rely on the unavailability of Senegal to tilt the balance to Singapore as the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, RV1 received no benefit as a result of its earlier position on the time bar, and so the doctrine of approbation and reprobation strictly speaking did not apply (at [101]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  As already mentioned, both Range and Etiqa have argued that Goldbell took inconsistent positions before and during the hearing of the setting aside application in SUM 4065.

</div>  Etiqa alleges that the initial position taken by Goldbell had caused it to be mistaken as to the nature of the Extension Request, in that it understood Goldbell as calling on the Bond and not merely requesting for an extension of the Bond’s validity period, and that purportedly led to Etiqa giving an undertaking to the court at the hearing on 25 January 2021 based on its wrong impression of Goldbell’s intentions.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I start with the Extension Request of 29 November 2019 sent by Goldbell to Etiqa.  In my view, this plainly stated that Goldbell was making a request for an extension of the validity period of the Bond until 13 February 2020 (see [15] above).  The words used by Goldbell in the Extension Request mirror cl 6 of the Bond, and simply pointed out that, if Etiqa decided not to grant any extension, it was obliged to make payment of the secured sum to Goldbell.  Try as I might, I am unable to comprehend how this could have been misconstrued by Etiqa as anything else but a request for an extension of the Bond’s validity period under cl 6.  Indeed, Etiqa’s position at the hearing on 25 January 2021 (conveyed through Mr Phua) was that the Extension Request had been one made under cl 6 of the Bond, in respect of which Etiqa had the right to either extend or pay in lieu of extension, in the event that the interim injunction was set aside (see [37] above).  Etiqa was therefore well aware of its obligations under cl 6 of the Bond.   At the hearing before me on 12 November 2021, Mr Phua informed me that Etiqa had decided, after receipt of the Extension Request, that it would not extend the Bond.  He also informed me that Etiqa would have paid out the secured sum to Goldbell as required by cl 6 of the Bond, but for the intervention of the grant of the interim injunction obtained by Range on 29 November 2019.  In fact, this is also confirmed by the contents of the 22 Feb 2021 Letter by PKWA (see [62] above), which stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the circumstances, it is clear that [Goldbell] did not make a call on [the Bond] for payment on 29 November 2019 but<span class="font-underline"> merely make a request for an extension of [the Bond] to 13 February 2020.  </span><span class="font-underline">However, by reason of the interim injunction, our clients [Etiqa] were not able to consider [Goldbell’s] request for an extension</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, therefore, there is no basis to suggest that Etiqa had in any way been mistaken as to the nature of the Extension Request.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As for Range, given the events leading to 29 November 2019, the issuance of the Extension Request would not have come as any surprise to Range, and neither could Range have been in any doubt that the Extension Request was a request for Etiqa to extend the Bond’s validity period under cl 6, and not a call on the Bond under cl 1.  The two parties had been in discussions about an extension of the Bond’s validity period (see [11]-[14] above).  As already mentioned, in October 2019, Range had indicated that it would be prepared to procure Etiqa to extend the Bond.  Goldbell followed up with that with chasers for updates from Range as to whether the Bond had already been extended.  At some point, Range must have decided that it would not agree to any extension of the Bond and started working with its lawyers on an application to restrain any request for an extension of, or any call, on the Bond.  That is why, even though the Extension Request was only sent by Goldbell to Etiqa at about 1pm on 29 November 2019,

</div> Range’s lawyers, Wong Partnership, had already filed Suit 1235 and its <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> application for the interim injunction shortly before at 12.33pm that same day, supported by Mr Soh’s Affidavit, which ran to 987 pages.  In those circumstances, there can be no doubt at all that Range fully understood that the Extension Request was a request for an extension of the Bond’s validity period, and it was up to Etiqa to extend the Bond or make payment.  Since Range had not agreed with Etiqa to any extension, which was a prerequisite to Etiqa doing so (see [13] above), it follows that Etiqa would have decided to pay out the secured sum under the Bond to Goldbell pursuant to its obligations under cl 6.  Range knew exactly that would happen under cl 6 of the Bond if a request was made by Goldbell for an extension and if it did not agree to an extension of the Bond - that was what parties had bargained for in the Contract as a possible way in which security would be held by Goldbell (see [47] above).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Goldbell’s position in its pleadings in Suit 1235 are no different from the position which it presently takes.  It had taken the position that the Extension Request was a request for an extension of the Bond’s validity period, and that the effect of cl 6 was that, if Etiqa refused to extend, then Etiqa was required to pay over the secured sum for Goldbell to hold the amount as security (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, para 15 of Goldbell’s Defence in Suit 1235).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  I had rejected this argument in my Judgment delivered on 18 February 2021 (see [42] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86  In sum, I do not find that Goldbell has taken inconsistent positions in Suit 1235 and in the present originating summonses.  I find that its position has been consistent, namely, that the Extension Request was a request for an extension of the Bond’s validity period pursuant to cl 6, and that it is now entitled to be paid pursuant to cl 6 because Etiqa had elected to make payment in lieu of such extension pursuant to the undertaking which it had conveyed to the court at the hearing of SUM 4065 on 25 January 2021.  As such, I do not agree with the submissions that Goldbell has approbated and reprobated.  However, most regrettably, the same cannot be said for Range.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I had set out in some detail the position and arguments that Range’s counsel had taken in the 2 December 2020 hearing of RA 286 and SUM 4660 (see [25]-[35] above).  At that hearing, Range had categorically taken the position that, if the interim injunction was to be set aside or if Suit 1235 failed, then it was not in dispute that Etiqa would pay over the secured sum under the Bond to Goldbell.  Counsel for Range referred to Etiqa’s confirmation to Goldbell that such payment would be made.  He argued that, in those circumstances, there was no necessity for any security for costs (even if Range was insolvent) because there was a sum of $3.8m which Goldbell would be holding as security, and from which it could claim its costs if it should succeed in Suit 1235.  On that basis, Range persuaded the court to set aside the AR’s decision to grant security for costs.  Range’s position also directly led to Goldbell’s decision to withdraw its application in SUM 4660 for the fortification of Range’s undertaking to pay damages given in support of the interim injunction.  Just like on the issue of costs, if Goldbell would be holding on to the sum of $3.8m as security in the event that the interim injunction was set aside, there would be no need for any further security to fortify the undertaking to pay damages that might arise if the court were to set aside the interim injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In my judgment, Range is precluded by the doctrine of approbation and reprobation from resiling from the position that it had taken previously in Suit 1235, namely, that Goldbell would be paid the secured sum by Etiqa pursuant to the Extension Request if the interim injunction was set aside or if Goldbell succeeded in defending Suit 1235.  That position was more than “reasonably clear” for all to see - it was the reason why Goldbell withdrew the fortification application in SUM 4660.  In adopting that position, Range successfully persuaded the court that there was no necessity for any order for security for costs because Goldbell was adequately secured by its entitlement to the secured sum under the Bond pursuant to the Extension Request. Range therefore succeeded in RA 286.  The court’s decision to allow Range’s appeal in RA 286 and discharge the order for security for costs made by the AR (see [39] above) was a “benefit” accruing to Range as a result of its prior position.  Having obtained that benefit, Range is now precluded by the doctrine of approbation and reprobation from putting forth a diametrically different position, namely, that Goldbell has no entitlement to the secured sum under the Bond notwithstanding it having made the Extension Request within the Bond’s validity period, for various other reasons which it did not earlier advance.  I took a dim view of Range’s attempt to make such arguments, which are in stark contrast to what its counsel had informed me repeatedly on 2 December 2020 when the arguments in RA 286 were made.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The doctrine of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 As mentioned, Range made a variety of arguments in support of its application in OS 745 for a permanent injunction to restrain Goldbell from receiving any payment under the Bond and to restrain Etiqa from paying on the Bond (see [72]-[73] above).

On the other hand, in determining whether there is an abuse of process that attracts the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, the court looks at all the circumstances of the case and in particular, the following: (a) whether the later proceedings is in substance nothing more than a collateral attack on the previous decision; (b) whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation; (c) whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and (d) whether there are some special circumstances that might justify allowing the case the proceed (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span><span class="font-italic"> v Goh Lian Teck and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]).

The court observed that the following <span class="font-italic">cumulative</span> requirements had to be met before the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception could apply to any case: (a) the decision said to give rise to the issue estoppel had to directly affect the future determination of the rights of the litigants; (b) the decision had to be clearly wrong; (c) the error in the decision had to stem from the fact that some point of fact or law relevant to the decision was not taken or argued before the court which made that decision and could not reasonably have been taken or argued on that occasion; (d) there had to not be any attempt to claw back rights that had accrued pursuant to the erroneous decision or otherwise to undo the effects of that decision; and (e) it had to be shown that great injustice would result if the litigant in question were estopped from putting forth the particular point which was said to be the subject of issue estoppel (at [190]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In oral submissions, counsel for Range emphasised that his arguments in OS 745 focus on whether Goldbell’s demand for payment under the Bond (as opposed to Goldbell’s request to extend Bond’s validity period) is unconscionable.

Any argument about the unconscionability of Goldbell’s present<span class="font-italic"> </span>demand for payment under the Bond is as much an argument about the unconscionability of the Extension Request, an issue which had been conclusively determined in SUM 4065 (see [43] above).

</div> and find that Range is issue estopped from re-arguing this issue again. The court should be “exceedingly slow to permit the re-litigation of decided issues in civil cases in view of the importance of finality in civil litigation” (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [140]).  I also find that this is not a case in which the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception can apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I will also add that, by seeking to focus on Goldbell’s demand for payment in the abstract, Range is effectively trying to characterise the Extension Request as in substance a call on the Bond.  Such an argument had already been raised by Range in SUM 4065, and which I rejected when I held that the Extension Request was a request to extend the Bond’s validity period pursuant to cl 6 and not a call on the Bond (see [42] above).  I therefore find it completely disingenuous for Range to persist in those same arguments before me, which had already been raised at the hearing of SUM 4065 and disposed of. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The other arguments as to why Goldbell should not now be paid the secured sum under the Bond were points which Range could (and should) have raised in SUM 4065.

</div> and that Goldbell failed to act expeditiously to protect its rights under the Bond and allowed it to expire before making the setting aside application only on 21 September 2020 - are premised on a state of affairs identical to that which existed at the time when Goldbell made the setting aside application in SUM 4065 and when that application was heard before me.  Accordingly, there is no reason why these arguments could not have been advanced by Range at the hearing of SUM 4065. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The fact that SUM 4065 had been concerned with a request to extend the validity period of the Bond under cl 6 rather than with a call on the Bond under cl 1 is immaterial.  The plain words of cl 6 make it clear that Etiqa is obliged to pay Goldbell the secured sum if it declines to extend the Bond’s validity period.  Indeed, that was also recognised by Range, as is evident from the terms of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>interim injunction and the reliefs that it had sought in Suit 1235, which restrain Goldbell from “making, claiming, receiving and/or directing [Etiqa] to extend and/or <span class="font-underline">make payment</span> … under [the Bond]” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>  Therefore, Range’s other argument as to why Goldbell should not <span class="font-italic">now</span> be paid - that cl 6 of the Bond provides Etiqa with a “true” or “business” option to make payment in lieu of extension so that Etiqa is no longer obliged to exercise that choice given that the Bond has already expired - is also one which it could and should have put forth in the course of earlier proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The fact that a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings does not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>render the raising of that same matter in later proceedings an abuse of process to attract the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> - the court adopts a broad, merits-based judgment and asks whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([91] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [52], citing <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood (a firm) </span>[2002] 2 AC 1 at 31).  I am, however, satisfied that the threshold of showing an abuse of process has been crossed in this case.   If Range had raised its cl 6 argument at an earlier stage of the proceedings, its earlier position that Goldbell would be entitled to payment of the secured sum once the interim injunction was set aside (see [29] above) would have been inconsistent and unsustainable.  Having obtained a benefit from its prior position (see [88] above), it must surely be an abuse of process for Range to now advance an argument which contradicts that position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As for the other arguments advanced by Range (including those about unconscionability), they focus on Goldbell’s demand for payment in the abstract, notwithstanding Range’s recognition that the demand follows from the Extension Request.  As I have observed earlier, in doing so, Range is effectively seeking to characterise the Extension Request as being in substance a call on the Bond.  Therefore, these are not only arguments which Range could have made in earlier proceedings, they are also premised on a basis which Range must know contradicts the earlier determination of the court in SUM 4065.  That can hardly be anything but an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Further, and in any event, I find these arguments to be without merit. I first turn to Range’s argument about the interpretation of cl 6.  Where a contract gives one of the parties the right to choose between two or more specified modes of performance, it imposes an alternative obligation (see G H Treitel, <span class="font-italic">Frustration and Force Majeure </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Treitel</span>”) at para 10-001).  If one or more of the specified alternatives becomes impossible or illegal after the contract is made, the contract is not discharged so long as at least one of those alternatives remains possible and lawful (<span class="font-italic">Treitel</span> at para 10-001).  However, an exception is made to this rule where the contract, on its true construction, provides for a “true” or “business” option, under which the relevant contractual obligation is to be performed in one way, unless the option holder chooses to substitute another way and does so by the effective exercise of his option, which in so doing he is not bound to consider the convenience or interest of the other party (<span class="font-italic">Reardon Smith</span><span class="font-italic"> Line Ltd v Ministry of Agriculture </span>[1963] AC 691 (“<span class="font-italic">Reardon Smith</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 730).  In the latter situation, since the freedom of choice as to the mode of performance is intended solely for the benefit of the option holder (see <span class="font-italic">Reardon Smith </span>at 730-731), if the primary obligation has become incapable of performance, it will follow that he is not obliged to exercise his choice as to carry out performance in the alternative way; instead, the contract is discharged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 According to <span class="font-italic">Treitel</span>, the following two features distinguish a “true” or “business” option from an alternative obligation (at para 10-007).  First, a “true” or “business” option provides for a <span class="font-italic">primary</span> mode of performance, until and unless the option holder exercises his option to perform in the alternative way.   Conversely, in the case of alternative obligations, either mode of performance is possible until the option holder actually performs the contract.  Second, in a “true” or “business” option, the freedom of choice must have been intended solely for the benefit of the option holder.  Conversely, in the case of alternative obligations, the freedom of choice exists for the benefit of both parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 With these principles in mind, I find that cl 6, on its proper construction, simply provides for an alternative obligation, and does not provide Etiqa a “true” or “business” option, as Range contends.  As I have determined in the Judgment, under cl 6 of the Bond, Goldbell was at liberty to demand that Etiqa extend the Bond’s validity period, and it was then up to Etiqa to choose to decide whether to extend, or, in lieu of such extension, make payment of the secured sum to Goldbell (at [5]).  Very clearly, cl 6 specifies two modes of performance by Etiqa upon Goldbell making an extension request - to extend the Bond’s validity period <span class="font-italic">or </span>make payment of the secured sum under the Bond.  On its face, cl 6 provides for no primary mode of performance - there is no certainty that Etiqa will necessarily extend the Bond on Goldbell’s request.  The very fact that cl 6 provides for Etiqa to make payment <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> lieu </span>of extension leaves the prospect of any extension uncertain as it contemplates the possibility that Etiqa will decline to extend the Bond.  Etiqa’s mode of performing its obligations under cl 6 (whether to extend the Bond or make payment in lieu of extension) will not be known until Etiqa actually performs the contract.  The freedom of choice in cl 6 is also one which is provided for the benefit of Etiqa <span class="font-italic">and </span>Goldbell.  Clause 6 gives Etiqa the freedom of choice to not extend the Bond’s validity period.  The provision for payment in lieu of extension also ensures that Goldbell is not left out of pocket because it will necessarily receive payment of the secured sum if Etiqa chooses not to extend the Bond’s validity period.  As such, as long as Goldbell makes an extension request under cl 6 within the validity period of the Bond, even if the Bond subsequently becomes incapable of extension, Etiqa’s obligation to make payment in lieu of extension, which exists as an alternative to Etiqa’s obligation to extend the Bond’s validity period, survives and is not discharged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Indeed, to construe cl 6 in the way Range does runs contrary to the purpose of the Bond.  If Etiqa is not bound to make payment in lieu of extension, simply because the Bond has become incapable of extension, that will mean that Goldbell may be deprived of security for Range’s performance of its obligations under the Contract through no fault of its own, despite it having made an extension request within the validity period of the Bond.  That would fundamentally alter the nature of Etiqa’s obligations under the Bond and, in the absence of evidence otherwise, could not have been the intention of the parties to the contract.  In my view, it is also important that one should bear in mind the circumstances in this case which gave rise to the inability of Etiqa to perform its obligation to extend or pay.  That situation arose only as a result of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>interim injunction which Range had obtained on 29 November 2019 <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">egregious breach of its duty of full and frank disclosure</span>.  As such, if Range’s submission about cl 6 is to be accepted, it would mean that it would be open to a contractor to deprive its employer of security simply by obtaining <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>injunctions in the way Range did. That would gravely undermine the utility and value of performance bonds as security. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Range’s argument that Goldbell is no longer entitled to hold any sum paid under the Bond as security for Range’s due performance of the Contract because the maintenance period has already expired is also without merit.  As I have emphasised, Goldbell’s demand to payment follows from the Extension Request, which had been made within the validity period of the Bond.  That in itself, coupled with Etiqa’s election to not extend the Bond, triggered Etiqa’s obligation to make payment under cl 6.  There is nothing in cl 6 that provides that the obligation to pay, once triggered, comes to an end when the Contract’s maintenance period has expired.  Range’s argument that Goldbell only has itself to blame for not applying to set aside the interim injunction before the expiry of the period of extension that it had sought also does not bring it very far.  Goldbell’s entitlement to be paid under cl 6 turns solely on whether it had made the extension request within the Bond’s validity period (which it did by making the Extension Request on 29 November 2019).  Exactly when Goldbell makes the setting aside application has no bearing on that issue.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Etiqa has any justification to not make payment of the secured sum </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As for Etiqa, I have already mentioned that there is no factual basis at all in its claim that it had made a mistake in construing the Extension Request as anything but what it expressly stated (see [83] above).  Since contracting parties’ intentions are to be objectively ascertained, the court will nevertheless uphold a contract in spite of a mistake if a reasonable person would have understood the contract in a particular sense, so that the mistaken party remains bound (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span><span class="font-italic">Laws of Singapore </span>vol 7 (LexisNexis, 2019 Reissue) at para 80.158).  In this case, a reasonable person would not have construed the Extension Request as anything but a request to extend the validity period of the Bond, and so Etiqa must be bound to the undertakings which it had given to Goldbell. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I also find that Etiqa’s conduct was no less poor when compared to Range’s.  It is clear that Etiqa was well aware of its obligations under cl 6, which was either to extend the Bond’s validity period or to make payment in lieu of such extension.  Etiqa’s counsel, Mr Phua, confirmed at the hearing of these two originating summonses that his client would have made payment under cl 6 of the Bond to Goldbell.  This was because there was no agreement between Etiqa and Range that the Bond should be extended.  Since the only impediment to payment was the interim injunction obtained <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> by Range on 29 November 2019, Etiqa was prepared to undertake to the court on 25 January 2021 that it would make payment if the interim injunction was set aside.  Sensibly, Etiqa took the position that, even though the Bond had expired on 30 November 2019, it would still pay the secured amount under the Bond to Goldbell.  This was because the Extension Request had been made before the expiry of the Bond, and Etiqa’s obligations under cl 6 had been triggered.  This was undoubtedly the correct legal position to take.  Also, it was precisely because Etiqa had expressed its willingness to the court on 25 January 2021 that it would comply with its obligations under cl 6 that I felt it unnecessary to grant Prayer 2 of SUM 4065 (see [21] above) after I decided to set aside the interim injunction.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Having taken such an unequivocal position, I find it most troubling that Etiqa then decided not to honour its undertaking when Goldbell called on it to make payment on 18 February 2021, after the interim injunction was set aside.  There was really no valid excuse in law for not making payment.  Etiqa had not made any mistake as to the nature of the Extension Request or as to its legal obligations under the Bond arising from the Extension Request when it confirmed with Goldbell’s counsel and then undertook to the court that it would make payment, if the interim injunction was set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 At the hearing of these two originating summonses, it emerged from the submissions of Mr Phua, on behalf of Etiqa, that his client had decided not to make payment only because of the 18 Feb 2021 Letter from Wong Partnership (see [60] above).  In that letter, Range threatened not to indemnify Etiqa if the latter made any payment under the Bond.  It appears then that Etiqa decided that it would be better for it, as a matter of legal strategy, not to make payment to Goldbell <span class="font-italic">unless</span> there was an order of court mandating such payment to be made.  If such an order were made, Etiqa believed that it would be in a stronger position <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Range as far as its claim to an indemnity was concerned.  As a result, Etiqa decided to resist payment <span class="font-italic">with</span><span class="font-italic">out any proper legal basis</span>, and this led to Goldbell having to commence OS 335, and the consequent issuing of the third party proceedings by Etiqa against Range for an indemnity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In my judgment, Etiqa has no legal justification not to make payment to Goldbell of the secured sum under the Bond pursuant to its undertaking given to the court on 25 January 2021.  Its reasons for not making payment are not premised on any legal basis, but simply because it was concerned about getting into further litigation with Range over the enforcement of its indemnity and wanted to improve its position in the event of such litigation.  That being the case, I find that it has no defence to Goldbell’s claim in OS 335.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Etiqa’s claim for an indemnity against Range</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Etiqa’s claim for an indemnity is a straightforward one.  It is based on a written contract of indemnity between Etiqa and Range which was executed by Range in consideration of Etiqa having issued the Bond in favour of Goldbell.  Etiqa relies on cl 1 of the indemnity, which provides that:

As such, Range will be required to indemnify Etiqa in respect the sums that it pays over to Goldbell.  At the hearing, counsel for Range initially conceded that, if the court were to order Etiqa to make payment to Goldbell, then it would naturally follow that Range would be obliged to indemnify Etiqa.  However, counsel subsequently changed his mind and took the position that Range should not be made to indemnify Etiqa because the latter should not have given any undertaking to the court to make payment under the Bond in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I find this argument quite impossible to accept.  It was entirely in line with its legal obligations under the Bond for Etiqa to have made the undertaking to the court.  By giving that undertaking, Etiqa was simply reiterating that it would comply with its legal obligations under cl 6 of the Bond.  As such, for the court to order Etiqa to comply with its undertaking is simply another way of ordering Etiqa to give effect to cl 6 of the Bond.
