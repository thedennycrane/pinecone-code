</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The learned District Judge (“DJ”) below dismissed DC/OA 41. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Both parties proceeded on the common premise that given the nature of the claim, permission of the court was required under s 21(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) for any appeal against the DJ’s decision. The Applicant filed a summons seeking permission from the DJ to appeal against her dismissal of DC/OA 41. Upon her dismissal of the summons, the Applicant filed the present application, pursuant to s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SCJA read with O 18 r 19(2) of the Rules of Court 2021, for permission to appeal against the learned DJ’s dismissal of DC/OA 41.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I dismiss the application and set out my reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Both parties to this appeal were in agreement as to the applicable legal test governing when permission may be granted for an appeal. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong </span><span class="font-italic">and another</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee v Tang</span>”), the Court of Appeal laid out (at [15]–[16]) three non-exhaustive categories when such permission will be granted:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first category would be where there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of error. While, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee v Tang</span> did not specify whether this category relates to errors of fact or law, recent pronouncements of the Appellate Devision of the High Court appear to lean towards the position that the errors should relate to errors of <span class="font-weight-bold">law</span>, while leaving open the question as to whether errors of <span class="font-weight-bold">fact</span> which are “<span class="font-italic">obvious from the record</span>” can justify the grant of permission: see <span class="font-italic">UD Trading Group Holding Pte Ltd v TA Private Capital Security Agent Limited </span><span class="font-italic">and another</span> [2022] SGHC(A) 3 (at [21]), cited by Goh Yihan JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Zhou Wenjing v Shun Heng Credit Pte Ltd</span> [2022] SGHC 313 (“<span class="font-italic">Zhou Wenjing</span>”) (at [30]–[31]). Further, it has also been held that the error must be one that “has a bearing on the decision of” the court below: see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman bin Shariff</span><span class="font-italic"> v Abdul Salim bin Syed </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 138 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman bin Shariff</span>”) (at [31(a)]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second category would be where there is a question of general principle decided for the first time. This category would not apply to a proposed appeal on an issue which is peculiar to the facts of the particular case and not likely to arise in other cases (<span class="font-italic">Essar Steel</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Bayerische Landesbank and others </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 25 at [27(b)]) or if there are mere questions of fact to be considered (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman bin Shariff</span> at [31]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The third category would be where there is a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage. For this category, the test of importance is an objective one. In other words, the question has to be objectively important, and not just important from the perspective of the parties: see <span class="font-italic">Portcullis Escrow</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Astrata (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2010] SGHC 302 (at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee v Tang</span> was also clear, by its use of the word “at least” at [16], that the three categories above are not exhaustive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In laying out the three discrete grounds above, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee v Tang</span> cited with approval (at [15]) the remarks of Lai Kew Chai J in <span class="font-italic">Anthony s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Savarimiuthu v Soh Chuan Tin</span> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 588 (at [2]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The circumstances for granting leave would include (though obviously not limited to) cases where an applicant is able to demonstrate a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of error or if the question is one of general principle upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to public advantage. … These propositions have a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">common thread: that to deny leave may conceivably result in a miscarriage of justice</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The use of the term “common thread” connotes that the requirement of potential miscarriage of justice appears to apply to all three categories above.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At the hearing below, the Applicant argued that the Screen was not being installed on common property (see [1(b)] above). This was a pivotal point – if the balcony walls on which the Screen’s brackets were being mounted constituted common property <span class="font-italic">and</span> the installation of the Screen could be construed as “exclusive use and enjoyment” of those walls (within the meaning of s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the BMSMA), the Applicant would have had to obtain approval by way of a 90% resolution at a general meeting of subsidiary proprietors, for the Screen to be installed. This would have been a difficult hurdle to cross and, without such a resolution, the issue of whether the Respondent should have approved the installation of the Screen would not even arise. Section 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]ith the written consent of the subsidiary proprietor of the lot concerned, a management corporation may make a by-law —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  <span class="font-italic">pursuant to a 90% resolution</span>, conferring on the subsidiary proprietor of a lot specified in the by-law, or on the subsidiary proprietors of the several lots so specified, for a period which exceeds 3 years —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  the <span class="font-italic">exclusive use and enjoyment</span> of; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  <span class="font-italic">special privileges</span> in respect of, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the whole or any part of the common property, upon conditions (including the payment of money at specified times or as required by the management corporation, by the subsidiary proprietor or subsidiary proprietors of the lot or several lots) specified in the by-law …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 During the hearing of the application before me, the Applicant conceded that at least some parts of the walls to which the Screen’s bracket would be affixed <span class="font-italic">were</span> common property. This belated concession flowed from s 2 of the BMSMA, which defines “common property” as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“common property”… means — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in relation to any … building comprised … in a strata title plan, such part of the … building —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not comprised in any lot</span> … in that strata title plan; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lots or …   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) in relation to any … building mentioned in paragraph (a) …, any of the following <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whether or not comprised in a lot</span> … :</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) any <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">structural element</span> of the building;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The walls onto which the Screen was to be installed lay entirely within the Applicant’s lot and, on that account, would ordinarily not have been classified as “common property” under limb (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the definition above.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I agree with the Applicant’s submissions.  In my view, the approach to assessing how common property may be “used” or “enjoyed” (such that exclusion of such use and enjoyment by other subsidiary proprietors gives rise to the exclusivity contemplated by s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the BMSMA) must hinge on the property’s location within the development, as well as the role(s) that the property plays given that location.  Common property consisting of outward facing walls have been taken to play an aesthetic role.  In <span class="font-italic">Sit Kwong Lam v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2645</span> [2018] 1 SLR  790 (“<span class="font-italic">Sit Kwong Lam</span>”), the Court of Appeal observed (at [59]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]ny area or installation that could affect the appearance of a building in a strata development, or that was part and parcel of the fabric of the building, could, by its mere presence, be “enjoyed” by some or even all subsidiary proprietors of the development. Indeed, there was no need for the area or installation to be physically accessible by the subsidiary proprietors (or any of them) in order to be “enjoyed” by the said proprietors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 However, both <span class="font-italic">Wu Chiu Lin</span> and <span class="font-italic">Sit Kwong Lam</span> dealt with features falling within limb (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the definition of “common property” in s 2(1) of the BMSMA.  In contrast, common property consisting of structural elements fall under limb (<span class="font-italic">c</span>).  Where such elements are comprised within the subsidiary proprietor’s lot and inward facing, the approach to assessing if there is exclusive use and enjoyment (within the meaning of s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the BMSMA) ought to be adapted accordingly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Structural features comprised within the lot, if not external facing, do not serve any aesthetic function for the development.  Where the subsidiary proprietor is proposing to perform works on such features, it would not be meaningful for the test (of whether the works amount to exclusive use and enjoyment) to centre on whether the works visually obstruct the feature.  Rather, the test ought to focus on the impact which the works have on structural functionality.  This is because use and enjoyment of such a non-external facing structural feature is derived by other subsidiary proprietors from the structural support which it renders to their respective lots, rather than from visual appreciation.  An example of exclusive use in such a context would conceivably be when the subsidiary proprietor’s works would hinder the management corporation from maintaining the structural feature within his lot.  Such works could potentially deprive other subsidiary proprietors of the structural integrity of that feature.  (For completeness, if the works proposed by the subsidiary proprietor affect the feature’s structural integrity, this would also trigger the prohibition in s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA.) Conversely, if a subsidiary proprietor mounts a painting on a pillar comprised within the inner recesses of his lot, and this pillar constitutes “common property” on account if it being a load-bearing feature, but the painting does not in any way prevent the management corporation from maintaining that pillar, this would not constitute exclusive use and enjoyment of the pillar. In such a situation, aesthetics should not factor into the equation.  It makes no sense to insist that just because persons standing outside the subsidiary proprietor’s window and peering into his lot would be obstructed (by the painting) from viewing the pillar, the subsidiary proprietor is bound to obtain approval by way of a 90% resolution just to mount that painting.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I am mindful that while the Screen’s brackets were being mounted onto the non-external facing parts of the structural elements concerned, the Screen’s roller blind (when drawn down) would obstruct the open space within the Applicant’s balcony, which would otherwise have been visible to outsiders.  However, parties did not contend that this open space was “common property”, such that its obstruction would constitute exclusive use falling within s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the BMSMA.  This was unlike in the case of <span class="font-italic">Wu Chiu Lin</span>, where the subsidiary proprietor was disallowed from obstructing the external facing walls above her unit, which walls <span class="font-italic">were</span> considered common property.  Notably, the Respondent allows rattan blinds to be mounted to the balcony ceilings – parties did not take the position that obstruction of the open space within the balcony by these blinds constituted exclusive use of common property, such that 90% approval under s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA was required for installation of rattan blinds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 While it may be a bit of a stretch to say so, there is arguably a question of general principle which could benefit from more detailed arguments on appeal, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the scope of what constitutes exclusive use and enjoyment of common property comprising non-external facing structural elements comprised within the lot. However, as explained at [6] above, an applicant seeking permission to appeal also needs to demonstrate the prospect of miscarriage of justice if permission is not granted. It is on this that the Applicant fails in his application. The learned DJ did not dispose of the issue of exclusive use and enjoyment solely by applying the test of exclusivity in <span class="font-italic">Wu Chiu Lin</span>. She also found that installation of the Screen would impinge on the Respondent’s ability to maintain and repair the structural elements to which the Screen had been mounted. This impingement had also supported her conclusion that installation of the Screen constituted exclusive use and enjoyment.

</div>
</div> In that respect, even under the approach advocated by the Applicant, the DJ found that there was exclusive use and enjoyment.  The Applicant thus suffered no injustice in this regard. Rather, his main bone of contention appears to be more factual in character. Installation of the Screen would have been more invasive than, say, installation of rattan blinds – the Screen required brackets to be mounted to the walls to seal off access to weather elements and insects. Notwithstanding, the DJ’s finding that mounting of the Screen impinged on the Respondent’s ability to maintain the structural integrity of the walls could have been grounded on a firmer substratum of evidence. For example, expert evidence could have been called to demonstrate the extent to which these brackets hindered structural maintenance of the walls, such that their installation should be considered as amounting to exclusive use and enjoyment. Be that as it may, I am of the view that this is an issue which is factual in nature and does not in and of itself give rise to questions of general principle or public importance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 More importantly, even if the DJ could be said to have erred in law when concluding that there was exclusive use and enjoyment, there would have been no miscarriage of justice arising from the dismissal of DC/OA 41. This is because the DJ went on to find that the Screen failed to keep with the appearance of the rest of the buildings. As will be explained below, I have upheld this finding, which constitutes a separate plank in support of the Respondent’s decision to disallow installation of the Screen. The appeal against dismissal of DC/OA 41 is thus unlikely to succeed, regardless of how the test of exclusive use and enjoyment of structural elements within the lot is couched.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Screen was in keeping with the appearance of the building</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 While I have taken the view that the test of what constitutes exclusive use and enjoyment of non-external facing structural elements comprised within the lot should focus on the impact of the proposed works on structural functionality (rather than on aesthetics), this does not mean that the element of aesthetics is irrelevant. As alluded to at [15] above, the Screen’s roller blinds would (when drawn down) cover the open space within the Applicant’s balcony.  While this did not amount to obstruction of common property, it still affected the overall façade of the building.  On this front, the question of whether installation of the Screen should be allowed hinges on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, compliance with the aesthetic-related clauses found in three legislative provisions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) section 37 of the BMSMA; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) section 37A BMSMA; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) by-law 5 in the Second Schedule to the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 (“BM(SM)R”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Section 37 BMSMA deals with effecting <span class="font-italic">improvements</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">within</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the subsidiary proprietor’s lot</span>.

Both these requirements are necessarily related – the management corporation’s guidelines on aesthetic uniformity would assist in maintaining some degree of uniformity in the appearance of the installations, thereby helping to maintain the aesthetics of the building’s appearance. A fair degree of latitude should be accorded to the management corporation in the promulgation of guidelines on what is aesthetically acceptable and what is not. In <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation St</span><span class="font-italic">rata Title Plan No 940 v Lim Florence Marjorie</span> [2019] 4 SLR 773 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Florence Marjorie</span>”), Vinodh Coomaraswamy J examined the operation of s 37 BMSMA and observed, at [87]–[88]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87 The decision whether the statutory criteria in ss 37(4)(a) and 37(4)(b) are met is within the purview of the management corporation and not the courts. This is apparent from s 37(4) itself, which requires that it is the management corporation who must be satisfied that both subsections are satisfied. Placing the decision-making in the hands of the management corporation is in line with the overall intention of parliament in enacting the Act. … The Act was thus intended to empower management corporations to make decisions in a bid to encourage self-regulation, as government intervention was no longer feasible. … Indeed, similar concerns underlie the Ontario Condominium Act from which the Act was adapted. Thus, an Ontario court in <span class="font-italic">York Region Standard Condominium Corp No 1076 v Anjali Holdings Ltd</span> [2010] OJ No 488 said at [9]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not [the] function [of the] judge, however, to assess the aesthetics of the changes made … As Cusinato J said at paragraph 12: ‘It matters not … that the landscaping appears to be beautifully done, or that all other unit holders find it pleasing.

In that case, the subsidiary proprietors wanted to install fixed awnings to address the issue of “killer litter”, but the management corporation refused to allow this, as its guidelines allowed only retractable awnings. The subsidiary proprietors filed an application that they be allowed to install fixed awnings. The STB rejected the application, ruling (at [25]) that the retractable awnings prescribed by the management corporation’s guidelines were “<span class="font-italic">a necessary, reasonable and proportionate response</span>” to the “killer litter” problem. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Applicant contends that there are no High Court pronouncements on whether the formulation propounded by the STB for assessing the management corporation’s guidelines, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that they be “<span class="font-italic">necessary, reasonable and proportionate</span>”, should in fact be the “controlling principle”

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I reject the Applicant’s submissions on this point. The law on burden of proof is trite and has been repeatedly expounded in our case law. Given that a person seeking to establish a fact bears the burden of proving it, it stands to reason that where a management corporation has issued guidelines to maintain the development’s aesthetic appearance, a subsidiary proprietor seeking to challenge those guidelines as being unacceptable bears the burden of demonstrating this to the court. This position also coheres with the broader policy position, canvassed at [31] above, that management corporations should be given sufficient leeway to dictate what accords with the development’s overall aesthetic theme. This is an important function which, as observed by Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Lim Florence Marjorie</span>, at [91], impacts on the value of the development:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The [MCST] – who, after all, is simply the embodiment of the collective will of … subsidiary proprietors – has passed by-laws which attach special significance to renovations carried out on a balcony. The plaintiff has also enacted specific by-laws to maintain day-to-day aesthetic uniformity of the balcony and therefore the façade, even to the extent of regulating the type, height and quantity of plants that can be grown in planter boxes on balconies and the colour and inclination of awnings. The plaintiff has quite reasonably taken the position that any renovations which affect the aesthetic uniformity of [the development’s] façade ‘may also impact on [the] good image [and] prestige of an upscale and prestigious estate in [the development]’. A lack of uniformity may, in the long term, have a detrimental effect on the value of the flats in a development …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If the management corporation is to perform this function effectively, it should not be put on the defensive and made to justify its guidelines in court every time a subsidiary proprietor sees fit to install something that sticks out like a sore thumb. If the subsidiary proprietor wants to defy the management corporation’s guidelines, he bears the burden of proving why he should be allowed to do so.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This view is also consistent with the observations expressed at the Second Reading speech introducing s 37A of the BMSMA (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(11 September 2017) vol 94 (Desmond Lee, Second Minister for National Development)), where the Minister remarked that the onus of ensuring that installations maintain uniformity with the development’s overall appearance lies with the subsidiary proprietor:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Next, we want to strengthen an existing provision to facilitate SPs’ installation of safety equipment in their own lots. While an existing prescribed by-law states that SPs cannot be prevented from installing any structure or device that prevents harm to children, SPs are also required to seek the MCST’s approval for installations which affect the appearance of the building. There have been cases of MCSTs vetoing SPs’ installation of safety grilles on the basis that the designs affected the building’s appearance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With this amendment …, MCSTs can no longer disallow installations of safety equipment such as grilles installed at windows or balconies. But a new Section 37A(2) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">will place the onus on SPs to ensure that their installations maintain a certain uniformity of appearance</span>. In this regard, developers and MCSTs are encouraged to provide design guidelines for such installations upfront, to guide SPs in achieving the overall desired appearance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In my view, there is no question of public importance or general principle arising here. The burden of proof for establishing that the court should disregard the Respondent’s guidelines lay squarely on the Applicant. Of course, in those instances where the management corporation’s guidelines are clearly unreasonable or disproportionate, the subsidiary proprietor may well face little difficulty in discharging that burden, although this would be highly dependent on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Extent to which a management corporation’s guidelines on aesthetic uniformity can curtail the range of safety equipment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As alluded to above, both s 37A of the BMSMA (in the case of installations within the subsidiary proprietor’s lot) and by-law 5(3) in the Second Schedule to the BM(SM)R (in the case of installations on common property) allow the subsidiary proprietor to install various categories of safety equipment, subject to the restriction that the installation keeps with the appearance of the rest of the building. I have used the term “safety equipment” loosely in describing the installations listed in by-law 5(3), as this by-law does not actually employ that term.  On this, the Applicant points to the following section of the Second Reading speech introducing s 37A of the BMSMA, as support for his view that Parliament intended for subsidiary proprietors to have a wide host of safety equipment to choose from:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Er Dr Lee asked for the definition of ‘safety equipment’ to be extended to cover other items.

</div> The Applicant thus argues that this is yet another question of general principle or public importance that should be ventilated on appeal, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the extent to which a management corporation is entitled to curtail the scope of safety equipment which could be installed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 With respect, the Applicant’s argument is misconceived. Parliament has laid out a wide host of <span class="font-italic">categories</span> of safety equipment. I would agree that the management corporation should not be restricting those categories, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by allowing subsidiary proprietors to install only insect screens but not railings.  Such a restriction would defeat the purpose of s 37A, as it would keep insects out but fail to protect against fall from height. However, what the Respondent did in this case was <span class="font-italic">not</span> to restrict the host of categories, but rather the type of installations <span class="font-italic">within</span> <span class="font-italic">each</span> <span class="font-italic">category</span>. Thus, within the category of insect screens in s 37A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA, the Respondent decided to exclude Fixscreen and Ziptrak. Once a management corporation’s choice of installation (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, invisible grilles and mosquito nets in this case) sufficiently addresses the safety concern sought to be achieved by the specific category of safety equipment prescribed by statute, the subsidiary proprietor’s only remaining grouse would be that the management corporation deprived him of a wider <span class="font-italic">aesthetic</span> array of installations. However, given the observation in <span class="font-italic">Lim Florence Marjorie</span> that the management corporation is typically charged with maintaining the aesthetic uniformity of the development, with a view to preserving the value of the development, it is to be expected that the guidelines promulgated by a management corporation must necessarily curtail diversity of aesthetic designs to some degree.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The real question that the Applicant is raising here is whether the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> to which the Respondent’s guidelines had narrowed the scope of choices within each category of safety equipment was reasonable.
