<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       United Overseas Bank Limited
                    (“UOB”) instituted the main action, Suit No 1057 of 2009/E
                    (“Suit 1057”), against its customer – Tru-line Beauty
                    Consultants Pte Ltd (the “Borrower”), as well as the
                    Borrower’s guarantors – Lee Hwee Loo (“Lee”) and Tan
                    Wei Hong (“Tan”) (collectively referred to as the
                    “Guarantors”), for sums allegedly outstanding under two banking
                    facilities granted by UOB to the Borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Registrar’s Appeal No 261 of 2010/G
                    (“RA 261”) is the appeal of the Borrower and the Guarantors
                    against the decision of the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), in
                    Summons No 1185 of 2010/Y (“Sum 1185”), to grant summary
                    judgment to UOB for its claim in Suit 1057. Registrar’s Appeal No 262 of
                    2010/L (“RA 262”) is UOB’s appeal against the AR’s
                    dismissal of UOB’s application, in Summons No 1184 of 2010/T
                    (“Sum 1184”), to strike out paras 24–31 of the Defence and
                    Counterclaim. I dismissed both appeals on 11 November 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       UOB had granted the Borrower two banking
                    facilities (collectively referred to as the “Banking
                    Facilities”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     a S$450,000 trust receipt facility
                        (“the Trust Receipt Facility”) under a Loan Insurance Scheme
                        III pursuant to UOB’s Letter of Offer dated 25 October 2007
                        (“the 1<sup>st</sup> Facility Letter”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     an overdraft
                        account of up to S$90,000 in respect of the Borrower’s current account
                        (“the OD Facility”) pursuant to UOB’s Letter of Offer
                        dated 29 October 2007 (“the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Facility Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On 22 October 2008, UOB
                    sent a letter to the Borrower notifying it that the Trust Receipt Facility had
                    been extended for a year with effect 26 October 2008 and that all the other
                    terms and conditions contained in the previous facility letter(s) would remain
                    unchanged and continue to be binding on the Borrower (the “Review
                    Facility Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Lee and Tan were joint and several guarantors
                    for the Borrower under two on-demand guarantees in favour of UOB (“the
                    Guarantees”). The guarantee for the Trust Receipt Facility was dated
                    26 October 2007 and had a limit of S$450,000. The guarantee for the OD
                    Facility was dated 29 October 2007 and had a limit of S$180,000. The
                    Borrower’s liabilities under the Banking Facilities were secured by the
                    Guarantees as well as a Letter of Charge and Set-off (the “FD
                    Charge”) executed by Lee in respect of fixed deposits of not less than
                    S$60,000 placed by Lee with UOB. Clause 9 of the Guarantees provided that
                    the Guarantors would be sole and principal debtors <em>vis-à-vis</em> UOB for all the moneys guaranteed. By cl 13 of
                    the Guarantees, the Guarantors agreed to indemnify UOB against all losses,
                    damages, liabilities, claims, costs, charges and legal and other expenses
                    sustained as a result of or arising from the Banking Facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       UOB’s Standard Terms and Conditions
                    Governing Banking Facilities (the “Standard Terms”) were annexed
                    to the 1<sup>st</sup> Facility Letter and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Facility Letter and were binding upon the
                    Borrower. Clause 8 of the Standard Terms stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">8.   WAIVER WITHOUT PREJUDICE</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bank may neglect or forbear to enforce any of the terms in this
                        Agreement or waive on such conditions as it deems fit any breach by you of

                            terms</em> in respect of the existing or subsequent breach.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clause 10 of the Standard Terms provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">10.   EVENTS OF DEFAULT</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the occurrence of any of the following events of default (i) the Bank
                        shall cease to be under any further commitment to you and all outstandings
                        under the entire credit line (“the Outstandings”) shall become
                        due and payable immediately... :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    If you breach any term of this Agreement including
                            failure to pay any amount due under this Agreement on the due date or on
                            demand, if so payable;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    If you are unable to pay your debts when they
                            become due or commit an act of bankruptcy or insolvency;</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    If you default <em>under any other
                                agreement</em> involving the borrowing of money or the
                            granting of advances or credit which gives the holder of the obligation
                            concerned the right to accelerate repayment or withdraw the advance or
                            credit;</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On or about 3 April 2009, UOB issued an
                    irrevocable Letter of Credit No. 1TMLC033498 for the sum of EUR26,565.42
                    (“the L/C”) to the Borrower in favour of Davines S P A
                    (“Davines”). At the material time, the Borrower was Davines’
                    local exclusive distributor of hair products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 21 May 2009, UOB faxed a document titled
                    Collection Notice Term Bills to the Borrower (“the Collection
                    Notice”) informing the Borrower that UOB had received documents from
                    Davines for the sum of EUR26,565.42 in respect of the L/C and seeking the
                    Borrower’s instructions with regards to discrepancies in the documents.
                    The reference number for the Collection Notice was 1TMTB011222. The Borrower
                    ticked and signed an option on the Collection Notice which stated that it
                    required a Trust Receipt. It returned the Collection Notice to UOB on the same
                    date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 26 May 2009, 9 June 2009 and
                    10 June 2009, UOB had sent SWIFT messages to Davines’ negotiating
                    bank to inform it that the documents remained refused and that UOB was holding
                    the documents until it received “a waiver from [the Borrower] and
                    agree[d] to accept it, or receive[d] further instructions from [Davines’
                    negotiating bank], prior to agreeing to accept a waiver”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As the Borrower failed to repay UOB the moneys
                    owed under three bills outstanding on the Borrower’s current account (Bill
                    No. 1TMIL102592 for EUR43,990.29; Bill No. 1TMIL110572 for EUR9,398.26; and
                    Bill No. 1TMIL102928 for US$20,926.80), UOB sent a letter of demand (the
                    “Recall Letter”) on or about 8 July 2009 to the Borrower and
                    the Guarantors demanding that they make full payment of the outstanding due
                    within five days from the date of the Recall Letter, failing which all of the
                    Borrower’s Banking Facilities would be deemed to have been recalled by UOB
                    and UOB would proceed to uplift the fixed deposit pledged under the FD Charge.
                    Although there was a typographical error in Tan’s address (the street
                    number was stated as “83” instead of “82”), Tan did
                    not dispute receipt of this letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It was undisputed that the Borrower and the
                    Guarantors failed to comply with the demands stated in the Recall
                Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     UOB recalled the Banking Facilities on or
                    about 13 July 2009. UOB also sent Lee a Withdrawal Advice slip dated
                    31 July 2009 to inform Lee that UOB had uplifted a fixed deposit under the
                    FD Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 3 August 2009, UOB sent a letter to
                    the Borrower to inform it that Bill No. 1TMTB011222 for the amount of
                    EUR26,565.42 under the L/C would be due on 18 August 2009 (“the Term
                    Bill Notice”). The Term Bill Notice stated:</p>

                    message to Davines’ negotiating bank to inform it that UOB was returning
                    the full set of discrepant documents (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above) on that day. On 17 August 2009, UOB sent a Debit Advice to the
                    Borrower informing the Borrower that UOB had deducted the sum of S$170.00 from
                    the Borrower’s account as cancellation charges under the
                L/C.</p>

                    of demand to the Borrower demanding payment of the total outstanding sums under

                    and legal costs. The letter to the Guarantors stated that a copy of
                    R&amp;T’s letter of demand to the Borrower dated 24 August 2009 was
                    enclosed but the Guarantors claimed that the said letter was not in fact
                    enclosed. R&amp;T’s letters were served on the Borrower and the Guarantors
                    by way of AR Registered Mail and Certificate of Posting. The letters to the
                    Guarantors were not sent to their address as stated in the Guarantees but were
                    instead sent to their addresses as stated in an Enhanced Instant Search on the
                    Borrower which UOB conducted on 14 August 2009. The Borrower and the
                    Guarantors did not dispute UOB’s claim that they had acknowledged receipt
                    of R&amp;T’s letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     According to UOB, by a letter dated
                    23 September 2009, R&amp;T notified the Borrower and the Guarantors that
                    the sum of EUR128,182.24 as stated in the letters mentioned at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above was reduced to EUR101,616.82, due to
                    the cancellation of the L/C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Borrower and the Guarantors exhibited, in
                    their joint affidavit of 5 April 2010, a letter dated 30 October 2009
                    from Davines which stated that Davines would not be renewing its distribution
                    agreement dated 25 June 2009 with the Borrower on its expiry on
                    31 December 2009. The reason given in the letter was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a matter of fact that there has been a <em>significant default</em> in payment<em>s</em>. (which we have revised it according to your request, but
                        unfortunately, <em>the payment schedule was not
                            adhered</em>) [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 15 December 2009, UOB filed a Writ of
                    Summons and Statement of Claim against the Borrower and the Guarantors in which
                    it sought:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     the total outstanding sum of
                        S$25,772.98 (inclusive of interest) due and owing in respect of the OD
                        Facility, plus further interest from 9 December 2009 up to the date of
                        full payment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     the total outstanding sum of EUR102,931.47 and US$21,550.63 due and owing
                        in respect of the Trust Receipt Facility, plus further interest from
                        9 December 2009 up to the date of full payment and all loss in foreign
                        exchange, if any; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     costs and disbursements on a full indemnity
                basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 27 January 2010, the Borrower and
                    Guarantors filed a joint Defence and Counterclaim. It was admitted in
                    paras 9 and 15 of the Defence and Counterclaim that the Borrower did not
                    pay UOB the outstanding sums stated in the Recall Letter and that an event of
                    default had occurred under cl 10(a) of the Standard Terms (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). The main grounds of the Defence were
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     each Facility Letter and the
                        Standard Terms annexed thereto constituted a separate and distinct agreement
                        between the Borrower and UOB and UOB could only recall the facility in
                        respect of which the Borrower was in default, and not all banking facilities
                        granted to the Borrower;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     UOB had continued to grant banking facilities under the
                        Trust Receipt Facility to the Borrower notwithstanding the non-compliance
                        with the demands stated in the Recall Letter; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     the liability of the Guarantors had
                        not arisen since UOB did not give an effective or proper service of a
                        written demand on the Guarantors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I would mention that the Defence and
                    Counterclaim also alleged that the guarantee dated 26 October 2007 was not
                    binding on the parties as there was no consideration from UOB in respect of that
                    guarantee. No elaboration was given of this defence. Neither was it pursued in
                    arguments before me. I will therefore not say any more about this
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At paras 24–31 of the Defence and
                    Counterclaim, it was alleged that UOB had wrongfully, and in breach of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Facility Letter, terminated the L/C which had
                    been issued to Davines in payment of the goods purchased by the Borrower from
                    Davines and that this had caused Davines to decide not to renew or extend the
                    Borrower’s exclusive distribution agreement with Davines, thereby
                    occasioning loss to the Borrower. It was pleaded at para 22 of the Defence
                    and Counterclaim that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    The Defendants will seek to set-off so much of the
                            Counterclaim herein as will be sufficient to diminish or extinguish the
                            Plaintiff’s claim herein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     UOB’s pleaded response to the issues
                    raised in paras 24–31 of the Defence and Counterclaim, as stated in
                    UOB’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim filed on 9 February 2010, was
                    that it was lawfully entitled, under the terms of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Facility Letter,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Facility Letter, Standard Terms and Review
                    Facility Letter, to terminate the whole of the Banking Facilities, including the
                    L/C. I noted that the issues highlighted at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above (and discussed at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> below) with regards to the discrepancies in the L/C and the
                    communication between UOB and Lee on whether the L/C documents ought to be
                    rejected because of the discrepancies were not raised in UOB’s pleadings
                    albeit they were subsequently discussed in an affidavit filed on behalf of UOB
                    on 23 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The application to strike out paras 24–31 of the Defence
                and Counterclaim (RA 262)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     UOB’s application to strike out
                    paras 24–31 of the Defence and Counterclaim was made pursuant to
                    O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“RoC”) and was made on the ground that the
                    counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and/or:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     was scandalous, frivolous or
                        vexatious; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action;
                        and/or,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     was
                        otherwise an abuse of the process of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The main issue in the counterclaim was whether
                    UOB’s cancellation of the L/C was wrongful and in breach of contract and,
                    if so, whether this had occasioned loss to the Borrower for which it was
                    entitled to claim damages from UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The L/C was an <em>irrevocable</em> documentary credit. An irrevocable credit
                    constitutes an independent contract between an issuing bank and the beneficiary
                    which, in the absence of fraud, is not affected by any irregularities in the
                    underlying contract in pursuance of which the credit was issued (see <em>Brody, White and Co Inc v Chemet Handel Trading (S) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 146 at [19]). The principle of autonomy
                    of credit, excepting fraud, is sacrosanct in the law of letter of credit and any
                    inroad into the principle will undermine and annihilate the trust and confidence
                    in the use of documentary credits in international trade. As such, the
                    contractual relationship between the issuing bank and the applicant for the
                    credit cannot affect the relationship between the issuing bank and the
                    beneficiary (<em>Agritrade International Pte Ltd v Industrial and
                        Commercial Bank of China</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 322 at [21] and
                    [22]). UOB’s pleaded defence to the counterclaim, <em>ie</em>, that it was entitled to recall all banking facilities
                    granted to the Borrower (including the L/C), was irrelevant to the issue whether
                    it ought to pay on the L/C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Para 9(d) of the Defence and Counterclaim
                    acknowledged that UOB had sent the Collelction Notice (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above) to the Borrower. The Collection Notice,
                    as exhibited in affidavit evidence, referred to two discrepancies: (1) the
                    L/C had expired; and (2) the invoice showed that the product was free of
                    charge. It was the Borrower’s position (as pleaded at paras 9(e)-(f)
                    of the Defence and Counterclaim) that the Borrower had indicated to UOB that it
                    wished to accept the discrepancies and that it required a Trust Receipt to
                    finance the payment. On the other hand, UOB alleged, in para 32 of an
                    affidavit filed on its behalf by Lau Kim Koon (“Lau”), a First
                    Vice President of its Group Special Assets Management, on 23 April 2010,
                    that on 26 May 2009, the Borrower had informed UOB that the Borrower wished
                    to reject the documents from Davines in view of discrepancies. Lau was relying
                    on a handwritten note to this effect made by a UOB staff, one Pui Wah, about a
                    telephone conversation with one Lisa. The handwritten note was made on a copy of
                    the Collection Notice. Lau’s allegation that the Borrower had rejected the
                    documents was not pleaded by UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In her affidavit filed on 3 May 2010, Lee
                    confirmed that she is known as Lisa Lee but she disputed that she had informed
                    Pui Wah that the Borrower wished to reject the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In view of the disputed facts and UOB’s
                    failure to raise the discrepancies in the L/C in its pleadings, it was arguable
                    that the Borrower had positively responded to UOB’s inquiry (in the
                    Collection Notice) whether to accept the discrepancies (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above) and that consequently UOB was obliged to
                    pay on the L/C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The question whether UOB’s omission to
                    pay on the L/C had caused Davines to terminate the distributorship agreement
                    with the Borrower was another, although related, matter. On this question, I
                    noted that Davines’ letter dated 30 October 2009 (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) referred to a significant default of
                    more than one payment because the plural “payments” was used. In
                    addition, the Borrower had apparently suggested a payment schedule which it did
                    not adhere to. The letter therefore suggested that the non-payment by UOB under
                    the L/C was not the true cause for Davines’ termination of the
                    distributorship agreement. However, no further evidence was given on this
                    question and I was not able to reach any conclusion on the question.
                    Accordingly, I declined to strike out paras 24–31 of the Defence and
                    Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The application for summary judgment (RA 261)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     UOB’s claim against the Borrower and the
                    Guarantors was premised on their failure to effect repayment of sums due under
                    the Banking Facilities granted to them by UOB. The Borrower and the Guarantors
                    did not dispute the amount owing to UOB. They also did not dispute that they had
                    received the letters of demand sent by R&amp;T (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). The grounds of the Defence, as set out at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above, are discussed below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   Whether UOB was entitled to recall the Trust Receipt
                Facility when the Borrower had only defaulted under the OD Facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Recall Letter (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) clearly stated that <em>all</em>
                    banking facilities would be recalled if the outstanding sums due to UOB were not
                    settled. The argument by the Borrower and the Guarantors that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Facility Letter and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Facility Letter were separate and independent
                    agreements and that UOB was not entitled to recall the Trust Receipt Facility
                    when the Borrower had only defaulted under the OD Facility was unsustainable in
                    light of cl 10(e) of the Standard Terms (as set out at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) which clearly allowed UOB to recall the
                    Banking Facilities as long as the Borrower defaulted under <em>either</em> the Trust Receipt Facility <em>or</em> the OD Facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   Whether UOB had waived its right to recall the Trust Receipt
                Facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     By the end of July 2009, UOB had recalled the
                    whole of the Banking Facilities and had proceeded to uplift a fixed deposit of
                    S$61,142.47 pledged under the FD Charge. The Borrower and the Guarantors were
                    informed of this series of events. The Term Bill Notice dated 3 August 2009
                    (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above) was a reminder to the
                    Borrower to pay outstanding sums in a bill that was rendered pursuant to the L/C
                    which was granted <em>before</em> the Recall Letter was
                    sent (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> and <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) and was <em>not</em> a further
                    grant of banking facilities to the Borrower. Although the Borrower had
                    indicated, in its reply to the Term Bill Notice on 7 August 2009, that it
                    required a trust receipt to settle the bill, such a trust receipt was never in
                    fact granted to the Borrower as is evident from the fact that the sum of
                    EUR26,565.42 due under the bill referred to in the Term Bill Notice was
                    classified as an amount due under a “Letter of Credit facility”
                    instead of under the Trust Receipt Facility in UOB’s letter of demand
                    dated 24 August 2009 (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above).
                    In any event, pursuant to cl 8 of the Standard Terms (as set out at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), any indulgence or waiver granted by UOB
                    was without prejudice to its right to recall the Banking Facilities at its sole
                    discretion where there had been a breach of the agreements between the parties.
                    UOB had, at the latest, exercised this right on 23 September 2009 (see
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), after the bill stated in
                    the Term Bill Notice was due.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c)   Whether UOB had given an effective or proper service of a
                written demand on the Guarantors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Guarantors claimed that UOB had not given
                    an effective or proper service of a written demand on them. Two reasons were
                    cited by the Guarantors as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     the letter of demand to the Borrower
                        dated 24 August 2009 was not enclosed in the letter of demand to the
                        Guarantors dated 21 August 2009 (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     the service of the letters of demand on the Guarantors by
                        AR Registered Post was bad because the notices were not sent to the
                        Guarantors’ address as stated on the last page of the
                        Guarantees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I was of the opinion that the
                    Guarantors’ liability to UOB had arisen in the present case for the two
                    reasons below (at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> and <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     First, whilst the Guarantors’
                    obligations under the Guarantees only arose when a demand in writing was made
                    against them (pursuant to cl 1 of the Guarantees), there was no legal
                    requirement that the letter of demand to the Borrower had to be provided to the
                    Guarantors. The letters of demand to the Guarantors dated 21 August 2009
                    and 23 September 2009 clearly stated the amounts owing to UOB by the
                    Borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Secondly, whilst it would have been advisable
                    for R&amp;T to have sent the letters of demand to both the Guarantors’
                    address as stated in the Guarantees as well as the Guarantors’ last-known
                    addresses, its failure to do the former did not affect UOB’s claim against
                    the Guarantors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Clause 1 of the Guarantees provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... we the undersigned hereby unconditionally guarantee that we will
                            <em>on demand in writing made on us</em> pay to you
                        or discharge on a full indemnity basis all moneys and liabilities whatsoever
                        which shall for the time being be due owing or incurred by [the Borrower]
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clause 28 of the Guarantees stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.    NOTICES – Any demand, notice or other
                            communication to [the Guarantors] <em>may be
                                sent</em> by telefacsimile, telex or otherwise in writing to
                            the telefacsimile number or telex number last known to [UOB] or to [the
                            Guarantors’] <em>registered address</em>. Any
                            demand, notice or other communication made or given to [the Guarantors]
                            shall be <em>deemed to be received</em> ... (if
                            sent by telefacsimile or telex) on the day of despatch or two (2) days
                            after being sent by prepaid post to [the Guarantors’] registered
                            address and in proving such service it shall be sufficient to prove that
                            the demand, notice or communication was properly addressed and posted.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was arguable that the reference to “registered
                    address” in cl 28 meant the address stated in the last page of the
                    Guarantees as asserted for the Guarantors. Even then, I was of the opinion that
                    cl 28 was intended for UOB’s benefit and was permissive rather than
                    mandatory. Therefore, the interpretation relied on by the Guarantors, UOB would
                    be able to rely on the deeming provision in cl 28 if the letters of demand
                    had been sent to the address stated in the last page of the Guarantees. As they
                    were not sent to that address, UOB would have had to prove that the demands had
                    been received by the Guarantors if that was an issue. However, the Guarantors
                    did not dispute that they had received the letters of demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Guarantors submitted that the common law
                    position required that personal service of the letters of demand be effected if
                    the contractual mode of service (<em>ie</em> cl 28 of
                    the Guarantees) did not apply. The Guarantors relied on the holding of the
                    Malaysia High Court in <em>Allied Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v Yau Jiok
                        Hua</em> [1998] 6 MLJ 1 (“<em>Allied
                        Bank</em>”) (at 36D-I) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In this case, there is no evidence of any agreement
                        between the parties with regard to the mode of service of the notice of
                        demand. The only provision on this issue is contained in the letter of offer
                        which merely states that repayment shall be on demand without condescending
                        to particularize the form of service. <em>This, to my mind,
                            means that the notice of demand must be served personally on the
                            defendant in the absence of any agreement to the contrary</em>. In
                        saying this, I draw support from the book entitled <em>Law of
                            Banking</em> (3<sup>rd</sup> Ed)
                        (Vol II) by Poh Chu Chai where the learned author in writing on service
                        of notices of demand in guarantee cases says at pp 352-353:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">When a guarantee imposes a duty on a creditor to give a notice of
                            demand to a guarantor, there is a presumption that the notice will be
                            served on the guarantor personally unless the manner in which the notice
                            is to be served is spelt out in the guarantee. The requirement for
                            personal service imposes an additional burden on a creditor. In
                            practice, it is more usual for a guarantee to provide for the form and
                            manner in which a notice of demand is to be served on a guarantor. Very
                            often, a guarantee will allow a creditor to serve a notice of demand on
                            a guarantor either by ordinary mail or by registered mail instead of by
                            way of personal service. This mode of service is equivalent to a form of
                            substituted service. Under this mode of service, a creditor discharges
                            his duty to a guarantor the moment a notice of demand is duly addressed
                            and posted. The risk of a notice going astray and not getting to a
                            guarantor owing to a miscarriage by the post office falls on the
                            guarantor as the parties have by agreement thrown the risk of
                            miscarriage on the guarantor. Equally, if a guarantor avoids the receipt
                            of a notice of demand, either by changing his address without notifying
                            the creditor or refuses to accept delivering of the notice, he is deemed
                            to have notice of the letter of demand the moment a notice duly
                            addressed is posted.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On appeal from the decision of the Malaysia
                    High Court in <em>Allied Bank</em>, however, the Court of
                    Appeal held that the High Court’s ruling that the notices of demand had to
                    be served personally could not be comprehended. The Court of Appeal held ([2006]
                    5 MLJ 145 at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... There is no express provision for personal service amongst the terms
                        and conditions stated in the letter of offer which is the agreement and such
                        a ruling would tantamount to importing a term into the agreement. We do not
                        think that the court could under the circumstances of this case read into
                        the agreement such a term or condition. In conclusion we would hold that the
                        learned JC was wrong in law and in fact in not admitting in evidence the
                        said notices of demand and the AR cards. On the evidence, the demand was
                        received by the respondent or his office staff, ie, his servant or agent and
                        the learned JC should have held that a valid demand has been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There was no express provision for personal
                    service amongst the terms and conditions of the Guarantees and I did not read
                    such a term into the Guarantees. To avoid confusion, I would mention that the
                    reference to “personal service” in the passages quoted above
                    should not be equated with “personal service” under the RoC.
                    O 62 r 2 of the RoC, which states that personal service must be
                    effected by a process server of the Court or by a solicitor or a
                    solicitor’s clerk whose name and particulars have been notified to the
                    Registrar, only applies to “personal service” of a document which
                    by an express provision of the RoC or by order of the Court is required to be so
                    served (see O 62 r 1 of the RoC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The purpose of making a written demand on the
                    Guarantor is to ensure that he is made aware when his obligation is triggered
                    and to give him an opportunity to meet his obligation. As mentioned, the
                    Guarantors did not dispute that they had in fact received the letters of demand.
                    The Guarantors need not have been direct recipients of the letters of demand
                    from UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(d)   Whether the counterclaim may be set off against UOB’s
                claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Borrower and the Guarantors argued that
                    the Borrower had a valid counterclaim against UOB for UOB’s failure to
                    honour the L/C and that this counterclaim may be set off against UOB’s
                    claim. The Borrower and the Guarantors submitted that the court should not grant
                    judgment to UOB or, if judgment was granted, it should be stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In <em>United Overseas v Peter
                        Robinson (trading as Top Shop)</em> (Civil Division, 26 March
                    1991, unreported), Bingham LJ, in delivering the judgment of the English Court
                    of Appeal, summarised the approach of the court to set-offs and counterclaims
                    raised in opposition to summary judgment applications. Bingham LJ’s
                    guidelines were adopted by the Singapore High Court in <em>Hawley
                        &amp; Hazel Chemical Co (S) Pte Ltd v Szu Ming Trading Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2008] SGHC 13 at [33] where Lai J set out the four classes of cases
                    in the court’s determination of whether summary judgment should or should
                    not be granted as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The first class would be where the defendant can
                        show an arguable set-off whether equitable or otherwise. To the extent of
                        such set-off, the defendant would be entitled to unconditional leave to
                        defend. It would be for the judge to decide whether such an arguable set-of
                        is shown or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The second class would be where the defendant sets
                        up a bona fide counterclaim arising out of the same subject-matter as the
                        action and connected with the grounds of defence. In this class of case, ...
                        the order should not be for judgment on the claim subject to a stay of
                        execution pending trial of the counterclaim, but should be for unconditional
                        leave to defend even if the defendant admits the whole or part of the
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The third class would be where the defendant has no
                        defence to the plaintiff’s claim so that the plaintiff should not be
                        put to the trouble and expense of proving it, but the defendant sets up a
                        plausible counterclaim for an amount not less than the plaintiff’s
                        claim. In such a case, the order should not be for leave to defend, but
                        should be for judgment for the plaintiff on the claim and costs until the
                        trial of the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    The fourth class would be where the counterclaim
                        arises out of quite a separate and distinct transaction, or is wholly
                        foreign to the claim, or there is no connection between the claim and the
                        counterclaim. The proper order should then be for judgment for the plaintiff
                        with costs without a stay pending the trial of the counterclaim.</p>

                        Salam</em>, Menon JC said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Potter LJ reviewed the authorities at [24] – [30] of
                        the judgment, and the following propositions emerge from the
                        authorities:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    There is a general right to equitable set-off
                                in cases where there is a close relationship or connection between
                                the dealings and the transactions which give rise to the respective
                                claims : see <em>Hanak v Green</em> [1958]
                                2 QB 9.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    It is not necessarily the case that the claim
                                and cross-claim must arise out of the same contract: see <em>British Anzani (Felixstowe) Ltd v International Marine
                                    Management (UK) Ltd</em> [1980] 1 QB
                            137.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    There is no universal rule that claims arising
                                out of the same contract may be set against one another in all
                                circumstances: see <em>The Government of Newfoundland
                                    v The Newfoundland Railway Company</em> (1888) 13 App
                                Cas 199.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    In determining how close the connection needs
                                to be, the court should not get bogged down in the nuances of
                                differently expressed formulations, save that there must be a close
                                and inseparable relationship between the claims. Beyond this, the
                                outcome can be left to be governed by notions of fairness and
                                whether the circumstances are such that it would be manifestly
                                unjust to allow one claim to be enforced without regard to the
                                other: see <em>Bim Kemi</em> ... at
                                [29].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Menon JC also said at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The question of whether a sufficient degree of closeness is
                        established in the connection between the respective claims is not
                        determined by some sort of formulaic process. In each case, the question
                        turns on whether the respective claims are so closely connected that it
                        would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one claim to
                        be enforced without regard to the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Although the Borrower’s claim was in
                    respect of UOB’s cancellation of the L/C and the L/C was issued pursuant
                    to one of the Banking Facilities and UOB was claiming for sums due and payable
                    to it under the Banking Facilities, I was of the view that this did not give
                    rise to a sufficient degree of proximity to raise a set-off. The claim by UOB
                    did not include any sum in respect of the L/C. The Borrower’s claim in
                    respect of the L/C was separate from UOB’s claim. This was also a case
                    where UOB should not be put to the trouble and expense of proving its claim
                    since its claim was admitted. I was therefore of the view that judgment should
                    be entered for UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(e)   Whether there should be a stay of execution if judgment is
                granted to UOB</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The degree of connection between the claim and
                    counterclaim, the strength of the counterclaim and the ability of a plaintiff to
                    satisfy any judgment on the counterclaim are some of the considerations which
                    the court may take account of in the exercise of its discretion whether or not
                    to order a stay of execution of judgment (see <em>Singapore Civil
                        Procedure 2007</em>, Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia at pp144 and 145 in the
                    commentary at O14/4/10 headed “Set-off and Counterclaim”). I have
                    already expressed my view on the degree of connection between the claim and
                    counterclaim. Secondly, as elaborated at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above, the counterclaim was suspect and it might even turn
                    out to be fraudulent. Thirdly, it was indisputable that UOB could satisfy any
                    judgment obtained by the Borrower in its counterclaim. In the circumstances, I
                    declined to order a stay of execution on the judgment for UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed both
                    appeals. I made no order on costs for each appeal.</p>
