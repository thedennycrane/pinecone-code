<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1

        This is an appeal against the decision of the

High Court, made on an application for the determination of a question of law under O.14 r

12 of the Rules of Court, where it was held that the respondents, as the confirming bank,

were entitled to refuse payment under an irrevocable letter of credit on the ground that a

material document tendered by the appellants was a forgery and was null and void.</font>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facts</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2        The

material facts leading to the action are straightforward and not in dispute. The

appellants, Beam Technology (Mfg) Pte Ltd (‘the sellers’), a Singapore company,

contracted to sell electronic components to an Indonesian buyer, PT Mulia Persada Permai

(‘the buyers’). As required under the sale contract, the buyers obtained the

issue by PT Bank Universal HO Jakarta of a letter of credit (LC) for a sum of US$277,500

in favour of the sellers. The LC was subject to the terms of the Uniform Customs and

Practice for Documentary Credit, 1993 Revision (‘UCP 500’). The respondents were

the confirming bank of the credit.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3        Under

the terms of the LC, one of the documents required to be tendered to draw on the credit

was a "full set of clean air waybill …" The buyers notified the sellers

that the air waybill would be issued by their freight forwarders, "Link Express (S)

Pte Ltd". </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4        On 14

July 2000, the sellers presented to the confirming bank the documents required in order to

draw under the LC. On 17 July 2000, the confirming bank issued a notice of rejection

informing the sellers that there were certain discrepancies in the documents. The

particulars of those discrepancies are immaterial for the purposes of this appeal. Two

days later, the confirming bank further notified the sellers that the air waybill was

issued by a non-existing entity in that there was no company known as "Link

Express(S) Pte Ltd". Hereinafter we shall refer to this company as "Link

Express". On the evening of the same day, the confirming bank returned all the

documents to the sellers on the ground that the air waybill was a forgery. Subsequently,

the sellers sought to re-present the documents but the confirming bank refused to accept

any further presentation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5        

Following the sellers’ commencement of the action to claim for the payment due under

the LC, the confirming bank applied to court for a determination of the following question

of law:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Whether the defendants as a

    confirming bank of the letter of credit No. 073001005900 was entitled not to make payment

    under the said letter of credit because an air waybill No. 618-63187228 purportedly issued

    by a freight forwarding company called Link Express (S) Pte Ltd, which was one of the

    documents required to be presented and was in fact presented by the plaintiffs under the

    letter of credit, was a forgery known to the defendants. Solely for the purpose of this

    application, it shall be assumed that the forgery was not carried out by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6        The

High Court allowed the application and ruled that the confirming bank was not obliged to

pay and dismissed the action. Being dissatisfied with that determination, the sellers have

appealed to this court. Besides the substantive issue, the sellers have also raised before

us a procedural point, i.e., whether the question posed is an appropriate one to be dealt

with under O 14 r 12(1).</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Order 14 r 12(1)</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7        The

argument of the sellers on this issue is that the question posed to the court is not

suitable for a determination under O 14 r 12, as it will not fully determine any issue of

the action. The sellers’ contention is that the confirming bank is not entitled, in

the absence of fraud on the part of the beneficiary, to look beyond the face of the

documents tendered. What is crucial is compliance on the face of the documents and not

compliance in fact. And even if this argument were to be unsustainable, the bank should

comply with Article 14 of UCP 500 and it had not so complied because it had not set out in

their notice of 17 July 2000, as required under Article 14(d)(ii), all the discrepancies

in respect of which the bank refused the documents. So even if there was a third party

fraud exception, the confirming bank was precluded from claiming that the documents were

not in compliance, having regard to Article 14(e) (quoted below at 11).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8        It is

clear that O 14 r 12(1) can be invoked to determine "any issue" in the cause,

without it also disposing of the entire cause: see <i>Payna Chettiar v Maimoon bte Ismail </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11088&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 387</a>. The question which the court was asked to determine in the present case would

not require the calling of any witnesses, as it was assumed that the air waybill was a

forgery and the sellers had obtained and tendered the documents to the confirming bank in

all good faith.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9        The

sellers seem to be saying that it was not enough merely to assert that the air waybill was

forged, the bank must also comply with the notice requirements prescribed under Article

14(d)(ii). The question posed is also flawed as it only focused on the fact of forgery but

failed to take into consideration the notice requirements prescribed in Article 14.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10        As

we see it, the question posed raises the issue as to whether a confirming bank can,

independently of the grounds set out in Article 14 relating to discrepancies, refuse

payment on the separate and distinct ground that a material document tendered to draw on

an LC is forged and of no effect. Putting it another way, can a confirming bank, in a case

where there is no discrepancy in the documents tendered, nevertheless refuse payment

because they have reliably established that a material document is forged? Ordinarily such

a question, which would be decisive of the action, would be suitable for determination

under r 12(1). But for reasons which will become apparent when we proceed to deal with the

substantive question, we think that in the circumstances of the present case, there ought

to be a trial.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Relevant provisions</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11        

Turning now to the substantive issue, it is necessary that we should first set out the

relevant provisions of UCP 500 which governed the LC in question:-</font>

  </blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12        It

is clear from these provisions of the UCP 500 that the opening of a confirmed LC imposes

upon the banker an absolute obligation to pay, irrespective of any dispute there may be

between the parties as to whether the goods are up to contract or not: see also <i>Hamzeh

Malass &amp; Sons v British Imex Industries Ltd</i> [1958] 2 QB 127 at 129.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13        The

banker is only concerned with documents and what the credit requires them to be, not with

goods or the contract which requires them to be paid for. If he does what he is told, he

is safe; if he departs from the terms and conditions of the credit, he acts at his own

risk. He is not obliged to go behind the documents and to consider whether the terms of

the underlying contract conforms to the terms of the LC or whether they have been or will

be performed: see Article 3a of UCP 500 and <i>Equitable Trust Co of New York v Dawson

&amp; Partners Ltd </i>[1927] 27 Lloyd’s Rep 49.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14        

Therefore, visual inspection of the actual documents presented is all that is called for.

Of course, the bank must examine them with reasonable care to ascertain that they appear

on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of credit. A bank is under

no duty to take further steps to investigate the genuineness of a signature which, on the

face of it, purports to be the signature of the person named or described in the letter of

credit: see <i>Gian Singh &amp; Co Ltd v Banque de l’Indochine </i>[1974] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15        It

is also settled law that where a confirming bank has paid on a credit in the face of <i>prima

facie</i> compliant documents, the confirming bank, and in turn the issuing bank, are

entitled to claim reimbursement from the applicant. This was unequivocally stated by Lord

Diplock, delivering the opinion of the Privy Council in <i>Gian Singh </i>(at 757), in

these terms:- </font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The fact that a document

    presented by the beneficiary under a documentary credit, which otherwise conforms to the

    requirements of the credit, is in fact a forgery does not, of itself, prevent the issuing

    bank from recovering from its customer moneys paid under the credit. The duty of the

    issuing bank, which it may perform either by itself, or by its agent, the notifying bank,

    is to examine documents with reasonable care to ascertain that they appear on their face

    to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit. The express provision to

    this effect in article 7 (now art 15 of UCP 500) of the Uniform Customs &amp; Practice for

    Documentary Credits does no more than re-state the duty of the bank at common law."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16        

However, nowhere in this statement was the Privy Council addressing the situation where

the confirming or issuing bank was aware, within the prescribed seven day period and prior

to any payment being effected, that a material document tendered was a forgery and

nullity. This was not an issue that was before the court in <i>Gian Singh</i>. Therefore,

the opinion expressed therein, which on the face is broad, must be considered with care.

Reasoning by analogy is not always appropriate. As will be discussed shortly, the House of

Lords in a case in 1981 recognised that the issue was still open.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17        

There is a dearth of authorities touching on this issue. It appears that there are only

two cases which expressly dealt with the point although the facts there were not on all

fours with the instant case. The first is <i>United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd &amp;

Anor</i> <i>v Royal Bank of Canada &amp; Ors</i> [1981] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 604, where the

bills of lading falsely stated that the goods were put on board the vessel on 15 December

1976 at London when in fact it was a day later, on the 16 December, and also not at London

but at Felixstowe. The plaintiffs, the beneficiaries, were not aware of the falsehood. The

question was whether those bills of lading were a forgery or were they to be treated as

valid documents containing inaccuracies. In a sense each of the bills did tell a lie about

itself – that it was executed on December 15, when in fact it was executed on

December 16. It also contained two lies about its contents – the date of shipment and

the place of shipment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18        At

first instance, Mocatta J held that unless there was personal fraud or unscrupulous

conduct on the part of the seller plaintiffs, and there was none there, the bank must pay

against documents which were <i>prima facie</i> conforming. His decision was reversed on

appeal. Stephenson LJ, who delivered the leading judgment, said, after reviewing the

authorities, (at p. 623):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"But whether or not a forged

    document is a nullity, it is not a genuine or valid document entitling the presenter of it

    to be paid and if the banker to which it is presented under a letter of credit knows it to

    be forged he must not pay."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19        Lord

Justice Ackner, the second member of the quorum, put the issues presented in these terms

(at p.628):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If the signature on the bill of

    lading had been forged, a fact of which the sellers were <i>ex hypothesi </i>ignorant, but

    of which the bank was aware when the document was presented, I can see no valid basis upon

    which the bank would be entitled to take up the drafts and debit their customer. Mr Hirst

    was virtually obliged to accept this. A banker cannot be compelled to honour a credit

    unless all the conditions precedent have been performed, and he ought not to be under an

    obligation to accept or pay against documents which he knows to be waste paper. To hold

    otherwise would be to deprive the banker of that security for the advances, which is a

    cardinal feature of the process of financing carried out by means of the credit: see <i>Gutteridge

    and Megrah, The Law of Bankers Commercial Credits, 6<sup>th</sup> ed</i>., at p. 142.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20        

However, on further appeal, the decision of the Court of Appeal, holding that the bank was

not obliged to pay on the credit because the bills of lading contained falsehoods, was

overturned by the House of Lords. The House restored the decision of Mocatta J. In coming

to its decision, the House had regard to the following significant features. The goods

sold were ready for shipment in the beginning of December 1976. It was intended that the

goods would be shipped on a vessel due to arrive at Felixstowe on 10 December 1976. All

parties had acquiesced to changing the loading port to Felixstowe instead of London.

However, the arrival of that vessel at Felixstowe was cancelled and the loading brokers

substituted it with another vessel scheduled to arrive only on 16 December 1976, one day

after the latest date of shipment prescribed under the documentary credit. The goods were

loaded on that day itself but the loading brokers, acting as agents for the carrier, put

the date 15 December 1976 on the bills of lading as if that day was the day on which the

goods were received on board. The brokers handed the bills to the sellers in return for

payment of the freight. On 17 December, the documents were presented to the confirming

bank for payment. Various points of objection relating to the bills of lading were taken.

The upshot of it all was that amended bills, together with other documents, were

re-presented to the bank on 22 December. The bank refused to pay because it had obtained

information "which suggested that the shipment was not effected as it appeared in the

bills of lading". The trial judge found that an employee of the loading brokers

deliberately made a false entry as to the date of shipment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21        Lord

Diplock, having noted that there was no direct authority on point, whether in the United

Kingdom or the United States, went on to state that the issue had to be decided on first

principles. He said that in such a nature of international trade, there were four separate

but yet interconnected transactions: (i) the contract of sale and purchase; (ii) the

contract between the buyer and the issuing bank; (iii) the arrangement between the issuing

bank and the confirming bank and (iv) the contract between the confirming bank and the

seller. The case only concerned the fourth contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22        Lord

Diplock observed that the object of this system of confirmed irrevocable documentary

credit was to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parted with control

of the goods and that "does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the

performance of the contract of sale being used on a ground for non-payment or reduction or

deferment of payment." However, he also said that the one established exception to

the general statement of principle as to the contractual obligations of the confirming

bank to the seller was where the seller "fraudulently presents to the confirming bank

documents that contain, expressly or by implication, material representations of fact that

to his knowledge are untrue …" The rationale for the exception was the principle

"fraud unravels all".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23        Lord

Diplock further amplified that the contractual duty between the confirming bank and the

issuing bank, and as between the issuing bank and the buyer under the credit, was "to

examine with reasonable care all documents presented in order to ascertain that they

appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit"

and if they so appeared, to pay on it. He referred to Article 7 of the then UCP (now

Article 15 of UCP 500) which provided that neither the confirming bank nor the issuing

bank assumed any liability or responsibility to one another or to the buyer "for the

form, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness, falsification or legal effect of any

documents."</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24        His

Lordship also noted that there was a distinction between a document which was a nullity

and that which only contained some inaccuracies. In respect of the former situation, his

Lordship left the question open:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"I would prefer to leave

    open the question of the rights of an innocent seller/beneficiary against the confirming

    bank when a document presented by him is a nullity because unknown to him it was forged by

    some third party."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25        But

in so far as the inaccuracy as to the date of shipment on the bills of lading was

concerned, Lord Diplock was of the view that the bills were far from being a nullity. He

said:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"It was a valid transferable

    receipt for the goods giving the holder a right to claim them at their destination,

    Callao, and was evidence of the terms of the contract under which they were being

    carried."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thus the House allowed the appeal

on the ground that the bills of lading were not null and void but only that they contained

inaccuracies.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26        The

question left open in <i>United City Merchants </i>came up for consideration in <i>Montrod

Ltd v Grundkotter Fleischvertriebs GmbH</i> [2001] 1 All ER (Comm) 368. There, the credit

required the presentation of inspection certificates signed by the applicant for the

credit, who had provided finance to the buyer of the goods. The buyer informed the seller,

the beneficiary under the credit, that one of its employees should sign the inspection

certificates on behalf of the applicant. The seller, honestly thinking that it had the

applicant’s authority, signed the certificates on behalf of the applicant, and

presented them for payment. In accordance with the terms of the credit, payment was to be

effected 45 days after presentation of the documents. Before the expiry of the 45 day

period, it became apparent that the applicant had not given any authority to the seller to

sign the certificates. The bank nevertheless paid on it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27        It

was argued that the certificates were a nullity and as the bank knew of it before payment,

the bank should not have paid the seller. At first instance, the Deputy High Court Judge

(Deputy Judge) held that the seller did not act fraudulently when its representative

signed the certificates and that the seller was entitled to payment. The issuing bank was,

in turn, entitled to reimbursement from the applicant. The Deputy Judge was of the view

that the banks need only consider the documents alone and should not take into account

other matters. He felt that the fraud exception should be restricted to a case where there

was fraud or knowledge of fraud on the part of the beneficiary or other party seeking

payment. He concluded by stating that -</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"the nullity exception

    should and does form no part of English law. It is unsupported by authority. It provides a

    further complication where simplicity and clarity are needed. There are problems in

    defining when a document is a nullity."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28        On

appeal, Montrod argued that besides fraud on the part of the beneficiary, there should

still, in law, be room for a nullity exception where a document tendered was worthless,

which was really a natural extension of the fraud exception. The fraud exception allowed

the court to intervene to prevent the perpetration of fraud on the part of the beneficiary

or other presenting party. It was contended that surely the court should also intervene

where the document presented was a nullity even though the beneficiary did not know it.

However, Potter LJ, who delivered the sole judgment of the court, rejected the suggestion

of a nullity exception. He said (at p. 273):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The fraud exception to the

    autonomy principle recognised in English law has hitherto been restricted to, and it is in

    my view desirable that it should remain based upon, the fraud or knowledge of fraud on the

    part of the beneficiary or other party seeking payment under and in accordance with the

    terms of the letter of credit. It should not be avoided or extended by the argument that a

    document presented, which conforms on its face with the terms of the letter of the credit,

    is none the less of a character which disentitles the person making the demand to payment

    because it is fraudulent <i>in</i> <i>itself,</i> independently of the knowledge and bona

    fides of the demanding party. In my view, that is the clear import of Lord Diplock’s

    observations in <i>Gian Singh</i> and in the <i>United City Merchants</i> case, in which

    all their Lordships concurred. As I understand it, Lord Diplock was of the view that a

    seller/beneficiary who was ignorant of forgery by a third party of one of the documents

    presented, or of the fact that the document contained a representation false to the

    knowledge of the person who created it, should not be in a worse position than someone who

    has taken a draft drawn under a letter of credit in circumstances which rendered him a

    holder in due course. While he left open the position in relation to a forged document

    where the effect of the forgery was to render the document a ‘nullity’, <u>there

    is nothing to suggest that he would have recognised any nullity exception as extending to

    a document which was not forged (i.e., fraudulently produced) but was signed by the

    creator in honest error as to his authority, nor do I consider that such an exception

    should be recognised.</u></font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That being so, I do not consider

    that the fact that in this case it was the seller/beneficiary himself who created the

    document said to be a nullity should <i>of itself</i> disentitle him to payment, assuming

    (as the judge found) that such creation was devoid of any fraudulent intent and was

    effected in the belief that GK enjoyed the authority of Montrod, as applicant for the

    credit, to sign and issue the certificate. Although the circumstances were highly unusual,

    they may none the less be regarded as no more than an illustration of the wide variety of

    circumstances in which documents come into existence in a commercial context which do not

    necessarily reflect the factual situation but which parties may none the less employ as a

    convenient means of progressing a particular transaction. If, in the circumstances of a

    multipartite transaction, a seller/beneficiary is indeed led to believe that he has

    authority to create and present a certificate of inspection for the purpose of triggering

    payment by letter of credit, I do not see why he should be regarded as any less entitled

    to payment in accordance with UCP 500 than in a case where he receives from a third party

    a document regular on its face which has, unknown to him, been created without

    authority." (Emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29        

Potter LJ also thought that as a matter of policy, the UCP 500, which embodied the

international banking practice, should be interpreted and applied to ensure certainty and

precision. He felt that if the court were to create a general nullity exception, the

formulation of which was insusceptible of precision, that would involve making undesirable

inroads into the principles of autonomy and negotiability universally recognised in

relation to letters of credit transactions.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30        At

this juncture we should refer to a local first instance case, <i>Mees Pierson N Bay

Pacific (S) Pte Ltd &amp; Ors </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59742&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 4 SLR 393</a>, where one of the documents required

for presentation to the confirming bank, a health certificate, was a forgery. At the time

of presentation, neither the seller nor the confirming bank had knowledge of the forgery.

The confirming bank accepted the documents and paid the sums under the credit. When it

subsequently discovered the forgery, it sought to recover the sum from the seller.

Rajendran J dismissed the bank’s claim on the basis that the bank had already

accepted the documents and made payment under the credit. Further, it had also failed to

give the necessary notice of rejection within the period stipulated under article 14(d) of

the UCP 500. Rajendran J, however, expressed, <i>obiter</i>, the following opinion at 40

of the judgment:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When a confirming bank makes a

    payment out under a commercial credit, the bank holds the documents as security for the

    payment. However, if the bills of lading are forged and therefore a nullity, the bank

    would not have any security. <u>To require the bank to make payment when the bank knows

    that the bills of lading are a nullity is to require the bank to knowingly forgo its

    security. That would be tantamount to requiring the bank to honour the credit on terms

    less favourable to the bank than that envisaged under the credit arrangement</u>.

    (Emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Rajendran J would appear to have

accepted the reasoning expounded by Ackner LJ in <i>United City Merchants</i>.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our views</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31        In

summary, the current position of the law would appear to be this. The House of Lords in <i>United

City Merchants</i> had left open the question whether there is a nullity exception

although at the Court of Appeal all the three members of the quorum thought there was. In <i>Montrod</i>

the Court of Appeal (of a different quorum) was inclined to the view that, apart from the

traditional fraud exception (i.e., fraud or knowledge of fraud on the part of the

beneficiary or other party seeking payment), there was no separate nullity exception. In

any case, even if there was such a nullity exception, it held that the certificate issued

by the seller in <i>Montrod</i> in honest belief that he had the authority of the

applicant of the LC could not be a nullity. Perhaps another way of differentiating <i>Montrod</i>

from the present case is that there the certificate required was not an essential document

but one touching on the question as to the quality of the goods sold. In short, there is

no definite authority on point, although the views of the Court of Appeal in <i>United

City Merchants </i>are no doubt highly persuasive.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32        It

seems to us that the issue must be approached on first principles. It is clear that the

obligation of the issuing/confirming bank towards the beneficiary is independent and

separate from the contractual obligations between the seller and the buyer, and the

obligation to pay is absolute irrespective of any dispute that may arise between the

seller and the buyer. As far as the confirming or negotiating bank is concerned, their

duty is only to verify whether what appears on the documents conforms with what is

required by the credit. If there is <i>prima facie</i> compliance, the bank is authorised

to pay and may claim reimbursement from the issuing bank notwithstanding that a document

tendered may subsequently turn out to be a forgery: <i>Gian Singh</i>. This is to protect

the bank and to ensure the smooth flow of international trade and the avoidance of delay.

But we are unable to see why such a rule should also lead to the result that if the

confirming or negotiating bank, from whatever source, is able to establish within the

prescribed seven day limit that a material document tendered is a forgery, being null and

void, the bank is nevertheless obliged to pay.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33        

While the underlying principle is that the negotiating/confirming bank need not

investigate the documents tendered, it is altogether a different proposition to say that

the bank should ignore what is clearly a null and void document and proceed nevertheless

to pay. Implicit in the requirement of a conforming document is the assumption that the

document is true and genuine although under the UCP 500 and common law, and in the

interest of international trade, the bank is not required to look beyond what appears on

the surface of the documents. But to say that a bank, in the face of a forged null and

void document (even though the beneficiary is not privy to that forgery), must still pay

on the credit, defies reason and good sense. It amounts to saying that the scheme of

things under the UCP 500 is only concerned with commas and full stops or some

misdescriptions, and that the question as to the genuineness or otherwise of a material

document, which was the cause for the issue of the LC, is of no consequence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34        As

the judge below observed, UCP 500 does not provide that a bank is obliged to accept a

document which is a nullity notwithstanding that the time prescribed under Article 14 for

the bank to reject the document has not expired. Thus the nullity exception which we

postulate is a limited one and would not have given rise to the sort of problems which

Potter LJ had expressed concern:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"If a general nullity

    exception were to be introduced as part of English law it would place banks in a further

    dilemma as to the necessity to investigate facts which they are not competent to do and

    from which UCP 500 is plainly concerned to exempt them."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We are not in any way suggesting

that the bank is obliged to investigate into any document tendered. The nullity exception

would only permit a bank to refuse payment if it is satisfied that a material document is

a nullity.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35        

Here, we would like to refer to the following comments of Professor R M Goode in an

article in Centre Point entitled <i>"Reflections on Letters of Credit –1", </i>where

he, in discussing<i> </i>the position of the <i>bona fide </i>plaintiff, said:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Is a plaintiff who seeks to

    enforce a letter of credit affected by forgery of the documents or other fraud in the

    transaction if he himself acted in good faith? There is a remarkable dearth of authority

    on this question. Let us start with the beneficiary. He himself has a duty to tender

    documents which are in order, and the fact that he acted in good faith in tendering forged

    documents is thus irrelevant. This fundamental point appears to have been overlooked by Mr

    Justice Mocatta in The American Accord when he held that the beneficiary was entitled to

    collect payment despite the insertion of a fraudulent shipping date on the bill of lading,

    since the fraud had been committed by the loading broker who was the agent of the carrier,

    not of the seller/beneficiary. But this, with respect, is not to the point. The

    beneficiary under a credit is not like a holder in due course of a bill of exchange; he is

    only entitled to be paid if the documents are in order. A fraudulently completed bill of

    lading does not become a conforming document merely because the fraud is that of a third

    party."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        It is our opinion that the

negotiating/confirming bank is not obliged to pay if it has established within the seven

day period that a material document required under the credit is forged and null and void

and notice of it is given within that period. While we recognise that there could be

difficulties in determining under what circumstances a document would be considered

material or a nullity, such a question can only be answered on the facts of each case. One

cannot generalise. It is not possible to define when is a document a nullity. But it is

really not that much more difficult to answer such questions than to determine what is

reasonable, an exercise which the courts are all too familiar with. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Judgment</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37        

However there is one fact in this case which troubles us and which, in our view, merits

further consideration and it is this. The buyers nominated "Link Express (S) Pte

Ltd" as the freight forwarder to whom the sellers should consign the goods.

Presumably the buyers would have given the sellers the name of the contact person at

"Link Express" as well as the latter’s telephone number. The sellers would

have contacted the person at "Link Express" to air-freight the goods to the

buyers. An air waybill was accordingly issued by "Link Express" for the

consignment. Could the air waybill so issued by "Link Express" be considered to

be a forgery, as being issued by a non-existent entity, when it was the very entity which

the buyer had nominated the seller to deal with? Indeed, one could say that the very

document asked for by the buyers was tendered. Could it, therefore, still be considered to

be non-compliant or a forgery? These are serious issues which must be answered because

they could be determinative of the action. The question posed to the court, pursuant to O

14 r 12 (as set out in 5 above), simply assumed that the document was a forgery and

nullity. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38        

Accordingly, in our judgment, the questions whether the air waybill constituted forgery

and is null and void and whether it amounted to non-compliance with the credit terms,

warrant, in the circumstances of the present case, further exploration.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39        In

the result, we would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment in favour of the

respondents, the confirming bank. The appellants (the sellers) shall have the costs of

this appeal, and the security deposit, together with any accrued interest, shall be

refunded to the appellants’ solicitors. The costs of the hearing below shall be in

the cause.</font></p>
