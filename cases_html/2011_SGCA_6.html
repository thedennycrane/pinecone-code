        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal raises the issue as to whether the
                    registration of a trade mark “NIKE” (“the Mark”)
                    should have been rejected on the ground that as of the date on which the Mark
                    took effect, there existed another identical earlier mark on the trade mark
                    register (“the register”). The appellant, Campomar S.L.
                    (“Campomar”), was the proprietor of that earlier mark and has
                    appealed against the decision of the Judge below (“the Judge”) who
                    refused to overturn the decision of the Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade
                    Marks (“the PAR”) allowing the registration of the Mark
                    notwithstanding Campomar’s objection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The respondent, Nike International Ltd
                    (“Nike International”), is a US company and a wholly-owned
                    subsidiary of Nike Inc. Both Nike International and Nike Inc have, since 1972,
                    been marketing and retailing shoes and apparel worldwide under the
                    “NIKE” trade mark and brand name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Campomar is a Spanish company and had on
                    2 April 1986 made an application to register the mark “NIKE”
                    in Class 3 of the International Classification of Goods in respect of
                    “perfumery with essential oils”. Its mark (“the 1986
                    Mark”) was duly registered on 30 December 1989 with the registration
                    taking effect from 2 April 1986.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 20 November 2001, Nike International
                    made an application (“the Registration Application”) to register
                    the Mark in Class 3 in respect of:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">bleaching preparations and other substances for laundry use; cleaning;
                        polishing, scouring and abrasive preparations; soaps; perfumery; essential
                        oils; cosmetics; hair lotions; dentifrices; colognes; toiletries;
                        sunscreens; cosmetics; skincare products; deodorants and antiperspirants for
                        personal use; shaving preparations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The specification was subsequently amended to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">bleaching preparations and other substances; cleaning; polishing, scouring
                        and abrasive preparations; soaps; all for laundry use or for use on sports
                        goods or sporting apprarel; perfumery; essential oils; cosmetics; hair
                        lotions; dentifrices; colognes; toiletries; shampoo; sunscreens; cosmetics;
                        skincare products; deodorants and antiperspirants for personal use; shaving
                        preparations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Campomar opposed the Registration Application based on, <em>inter alia</em>, its earlier 1986 Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Consequently, Nike International filed an
                    application on 21 January 2002 (“the Revocation Application”)
                    to have Campomar’s 1986 Mark revoked under s 22(1) of the Trade Marks
                    Act (Cap 332, 1999 Rev Ed) (“TMA 1999”) on the ground
                    that for the period of five years immediately preceding its application to
                    revoke, Campomar had not used its 1986 Mark. As a result, the Registration
                    Application was held in abeyance pending the outcome of the Revocation
                    Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the conclusion of the hearing of the
                    Revocation Application, Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks Anne Loo
                    (“PAR Loo”) held that Campomar had failed to show that it had made
                    use of the 1986 mark during the relevant five year period. She thus revoked the
                    registration of the 1986 Mark. Her decision was reversed on appeal to the High
                    Court in <em>Nike International Ltd and another v Campomar
                        SL</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 76. On further appeal by Nike
                    International to the Court of Appeal, the decision of PAR Loo was restored: the
                    decision of this Court is reported at <em>Nike International Ltd
                        v Campomar SL</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 919 (“<em>Nike International (Appeal</em>)”). Thus, in
                    accordance with s 22(8)(a) of the TMA 1999 (which has been renumbered as
                    s 22(7)(a) of Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“TMA
                    2005”)), Campomar’s rights to the 1986 Mark were deemed to have
                    ceased from the date of the Revocation Application (<em>ie</em> 21 January 2002).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Following the revocation of the 1986 Mark, the
                    Registration Application was accepted for registration and published on
                    14 June 2006 for opposition purposes. Pursuant to rule 29(1) of the Trade
                    Marks Rules 1998 (Cap 322, R 1, 2008 Rev Ed), the period of time
                    within which any interested party could oppose the registration of the mark was
                    from 14 June 2006 to 14 August 2006. Campomar filed a notice of
                    opposition on 14 August 2006. At a hearing on 16 September 2009 before the
                    PAR, Campomar opposed the registration of the Mark on <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the following two grounds. First, it contended that
                    s 8(1) of the TMA 2005 prohibited registration of a later trade mark if it
                    was identical with an “earlier trade mark” and if the goods or
                    services for which the later trade mark was sought to be registered were
                    identical with the good or services for which the “earlier trade
                    mark” was protected. Campomar averred that pursuant to the definition of
                    “earlier trade mark” under s 2(1) of the TMA 2005, the
                    relevant time to consider if there were any earlier trademarks was the time when
                    Nike International made the Registration Application (<em>ie</em> 20 November 2001). Since Campomar’s 1986 Mark was
                    not deemed to have ceased until 21 January 2002, the 1986 Mark fell within
                    the definition of “earlier trade mark” under the TMA 2005. As the
                    Mark was identical with the 1986 Mark, and the goods and services applied for
                    were identical with those for which the 1986 Mark was protected, the
                    Registration Application should accordingly be refused under s 8(1) of the
                    TMA 2005. Secondly, relying on s 7(6) of the TMA 2005, Campomar alleged
                    that Nike International had made the Registration Application in bad
                    faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In respect of Campomar’s first ground of
                    opposition, Nike International argued that a right to oppose could only arise
                    after the date of publication of the Mark (<em>ie</em>
                    14 June 2006). Since Campomar’s 1986 mark had already been revoked by
                    14 June 2006, it could not be an “earlier trade mark” under
                    s 2 of the TMA 2005 at the time that the right to oppose arose.
                    Accordingly, s 8(1) of the TMA 2005 could not apply. As for
                    Campomar’s second ground of opposition, Nike International argued that
                    they had shown <em>bona fide</em> and prolific use of the
                    Mark on a wide range of products all around the world and that Campomar had not
                    adduced any credible evidence of the use of its 1986 Mark in relation to any
                    goods in Singapore. Hence Nike International submitted that Campomar had no
                    basis whatsoever to invoke s 7(6) of the TMA 2005 against it in relation to
                    the Registration Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In her written grounds of decision (“the
                    PAR’s GD”) dated 30 October 2009, the PAR held that Campomar
                    failed on both grounds of opposition. In relation to the first ground, the PAR
                    took the view that the relevant point in time to consider if there was an
                    “earlier trade mark” under s 2(1) of the TMA 2005 was neither
                    the date on which the Registration Application was made (<em>ie</em> 20 November 2001) as argued by Campomar, nor the date of
                    publication of the Mark (<em>ie</em> 14 June 2006) as
                    argued by Nike International, but an even later date, <em>viz</em>, the date on which the Registrar decides if the later mark
                    could be registered, <em>ie</em>, the time of the hearing
                    of the opposition, or more specifically, the point of time when the Registrar is
                    about to enter the Mark on the register. In the present case, this date was 16
                    September 2009. Since the 1986 Mark was no longer a “registered
                    mark” from 21 January 2002, there was no longer, at the time of the
                    hearing of the Registration Application, an “earlier trade mark”
                    for the purposes of s 2 of the TMA 2005 which could form the basis of
                    Campomar’s opposition under s 8(1) of the TMA 2005. Accordingly, the
                    PAR held that s 8(1) of the TMA 2005 did not apply. She also rejected
                    Campomar’s contentions that the Registration Application was made in bad
                    faith. Having disposed of the objections, she allowed the registration of the
                    Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Campomar appealed against this decision of the
                    PAR to the High Court by way of Originating Summons No 1353 of 2009 (“the
                    OS”). We should, at this juncture, point out that in its appeal to the
                    High Court, Campomar abandoned its opposition to the registration of the Mark
                    based on s 7(6) of the TMA 2005 (<em>ie</em>, bad
                    faith) and confined its appeal on the sole ground that registration should have
                    been disallowed on account of the 1986 Mark. It contended that the the PAR had
                    misdirected herself in law in determining what constituted an “earlier
                    trade mark” for the purpose of s 8(1) of the TMA 2005. Campomar also
                    pleaded that the PAR misdirected herself in law by stating that there is an
                    absence of an express provision that defines “earlier trade marks”
                    as marks that are on the register as at the date of the
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The OS was heard by the Judge, who, on
                    14 April 2010, dismissed Campomar’s appeal. His grounds of decision
                    (“the GD”) may be found at <em>Campomar SL v Nike
                        International Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 951. Campomar now
                    appeals to this court to reverse both the Judge’s as well as the
                    PAR’s decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The sole issue before the Judge was whether
                    Campomar’s 1986 Mark could be considered an “earlier trade
                    mark” within the definition of s 2(1) of the TMA 2005 for the
                    purposes of the application under s 8(1) of the same. Like the PAR, the
                    Judge found that the 1986 Mark did not qualify as an “earlier trade
                    mark”. He agreed with the PAR that the appropriate moment to determine
                    whether there was an “earlier trade mark” under s 8(1) of the
                    TMA 2005 was at the hearing of the opposition. Since the 1986 Mark had already
                    been revoked by then, it was no longer a registered trade mark, and therefore
                    not an “earlier trade mark” for the purposes of s 2(1) and
                    s 8(1) of the TMA 2005. Accordingly, s 8(1) would not apply as a
                    ground for refusing registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In coming to his decision, the Judge first
                    noted that under s 2 of the TMA 2005, an “earlier trade mark”
                    referred to a “registered trade mark… the application for
                    registration of which was made earlier than the trade mark in question”.
                    It does not indicate the relevant moment in time at which it should be
                    determined whether an earlier mark existed. However, from the wording of
                    s 2 of the TMA 2005, the Judge took the view that the application for the
                    earlier trade mark must not only be made before the later trade mark in question
                    (in this case, the Mark), the earlier trade mark must still, at the relevant
                    time, be a registered trade mark (see GD at [3]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Judge then considered the cases of
                        <em>Riveria Trade Mark</em> [2003] RPC 50
                        (“<em>Riveria</em>”) and <em>Transpay Trade Mark</em> [2001] RPC 10
                        (“<em>Transpay</em>”) both decisions of
                    the UK Trade Marks Registry. Campomar relied heavily upon the former and argued
                    that it stood for the proposition that the appropriate time to consider if there
                    was an “earlier trade mark” was at the time of the application to
                    register the subsequent trademark. The Judge was, however, of the view that
                        <em>Riveria</em> could not assist Campomar as that case
                    concerned a determination of the question of whether the registration of a later
                    trade mark was valid, whereas the appeal before him concerned grounds for
                    opposing the registration of a later mark <em>per se</em>.
                    In the former situation, the Judge was of the opinion that the question of
                    whether a later mark was validly registered would “obviously”
                    depend on the circumstances at the time of the registration. In the latter
                    situation, however, he was of the view that events which occurred between the
                    date of application for registration and the date on which the decision was to
                    be made on the application ought to be taken into account (<em>ie</em> the position taken by the UK Trade Mark Registry in <em>Transpay</em>) as the courts ought to be aware of the
                    realities of the situation at the date that the opposition proceeding was heard.
                    Moreover, adopting this approach would be consistent with the approach of this
                    Court in <em>Tiffany &amp; Co v Fabriques de Tabac Reunies
                        SA</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 541 (“<em>Tiffany &amp; Co</em>”), where this Court opined that the
                    appropriate time to consider if the public was likely to be confused by an
                    applicant’s mark was at the time at which the opposition proceeding was
                    heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The main issue in this appeal is similar to
                    that which confronted the court below, <em>viz</em>,
                    whether Campomar’s 1986 Mark could be considered to be an “earlier
                    trade mark” within the meaning of s 8(1) read with s 2(1) of
                    the TMA 2005. However, it does not appear to us that resolution of this issue
                    would depend solely on the question of whether the Registrar, in determining an
                    application to register, should view the application as at the date of the
                    application to register or the date of the hearing of the registration
                    application itself. This is because the 1986 Mark was deemed to have been
                    removed as of 21 January 2002 but the Mark was deemed to have been
                    registered with effect from 20 November 2001. Thus, if both the PAR and the
                    Judge were right to say that the court ought to deal with an application to
                    register as at the date on which the application to register comes before the
                    Registrar for a decision (and we think that is correct for reasons we will come
                    to shortly), one will then face the problem of the same mark having being
                    registered as belonging to two distinct proprietors between 20 November
                    2001 and 21 January 2002. As the TMA 2005 and its predecessor prohibits
                    this phenomenon, this two-month period of overlap cannot be ignored in
                    determining whether an “earlier trade mark” existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Section 8(1) of the TMA 2005 prohibits the
                    registration of a later trade mark if it is identical with an “earlier
                    trade mark” and if the goods or services for which the former is sought
                    to be registered are identical with the good or services for which the
                    “earlier trade mark” was protected. Section 8(1) and (2) of the
                    TMA 2005 provide as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The effect of limb (a) and the concluding limb is that a mark may be
                    considered to be an “earlier trade mark” only where it is either
                    already registered or pending registration. Registerability of the earlier mark
                    is critical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As the Judge rightly pointed out, s 2(1)
                    of the TMA 2005 does not provide any specific guidance or indication as to the
                    point in time for determining if an earlier trade mark exists for the purposes
                    of s 8(1) of the TMA 2005. Campomar has argued that a “literal
                    interpretation” of s 2(1) would give rise to the conclusion that the
                    relevant date was the date of the Registration Application. However, we do not
                    see how that view can be taken when the provision merely sets out the
                    requirements which must be met before a mark may qualify as an “earlier
                    trade mark”. For the reasons alluded to by the PAR and the Judge in the
                    present case, the local case of <em>Hugo Boss AG v Reemtsma
                        Cigarettenfabriken GMBH</em> [2009] SGIPOS 7
                        (“<em>Hugo Boss</em>”), as well as the
                    English cases of <em>Kambly SA Specialities de Biscuits Suisses v
                        Intersnack Knabber-Geback GMBH &amp; Co KG</em>
                    [2004] EWHC 943 (CH) (“<em>Kambly</em>”) and <em>Transpay</em>, we agree
                    that the Registrar, in considering an opposition to an application for
                    registration of a mark, should view the matter as at the date of the hearing of
                    the opposition instead of the date of the registration application. This
                    approach is not only consistent with the wording of s 8(1), more
                    importantly, it is sensible, pragmatic and realistic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>Hugo Boss</em>,
                    the Registrar had to determine whether Hugo Boss AG’s expunged trade mark
                    registrations for “BOSS” and “HUGO BOSS” in Class 34
                    could still be considered as “earlier registrations” for the
                    purposes of s 23(1) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed)
                    (“TMA 1992”). Section 23(1) of TMA 1992 provides:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken Gmbh
                    (“Reemtsma”) had, on 14 December 1998, applied to register the
                    mark “BOSS” in Class 34 for use on “tobacco, tobacco
                    products, particularly cigarettes and cigarillos, smoker’s articles,
                    matches; all included in Class 34”. On 5 February 2002, Reemtsma filed
                    two applications to have Hugo Boss’ trade mark registrations for
                    “BOSS” and “HUGO BOSS” in Class 34 revoked. By a
                    judgment of the High Court dated 10 September 2003, these two marks of Hugo
                    Boss were revoked and the two marks were deemed revoked as from 5 February
                    2002 (<em>ie</em> the date of the revocation application)
                    (see the judgment reported at [2003] 4 SLR(R) 155). On 23 July
                    2004, Reemtsma’s application was published for opposition purposes. On
                    23 November 2004, Hugo Boss AG filed its Notice of Opposition. At the
                    hearing of Reemtsma’s application to register the BOSS mark, PAR Lee Li
                    Choon (“PAR Lee”) noted that s 23(1) of the TMA 1992 referred
                    to marks “belonging to a different proprietor and <b><em>already on the register</em></b>” [emphasis in original]. Such
                    marks prevented the registration of later marks which were identical to or
                    nearly resembled marks in relation to the same goods or goods of the same
                    description. PAR Lee next considered the question of “what [was] the
                    point in time for the purpose of determining what marks were “already on
                    the register” for the purpose of section 23(1)” and concluded that
                    the point in time at which the Registrar should consider if prior expunged marks
                    were still “on the register” for the purposes of a s 23(1)
                    objection was at the point in time when the Registrar decided whether the later
                    mark could be entered onto the register. In other words, the point in time would
                    be the point at which the opposition proceeding was heard. This was because
                    s 23(1) of the TMA 1992 stated that “Except as provided by section
                    25, no trade mark <b><em>shall be registered</em></b> in respect
                    of any goods …” [emphasis added in bold italics]. PAR Lee was of
                    the view that the phrase “no trade mark shall be registered”
                    related to the act of placing a mark on the register. Further, she also noted
                    that there was no express provision in the TMA 1992 stating that “marks
                    already on the register” had to be marks already on the register
                        <em>as at the date of the application for registration of the
                        later mark</em> [emphasis added]. Additionally, PAR Lee was of the
                    view that her interpretation was a reasonable one and was also in line with the
                    Registrar’s implementation of the TMA 1992 by waiving citations of earlier
                    registrations/applications which, at the point of decision, were no longer
                    subsisting and valid (<em>eg</em> when they had lapsed due
                    to non-renewal or abandonment). Finally, PAR Lee observed that her approach was
                    wholly consistent with that taken by this Court in <em>Tiffany
                        &amp; Co</em> where the Court observed at [57]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    ... Whether or not to take into account facts
                            occurring after the date of application to register the mark must of

                            always be aware of the realities of the situation at the date that the
                            opposition proceedings under s 15 [of the TMA 1999] are
                            heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Turning next to the English cases of <em>Kambly</em> and <em>Transpay</em>, they
                    also suggest that events which occurred between the date of application for
                    registration and the date on which the decision on the application was made
                    ought to be taken into account.</p>

          <em>Kambly</em> was a
                    case concerning two earlier registered marks belonging to Kambly in respect of
                    flour, confectionery, bread, cake and biscuits, and the like (“the Kambly
                    Trade Marks”), and two later marks which Intersnack sought to register in
                    respect of a wider category of products which also included “snack
                    products” (“the Intersnack Trade Marks”). Intersnack also
                    sought revocation of the Kambly Trade Marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Kambly argued that registration of the
                    Intersnack Trade Marks was barred by s 12 of the UK Trade Marks Act 1938 (c
                    22) (“ UK TMA 1938”) because s 12 of the UK TMA 1938
                    prohibits the registration of marks identical to and resembling pre-existing
                    marks on the register where registration of the later marks were sought in
                    respect of goods identical to and nearly resembling goods for which the earlier
                    marks were registered for, but as at the date of the applications for
                    registration by Intersnack (respectively 23 May 1989 and 11 May 1990),
                    the Kambly Trade Marks were still on the register (they were only deemed revoked
                    as of 31 August 1993) and the Intersnack Trade Marks nearly resembled (if they
                    were not identical with) the Kambly Trade Marks and were also in respect of the
                    same goods or same description of goods. Section 12, in so far as material,
                    reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Turning next to <em>Transpay</em>, this was a case where Barclays Bank Plc
                    (“Barclays”) applied, in November 1994, to register the word
                    TRANSPAY in Classes 16 and 36 in relation to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, money orders, cheques, cheque books, plastic cards, banking
                    and financial services. In February 1995, it applied to register another version
                    of the device in the same classes. Both applications were accepted and
                    published. In November 1995 and July 1996, Chequepoint Express Inc
                    (“Chequepoint”) filed notices of opposition. One ground of
                    opposition was under s 5(2)(b) of the UK Trade Marks Act 1994 (c 26)
                    (“UK TMA 1994”) on the basis that it owned two earlier trade marks
                    for TRANSCHEQ in the same classes. However, Chequepoint’s marks had
                    expired following non renewal on 15 February 1997 and were no longer
                    capable of restoration to the register.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The UK Trade Marks Registry was thus
                    confronted with the question as to whether Chequepoint could validly object to
                    Barclays’ registration application under s 5(2)(b) of the UK TMA 1994
                    on account of the fact that Chequepoint’s earlier marks only lapsed after
                    Barclays had applied for the registration of its two new marks
                    (Chequepoint’s earlier marks expired for non-renewal on 15 February 2007
                    but Barclays’ registration application for its marks was dated 15 November
                    1994 and 17 February 1995 respectively). Chequepoint argued that matters had to
                    be considered as at the date of the registration application. As the earlier
                    marks were still on the register when Barclays made its applications,
                    Chequepoint contended that its marks were accordingly earlier registered marks
                    for the purposes of s 5(2)(b) and their subsequent lapse could not affect
                    its status as at the date on which Barclay made its registration application.
                    Barclays, on the other hand, argued that where an earlier mark had been allowed
                    to lapse, this ought to be taken into account, even if the lapse occurred after
                    the date of the application for registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mr Mike Knight of the UK Trade Marks Registry
                    dismissed Chequepoint’s opposition and allowed Barclays’
                    registration applications. He was of the view that implicit from the provisions
                    of the UK TMA 1994 was the notion that acceptance of an application for
                    registration of a mark was distinct and separate from the actual registration of
                    the mark. This view was based on ss 37 and 40 of the UK TMA 1994. The former
                    dealt with the examination of a registration application whereas the latter made
                    provision for the actual registration of a mark. Based on these two provisions,
                    Mr Knight concluded that the acceptance of an application was not the same
                    as registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Having noted the distinction between
                    acceptance of a mark for registration and the actual registration of the mark,
                    Mr Knight then said that the UK TMA 1994 allowed the registrar to consider
                    certain matters arising between those two events, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, where: (a) the proprietor of an earlier mark limited the
                    specification of the goods and services such that the cause of the conflict
                    between the two marks was removed; (b) the earlier mark had been fully cancelled
                    after the date of application for registration of the otherwise later
                    conflicting mark; (c) the applicant had taken an assignment of the earlier mark;
                    and (d) where the earlier mark had lapsed. This was to prevent unfairness from
                    resulting. If consideration was restricted to only matters that existed at the
                    application date, it would be impossible for part cancellation of goods or
                    services to be taken into account that could allow the later mark to be
                    registered. Furthermore, the effect of cancellation or assignment of a mark
                    could also not be considered. Turning to the facts before himself,
                    Mr Knight noted that as Chequepoint’s earlier marks no longer existed
                    as registered trademarks from February 1997 and indeed by September 1999 when
                    the application came up for consideration, they were clearly not on the
                    register. Thus, he held that Chequepoint could not rely on s 5(2) of the UK
                    TMA 1994 to oppose the registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Thus, the effect of <em>Hugo
                        Boss</em>, <em>Kambly</em> and <em>Transpay</em> is that the relevant date for determining the existence
                    of an “earlier mark” is the date when the mark is to be entered on
                    the register, and not the date of the registration application. However, as
                    mentioned in <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above, it seems to us that
                    the problem which surfaced in this case is not amenable to a resolution by
                    merely applying s 8(1) of the TMA 2005, read with the definition of an
                    “earlier trade mark” provided for in s 2(1) of the same act.
                    There is also the additional problem arising from a combination of the
                    relation-back provisions in the TMA 2005, <em>viz</em>, ss
                    22(7) and 15(2), which we have to contend with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Under s 22(7) of the TMA 2005, revocation
                    of a trade mark takes effect either from the date of the revocation application
                    where the application is granted, or earlier if the court is satisfied that
                    there are grounds for revocation to be effective at a date prior to the
                    revocation application. Under s 15(2) of the same Act, that subsection
                    provides that where an application for registration of a mark is granted, the
                    mark is deemed to be registered as of the date of the application for
                    registration, <em>ie</em>, the effective date of
                    registration or a mark will relate back to the date of the application for
                    registration, notwithstanding the lapse of time between the date of application
                    for registration and the date of actual entry of the mark onto the register. The
                    effect of s 22(7), read with s 15(2) of the TMA 2005, is that if the
                    date of application for registration of a later mark (this is also the effective
                    date of registration of that later mark) occurs <em>before</em> the date of application for revocation of an earlier mark
                    (this is also the effective date of revocation of that earlier mark), on a
                    successful registration of the later mark and revocation of the earlier mark,
                    there would be two identical or almost similar marks on the register at the same
                    time at some point. This would be precisely the situation in the present matter
                    should the Mark be registered. It seems to us that one of the objects of
                    enacting s 22(7)(a) (backdating of the revocation to a date earlier than
                    the date of application to revoke if the circumstances justify that) must be to
                    address this problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Although the 1986 Mark was only finally
                    removed on 16 January 2006 following the decision of this Court in <em>Nike International (Appeal)</em>, in view of s 22(7) of
                    the TMA 2005, the revocation of the 1986 Mark was deemed to take effect from
                    21 January 2002, the date on which Nike International made the Revocation
                    Application. Similarly, although Nike International’s application to
                    register the Mark was only granted on 16 September 2009, the Mark was deemed by
                    s 15(2) of the TMA 2005 to take effect from 20 November 2001. Thus for the
                    period between 20 November 2001 and 21 January 2002 (“the overlap
                    period”), if the Mark was allowed to remain on the register, then in law
                    both the 1986 Mark and the Mark would exist concurrently on the register, albeit
                    for a brief two-month period. Accordingly, even if the relevant date for
                    determining whether there was an “earlier mark” was the date when
                    the mark was to be entered on the register rather than the date of the
                    registration application, which we agree, this position does not alter the fact
                    that as at the date of the hearing before the PAR, the 1986 Mark remained on the
                    register until 21 January 2002 and was only effectively removed <em>after</em> the effective registration date of the Mark (20
                    November 2001). To that extent, allowing the registration of the Mark would run
                    counter to the provisions of the TMA 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Hugo Boss</em>, it
                    seems to us that the approach taken by PAR Lee was to simply ask whether, as at
                    the date of the hearing to oppose Reemtsma’s application to register the
                    BOSS mark, Hugo Boss’ two earlier marks were still on the register. In
                    finding that the registration of Hugo Boss’ two earlier marks did not
                    constitute earlier registrations for the purposes of s 23(1) of the TMA
                    1992, she did not appear to have considered the fact that if Reemtsma’s
                    application to register its later mark was granted, registration of that mark
                    would take effect as from 14 December 1998. However, the two earlier Hugo Boss
                    were still on the register on 14 December 1998 and remained so until 5 February
                    2002, which was the date of the revocation application and hence the effective
                    date of their revocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Similarly, the fact that there was a period of
                    overlap between the effective date of registration of the later Intersnack Trade
                    Marks (respectively 23 May 1989 and 11 May 1990) and the effective
                    date of revocation of the old Kambly Trade Marks (31 August 1993) did not appear
                    to have been addressed by Lightman J in <em>Kambly</em>.
                    Granted, Lightman J’s views were expressed in the context of the UK TMA
                    1938, which did not contain any equivalent of s 22(7) of Singapore’s
                    TMA 2005. A similar provision was however introduced some time later into the UK
                    TMA 1994 (see s 46(6) of the UK TMA 1994). Yet, that provision was not
                    considered in <em>Transpay</em> either. Like PAR Lee,
                    Mr Knight did not appear to have considered the fact that in allowing the
                    registration of Barclays’ later marks, Chequepoint’s earlier marks
                    and Barclays’ later marks would appear alongside each other on the
                    register between 15 November 1994/17 February 1995 and 15 February 1997. In
                    passing, we should further add that Mr Knight also found that the two
                    marks, TRANSPAY and TRANSCHEQ, were not confusingly similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In dealing with the problem created by the
                    relation-back provisions in the TMA 2005, <em>viz</em>, ss
                    22(7) and 15(2), we find guidance from <em>Riveria</em>,
                    which Campomar relied on. While we do not agree with Campomar’s reliance
                    on <em>Riveria</em> for the proposition that the
                    appropriate time to consider if there was an “earlier trade mark”
                    was at the time Nike International applied to register its subsequent mark (see
                        <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> below), there is much to be said
                    about the remarks of Mr Allan James (of the UK Trade Marks Registry) to the
                    effect that an earlier mark must be revoked effective from a date which preceded
                    the date of application for registration of a later conflicting mark before the
                    later mark could be validly registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     
          <em>Riveria</em>
                    concerned an application by the proprietor of an earlier mark for a declaration
                    that the registration of a later mark, which was similar to the earlier mark and
                    registered for identical goods, was invalid. This case involved the earlier
                    trade mark of “Riveria”, which was held by Stella Products Limited
                    (“Stella”), and the later mark of “Franco’s Riveria
                    Cone”, which was held by Domenico Tanzarella t/a Franco’s Ices
                    (“Franco”). Stella’s earlier trade mark was registered with
                    effect from 13 June 1973 but was subsequently revoked for non-use effective from
                    21 May 2001. Franco applied on 22 March 2000 to register its later mark.
                    This application was granted on 25 August 2000, a date which pre-dated
                    Franco’s application to revoke Stella’s registered mark for non-use
                    for the prescribed period (<em>ie</em> 21 May 2001).
                    However, pursuant to the relation-back provision in the UK TMA 1994, the
                    effective date of registration of Franco’s later mark was backdated to 22
                    March 2000. Following the registration of Franco’s mark, Stella applied on
                    23 April 2001 (which was even before Franco applied to revoke the Stella mark)
                    to have Franco’s registration invalidated on the ground that its mark was
                    on the register. The decision of Mr James in <em>Riveria</em> was in relation to this application by Stella. Although
                    Franco’s application to revoke was made later than Stella’s
                    application to invalidate (the former was made on 21 May 2001 whereas the
                    latter was made on 23 April 2001), the former was heard first and the
                    revocation order was granted. In the light of this background and of the fact
                    that the revocation of the Stella mark was deemed effective from the date of the
                    revocation application (<em>ie</em> 21 May 2001),
                    Mr James put the issue before him as follows (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The matter in dispute is whether the subsequent revocation of Stella's
                        registration with effect from May 21, 2001 has the effect of either
                        retrospectively extinguishing the earlier trade mark right or else
                        preventing or limiting the proprietor's ability to continue to rely upon
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr James answered this query in the
                    negative and relied on s 46(6) of the UK TMA 1994, which was the genesis of
                    our s 22(7) of the TMA 2005. Section 46(6) of the UK TMA 1994
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) Where the registration of a trade mark is revoked to any extent, the
                        rights of the proprietor shall be deemed to have ceased to that extent as
                        from—</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)the date of the application for revocation, or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)if the registrar or court is satisfied that the grounds for revocation
                        existed at an earlier date, that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In his view, by virtue of s 46(6) of the UK TMA 1994, the rights
                    of the proprietor of a revoked registration would continue to exist up until the
                    date of the application for revocation, “unless the registrar is
                    satisfied that the grounds for revocation existed at an earlier date”
                    (see [14] of <em>Riveria</em>). It was, therefore, essential that the party who was
                    seeking to revoke an earlier trade mark, whether to make way for its own
                    application or to resist an application to have its own registration declared
                    invalid on the basis of the earlier trade mark, request that the conflicting
                    earlier mark be revoked with effect from a date which precedes the date of its
                    own application for registration. Otherwise, the subsequent revocation of an
                    earlier mark (in this case, Stella’s earlier mark, with effect from
                    21 May 2001), after the later mark had been registered (in this case,
                    Franco’s later mark, which was deemed to be registered on 22 March
                    2000), would have the effect of retrospectively extinguishing the rights of the
                    proprietor of the earlier mark during the overlapping period when <em>both</em> the later mark and earlier mark would be found on
                    the register (<em>ie</em> between 22 March 2000 and
                    21 May 2001).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     What is of relevance in <em>Riveria</em> to the present case is in relation to the existence of
                    the overlapping period. Mr James would not allow the Franco mark to remain
                    on the register as it would coincide with the Stella mark which was still there
                    until 21 May 2001. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, Mr James
                    also added that the difficulties that arose could have been taken care of by
                    resorting to s 46(6)(b) of the UK TMA 1994 (our s 22(7)(b) of the TMA
                    2005) and by requesting the Registry to order that the revocation takes effect
                    from a date earlier than the date of the application by Franco to register its
                    mark, provided that there is sufficient evidence to warrant such a further
                    backdating (on the facts of <em>Riveria</em>, Franco failed
                    to do so and Mr James declined to accept Franco’s “tentative
                    invitation to speculate about what the outcome might have been if revocation had
                    been sought from an earlier date” (see [21] of <em>Riveria</em>)). From the facts
                    of the case and this reasoning of Mr James, it would be seen that when he
                    was considering the application to invalidate the Franco mark, he was looking at
                    the matter as at the date of the hearing of that application and not as at the
                    date of the application. If he was looking at the matter as of the date of the
                    application to invalidate the Franco mark, there was no question of any
                    overlapping period to talk about. The incidence of an overlapping period only
                    arose following events which occurred after the invalidation application made on
                    23 April 2001 (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     While it is true that the proceedings here,
                    which concern opposition to registration, are different from that in <em>Riveria</em>, which related to invalidation of a registered
                    mark, both were based on the ground that there was an earlier similar or
                    identical registered mark. The ground for opposing the registration of a mark
                    under s 8(1) of the TMA 2005 can also be relied upon to invalidate a mark.
                    This is clearly set out in s 23(3) of the TMA 2005, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)The registration of a trade mark may be declared invalid
                        on the ground -</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">That there
                                is an earlier trade mark in relation to which-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-3-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-3-Item">The conditions set out in section 8(1) or
                                    (2) apply;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, whether a party should apply to
                    oppose the registration of a mark or to invalidate the mark depends on whether,
                    at the time of application, the mark in question has been registered. If
                    registration of the later mark is still pending, then the party having an
                    interest in the matter should give notice of his intention to oppose the
                    registration of the mark. On the other hand, if the later mark has already been
                    registered, then the proper course for an interested party to take would be to
                    apply for the invalidation of that mark</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In this case, the 1986 Mark has undoubtedly
                    been revoked on 21 January 2002. But it does not mean that that mark had
                    never been on the register. It was there until 21 January 2002. As the
                    effect of the registration of the Mark would be related back to the date of
                    application, 20 November 2001, this is a consequence which the Registrar
                    cannot disregard in considering the Registration Application. Otherwise, it
                    would mean that during the overlapping period, an identical mark, owned by two
                    different entities, would be on the register. The TMA 2005 could not have
                    contemplated or sanctioned that. As stated before, the problem could have been
                    avoided by resorting to s 22(7)(b) of the TMA 2005, which gives the
                    Registrar the power to order the revocation of a registered trade mark to take
                    effect even earlier than the date on which the application for revocation was
                    made if the circumstances warrant it. The provisions in s 22(7)(b) of the
                    TMA 2005 were only added in 1999. As stated in [29], it seems to us that one of its objects must be to address
                    the sort of problems that could arise like the present where the application to
                    register a later mark was made before an application to have an earlier
                    identical or similar registered mark revoked for non-use and there is evidence
                    to show that the non-use occurred even before the commencement of the five-year
                    period relied on in the application for revocation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Transpay,
                        Kambly</em> and <em>Hugo Boss</em>, the question
                    of the existence on the register of two similar or identical marks belonging to
                    different parties during the overlap period was not given focus. At this
                    juncture, we would highlight one other aspect of <em>Transpay</em>. There, the earlier mark was not revoked for non-use
                    but lapsed due to non-renewal. We do not think this difference, as to the reason
                    for a mark being no longer on the register, is material. Rather, the critical
                    facts are first, whether an earlier mark was still on the register at the time
                    the later mark was to be entered on that register and second, whether the entry
                    of the later mark onto the register would create a situation whereby two similar
                    or identical marks belonging to different parties could be found on the register
                    at any point in time. In the cases of <em>Hugo Boss and
                        Kambly</em>, the significance of a period of overlap was similarly not
                    considered (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> and <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above). Moreover, they were decided under the
                    now superseded predecessors of the respective UK and Singapore Trade Marks Acts,
                    where what is now s 22(7)(b) of the TMA 2005 (or s 46(6)(b) of the UK
                    TMA 1994) had not yet been added.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     To recapitulate, what we would underscore is
                    that while the Registrar, in considering an application to register a mark in
                    the face of an opposition under s 8(1), is entitled to take into account
                    all the circumstances up to that point in time, including the revocation of an
                    earlier identical registered mark, the Registrar should not disregard the fact,
                    as in this case, that the registration of the later mark would give rise to
                    there being on the register two identical marks being owned by two different
                    parties for a period of time. As we see it, the provisions in s 22(7)(b) of
                    the TMA 2005 must have been added to address, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, this difficulty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In conclusion, this court would state that it
                    makes good and practical sense, when the Registrar determines an application for
                    a mark to be registered, to consider it in the light of the circumstances
                    prevailing on the day of hearing instead of viewing it as on the date of the
                    application. Indeed, in <em>Riveria</em>, which was an
                    invalidation proceeding, Mr James still considered the application in the
                    light of the facts before him as at the date of the hearing. What is critically
                    important, whether it is an opposition proceeding or an invalidation proceeding,
                    is for the Registrar to always bear in mind the need to ensure that the entry of
                    a later mark on the register would not result in the existence of two similar or
                    identical marks, belonging to different parties, on the register at <em>any period of time</em>. In the present case, while the 1986
                    Mark was no longer on the register on 16 September 2009 (the date of the
                    hearing of the Registration Application), the register would show that the 1986
                    Mark was on the register until 21 January 2002. As the registration of the
                    Mark would take effect from 20 November 2001, which was a date well before
                    the 1986 Mark was removed from the register, the entry of the Mark on the
                    register would infringe s 8(1) of the TMA 2005 and would in turn cause
                    confusion. Therefore, it should not be allowed. The remedy for a problem of this
                    kind could be resolved in an appropriate case by resorting to s 22(7)(b) of
                    the TMA 2005. However, this was not done here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the result, Campomar’s appeal is
                    allowed with costs here and below and with the usual consequential
                    orders.</p>
