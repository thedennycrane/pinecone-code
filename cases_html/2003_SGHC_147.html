<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Zhang Xu Sheng returned to the flat about 5pm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Zhang asked the accused to get assistance from the Ministry of Manpower instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two quarrelled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Zhang’s parents, Zhang Shi Xiang and Wei Mei Mei came out of the flat and saw the accused slashing his own arm twice and saying ‘See whether I dare!’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Zhang Xu Sheng asked the accused not to do anything foolish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused then stabbed Zhang once, injuring him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When Zhang’s parents saw that they rushed at the accused to prevent him from further hurting Zhang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused ‘waved and jabbed the knife’ at Zhang’s parents and in the melee, he stabbed Zhang’s mother, Wei Mei Mei, aged 62, once in her left chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The knife went into the woman’s heart, killing her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her husband was also injured but not too seriously.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Huang Hong Si pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, Ch 224 in respect of Wei Mei Mei’s death, and a charge of causing grievous hurt with weapon under s 324 of the same code, before me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A third charge under s 324 for causing hurt to Zhang’s father was taken into account for the purposes of sentencing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The accused was not represented by counsel and said in mitigation that he went to Zhang only to recover his money, a sum which he says may not be large to others but was great to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He is married with a 10 year old son in China.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The learned DPP submitted that there were aggravating factors in this case and he listed them as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">‘(i)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> the Accused had armed himself with a knife when he went to look for Zhang Xu Sheng (“the victim”) on 14 December 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He knew the knife could be used as a dangerous weapon and he intended to use it to threaten or cause hurt for the purpose of obtaining money from the victim;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> the victim and his mother, Wei Mei Mei (“the deceased”) were two innocent people who fell victim to the accused’s action in using the knife;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(iii)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> there was no provocation by the victim or the deceased;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(iv)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> the deceased and the victim were unarmed and harmless to the accused;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(v)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> the deceased was merely trying to stop the accused from attacking her son when the accused turned the knife on her;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(vi)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> the injuries suffered by the deceased and the victim were very serious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The victim’s injuries were so serious that he had to be hospitalised for 4 days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And if not for the deceased and her husband’s intervention to stop the accused, the victim’s injuries could have been worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although the deceased had suffered a single stab wound, it was sufficient to cause her death; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(vii)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">     </span> this was the second time that the accused had confronted the victim at his flat over his pay matters.’</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> It has become common practice for prosecuting counsel to address the court on sentencing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is done with the view of assisting the court in balancing all the factors relevant to its determination of the sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The prosecuting counsel’s submission will naturally focus on the degree of seriousness in connection with the offence so as to act as a ballast to the plea in mitigation by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It appears to me that it has become customary of the prosecution to refer to the degree of seriousness in connection with the offence as ‘aggravating factors’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While I would like to think that judges would appreciate counsel’s purpose even if they may not accept all or any of the factors submitted, it is, nonetheless, important to understand the use of the term ‘aggravating factors’, and not confuse it with the phrase ‘aggravated offence’, as is sometimes used to describe an offence as a more serious version of another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For example, robbery with hurt can be described as an aggravated offence of robbery, and kidnapping in order to murder is an aggravated offence of kidnapping.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> What has frequently been labelled as ‘aggravating factors’ are, therefore, more accurately factors that indicate the level of gravity of the crime in specific relation to the offence upon which the accused was charged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The degree of seriousness at each level differs according to the individual facts of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such facts are not intended to be used to compare the crime of robbery with the crime of rape, for example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They are to be used to engage the court in the exercise of establishing how the offender is to be punished within the range of punishment prescribed for him for that offence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this regard, the degree of seriousness of the crime has four major distinctive aspects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> First, there is the degree of seriousness of the offence itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This presents little difficulty because this aspect is usually reflected in the range of punishment prescribed by the legislature for the offence; although there is always room for moot, for example, as to whether the crime of fabricating evidence (for which the punishment is up to 3 years’ imprisonment) is a more serious offence than the crime of being a member of an unlawful assembly (for which the punishment is up to 2 years’ imprisonment).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The second aspect of seriousness is the manner and mode in which it was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An accused who kills his victim with a single stab wound commits the same crime, but arguably, in a less brutal manner than one who crushes his victim to death with a truck as a weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Similarly, the offence of causing hurt is obviously more serious in a case where a person has been beaten several times (on the same occasion) than one who was hit only once (assuming the blows in both cases are roughly the same).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The third aspect is the degree of seriousness of the consequences of the criminal act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One victim may die a quick death, another may linger in pain before expiring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No two cases may be alike, but the task of the court to consider the degree and scope of seriousness is incomplete if it merely takes into account individual factors and add them all together (even if that can be done).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not a numbers game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The court’s duty is to consider all the factors, including the mitigation, as a blend and evaluating them as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The fourth aspect concerns the interests of the public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is in the public interest is not always readily palpable and it should therefore be invoked less the crime be unjustifiably magnified.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In the present case, some of the ‘aggravating factors’ are merely standard parcels, for example, the fact that the accused was ‘armed with a knife and intended to use it’ is a factor common to many such cases; that innocent victims were harmed is a fact without which we would not have an offence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Similarly, the fact that there was no provocation from the victim is relevant but cannot be regarded as ‘an aggravating factor’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Provocation by the victim, on the other hand, may be a mitigating factor.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In the present case, the accused was suffering from a mental condition that mitigates some of the factors that might otherwise have increased the degree of seriousness of the offence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The consultant psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health examined the accused and found the accused to have a ‘prolonged depressive reaction that was caused by prolonged stressful situation’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He stated that the accused was in a dissociative state of mind at the time he committed the offences.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He also stated that although the accused was aware of what he was doing, ‘he did not have mental control of his actions.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the circumstances, I sentenced the accused to seven years imprisonment in respect of the first charge, and 12 months imprisonment in respect of the second charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sentences of imprisonment are to run concurrently with effect from the date of his arrest.</span></p>
