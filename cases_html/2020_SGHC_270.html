The defendant is the Attorney-General (“AG”).  The plaintiff filed Originating Summons No 1044 of 2020 (“OS 1044”) for leave under O 53 r 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) to commence judicial review to seek various remedies against the police.  Essentially, the plaintiff seeks to prevent the police from continuing the two investigations against him.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the plaintiff’s application because it was without any merit and I provided parties with brief reasons for my decision.  I elaborate on those grounds below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 As stated, the plaintiff is currently the subject of two criminal investigations (“the investigations”).  The first is conducted by Investigation Officer Desmond Toh (“IO Toh”) of the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) of the Singapore Police Force.  It concerns the alleged commission by the plaintiff of the offence of criminal breach of trust under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) (“CAD investigations”).  This is because the plaintiff had allegedly misappropriated a sum of S$30,000 which he received from AXA Insurance Pte Ltd (“AXA Insurance”) on behalf of one of his former clients, Mr Suresh Kumar s/o A Jesupal (“Mr Kumar”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This sum of S$30,000 was part of a larger sum of S$50,000 which the defendant in DC/DC 387/2015 (“DC 387”), Mr Guo Nengqing (“Mr Guo”), was ordered to pay Mr Kumar as damages.  The plaintiff had represented Mr Kumar as counsel in DC 387, which was a motor accident claim.  Mr Kumar had been injured in an accident which was caused entirely by the negligence of Mr Guo.  In the course of DC 387, the plaintiff was replaced by Mr Joseph Chen (“Mr Chen”), who has his own law firm, as the lawyer for Mr Kumar.  Nevertheless, it is said that AXA Insurance, the insurer for Mr Guo, made the payment of the S$30,000 to the plaintiff’s firm even though they were no longer the solicitors on record.  Mr Kumar claims that, to date, he has not received this sum of S$30,000 from the plaintiff.  Mr Chen then made a complaint to the police, on behalf of Mr Guo, about the alleged criminal breach of trust of the S$30,000 by the plaintiff.

The complainant’s allegation is that the plaintiff had invited her for dinner and drinks at his home and persistently addressed her using inappropriate terms such as “darling” and “baby”, even after she told him that she felt uncomfortable with this.

First, the subject matter of the complaint has to be susceptible to judicial review.  Second, the applicant has to have a sufficient interest in the matter.  Third, the materials before the court have to disclose an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the applicant:<span class="font-italic"> Gobi a/l Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal</span> [2020] 2 SLR 883 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) at [44].

The requirement to obtain leave for judicial review “is intended to filter out groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage and its aim is to prevent waste of judicial time as well as to protect public bodies from harassment”.  Thus, notwithstanding the modest threshold for granting leave, the courts “have not hesitated to dismiss unmeritorious judicial review applications even at the leave stage”: <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Pheng Lip Ian v Chen Fun Gee and others</span> [2020] 1 SLR 586 at [25]; <span class="font-italic">AXY </span>at [34]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 From the parties’ submissions, it was common ground that the first two requirements were satisfied in this case.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the circumstances, I agreed with counsel for the defendant that IO Toh and the CAD did not make any undertaking via the 15 October letter <span class="font-italic">not</span> to take a statement from the plaintiff on 16 October 2020.  Given that the plaintiff relied <span class="font-italic">only</span> on the 15 October letter and nothing more, there was therefore no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of the alleged undertaking.  More importantly, even if there was such an undertaking by IO Toh, counsel for the plaintiff failed to make any submissions as to the legal effect of such an “undertaking” and its “breach”.  In short, the plaintiff’s case in relation to the declaration about the alleged undertaking was a complete non-starter.  As such, I was of the view that there was no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that the declaration sought by the plaintiff (see [18(d)] above) would ever be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CAD investigations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As for the prohibiting and mandatory orders sought, the plaintiff did not cite any authorities or any legal principle to support his rather remarkable contention that the Court could, in appropriate circumstances, grant orders to stop the CAD and the police from continuing their investigations into complaints that had been made.  Instead, for the CAD investigations, the plaintiff’s case was that it would amount to “contempt of court” under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (Act 19 of 2016) (“AJPA”) for the CAD investigations to continue because “the subject matter of the investigations” is “before the State Courts” in MC 1595.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff only filed an affidavit which enclosed the statement of claim filed by Mr Kumar in MC 1595 against AXA Insurance and Mr Guo <span class="font-italic">o</span><span class="font-italic">n the morning</span> of the hearing before me on 5 November 2020.  The plaintiff is the third party in MC 1595.  In that action, Mr Kumar is seeking a declaration that AXA Insurance’s payment of S$30,000 to the plaintiff did not discharge Mr Guo’s liability to Mr Kumar in DC 387 or AXA Insurance’s statutory liability under s 9 of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed).  Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Mr Kumar is seeking a “second bite of the cherry” because he did not sue the plaintiff for the S$50,000 in MC 1595, but yet Mr Chen (Mr Kumar’s present lawyer in MC 1595) made the police report against the plaintiff, on Mr Kumar’s behalf, regarding the S$30,000.  In other words, according to the plaintiff, Mr Kumar seems to have taken inconsistent positions in MC 1595 (that the plaintiff does not owe him the S$30,000) and the police report (that the plaintiff owes him the S$30,000).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I was not satisfied that there was an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the prohibiting and mandatory orders sought by the plaintiff to restrain the CAD from resuming the CAD investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 First, the plaintiff had not shown me that it would be appropriate in this case for the Court to grant prohibiting and mandatory orders to stop the police investigations.  In <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj and another v Ting Kang Chung John </span>[2010] 1 SLR 1026 (“<span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj</span>”), the appellants filed an originating summons to set aside an arbitration award made by the respondent.  The appellants then filed a summons to apply for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the police and/or the Commercial Affairs Department to be “directed” to “speedily complete their investigations” into the magistrate’s complaints filed by the appellants against the respondent.  The High Court declined to make this order (see <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj and Another v Ting Kang Chung John and Another</span> [2009] SGHC 71).  The Court of Appeal allowed the respondent’s application to strike out the appellants’ appeal principally because the notice of appeal was filed out of time and the circumstances of the case did not merit an extension of time.  This was partly because the appellants had failed to show that the court had the power, in a civil suit, to make a mandatory order against the said law enforcement agencies when the said agencies were not a party to the proceedings (at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 More importantly for present purposes, the Court of Appeal went on to observe (at [40]), citing Clive Lewis QC, <span class="font-italic">Judicial Remedies in Public</span> <span class="font-italic">Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2009) at para 4-084, that, even in cases where an application for a <span class="font-italic">mandamus</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(now known as a mandatory order) had been properly made, English courts “will not … give orders to the police telling them how and when to exercise their powers in specific situations<span class="font-italic"> as the court is not in a position to determine what action particular situations will require</span>” [emphasis added].  The Court of Appeal also cited (at [41]) the case of <span class="font-italic">R v Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall, ex p Central Electricity Generating Board</span> [1982] QB 458, where the English Court of Appeal found that, although there had been a breach of the peace in that case, the court would not grant orders to the police as to how they should carry out their duties because “<span class="font-italic">[i]t is </span><span class="font-italic">of the first importance that the police should decide on their own responsibility what action should be taken in any particular situation</span>” [emphasis added by the Court of Appeal].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Thus, on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj</span>, the Court of Appeal observed that, even if the appellants had commenced proceedings by the correct process (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for judicial review seeking a <span class="font-italic">mandamus</span>), the court would still have refused the application “because <span class="font-italic">it was not for this court to instruct the law enforcement agencies as to how they should go about doing their jobs</span>” [emphasis added]: at [42].  In my view, the same approach should apply to situations where the applicant, as in the present case, seeks relief from the court to mandate the police to <span class="font-italic">halt</span> investigations.  Barring any express statutory provision which gives the Court the power to stop the police from carrying out its duty to conduct criminal investigations, I do not think it would be appropriate for the Court to direct the police on when to commence or stop its investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In his submissions, counsel for the plaintiff had completely failed to address this issue.  No statutory provision, case precedent, or legal principle was cited by the plaintiff for the proposition that it would have been appropriate for the Court to stop the police from carrying out its investigations in this case.  On the contrary, the CPC lays down detailed procedures on how the police should carry out its investigations and record statements from persons of interest.  For instance, the police have a duty under ss 16 and 17 of the CPC to investigate a case that has been reported under ss 14 or 15 of the CPC.  Section 22 of the CPC also lists detailed steps on how statements should be taken during investigations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Even for <span class="font-italic">criminal prosecutions</span> carried out by the AG, it is trite that the AG’s discretion to prosecute under Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“Constitution”) is only subject to judicial review in two situations: where the prosecutorial power is abused, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, and where its exercise contravenes constitutional protections and rights: <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam Ravinthran v Attorney-General</span> [2012] 2 SLR 49 at [17], endorsing <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Guat Neo Phyllis</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239 at [149].  The plaintiff did not seek to submit that these limits may or should be extended to <span class="font-italic">the police</span><span class="font-italic">.  </span>Assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that these limits could be extended to police investigations, the plaintiff had failed to show me that the police<span class="font-italic"> </span>had acted in bad faith or in contrary to the Constitution in this case.  Thus, the plaintiff had completely failed to satisfy me that the prohibiting and mandatory orders sought can be or should be granted in this case.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, the plaintiff failed to prove any <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of contempt of court.  Contrary to the plaintiff’s submissions, I did not think that there was any “second bite of the cherry” because MC 1595 is different from the CAD investigations.  Mr Kumar’s position in MC 1595 appears to be that AXA Insurance was not authorised to pay the S$30,000 to the plaintiff because he was no longer acting as Mr Kumar’s lawyer at the time when the payment was made.  If so, it is not illogical that Mr Kumar wishes to claim the full S$50,000 from the defendants in MC 1595 and not from the plaintiff.  At the same time, it also flows from Mr Kumar’s position in MC 1595 that the plaintiff had received the S$30,000 <span class="font-italic">meant for Mr Kumar </span>from AXA Insurance without authorisation, and that the plaintiff also has not turned over this sum to Mr Kumar or returned the money to AXA Insurance.  If so, I do not see why Mr Chen cannot <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> raise a complaint, on behalf of Mr Kumar, to the CAD in respect of this issue of the plaintiff retaining the S$30,000 he received.  Of course, I make no comment as to whether any offence has been made out, and I have been assured by counsel for the plaintiff at the hearing that the plaintiff had specific instructions from Mr Kumar on how to deal with the sum of S$30,000 that he received.  I have no doubt that the CAD investigations will cover this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 But, leaving aside the question of whether Mr Kumar had taken inconsistent positions, the more pertinent question was whether there may even be contempt of court by reason of the CAD investigations being allowed to continue.  The AJPA is now the primary source of the law of contempt in Singapore.  Contempt under s 3 of the AJPA refers to the interference of the court process or publications which risk prejudicing or interfering with legal proceedings or the course of justice.  Contempt under s 4 of the AJPA refers to disobeying court orders and breaching undertakings given to the court.  In particular, s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), which the plaintiff relied on, provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contempt by scandalising court, interfering with administration of justice, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.—(1)  Any person who — …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) intentionally does any other act that <span class="font-italic">interferes with, obstructs or poses a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice</span> in any other manner, if the person knows or ought to have known that the act would interfere with, obstruct or pose a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">commits a contempt of court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I could not see how any issue of contempt of court could arise by the mere fact that the CAD is carrying on its investigations into the plaintiff’s actions.  The mere fact that parallel criminal investigations are ongoing does not, in and of itself, pose a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice within the meaning of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the AJPA.  I agreed with counsel for the defendant that, under the CPC, criminal investigations do not come to a halt simply because there are related civil proceedings in the courts.  I also agreed with counsel for the defendant that there was no allegation at all that the CAD had in any way interfered with or obstructed proceedings in MC 1595, or commented on the merits of MC 1595, or prevented the plaintiff or any other party from participating in MC 1595.  It was telling that the plaintiff did not and could not point to any such interference or obstruction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Furthermore, from the affidavit evidence, it appeared that the CAD investigations were still in their early stages.  What, <span class="font-italic">if any</span>, specific charges might be brought as a result of the investigations in this case were still not known at that time.  Quite obviously, this would depend on the outcome of the investigations and the assessment of the case by the Attorney-General’s Chambers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Thus, in my judgment, the fact that MC 1595 is a civil suit dealing with the same facts which are the subject of the CAD investigations did not mean that criminal investigations could not proceed simultaneously.  The continuance of the CAD investigations, without more, cannot, by any conceivable argument, amount to “contempt of court”.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Third, the plaintiff also failed to show me why the investigations should be halted, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> there were contempt of court.  The usual consequence of a finding of contempt of court under the AJPA is that the offender would be punished and sentenced under s 12 of the AJPA accordingly.  There is nothing in the AJPA that gives the Court the power to <span class="font-italic">halt</span> criminal investigations as a result of any commission of contempt of court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As such, I was not satisfied that there was an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the prohibiting and mandatory orders sought by the plaintiff to restrain the CAD from continuing with its investigations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">POHA investigations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As for the POHA investigations, the plaintiff’s ground for seeking to restrain IO Cheong from resuming investigations was that she “was in collusion” with IO Toh “when the latter comraded [the plaintiff] to attend the [CAD] to take statement by [IO Cheong]”.  It was entirely unclear to me what this alleged collusion entailed, apart from the contention that the collusion was said to be proven by the mere fact that the two officers made a phone call together to the plaintiff on 23 September 2020.  The plaintiff had provided nothing more than a bare assertion without any details and without any supporting evidence.  In short, there was no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of this alleged collusion.  Such “skimpy or vague” claims do not, as aforementioned at [20] above, satisfy even the low threshold for leave.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On the other hand, IO Toh and IO Cheong had explained clearly on affidavit that they scheduled to interview the plaintiff on the same date <span class="font-italic">for convenience</span>.

</div>  This was to save him the trouble of attending the Police Cantonment Complex twice on different days, given that the CAD and the Central Division are both located in that complex.  I found this to be a perfectly sensible and, indeed, inherently logical thing for the two officers to have done, and I am unable to comprehend the plaintiff’s cause for complaint.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Far more significantly, counsel for the plaintiff could not explain what legal effect, if any, the alleged collusion had on the investigations.  Thus, there was completely no legal basis put forward by the plaintiff as to why he had an arguable case to be entitled to the prohibiting and mandatory orders in relation to the POHA investigations.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In his oral arguments, counsel for the plaintiff also argued that IO Cheong had compromised her independence by allowing IO Toh to request the plaintiff to come down for an interview on her behalf.  I am unable to agree that this was enough to raise any issues about the independence of IO Cheong.  It is quite clear to me that it was only for sake of convenience that a single officer wrote to the plaintiff on 23 September 2020 to arrange the interviews he would be attending at the Police Cantonment Complex on 28 September 2020. In my view, that was unobjectionable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In any event, I reiterate my observations at [29] to [33] above that the plaintiff had not satisfied me on the fundamental issue that it would be appropriate in this case for the Court to grant prohibiting and mandatory orders to stop the police investigations.  The same concerns also apply to the POHA investigations.  As such, I was also not satisfied that there was an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the prohibiting and mandatory orders sought by the plaintiff to restrain the police from continuing with the POHA investigations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 From my review of his affidavits and letters from plaintiff’s counsel to IO Toh and IO Cheong, the gist of the plaintiff’s complaints about the investigations appeared to be that the police reports, according to the plaintiff, are either untrue or unfounded, and that the complainant for the allegation of criminal breach of trust, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> Mr Kumar, is not a person of any credibility.  Instead, the investigations were, according to the plaintiff, “politically motivated”.  However, the plaintiff could not adduce <span class="font-italic">any evidence</span> to show even a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the investigations were so tainted by “political motivations”, and that there was some legal basis arising from this, such that the police should somehow be <span class="font-italic">mandated</span> to discontinue the investigations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I would add that, if it is indeed the plaintiff’s case that the police reports are unfounded, then it would <span class="font-italic">precisely</span> be in the plaintiff’s interest to formally provide his statement to the CAD and the police to explain his version of events so that the investigations may be properly concluded.  As stated at [29] above, there are detailed procedures laid down <span class="font-italic">by statute</span> in the CPC on how the police should carry out its investigations and record statements.  The police cannot – and, indeed, should not – simply ignore a police report solely because the person under investigation has raised claims <span class="font-italic">through counsel</span> that the police report is baseless.  The whole purpose of investigations is to determine whether the police report has grounds or not, and whether offences have been committed.  If a person’s statement of innocence or allegations of bad faith on the complainant’s part is enough to justify the Court ordering a stop to police investigations, if that were even possible, it would make a mockery of the powers and procedures for criminal investigations set out in the CPC.          </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the reasons set out above, I found the plaintiff’s claims in this application to be utterly devoid of any legal merit whatsoever.  As such, I dismissed OS 1044 with costs fixed in the amount of S$7,500 inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ravi s/o Madasamy (Carson Law Chambers) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Khoo Boo Jin, Joel Chen, Ailene Chou and Ashley Ong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
