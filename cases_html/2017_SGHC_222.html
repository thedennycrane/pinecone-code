The parties each led evidence from their respective psychiatric experts: the applicant led evidence from Dr Ung Eng Khean (“Dr Ung”), a psychiatrist from Adam Road Medical Centre; the respondent led evidence from Dr Koh Wun Wu Kenneth Gerald (“Dr Koh”), a senior consultant from the Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). As will be evident from my analysis below, the conflicting expert opinions of Dr Ung and Dr Koh on the mental condition of the applicant at the time of the offence constitute the very crux of the dispute in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the close of proceedings, I reserved judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The applicant had been charged under s 7 of the MDA for importing not less than 42.72g of diamorphine on 22 April 2009. On 22 November 2010, I found the applicant guilty following a trial, and sentenced him to death as mandated by s 33 read with the Second Schedule to the MDA: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam </span>[2011] 2 SLR 830 (“the Trial Judgment”). He appealed against his conviction. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 27 July 2011: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“the CA Decision”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The applicant’s execution was stayed in the midst of the government’s review of the mandatory death penalty regarding drug offences. On 14 November 2012, the Singapore Parliament passed the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 30 of 2012) (“the Amendment Act”). The Amendment Act introduced s 33B of the MDA, which confers upon the court the discretion to sentence an offender convicted of a capital drug charge to life imprisonment if: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) his involvement in the offence was merely as a courier as described under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">and</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>he has been issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the Public Prosecutor within the meaning of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 33B(2) of the MDA) (“the substantive assistance provision”); or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) his involvement in the offence was merely as a courier as described under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">and </span>he was suffering from an abnormality of mind within the meaning of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 33B(3) of the MDA) (“the abnormality of mind provision”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 27(6) of the Amendment Act allows persons who had been convicted and sentenced to death under the MDA prior to the amendments, and had their appeals dismissed, to be re-sentenced in accordance with s 33B.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 10 December 2014, the Prosecution informed the court and the then-counsel for the applicant that the Public Prosecutor would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be issuing a certificate of substantive assistance to the applicant. Despite this, the applicant filed the present application on 24 February 2015 to seek to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment under the substantive assistance provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The applicant also commenced various other applications. On 27 March 2015, the applicant commenced Originating Summons No 272 of 2015, seeking judicial review of the Public Prosecutor’s decision not to grant the certificate (“the judicial review application”). The proceedings for the judicial review application have been adjourned pending the outcome of the present re-sentencing application. On 8 January 2016, the applicant filed Criminal Motion No 2 of 2016 seeking, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a declaration that s 33B of the MDA is unconstitutional and contrary to the rule of law (“the constitutional challenge”). The Court of Appeal dismissed the constitutional challenge on 2 December 2016: <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Srivijayan v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 173.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 During the hearing for the re-sentencing application on 11 April 2017, the parties agreed to proceed on the basis that the applicant was seeking to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment under the abnormality of mind provision. The applicant has since, with my leave, amended the Notice of Motion on 7 August 2017 to update the grounds of the re-sentencing application to reflect this position. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The facts surrounding the offence have previously been compendiously summarised by the Court of Appeal when the Trial Judgment went on appeal. I thus gratefully adopt the facts as restated in the CA Decision and set out the portions that are pertinent to the present analysis as follows (the CA Decision at [5]–[15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5 The [applicant] testified that he met a Chinese man by the name of King on 21 April 2009, and asked King for a loan of RM500 in order to pay for his father’s heart operation on 23 April 2009 in Kuala Lumpur. King agreed. The next day, 22 April 2009, the [applicant] met King at a food shop in Johor Bahru at about 6.00pm. King handed the [applicant] what the [applicant] believed to be a packet of food together with a transparent plastic packet of curry, telling the [applicant] to deliver those items to a person in Woodlands, Singapore. King gave the [applicant] a telephone SIM card, and asked the [applicant] to put the said card into his phone and activate it upon entering Singapore. King also told the [applicant] to wait in front of a designated “7-Eleven” convenience store, and to give the items to a person in a “dark blue Camry”. After the delivery, the [applicant] was to return to Malaysia. King told the [applicant] that he had to complete the delivery of the items before he would lend the RM500 to the [applicant].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6 Just as the [applicant] was about to leave with the said items, King invited him into his (King’s) car, where he told the [applicant] that he had changed his mind and that he needed the [applicant] to deliver something else instead. King handed the [applicant a packet wrapped in newspaper (“the Bundle”)] … King said that the Bundle contained “company product” or “company spares”. King told the [applicant] that the Bundle had to be tied to the [applicant’s] thigh for the delivery. According to the [applicant], he initially resisted King’s request, but King slapped and punched him, threatening that if he refused to deliver the Bundle, King would “finish” and “kill” Shalini (the [applicant’s] girlfriend). King made the [applicant] remove one side of his trousers and raise his leg such that it rested on the dashboard of King’s car. Thereafter, King tied the Bundle around the [applicant’s] left inner thigh with yellow tape. King again instructed the [applicant] to go to Singapore and put the SIM card into his phone, and wait in front of the designated “7-Eleven” convenience store. As before, King informed the [applicant] that a “dark blue Camry” would come, that the person in the said Camry would be wearing blue-coloured spectacles, and that the [applicant] was to hand the Bundle to that person.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7 King then sent the [applicant] to the [applicant’s] apartment to prepare for the delivery trip. When the [applicant] alighted from King’s car, the [applicant] telephoned Kumarsen and told Kumarsen that he had to take some money to Singapore. Kumarsen agreed to give him a ride. The [applicant] returned to his room in the apartment and put on a pair of trousers which belonged to one Tamilselvam (Kumarsen’s nephew, who was staying in the [applicant’s] room). Because Tamilselvam was much bigger sized than the [applicant], the [applicant] had to use a belt to secure the fit. According to the [applicant], he wore Tamilselvam’s trousers because King had told him to wear bigger trousers as it was important that what was in the Bundle was not damaged. Although Shalini, Tamilselvam and one Ramesh were in the apartment at that time, the [applicant] testified that he did not tell any of them what King had done or said to him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 Kumarsen rode his motorcycle, with the [applicant] riding pillion, to the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint. At about 7.45pm, the [applicant] and Kumarsen were stopped at the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint by the passport screening officer and taken to an office. In the office, the [applicant] called Shalini. The [applicant] and Kumarsen were thereafter brought to different rooms by various officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9 Staff Sergeant Syed Anis Bin Syed Omar Alsree (“SSgt Anis”), a CNB officer, commenced the strip search of the [applicant] … During the strip search, the [applicant] was asked by SSgt Anis to remove his trousers, which he did. At this point, SSgt Anis saw the Bundle secured to the [applicant’s] left inner thigh with yellow tape over the red pair of boxer briefs that he was wearing. Later, Sergeant Muhd Zaid Bin Adam and Sergeant Shahrulnizam s/o Abdullah (“Sgt Shahrulnizam”) entered the room and SSgt Anis left the room. Sgt Shahrulnizam spoke to the [applicant] in Tamil, handcuffed him, and then proceeded to remove the Bundle from the [applicant’s] thigh. While doing so, part of the Bundle’s newspaper wrapping tore, enabling Sgt Shahrulnizam to see that the Bundle contained a transparent plastic bag with white granular substance in it. The white granular substance was subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 42.72g of heroin.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 At about 12.10am on 23 April 2009, Sgt Shahrulnizam handed the seized exhibits to Sergeant Vasanthakumar Pillai s/o M M Iruthaya Nathen Pillai (“Sgt Vasanthakumar”) for the purpose of recording statements from the [applicant] and Kumarsen … Sgt Vasanthakumar recorded Kumarsen’s statement first, and later recorded the [applicant’s] statement between 1.20am and 1.35am. The material portions of the [applicant’s] statement recorded by Sgt Vasanthakumar read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q1) What is this? (Pointing to a zip lock Bag consisting of 1 big packet of white granular substance, Crushed Newspaper &amp; yellow Tape)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A1) Heroin.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q2) Whom does it belong to?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A2) It belongs to my Chinese friend who goes by the name of king who strapped it on my left thigh.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q3) Why did he strapped it on your left Thigh?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A3) He Strapped it on my left thigh is because it was for my safety and no one will find it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q4) Whom is it to be delivered to?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A4) It is to be delivered to one Chinese recipient who will be driving a dark blue Camry and he will be meeting me in front of [the] 7-11 store at Woodlands Transit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q5) Why do you have to deliver the Heroin?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A5) I have to deliver [the] Heroin is because I owe king money &amp; he promised to pass me another five hundred dollars after my delivery.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 At about 6.02am on 23 April 2009, Assistant Superintendent Sivaraman Letchumanan recorded the [applicant’s] cautioned statement, the material part of which is as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I was forced and sent into Singapore. I had borrowed money on interest. My father is undergoing an operation this morning. I went and asked the same person an additional RM500/-. And he told me to deliver something. First he gave me a package with Roti Channai and gravy. As I was leaving the shop, he called me by my name ‘Raja’ and requested me to return to the shop. He asked me to remove my pants and he placed a bundle wrapped up in Chinese Newspaper on my left upper thigh and he used a tape and taped the packet around my thigh. He went 3 time round. I asked him ‘what is this’ and he told me it is for your safety and the thing will be save. He is a male chinese known to me as ‘King’. I did not know what was inside the package and only when it was opened up, one of the sirs told me it was Heroin. The rider of the motorcycle does not know anything about this. I was threatened that if I didn’t return the money, they will knock down my girlfriend using a car. That is all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In the Trial Judgment, I accepted that the statements made by the applicant to the CNB officers had been provided voluntarily and recorded accurately (at [33]). Also, I “did not accept the [applicant’s] version of facts to be true, in particular the alleged fact that King had assaulted the [applicant] and threatened to kill [the applicant’s girlfriend] if the [applicant] refused to (a) let King strap onto his left thigh the Bundle, which King told him contained ‘company spares’ or ‘company product’ and (b) deliver the strapped Bundle to King’s ‘brother’ in Singapore” (at [34]). I thus found that the applicant had failed to establish the defence of duress on a balance of probabilities (at [18]–[19]). I also found that the applicant did have actual knowledge of the contents of the Bundle at the material time of the offence (at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed all of the aforementioned findings made at trial: see the CA Decision at [18]–[19]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The expert evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 For the purposes of this re-sentencing application, the following expert reports were tendered:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) A psychiatric report from Dr Koh dated 11 April 2013 (“Dr Koh’s 2013 Report);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) A psychological report from Ms Eunice Seah (“Ms Seah”), a psychologist at the Department of Psychology of the IMH, dated 12 April 2013 (“Ms Seah’s Report”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) A psychiatric report from Dr Ung dated 22 August 2016 (“Dr Ung’s Report”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) A further psychological report from Dr Patricia Yap (“Dr Yap”), the Principal Clinical Psychologist at the IMH, dated 1 February 2017 (“Dr Yap’s Report”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) A further psychiatric report from Dr Koh dated 7 February 2017 (“Dr Koh’s 2017 Report”).</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dr Koh’s 2013 Report</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The applicant was first referred to Dr Koh for a forensic psychiatric evaluation while he was awaiting the execution of his sentence following his conviction at trial.

In addition, his cognitive functioning was well-preserved in the following domains: basic attention span, working memory and visuo-spatial skills. Notably, his performance was impaired in information processing tasks, but this slowness was likely to be due to his concern with performing well and not a true deficit. In contrast, Mr Nagaenthran’s visual memory was impaired and did not improve significantly with recognition cues. With regards to verbal memory, when he was asked to remember unstructured information (i.e., word lists), his performance was impaired; but his recall and recognition improved to be within the <span class="font-italic">Low Average to Average </span>range when the information was structured and within a context (i.e., stories). These results are generally consistent with Mr Nagaenthran’s complaints of poor memory. Additionally, testing revealed that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">while many of Mr </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nagaenthran’s executive functioning skills were impaired (including verbal fluency, set-shifting, abstract reasoning, judgment, strategy formation, and problem-solving) he</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">was able to plan and organise on simpler items and there were no indications </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">of problems with impulsivity and vigilance</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Both Mr Nagaenthran and his sister rated him as significant for ADHD symptoms on the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), and indications of issues with inattentiveness and sustained attention in a computerised test suggested that it would be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ADHD of the inattentive subtype</span>. Mr Nagaenthran’s performance on the computerised test was associated with a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">moderate rather than high likelihood of having a disorder characterized by attention deficits</span>.

His sister has observed that Mr Nagaenthran has always been his friends’ scapegoat and does not think about himself and his family when he does whatever his friends ask him to do. While there are some indications in the current assessment that Mr Nagaenthran may have adult ADHD, his account of the incidents leading to his arrest suggests that he acted in a pre-meditated fashion and understood the potential consequences of his behaviour.

First, Dr Koh disagreed with Dr Ung that the applicant was mildly intellectually disabled.

</div> both Dr Yap and Ms Seah had concluded that the applicant was not intellectually disabled. Second, Dr Koh rejected Dr Ung’s diagnosis that the applicant had ADHD. Dr Koh called into question Dr Ung’s reliance on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (“ASRS”), given that the ASRS is a self-rating scale that carries the attendant possibility of bias. Dr Koh suggested that Dr Yap’s employment of the more objective Connor’s Continuous Performance Test (3rd Edition) (“CPT3”) was more instructive. Dr Koh’s opinion was that even if the applicant has ADHD, his condition is mild, with features of inattentiveness, but not hyperactivity or impulsiveness.

This is abundantly clear from the applicant’s evidence given in his long statement that he had to deliver the drugs that he was caught with because he owed King money and King promised to pay him another RM500 after the delivery, and that he knew little about the transaction beyond the fact that the drugs were to be “delivered to one Chinese recipient who will be driving a dark blue Camry and [who] will be meeting [the applicant] in front of [the] 7-11 store at Woodlands Transit” (see [9] above).

</div> Finally, DPP Lau suggests that, far from having any mental disorders, the applicant has in fact shown himself to be fully capable of a significant degree of deliberation and intelligence in his dealings with others, given that he was able to draw up multiple conflicting accounts that were each internally consistent, logical and rich in detail when questioned by the investigation agencies, before the court and by all the examining psychiatrists thus far.

According to him, Dr Ung’s opinion that the applicant’s cognitive deficits could have caused him to be more susceptible to over-estimating the threats from King ought to be rejected because his claims of duress had been dismissed at trial. Also, Dr Ung’s opinion that the applicant’s cognitive deficits could have caused him to be more susceptible to misguided gang loyalty also ought to be rejected because this account is a mere afterthought. Ultimately, DPP Lau suggests that the applicant’s true motivation for committing the offence was simply that he owed King money and he needed to perform the delivery to earn more money; this showed that the applicant’s mental responsibility could not have been substantially impaired as he took a calculated risk.

However, it has been repeatedly applied in the context of determining whether the diminished responsibility exception to murder under Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) is satisfied: see <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Rahmat v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span>”) at [79], citing <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 1 SLR 606 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Pang </span><span class="font-italic">Siew</span>”) at [58] and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Zhijian and another appeal </span>[2014] SGCA 58 (“<span class="font-italic">Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Zhijian</span>”) at [50].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Exception</span> 7.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is, in essence, a near-identical reproduction of Exception 7: <span class="font-italic">Rosman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]; <span class="font-italic">Jeffery </span><span class="font-italic">Phua </span>at [6]. It thus stands to reason that this three-limb test ought to be applied with the same level of methodical rigour in the context of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA as in cases involving Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As a brief aside, I note that the structuring of the analysis for the abnormality of mind provision as a “three-stage test” has previously been criticised in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">G </span><span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy Naidu v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 874 (“<span class="font-italic">Naidu</span>”), which dealt with Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code. The court in <span class="font-italic">Naidu </span>took the view that the “three-stage test” is a “misapplication of the law” because the exception is a “composite clause that must be read and applied as a whole” (at [4]); the exception requires the court to merely answer the straightforward question of whether the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility (at [6]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, the <span class="font-italic">Naidu </span>decision goes against the considerable weight of previous Court of Appeal jurisprudence on this point: it presents a marked departure from the approach adopted in previous Court of Appeal decisions like <span class="font-italic">Took Leng How v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 70 (“<span class="font-italic">Took Leng How</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Chua Hwa Soon Jimmy v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 601, which all affirmed the “three-stage test”. More critically, the <span class="font-italic">Naidu </span>approach has also not been endorsed in subsequent Court of Appeal decisions like <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), <span class="font-italic">Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Zhijian</span> ([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), which have all affirmed the “three-stage test”. Given the guidance from these later Court of Appeal decisions, it appears that the same “three-stage test” ought to be applied when conducting the present analysis in relation to s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I am disinclined to apply the approach espoused in <span class="font-italic">Naidu</span>. In my view, the “three-stage test” promotes conceptual clarity by making clear the distinction between the elements that ought to be a matter of expert evidence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second limb) and elements that ought to be exclusively a matter for judicial determination (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first and third limbs) (see [40] below). For myself, the key principle that should be extracted from <span class="font-italic">Naidu</span> is that there simply must be “appropriate links established by the evidence between these three elements” of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>): Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan &amp; Chan Wing Cheong, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore</span> (LexisNexis, Rev 2nd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan</span>”) at para 27.8. If anything, the court’s single-minded focus in <span class="font-italic">Naidu</span> on the composite inquiry – of whether the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility – ought to simply be interpreted as a recognition of the fact that among the three limbs of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), the third limb is the critical question that brings together all the other limbs of this provision: <span class="font-italic">Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan</span> at para 27.34.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Turning back to the application of this three-limb test, it is trite that while the second limb, which concerns the aetiology or root cause of the abnormality, is a matter largely within the purview of expert opinion, the first and third limbs are matters that cannot be the subject of any medical opinion and must be left to the determination of the judge as the finder of fact: <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [80]; <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [59]. In arriving at a determination for the first and third limbs, the judge is “entitled and indeed bound to consider not only the medical evidence but the evidence upon the whole facts and circumstances of the case”: <span class="font-italic">Walton v The Queen </span>[1978] AC 788 at 793 (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Keith of Kinkel), quoted in <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew</span> at [59]. It also bears further emphasis that s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA ought to be construed <span class="font-italic">narrowly</span>, given that Parliament’s intent is for this provision to “operate in a measured and narrowly defined way” and avoid inadvertently opening the backdoor for offenders to escape harsh punishment notwithstanding their understanding of the consequences of their offences: see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Rosman </span>([23] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [46].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evaluating expert evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Given that this application also requires me to decide which party’s expert evidence ought to be preferred, I turn next to set out the principles pertaining to evaluating expert evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 When a court is presented with expert evidence, as a matter of general practice, the following observations of V K Rajah JA in the Magistrate’s Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Sakthivel</span><span class="font-italic"> Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakthivel</span>”) (at [76]) are highly instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What is axiomatic is that a judge is not entitled to substitute his own views for those of an uncontradicted expert’s: <span class="font-italic">Saeng</span><span class="font-italic">-Un Udom v PP</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 1. Be that as it may, a court must not on the other hand unquestioningly accept unchallenged evidence. Evidence must invariably be sifted, weighed and evaluated in the context of the factual matrix and in particular, the objective facts. An expert’s opinion “should not fly in the face of proven extrinsic facts relevant to the matter” <span class="font-italic">per</span> Yong Pung How CJ in <span class="font-italic">Khoo James v </span><span class="font-italic">Gunapathy d/o Muniandy </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 414 at [65]. In reality, substantially the same rules apply to the evaluation of expert testimony as they would to other categories of witness testimony. Content credibility, evidence of partiality, coherence and a need to analyse the evidence in the context of established facts remain vital considerations; [the expert witness’s] demeanour, however, more often than not recedes into the background as a yardstick.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage was quoted with affirmation by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Poh Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace) </span>[2010] 1 SLR 1129 at [22].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Additionally, in respect of conflicting expert evidence in particular, the following observations in <span class="font-italic">Sakthivel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>from Rajah JA (at [75]) are pertinent:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where there is conflicting evidence between experts it will not be the sheer number of experts articulating a particular opinion or view that matters, but rather the consistency and logic of the preferred evidence that is paramount. Generally speaking, the court should also scrutinise the credentials and relevant experience of the experts in their professed and acknowledged areas of expertise. Not all experts are of equal authority and/or reliability. In so far as medical evidence is concerned, an expert with greater relevant clinical experience may often prove to be more credible and reliable on “hands-on” issues although this is not an inevitable rule of thumb. Having said that, there is no precise pecking order or hierarchy relating to expert evidence. Experts may sometimes be abundantly eminent while lacking credibility in a particular matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having considered all the facts of the case, the expert evidence tendered before me, as well as the parties’ respective submissions, I have come to the conclusion that the applicant has not met any of the three elements prescribed under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA.

In my view, the applicant was not suffering from an abnormality of mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The definition of what amounts to an “abnormality of mind” has been accepted by the Court of Appeal to be the following passage explicated by Lord Parker CJ in the English Court of Criminal Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Regina v Byrne </span>[1960] 2 QB 396 (“<span class="font-italic">Byrne</span>”) (at 403):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘Abnormality of mind,’ … means a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal. It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind’s activities in all its aspects, not only the <span class="font-italic">perception of physical acts and matters, and the ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise the will power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment</span>. The expression ‘mental responsibility for his acts’ points to a consideration of the <span class="font-italic">extent to which the accused’s mind is answerable for his physical acts</span> which must include a consideration of the extent of his ability to exercise will power to control his physical acts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(See <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [81], <span class="font-italic">Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Zhijian </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [64] and <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [61].) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Two key principles may be extracted from the <span class="font-italic">Byrne </span>definition of “abnormality of mind”. First, the court, in assessing whether the applicant suffers from an “abnormality of mind”, must determine whether the evidence shows an abnormally reduced mental capacity to: (1) understand events; (2) judge the rightness or wrongness of one’s actions; or (3) exercise self-control (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [82], citing <span class="font-italic">Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 27.12). Second, the first limb “requires the court to be satisfied not only of the fact that the accused was suffering from a condition that a reasonable man would consider abnormal, but further that the abnormality was of such a<span class="font-italic"> degree </span>as to impair<span class="font-italic"> </span>the accused’s cognitive functions or self-control” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Took Leng How </span>([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [47]. This means that it is necessary for the applicant in this case to show that any alleged abnormality of mind that he is suffering from is an abnormality to such an <span class="font-italic">extent</span> that his cognitive functioning or self-control is impaired. In the words of the Chao Hick Tin JA in <span class="font-italic">Took Leng How</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [47]), this first limb under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA “should never be deemed satisfied unless the extent of the purported abnormality is also established”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It must also be emphasised that it is the applicant’s mental condition <span class="font-italic">at the time of the offence</span>, and not at any other time, that is relevant when assessing whether the applicant was suffering from an abnormality of mind: <span class="font-italic">Took Leng How </span>([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [48]; see also <span class="font-italic">Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 27.17.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, Dr Ung diagnosed the applicant to be suffering from the following conditions: (1) Severe Alcohol Use Disorder, (2) Severe ADHD Combined Type and (3) Mild Intellectual Disability (see [18] above). Based on the principles set out in the foregoing paragraphs, it is necessary for me to determine whether the evidence in respect of each of the three alleged conditions shows a mental capacity that is abnormally reduced to such an extent that the applicant’s ability to understand events, judge the rightness or wrongness of one’s actions, or exercise self-control can be said to have been impaired at the time of the offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I will now address each condition in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alcohol use disorder</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I begin with Dr Ung’s diagnosis of severe alcohol use disorder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Dr Ung’s diagnosis of this condition was based on his administration of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (“AUDIT”) when interviewing the applicant on 19 July 2016 and his evaluation of the applicant using the alcohol use disorder diagnostic criteria under the DSM-V. According to Dr Ung, the applicant’s AUDIT score of 30 apparently corresponds to harmful use and dependence on alcohol. Also, Dr Ung claims that the applicant’s alleged pattern of harmful alcohol use corresponds to alcohol use disorder.

Dr Koh’s opinion is thus formed on the basis of: (1) Dr Koh’s clinical assessment of the applicant as well as Dr Yap’s psychological testing results, and (2) corroborative information obtained from Dr Koh’s interviews with the applicant’s sister and the prison officer in charge of his housing unit.

It was earlier mentioned that Dr Koh has diagnosed the applicant’s ADHD condition to be only of the inattentive subtype and only “mild at most” (see [63] above). Although Dr Ung opines that the applicant labours under a “severe” ADHD condition with combined presentation, I have already dismissed his diagnosis as unreliable for the reasons stated above (see [64] above). As stated under the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for ADHD, a diagnosis of ADHD of “mild” severity entails “no more than minor impairments in social or occupational functioning” (see [60] above). In addition, the DSM-V diagnostic features for ADHD state that ADHD of the inattentive subtype merely involves “wandering off task, lacking persistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to defiance or lack of comprehension”.

His inadequate performance at a practical level is manifest by his inability to last in any one job for more than 3 months (even shorter durations in non-security jobs). With respect to his social domain, he has difficulty regulating emotion and behaviour in age-appropriate fashion as well as gullibility manifest by his acting as a guarantor for his friend and acting as a courier leading to his current offence … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Conversely, Dr Koh, Ms Seah and Dr Yap all opine in their respective expert reports that the applicant is <span class="font-italic">not </span>intellectually disabled, and merely suffers from borderline intellectual functioning (see [14], [16], [20]–[21] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my judgment, the applicant only suffered from borderline intellectual functioning, and did not suffer from mild intellectual disability. First, Dr Ung’s conclusion that criterion A is clearly satisfied is questionable. It is true that Ms Seah’s Report states that the applicant obtained an FSIQ score of merely 69 following the administration of the WAIS-IV, which placed him within the high end of the <span class="font-italic">Extremely Low</span> range. However, as rightly observed in the DSM-V diagnostic features for intellectual disability (see [68] above), “IQ test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be insufficient to assess reasoning in real-life situations and mastery of practical tasks”. Indeed, Ms Seah goes on to observe in her report that the applicant’s FSIQ confidence interval from 66 to 74 indicates with 95% certainty that the applicant was in fact operating between the <span class="font-italic">Extremely Low </span>to <span class="font-italic">Borderline </span>range of functioning. This is more consistent with the applicant’s performance on the VCI, PRI and PSI, all of which place the applicant within the <span class="font-italic">Borderline </span>range of functioning. This was then subsequently confirmed by Dr Yap in her report, where she concluded after administering numerous tests, including the WAIS-IV, that the applicant was not intellectually disabled. In particular, the applicant scored within the <span class="font-italic">Borderline </span>range for both the PRI and WMI. Also, while the tests showed that many of the applicant’s executive functioning skills were impaired, Dr Yap emphasised that the applicant was able to plan and organise on simpler items, which I take to be an indication that he is not intellectually disabled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, Dr Ung’s conclusion that criterion B is satisfied is also dubious. In this regard, I agree with the respondent’s submission that Dr Ung’s basis for finding that the applicant fulfils criterion B does not withstand scrutiny. The bare fact that the applicant has not been able to last in any one job for more than three months does not appear to be sufficient to show a supposed deficiency in the applicant’s <span class="font-italic">practical</span> domain of adaptive functioning. There may be other reasons why the applicant left those jobs: the applicant previously revealed inMs Seah’s interview that he “typically left his previous jobs after a few months as they either did not pay well or … he did not like some of the jobs”.

</div> The applicant used to hold low-paying jobs, which included working as a security officer, a car wash worker and a welder. It was thus not entirely unexpected that the applicant would switch jobs frequently in search of higher pay. In fact, given that the applicant clearly demonstrated an ability to seek and obtain employment both in Malaysia and Singapore and travel between both countries on his own, I find that the applicant was relatively adept at living independently. He thus should not be considered to be deficient in the practical domain of adaptive functioning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As for the applicant’s apparent gullibility as evinced in his acting as a guarantor for his friend (see [69] above), I disagree that this in itself shows that the applicant is deficient in the <span class="font-italic">social</span> domain of adaptive functioning. There are many reasons why someone would be willing to act as a guarantor for a friend. This fact relied on by Dr Ung is thus neither here nor there. Even if gullibility could somehow be equated with deficiency in the social domain of adaptive functioning, it is highly questionable whether the applicant was indeed truly gullible. The applicant is no babe in the woods: his actions adopted in respect of the drug importation itself reveal that he is capable of manipulation and evasion. In order to obtain a ride into Singapore, the applicant first lied to Kumarsen that he wanted to enter Singapore to collect money.

Having said that, this is nevertheless a telling indication that the condition of borderline intellectual functioning should not be considered an abnormality that is severe enough to be considered an “abnormality of mind” for the purposes of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Following from my analysis above, I find that the applicant was not suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence. The applicant did not suffer from any alcohol use disorder, severe or otherwise. Also, the applicant’s mild ADHD condition of the inattentive subtype as well as his borderline intellectual functioning are both conditions that are not of such a degree as to impair the applicant’s mental capacity to understand events, judge the rightness or wrongness of one’s actions, or exercise self-control.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 At this juncture, I note that the applicant relies heavily on the decision of <span class="font-italic">Jeffery </span><span class="font-italic">Phua</span>, where Choo Han Teck J held that the applicant fell within the ambit of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) because his abnormality of mind had an influence on his ability to resist his act of importation (at [16]), and because he was probably incapable of resisting any internal rationality that might have dissuaded him from committing the offence (at [17]). In my view, <span class="font-italic">Jeffery </span><span class="font-italic">Phua </span>does not assist the applicant here. It is trite that each case must turn on its own facts. The two psychiatric experts in <span class="font-italic">Jeffery </span><span class="font-italic">Phua </span>had agreed that the applicant was suffering from Persistent Depressive Disorder and Ketamine Dependence, and Choo J accepted that both conditions amounted to an abnormality of mind (at [2]). As already canvassed above, the same cannot be said for the applicant in the present re-sentencing application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In the light of this conclusion, the applicant’s bid to be re-sentenced to life imprisonment fails at the very first hurdle. It is thus technically unnecessary for me to decide whether the other two limbs of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA are satisfied. Having said that, out of an abundance of caution, I will nevertheless proceed to briefly consider them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Aetiology of the abnormality of mind</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I now turn to address the second limb of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. In my view, the applicant has also failed to satisfy this limb of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For this part of the analysis, the court has to determine, with the help of the expert evidence adduced, whether the applicant’s abnormality of mind arose from or was induced by one of the prescribed causes listed in the second limb. It has been recognised that the wording of the prescribed causes in the second limb “appear[s] wide enough to include most recognised medical conditions”; having said that, the onus still remains squarely on the applicant to identify which of the prescribed causes is applicable to his case: see <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [89].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In my judgment, even assuming that the applicant was indeed suffering from all of the three abnormalities of mind as diagnosed by Dr Ung, the applicant has not been able to identify which of the prescribed causes is applicable to his case. The Court of Appeal has recently issued a salutary reminder in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>for expert witnesses testifying in such matters to, “on top of diagnosing whether the accused person was suffering from a recognised mental condition, identify which prescribed cause, if any, in their opinion gave rise to the accused’s abnormality of mind” (at [89]). Yet, this is precisely what Dr Ung has failed to do in his expert report. It bears mentioning that this is a significant lacuna in Dr Ung’s Report, given the fact that identifying the aetiology of the abnormality has been recognised to be a matter largely within the purview of expert opinion (see [40] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Mr Thuraisingam tries to make some arguments in favour of showing that the second limb has been satisfied. He first asserts that “it is clear that the [applicant’s] abnormality of mind was induced by disease or injury, namely, the [applicant’s] ADHD”.

</div> I reject this argument. For it to make sense, the applicant must show that the applicant’s ADHD condition, which is in itself one of the applicant’s abnormalities of mind, <span class="font-italic">induced </span>the onset of either of the applicant’s other two abnormalities of mind, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, his mild intellectual disability or severe alcohol use disorder, such that the ADHD condition is now the “disease or injury”. The applicant has not shown any evidence of such linkages amongst the different abnormalities of mind diagnosed by Dr Ung; this argument is simply a bare assertion. Mr Thuraisingam next contends that the applicant’s mild intellectual disability arose from inherent causes – the cognitive deficits may have been present in the applicant congenitally, or may have arisen from heavy alcohol use. While that may all very well be the case, the fact remains that Dr Ung has failed to offer his opinion regarding these potential inherent causes. The result, as Dr Koh has rightly pointed out in his 2017 report, is that “[t]he origin of these mild cognitive deficits in Mr Nagaenthran is speculative”.

</div> In my view, mere speculation ought not to suffice when deciding whether this limb has been satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The burden remains on the applicant to establish each limb of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA on the balance of probabilities.

In my view, the applicant has also failed to show that there was a substantial impairment of his mental responsibility for the offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 It is trite that “substantial impairment” requires neither total nor minimal impairment; what amounts to a substantial impairment of mental responsibility falls somewhere in between, and is a matter for the finder of fact to decide on in a commonsensical way: <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [64]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Juminem and another </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 536 at [30], quoting <span class="font-italic">Regina v Lloyd </span>[1967] 1 QB 175 at 178; see also <span class="font-italic">Yeo, Morgan &amp; Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 27.34.

The applicant would be unable to show that any of the diagnosed abnormalities of mind has substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his offence as there is no factual basis on which to make any such finding of substantial impairment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The applicant has, at various points in time from his arrest till now, furnished vastly distinct accounts of why he had committed the offence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When the applicant was first arrested, he admitted in his contemporaneous statement that he knew that the Bundle contained heroin which he was delivering for King. He also stated that he had to deliver the heroin as he owed King money and was promised another RM500 after delivery. There was no mention of any threat made by King towards the applicant’s girlfriend if he had refused to make the delivery (see [9] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) During trial, the applicant denied knowledge of the contents of the Bundle, insisting that he was told that it contained “company products”. The applicant then claimed that he had made the delivery under duress – King had assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend unless he made the delivery (see [9] above). The applicant repeated this account to Dr Koh when he was examined in on 14 and 21 March 2013.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is thus nigh impossible for me to conclude in the present application that the applicant’s mental responsibility was indeed substantially impaired at the time of the offence. In the first place, I do not accept the applicant’s suggestion that his mental responsibility was substantially impaired because his condition made him more susceptible to over-estimating the threat from King. At trial, I had already rejected the applicant’s claim that he was coerced by King to make the delivery. My finding was subsequently upheld on appeal. Hence, there was simply no threat for the applicant to be more susceptible to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Next, the applicant’s alternative suggestion – that his mental responsibility was substantially impaired because his condition contributed to his misguided loyalty to his gang – must also be rejected. I do not believe that the applicant’s accounts to Dr Ung and Dr Yap are credible accounts of events. I am unable to accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the applicant had indeed transported the Bundle out of misguided gang loyalty. This was not the version of facts that was elicited at trial; this account only emerged in late 2016, more than seven years after the commission of the offence. I thus reject this account of events as a bare afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Having rejected both accounts based on coercion by King and misguided gang loyalty, we are accordingly left with the account provided at the point of arrest, which is that the applicant delivered the Bundle, which he knew contained heroin, simply because he needed money. Taking this account to once again be the most believable account of events (having been previously accepted at trial as the true state of affairs as well), I agree with the respondent’s submission that this account shows that the applicant’s mental responsibility could not have been substantially impaired. The applicant clearly understood the nature of what he was doing and did not lose his sense of judgment of the rightness or wrongness of what he was doing. He also did not appear to lose his self-control, given that he had ample time to consider his actions and took multiple deliberate steps to execute the importation of the Bundle. These steps included taking precautions to conceal the drugs by wearing larger trousers, tricking Kumarsen into giving him a ride into Singapore, and attempting to manipulate the CNB officers into not searching him (see [73] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 On the whole, I find that there is no basis to draw an inference that the applicant’s mental responsibility was substantially impaired in the commission of his offence, even if he is regarded to have been labouring under an abnormality of mind.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94   For all of the reasons set out above, I dismiss this re-sentencing application. Even though the applicant was a mere courier within the meaning of s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, I find that he has not satisfied the requirements under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). He has not shown that he “was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions” in relation to his offence.
