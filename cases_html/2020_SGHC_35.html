The main difference in the present application lies in the fact that it was brought by the PTIBs in order to realise the assets of the Bankrupt as part of their general administration of his estate, which includes the Bankrupt’s share in the Property as a tenant in common with the respondent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 For the purposes of invoking the power of sale, I saw no difference between an application by a non-bankrupt co-owner and that by the OA or trustees in bankruptcy who represent the interests of a bankrupt co-owner’s creditors. It is clear that the OA is empowered to sell a bankrupt’s property and to institute legal proceedings in relation to the same under s 111(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 112(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act, and the trustee in bankruptcy is empowered to do the same under s 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. The PTIBs were entitled to apply to the court for an order to sell the Property because the Bankrupt’s interest in the Property has vested in them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The present scenario was also considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>. The case involved a house owned by three individuals as tenants in common: the appellant (“Su”), the first respondent (“Priya”) and the second respondent (“Philip”) in respective shares of 50%, 49% and 1%. The house was originally owned by Phillip and Su as joint tenants but the joint tenancy was severed in 2004 when Priya bought over a 49% share in the house. She signed a sale and purchase agreement which included a particular clause 10 (“cl 10”). This clause, in essence, provided that Priya would not evict Su and her children from the house as it was their place of dwelling (<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>at [14]). Priya subsequently ran into financial difficulties and thus applied for an order that the house be sold in order for her to use the sale proceeds to stave off impending bankruptcy proceedings. The Court of Appeal upheld the order of sale and further noted, in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> at [74], that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if no order for sale was made and Priya were to be adjudged a bankrupt, it would likely be the Official Assignee who would be seeking an order for the sale of the Property in order to meet the claims of Priya’s creditors. In that situation, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">we fail to see </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">how cl 10</span><span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">even on the basis of Su’s interpretation, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">could possibly have stood in the way of the Official Assignee</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Thus, the possibility of the OA applying to court for the sale of property to meet the claims of the creditors of a bankrupt co-owner has been judicially approved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Having decided that the court has the power under s 18(2) read with para 2 of the First Schedule to the SCJA on the application of the OA or the PTIBs to order a sale of the Property co-owned by the Bankrupt, I now turn to explain the considerations behind my decision to so order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Considerations in ordering the sale of the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The High Court can order the sale of land if it would be “necessary or expedient” to do so per para 2 of the First Schedule to the SCJA.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I did not think that <span class="font-italic">all </span>the <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>factors were applicable to the present case. In particular, it was not necessary to consider (1) the state of the relationship between the parties and (2) the prospect of the relationship between the parties deteriorating if a sale is not granted. This is because the <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>factors are specifically tailored towards a joint ownership context in which a fellow non-bankrupt co-owner invokes the court’s power of sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Bankrupt is not a party to the present application and, in any event, the PTIBs are wholly entitled to deal with the Property that forms part of his bankruptcy estate for the benefit of his creditors. Unlike previous cases dealing with the court’s power of sale under the SCJA, there is no relationship between the PTIBs and the respondent to speak of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>factors are guidelines distilled from a long line of case law involving co-owners who sought to invoke the court’s power of sale. They are not meant to be applied as a comprehensive and concretised check-list to be addressed in every case, whether or not warranted on the facts. Neither has it been the approach of our courts both before and after the decision in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>, to consider and address every single factor when the factual matrix plainly does not call for it. By way of illustration: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Abu Bakar</span>, S Rajendran J ordered the sale of a small family house after considering the difficulty in implementing an order for partition and the inability of the other co-owners to pay for the applicant’s one-third share in the property (at [18]–[19]). He did not separately consider the state of the relationship between the parties nor the lack of a prior agreement between parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo v Foo Jee Seng </span>[2016] SGHC 225, Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) considered whether to order the sale of a property owned by two brothers as tenants in common. She ordered the sale after considering that neither party was presently living in the property and that their acrimonious relationship would make continued cooperation difficult (at [23]). There was no explicit enumeration of the potential prejudice that each co-owner might face if a sale was granted. As there was no prior agreement concerning the manner in which the land was to be disposed of, this factor was not alluded to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 At this juncture, I pause to note that my approach aligns with the decision in <span class="font-italic">BYX v BYY</span> [2019] SGHC 237, which was released shortly after parties had made their submissions. There, Tan Puay Boon JC found that the <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>factors are “largely limited to the joint ownership context” and were thus inapplicable in the context of an execution creditor who wished to effect the sale of the judgment debtor’s mortgaged immovable property that had been seized under a writ of seizure and sale (at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I am of the view that when a court considers whether it is necessary or expedient to order a sale of property upon the application of the OA or the trustee in bankruptcy, it should consider not only the interests of all the individuals who may be directly affected by the sale but also the creditors of the bankrupt co-owner of the property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As a general rule, the court should consider all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case and conduct a balancing exercise. Some of the factors to be taken into account in the balancing exercise may include the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the expected share of sale proceeds would be sufficient to discharge the debts owed by the bankrupt to his creditors. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the co-owner resisting the sale has contributed, benefited or is in any way related to the events that led to the bankruptcy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The potential prejudice that the co-owner(s) and any third parties might face in each of the possible scenarios, namely, if a sale is granted and if it is not granted. An example of such prejudice to the co-owner(s) could include their inability to find feasible alternative accommodation once a sale is ordered due to the low price their property might fetch.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The potential prejudice that creditors might face in each of the two abovementioned scenarios.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Whether there is sufficient time and opportunity given to source for alternative accommodation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 If the property is being used as a family home, any exceptional and irremediable hardship to the family should also be considered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 With this in mind, I now turn to the facts of this present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As in a majority of cases, the single most valuable asset belonging to the Bankrupt is the home which he occupies along with various other individuals, including the respondent. The present fact scenario brings into play two mutually exclusive interests. On one side is the claim of the unsecured creditor, the SSC, which has been kept waiting for more than three years since the Bankruptcy Order was made in August 2016.  On the other side is the general concern that hardship should not be visited upon individuals like the respondent who are, in the main, innocent victims of the Bankrupt’s financial misfortune. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It did not escape my attention that the Property is currently being used as a family home for the respondent, the Bankrupt, their two sons, their daughter-in-law, their grandson and their domestic helper (collectively, the “present occupants”).

To disallow the sale would mean that the SSC would have no way of reclaiming its debt plus interest and correspondingly allow the Bankrupt to evade his entire debt obligation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Balancing of various factors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 After considering the prejudice caused to the creditors, the respondent and the other occupants of the family home, I was satisfied that the balance lies firmly in favour of ordering the sale of the Property. The prejudice caused to the SSC as the sole unsecured creditor is significant and continues to accumulate as the delay in repayment stretches. A failure to order the sale would also allow the Bankrupt to evade a large chunk of his bankruptcy obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In contrast, the respondent would receive approximately $2.15 million from her share of the sale proceeds from the Property. Even without considering the approximately $300,000 surplus left over to the Bankrupt after fully discharging all his debts, the respondent’s share of $2.15 million is more than sufficient to purchase a large HDB flat (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> a five room HDB flat or a three generation HDB flat) to fit the needs of the seven individuals in her family and pay for all the attendant fees incurred in the purchase of an alternative family home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Even if I have underestimated the prejudice caused to the respondent and her family, I remain assured in my decision by the fact that the respondent and all the other occupants have been given ample time to make alternative accommodation arrangements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 At the time of the hearing, more than three years have passed since the making of the Bankruptcy Order. The PTIBs and previously, the OA had repeatedly sought to contact the Bankrupt and the respondent to discuss ways in which the bankrupt could pay off his debts to the SSC (see [6] and [7] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I pause at this juncture to add that if only a short amount of time, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, less than a year had elapsed between the making of the Bankruptcy Order and the present application, I might have been prepared to delay the sale of the Property in order to allow the respondent and her family to make reasonable and orderly arrangements to sort out their affairs so as to minimise the inevitable hardship and distress that come with losing their home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I note that such a position has also been taken in the UK as a way to balance the competing interests of a bankrupt’s family and his creditors in the context of a family home. Under s 335A(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (“UK Insolvency Act”), the court is empowered to make an order for the sale of land upon the application of a trustee in bankruptcy if it “thinks just and reasonable” after having regard to the interests of creditors, the bankrupt’s family and all the circumstances of the case. However, s 335A(3) of the UK Insolvency Act states that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where such an application is made after the end of the period of one year beginning with the first vesting … of the bankrupt’s estate in a trustee, the court shall assume, <span class="font-italic">unless the circumstances of the case are exceptional, that the interests of the bankrupt’s creditors outweigh all other considerations</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 That said, my remarks at [43] should not be taken as a license for a trustee in bankruptcy or the OA to be unnecessarily tardy in making an application for the sale of a bankrupt’s home especially in a situation where the interest rate ordered in the judgment sum payable to the SSC is well above the current interest rate for fixed deposits with the local banks. Per s 121A of the Bankruptcy Act, after the debts and expenses of the bankruptcy have been paid, any surplus is to go towards paying the accumulated interest on the bankruptcy debts before returning to the bankrupt. This means that the longer the time taken for a trustee in bankruptcy or the OA to bring an application for sale, the greater the accumulated interest owed by the bankrupt. Undue delay in a case, particularly when the bankrupt’s family does not object to a sale by the trustee in bankruptcy or the OA, would also cause hardship to the bankrupt’s family as they would have to live under a prolonged state of uncertainty as to whether they would be evicted from their homes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The sole unsecured creditor, the SSC, has already waited for more than three years to reclaim its debt. It cannot be expected to wait <span class="font-italic">ad infinitum </span>for the Bankrupt and the respondent to be ready to sell the Property, especially when the prejudice to the respondent is outweighed by the grave and continuing financial prejudice to the SSC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In light of the above, I found that it was necessary and expedient to order the sale of the Property under s 18(2) read with para 2 of the First Schedule to the SCJA and so ordered. The PTIBs are to have conduct of the sale and the sale proceeds are to be remitted to the Bankrupt and the respondent in equal shares after deducting the expenses connected with the sale and the repayment of the outstanding mortgage. The sale proceeds remitted to the Bankrupt are to form a part of the estate of the Bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Costs including disbursements and GST to be fixed at $5,800 and paid by the respondent to the PTIBs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn   <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chang Man Phing Jenny, Lim Xian Yong Alvin and Joel Tieh Wenjun (WongPartnership LLP) for the applicants; <br/>Seah Zhen Wei Paul and Kang Weisheng Geraint Edward (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
