<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties to these proceedings
                    are husband and wife. They married in 1971. There are four children of the
                    marriage. Each of the children achieved adulthood and economic independence from
                    their parents long ago. No questions of custody or maintenance for the children
                    therefore arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The wife petitioned for divorce in
                    2011 on the basis of the husband’s unreasonable behaviour. The husband initially
                    opposed the divorce but he eventually withdrew his objections after the
                    plaintiff amended her statement of particulars in 2012. Interim judgment was
                    granted uncontested a few months later in 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The
                    application before me concerns the division of the matrimonial assets and
                    maintenance for the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It is common ground that the
                    matrimonial assets comprise the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Assets in joint names:</div>

                                    the matrimonial home. This property is by now unencumbered. The
                                    wife values it at $400,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> while the husband values it at

                    assets is in excess of $2.5m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Almost all of that
                    value is represented by real property. The wife seeks four orders from me: (i)
                    an equal division of the real property; (ii) a fair division of the money in the
                    couple’s joint current account; (iii) an order that each spouse retain the
                    matrimonial assets held in his or her sole name; and (iv) maintenance of $500
                    per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The husband
                    seeks a 65:35 division of the matrimonial assets and offers nothing to the wife
                    by way of maintenance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Having heard submissions, I
                        order<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> that the real
                    property be sold on the open market with the net proceeds being divided equally
                    between each spouse, subject to each spouse having an option to buy out the
                    other spouse’s half-interest. I further order that the money in the couple’s
                    joint bank account at OCBC be divided equally between them and that they each
                    retain the assets held in their individual names. I decline to award the wife
                    any maintenance, but make a nominal award to accommodate a future application
                    for maintenance by the wife if circumstances change.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I now set out the grounds for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The history of the marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The husband and wife married on 30
                    December 1971. They underwent a customary marriage ceremony on 2 June
                        1972.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The wife is now
                    65 and the husband is 67. There are four children of the marriage, born in 1973,
                    1975, 1976 and 1986. The children range in age from 41 to 28 years of
                    age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It was only after their customary
                    marriage in 1972 that the couple began to live together. They lived together
                    initially with the husband’s parents for six months. They then lived in a
                    succession of rented accommodation from 1972 to 1978.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The wife was earning her own
                    income even before the marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> She trained as a tailor and ran her own
                    dress-making business from home. After the marriage, she continued to run her
                    business from home and to earn an income.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> She designed and tailored
                        bespoke<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    dresses for her customers, doing the work either herself or with the assistance
                    of seamstresses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Her
                    business, by all accounts, enjoyed a modicum of success. She also applied her
                    skills to sewing clothes for the husband and their children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The matrimonial home</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In 1978, the couple bought their
                    first flat. It was in Ang Mo Kio.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The purchase price was
                        $24,500.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The
                    husband paid $16,000 towards the purchase price from his CPF account and
                    arranged a loan from the HDB for the balance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He also asserts that he alone paid the
                    monthly instalments, either through his CPF account or in cash.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The wife, however, asserts
                    that she contributed financially towards the purchase of this flat and towards
                    the loan taken to pay for renovations to the flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In particular, she alleges that she
                    made a capital repayment of $9,000 in 1980 or 1981 out of her lottery
                        winnings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> It
                    is not necessary for me to reach this far back into history and make any
                    findings on these disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The loan on the Ang Mo Kio
                    property was fully repaid by 1981 at the latest. Also in 1981, the husband
                    started his own renovation business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In or about 1999, the couple
                    sold their flat in Ang Mo Kio. There is conflicting evidence about the sale
                    price, with the husband asserting in one of his early affidavits that it was
                    sold for $255,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> but
                    asserting in a later affidavit that it was sold for $330,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Again, it is not necessary
                    for me to resolve this conflict in his evidence. The couple lived with the
                    wife’s brother while waiting for their new matrimonial home in Serangoon to be
                        ready.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The
                    Serangoon property continues to be their matrimonial home to this day. It is one
                    of the properties which I have to divide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The purchase price of the
                    Serangoon property was $231,000. The stamp duty and legal fees came to just
                    under $3,900. The husband’s direct contributions towards acquiring the Serangoon
                    property were just under $57,000, comprising $53,100<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> from his CPF account plus the
                    transaction costs of about $3,900. The wife’s direct contribution was just under
                    $12,000 from her CPF account. The remainder of the purchase price was financed
                    by a loan of about $160,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The husband submits that wife’s
                    direct contributions towards the Serangoon flat from her CPF account should be
                    attributed to him because she earned those CPF contributions as an employee of
                    his renovation business. His position, therefore, is that he generated all the
                    money which went into her CPF account. I reject that submission. While the
                    ultimate source of the money may have been the husband’s renovation business and
                    his efforts in that regard, the CPF contributions became the wife’s property
                    once they were credited to her CPF account. That is so even if she in fact
                    rendered no services to the renovation business but was registered as its
                    employee purely to permit him to hire more foreign labour, as was suggested. The
                    money in her CPF account was her money which she chose to commit to the
                    Serangoon property. I therefore attribute this sum of just under $12,000 wholly
                    to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The couple did some renovations
                    before moving into the Serangoon property. The wife’s account is that she took a
                    loan of $20,000 to pay for the renovations and repaid the loan in full at the
                    rate of $500 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The
                    husband’s account is that all the renovations were done by his renovation
                    business funded by a loan of $30,000. When that money ran out, the husband’s
                    renovation business purchased the necessary remaining materials and carried out
                    the remaining work without payment. He values that remaining work at $20,000 and
                    claims credit for it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I give credit to each spouse for
                    a $20,000 contribution towards the renovations. The wife has not produced
                    evidence to corroborate her oral evidence that she took and repaid the loan of
                    $20,000. But the husband has adduced evidence that a renovation loan of $30,000
                    was taken against the security of the Lucky Plaza property to pay in part for

                    credit for repayment of that loan. That suggests to me that he implicitly
                    accepts that the wife repaid the loan. There is, however, a conflict of evidence
                    as to the quantum of the loan. The husband says the loan amount was $30,000 and
                    that the monthly repayment was $504.30.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The wife says she repaid $20,000 at

                    cannot, however, give the wife credit for more than she claims. I therefore
                    adopt the wife’s figure and credit to her the sum of $20,000 as part of her
                    direct contributions to the acquisition of the Serangoon property.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     From 1999 to 2001, the wife paid
                    the monthly instalments towards the loan on the Serangoon property out of the
                    profits of her boutique.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>
                    From 2001 to 2013, the monthly instalments were paid out of the rent which the
                    couple earned on the Lucky Plaza property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> I have left these sums out of account
                    in the above calculation, but bring them into account as a factor in the
                    broad-brush approach I apply at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> below. The loan on the Serangoon property was fully repaid
                    by 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Lucky Plaza property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     From 1972 to 1979, the wife’s
                    dressmaking business grew. In 1979 she registered it as a sole proprietorship
                    and opened a boutique in rented premises at People’s Park Centre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> She moved the boutique to Lucky Plaza in
                    1982 or 1983. In 1988, the boutique moved again, to a different rented unit
                    within Lucky Plaza.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In 1992, the opportunity arose
                    for the couple to purchase the Lucky Plaza unit at which the boutique was
                    operating from its landlord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> They did so at a price of $410,000. The idea
                    of purchasing the Lucky Plaza property was entirely the husband’s. He saw it as
                    a good investment to fund the couple’s retirement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> He secured the option from the vendor,
                    he exercised the option, he funded the down payment of 20% of the purchase price
                    and he paid the transaction costs of almost $6,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> He also
                    arranged a 15-year term loan of $330,000 to fund the balance of the purchase
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The wife does not dispute that
                    the husband conceived and drove the acquisition of the Lucky Plaza property. But
                    she says that she paid $70,000 towards its acquisition from a combination of her
                    lottery winnings, a loan from family members and her savings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The wife has no independent
                    evidence to corroborate her affidavit evidence in this regard. The husband
                    rejects this evidence categorically.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> In the absence of any independent
                    evidence to corroborate the wife’s account, I am unable to accept that she
                    contributed $70,000 to the purchase price of the Lucky Plaza
                property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The husband made a direct
                    contribution of $30,000 towards the purchase price of the Lucky Plaza property.
                    He raised this sum by selling his fourth car, a Toyota Corolla. The wife claims
                    that half of this sum of $30,000 should be attributed to her. She claims credit
                    for it on the basis that she had paid 90% of the cost of the husband’s first car
                    and because he paid for his second car out of the couple’s joint
                        account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    There is no evidence of these payments beyond the wife’s assertions on
                    affidavit. It is also not at all clear to me that the wife can trace, as it
                    were, her contributions to the husband’s first and second car into his fourth
                    car in this way. I am therefore unable to attribute $15,000 out of the husband’s
                    direct contribution of $30,000 to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The monthly instalments for the
                    loan secured on the Lucky Plaza property were a little over $3,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The husband concedes that,
                    from 1992 to 1998, the wife paid these monthly instalments in full out of the
                    profits of her boutique.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> But the
                    husband claims that these repayments should be attributed equally to each
                    spouse. He submits that it was his foresight, acumen and capital which led to
                    the couple purchasing the Lucky Plaza property, and which freed the wife’s
                    boutique from having to worry about the vagaries of renting premises. The
                    boutique enjoyed another benefit attributable to him, he says, because it paid a
                    smaller amount each month referable to its premises than neighbouring units were
                    paying as rent. Moreover, he says, the amount paid was not an expense but
                    instead went towards increasing the couple’s equity of redemption under the
                        mortgage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I accept that the purchase of
                    the Lucky Plaza property was conceived and driven by the husband. But I do not
                    accept his submission that the repayments towards the loan from the profits of
                    the wife’s boutique should be attributed to him. That money was earned by the
                    wife through her efforts in her boutique. It should be attributed to her as far
                    as direct contributions are concerned. I will, however, bring into account the
                    husband’s efforts in conceiving and driving the acquisition of the Lucky Plaza
                    property and also his indirect contributions to the success of the boutique as
                    factors in the broad-brush approach I apply at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In or around 1999, when the Ang
                    Mo Kio flat (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)
                    was sold, the husband applied $190,000 from the proceeds of sale to pay down the
                    loan on the Lucky Plaza property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> I attribute this capital repayment equally
                    to the husband and to the wife. By 1999, the couple had been married 28 years
                    and had had four children. The youngest of their four children was then still
                    only 13 years of age. Even if I were to accept the husband’s evidence that the
                    wife made no direct contributions towards the acquisition of the Ang Mo Kio
                    flat, her indirect contributions to the welfare of the family from the time the
                    Ang Mo Kio flat was purchased in 1978 until it was sold in or around 1999
                    warrants an equal attribution of this capital repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The capital repayment of
                    $190,000 in February 1999<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> reduced the principal payable on the
                    loan for the Lucky Plaza property to just over $33,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> and the monthly instalment from about
                    $3,000 to about $560.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> It appears
                    also that the couple secured at this time additional credit facilities of
                    $120,000 against the Lucky Plaza property. These additional facilities comprised
                    an increase in their overdraft line from $10,000 to $100,000 and an additional
                    term loan of $30,000, presumably connected to the renovation of the Serangoon
                        property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The monthly instalment for this additional term
                    loan was $504.30,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> bringing
                    the total monthly instalments for the term loans secured against the Lucky Plaza
                    property to just over $1,000. But this was still a significantly smaller sum
                    than the monthly instalment before the capital repayment. From 1999 to 2001, the
                    wife continued to pay the monthly instalments for the term loans secured on the
                    Lucky Plaza property out of the profits of her boutique.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In 2001, the wife moved her
                    dress-making business from the Lucky Plaza property into the matrimonial home.
                    From 2001, the Lucky Plaza property was let and the rent was applied in part to
                    pay the monthly instalments for the debt secured on it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The mortgage over the Lucky
                    Plaza property was discharged in 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> It appears odd that it took a further
                    11 years from 1999 to discharge the mortgage. After the capital repayment in
                    1999, the Lucky Plaza property stood as security for term loans totalling
                    $63,000. The reduced principal on the original purchase-money term loan stood at
                    about $33,000. There was also the entire principal owing on the new $30,000 term
                    loan. At about $1,000 a month, one would expect that total amount of about
                    $63,000 plus interest to be repaid in a little over 63 months. But the mortgage
                    on the Lucky Plaza property was discharged only about 130 months later, in 2010.
                    If the monthly payments of about $1,000 continued throughout those 130 months,
                    that means that it required at least $130,000 to discharge the mortgage. This in
                    turn suggests that the additional overdraft facilities arranged at the time of
                    the capital repayment were drawn on and also had to be repaid before the
                    mortgage could be discharged. The use of these overdraft facilities has not been
                    accounted for by the husband.</p>

                    now consider how to exercise my power under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap
                    353, 2009 Rev Ed) to divide the matrimonial assets “in such proportion as the
                    court thinks just and equitable.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Court of Appeal in <em>BCB v BCC</em> [2013] 2 SLR 324 has recently and
                    authoritatively surveyed the case law and restated how a judge at first instance
                    is to approach this task. I distil the following principles from that
                    case:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It is fundamental to the proper exercise of the
                            power under s 112 of the Women’s Charter that the court use a
                            broad-brush approach (at [7]).</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It is wrong in principle to emphasise unduly or
                            to focus inordinately on each spouse’s direct contributions (at [8]).
                            That is only one of the many factors to be considered as part of all the
                            circumstances of the case in exercising the power to arrive at the just
                            and equitable division mandated by s 112(1).</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The court should not adopt the approach taken
                            under the predecessor of s 112 by treating the spouses' direct
                            contributions as the starting point for a just and equitable division,
                            and then making adjustments to account for the spouses’ non-financial
                            contributions (at [9]).</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The modern broad brush approach ensures that the
                            division arrived at by the court gives effect to the important principle
                            that the court must take fully into account all indirect contributions
                            of every type (at [11]) and made by each spouse (at [12] and
                            [34]).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Applying the broad brush
                    approach, I cannot agree with the husband that it would just and equitable to
                    divide the matrimonial assets such that the husband receives 65% and the wife
                    receives 35%. I agree with the wife that the real property should be divided
                    between the spouses equally. I arrive at this decision for the following
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The factor which weighs most
                    strongly with me is that this is, by any measure, a very long marriage. At the
                    date of the hearing, the marriage had endured for 42 years. The longevity of the
                    emotional, parental, social and economic bond between the spouses is to my mind
                    a very weighty factor that overshadows all others. In particular, it causes the
                    importance of the precise ratio of the parties’ direct contributions which were
                    made decades earlier and which I am now attempting assess decades later on
                    imperfect and incomplete evidence to recede into the background. The length of
                    the marriage is a factor which points towards the just and equitable division of
                    the matrimonial assets being an equal division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The marriage brought into the
                    world four children, each of whom were raised to adulthood and each of whom – to
                    the credit of both parents – received an education commensurate with his and her
                    abilities. Each child is now economically independent. That is by any account a
                    successful outcome for the family. The success of the family is due to both
                    non-financial and financial contributions by each spouse. I will look at these
                    two categories of contributions in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The non-financial contributions
                    to the welfare of the family came almost entirely from the wife. She looked
                    after the home, the husband and the children. She attended to the children’s and
                    husband’s daily needs, ensured that the children went to school and supervised
                    their homework.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Even the husband acknowledges that he was an
                    uninvolved parent. It is also true that he was an uninvolved
                husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The husband’s non-financial
                    contributions to the welfare of the family were not only absent, they were
                    negative. He was involved in illegal gambling as a bookmaker<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> or, as he puts it, an
                    “illegal horseracing runner”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The wife had to bail him out on one
                    occasion when he was detained at the police station.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> She alleges that he drank
                    heavily, gambled heavily, associated improperly with other women and infected
                    her with a sexually-transmitted disease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> The husband rejects these
                    allegations as scandalous.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> I do not think that the wife would
                    have made up these allegations. I accept her account. It is also a matter of
                    record that the wife was compelled to seek a personal protection order against
                    the husband in 2010, to which the husband consented.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The wife’s financial
                    contributions to the family were also substantial, diminishing only as each
                    child left secondary school. The husband failed to give the wife an allowance or
                    otherwise to maintain her during the marriage. The husband implicitly accepts
                    this by not asserting otherwise in his three affidavits of assets and means. The
                    wife therefore had to use the income she generated from her dress-making
                    business, without significant contribution from the husband, to pay the monthly
                    household expenses, to pay for the children’s education up to and including
                    secondary school and to pay an allowance to the children over the same period.
                    She was also able to make a significant contribution to paying down both the
                    loan on the Serangoon property and on the Lucky Plaza property. It is common
                    ground that the wife lived a frugal life.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> She was therefore also able to save
                    some money for herself, despite having to meet all of these expenses of the
                    family in the absence of any significant financial contribution from the
                    husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The husband’s contribution to
                    the welfare of the family was largely, though not exclusively, financial.
                    Indeed, he attributes his lack of involvement in the home and with the children
                    to the hours he spent earning money, first as an employee<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> then as a taxi
                        driver<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> and
                    as a renovation contractor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> His significant financial contribution
                    to the welfare of the family was in financing the post-secondary education of
                    three of the four children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> He paid for the eldest child to be
                    educated at junior college in Singapore, and for the eldest two children to be
                    educated at polytechnic in Singapore and at university in Western Australia to
                    secure their degrees. As the second child was born just a year after the first,
                    the burden of educating the eldest two children overlapped. The husband
                    estimates that he has spent $136,000 on their education, including tuition and
                    living expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> He
                    also paid for the youngest child’s Diploma and Higher Diploma in Hotel
                    Management as well as that child’s living expenses, totalling about
                        $40,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I accept that the husband
                    discharged a significant financial burden in this respect. But I must set
                    against that the fact that the husband, in paying for the children’s education
                    after secondary school, was doing no more than his duty – albeit a duty shared
                    with the wife – under s 68 of the Women’s Charter to maintain them. I must also
                    take into account the fact that the husband did not begin to discharge this duty
                    in any significant way until the children left secondary school, almost 20 years
                    into the marriage. Before that, the duty to maintain the children was discharged
                    almost single-handedly by the wife. There is also evidence that the wife’s
                    financial contributions to each child continued, albeit not in any substantial
                    way, after each child left secondary school. Finally, I must also set against
                    this the total failure by the husband to discharge the duty which he, and he
                    alone, bore to maintain the wife during the currency of the
                marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The husband’s principal
                    non-financial contribution to the family was through his business acumen. The
                    bulk of the couple’s current wealth is represented by the Lucky Plaza property.
                    Twenty-two years after they purchased the property, it is worth five times what
                    they paid for it. The investment has appreciated at a compound annual growth
                    rate of over 7%. It was a wise investment indeed. I accept that the couple own
                    the Lucky Plaza property today not only because of the wife’s direct
                    contributions in paying down the loan but because of the husband’s indirect
                    contribution through his decision to purchase it, his efforts in arranging the
                    purchase including securing the financing, and his decision to make the capital
                    repayment in 1999. The husband has also produced evidence that he took on the
                    burden of managing the property both while the wife operated her boutique from
                    it and also after the property was tenanted to generate an income. Thus, for
                    example, he resolved an issue caused by a leak into the unit from the unit above
                    and petitioned, albeit unsuccessfully, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
                    to have the property tax reassessed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is also the case that the
                    husband made non-financial contributions to the wife’s boutique. He was a
                    partner in the boutique from 1980 to 1984.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> He oversaw the bookkeeping and
                    accounting for the boutique.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Although the wife characterises this
                    as controlling behaviour on his part, these administrative matters are
                    nonetheless burdens, and the husband taking care of these administrative burdens
                    freed the wife to concentrate on her revenue-producing activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On a broad brush approach, I
                    consider that the wife’s financial contributions to the welfare of the family
                    until each child’s post-secondary education meet the husband’s financial
                    contributions to the children’s post-secondary education. I take into account
                    also the fact that husband failed entirely in his unilateral duty to maintain
                    the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     There is no easy way, however,
                    to compare and equate the wife’s non-financial contributions through caring for
                    and nurturing the family with the husband’s non-financial contribution through
                    his business acumen. But on a broad brush approach, I consider that the wife’s
                    indirect contributions to the welfare of the family point towards the just and
                    equitable division of the Serangoon property being an equal division. I also
                    consider that the husband’s non-financial contributions to the Lucky Plaza
                    property point towards the just and equitable division of the Lucky Plaza
                    property being an equal division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The final factor which I
                    consider is each spouse’s direct contributions to each of the two real
                    properties which they now jointly own. Their contributions to each property are
                    almost exact mirror images of each other: each spouse made direct contributions
                    of about 30% for one property and about 70% for the other. This factor too
                    points towards a just and equitable division being an equal
                division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     If anything, an equal division
                    underweights the wife’s direct contributions to the advantage of the husband.
                    This is because I have left out of account at least part of the wife’s direct
                    contributions to both properties through the payment of the monthly
                    instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As far as the Lucky Plaza
                    property is concerned, I have assessed the wife’s direct contributions at 69%
                    (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above). This
                    calculation leaves out of account the wife’s direct contributions through the
                    payment of the monthly instalments from 2001 onwards out of the Lucky Plaza
                    property’s rent. If that rent were to be attributed to the wife and to the
                    husband <em>pro rata</em>, based on their direct
                    contributions to the acquisition of the Lucky Plaza property, the wife’s direct
                    contributions to the Lucky Plaza property would exceed 69%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As for the Serangoon property, I
                    have also left out of account the wife’s payment of the monthly instalments from
                    1999 to 2001 out of the profits of her boutique and from 2001 until the loan was
                    discharged in 2013 through her at least 69% interest in the rent earned by the
                    Lucky Plaza property (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     All of these factors point
                    towards a finding that the just and equitable division of the two real
                    properties is at the very least, from the wife’s perspective, an equal division.
                    I find no merit whatsoever in the husband’s submission that his contributions of
                    all kinds “far surpass” the wife’s and that a 65:35 division is therefore “not
                        unreasonable”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The spouses’ joint account at
                    OCBC is the account into which the rent for the Lucky Plaza unit is paid. Given
                    that I have ordered an equal division of the Lucky Plaza property, it follows
                    that the money standing to the spouses’ credit in this joint account should also
                    be divided equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I also order that the remaining
                    matrimonial assets, all of which are held in individual names, should be
                    retained by the spouse in whose name they are held. This was not seriously
                    contested at the hearing before me and, on one reading of the Notice of Appeal
                    in this matter, this order is not the subject-matter of the husband’s
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The wife is 65 years old. She
                    seeks maintenance at $500 a month for such number of years as I consider
                    appropriate, to be commuted into a capital sum and awarded now as lump sum
                    maintenance. She is now 65, and says she no longer has steady hands, no longer
                    receives many orders for clothes and may not be able to support herself by
                    making clothes for much longer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> This is borne out by her income tax
                    returns which show her income from trade, <em>ie</em> her
                    dressmaking business, dwindling from a high of $15,923 in year of assessment
                    1999 to $2,400 in year of assessment 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> The number of years of maintenance
                    which the plaintiff seeks is not quantified in the plaintiff’s written
                    submissions. However, in oral submissions, counsel for the plaintiff proposed 3
                    years’ maintenance at $500 per month, to be paid now as a lump sum of
                    $18,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The husband is 67 years old. He
                    now works solely as a taxi driver, having transferred his renovation business to
                    his older son in 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> His latest
                    income tax assessment for year of assessment 2014 shows income from trade of

                    elderly mother for food and medical expenses. He points out also that the wife
                    receives a monthly allowance from their daughters – the eldest two of their four
                    children – while he does not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In all the circumstances of the
                    case, I do not think it appropriate to make an order for maintenance, whether by
                    way of periodic payments or lump sum for the following four reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">First, I take into account that the division of
                            matrimonial assets which I have ordered will leave each spouse with
                            financial resources of well over $1m at his and her disposal. That is
                            more than sufficient for each of them to rehouse themselves and to
                            remain economically independent through their old age. It is legitimate
                            to have regard to the outcome of the division of matrimonial assets in
                            determining whether to order maintenance and if so in what sum: see s
                                114(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter and
                                <em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</em> [2012] 2
                            SLR 506 at [26].</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Second, and related to the first factor, it does
                            not appear to me that the wife can be said to have a financial need for
                            maintenance within the meaning of s 114(1)(<em>b</em>), given that she has this substantial sum at her
                            disposal.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Third, in considering s 114(1)(<em>c</em>), it seems to me that the standard of living which the
                            wife will enjoy after the divorce with this sum at her disposal will not
                            be significantly different from the standard of living she enjoyed
                            during the marriage.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Finally, I take into account the fact that the
                            wife is, at least at present, receiving an allowance from the two eldest
                            children while the husband appears to have no prospect of ever receiving
                            any such allowance and is, instead, himself discharging a monthly
                            obligation to an aged parent.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">However, in case circumstances change to warrant a future application for
                    maintenance, I award the wife nominal maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The wife asks for the costs of
                    these proceedings up to the stage of interlocutory judgment on the basis that
                    that phase of the divorce was protracted by the husband’s opposition to the
                    divorce. It remains the fact, however, that the husband withdrew his opposition;
                    and that he did so only because and only after the statement of particulars was
                    amended. In all the circumstances of the case, I make no order as to costs for
                    both phases of these divorce proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     For the reasons set out above, I
                    order as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Each of the two real properties is to be sold
