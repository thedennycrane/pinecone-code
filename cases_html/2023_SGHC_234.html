The claimant commenced HC/OC 158/2022 (“OC 158”) against the majority shareholders of SLH for alleged minority oppression. As part of OC 158, the claimant applied in HC/SUM 2781/2022 (“SUM 2781”) for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the majority shareholders from transferring certain properties out of the ownership of SLH. The majority shareholders filed affidavits to oppose SUM 2781 and introduced email correspondence therein, which the claimant alleges is protected by “without prejudice” privilege (the “Emails”). Therefore, again as part of OC 158, the claimant has taken out the present application to strike out: (a) these Emails which were exhibited in the affidavits; and (b) the relevant paragraphs in the affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Having taken some time to carefully consider the parties’ submissions, I allow the claimant’s application to strike out all the Emails, save for the last email from Mr Robert Wee (“Mr Wee”) sent on 9 November 2020 at 4.42pm. I provide the reasons for my decision in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The background to the parties’ dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The dispute in OC 158 arose out of the conduct of the majority shareholders in SLH. The late Dato Lim Kim Chong (“Dato Lim”) set up SLH to hold assets that he wished to distribute for the benefit of certain members of his family. The claimant is one of Dato Lim’s eight children. The first to third defendants are the majority shareholders of SLH. The first defendant is Mr Lim Soon Huat (“Soon Huat”) and the second defendant is Mr Lim Soon Heng (“Soon Heng”). The third defendant is Lim Kim Chong Investments Pte Ltd (“LKCI”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 25 July 2013, Dato Lim and his children entered into a Deed of Family Arrangement (the “Original Deed”) to, among others, distribute a portion of his assets to his eight children in Singapore. To effect this, Dato Lim divided his eight children into two groups (“Group A” and “Group B”). Dato Lim then caused his various companies (and the properties they owned) to be divided between the fourth defendant, Sin Soon Lee Realty Company (Private) Limited (“SSLRC”), and SLH. The Group A beneficiaries, which include Soon Huat, became shareholders of SSLRC and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SSLRC and its subsidiaries. The Group B beneficiaries, which include Dato Lim, the claimant, and Soon Heng, became shareholders of SLH and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SLH and its subsidiaries. On 15 September 2016, Dato Lim supposedly gave his personal and beneficial stake in LKCI to Soon Huat. On 23 August 2017, Dato Lim also supposedly gave his personal and beneficial stake in SLH to Soon Huat. As a result, in addition to being a member of the Group A beneficiaries, Soon Huat also became a member of the Group B beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Original Deed has been amended twice. On 28 February 2015, the members of the Lim family entered into an Amending and Restating Deed of Family Arrangement to amend certain terms of the Original Deed (the “Amended Deed”). Subsequently, on 11 January 2019, the parties to the Original Deed and the Amended Deed entered into a third deed, to provide, among others, for the disposal and handling of certain shares in an asset in Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The obligations relevant to the present application are as follows. Under cl 9.1 of the Amended Deed, the Group A beneficiaries were obliged to procure SSLRC to make a gift or transfer two properties to SLH and/or its nominees. These two properties are known as the “Geylang Property” and the “Tamarind Road Property”. For convenience, I will refer to the two properties as the “Properties”. In addition, under cl 12.5 of the Amended Deed, the Group A beneficiaries were obliged to procure SSLRC to pay a sum of $9m, being part of the “Group B Assignment Amount” as defined in the Amended Deed, to SLH and/or its nominees. Again, for convenience, I will refer to this sum of $9m as the “Assignment Amount”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The events leading to the Emails between the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Sometime in July 2020, Dato Lim proposed a meeting between the Group A and Group B beneficiaries to resolve the transfers mentioned above. On Soon Heng’s initiative, the meeting was eventually scheduled to take place on 7 August 2020. Soon Heng set out the agenda for the meeting in an email dated 15 July 2020:

It was attended by, among others: (a) certain members of Group A; (b) Mr Wee of Ho &amp; Wee LLP, as the solicitor representing the Group A beneficiaries; (c) Soon Heng and the claimant, as members of Group B; (d) Mr Tan Teng Muan (“Mr Tan”) of Mallal &amp; Namazie, as the solicitor representing the Group B beneficiaries at the time; (e) Dato Lim; (f) Mr Yang Shi Yong of Drew &amp; Napier LLC, as Dato Lim’s solicitor; (g) Soon Huat; and (h) Mr Sarbjit Singh (“Mr Singh”) and Mr Thomas Ang of Selvam LLC, as the solicitors representing Soon Huat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 However, the meeting was cut short after thirty minutes when Dato Lim left the meeting room. In the days following 7 August 2020, the lawyers who attended the meeting exchanged email correspondence – that is, the Emails – about the issues discussed at the meeting. It is not disputed that several of the Emails were marked by the lawyers as being “without prejudice” or “without prejudice save as to costs”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The events leading to the present application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 27 July 2022, the claimant commenced OC 158 against, among others, the majority shareholders of SLH, including Soon Huat and Soon Heng, for minority oppression. For present purposes, it suffices to state that one of the alleged oppressive acts was that Soon Huat and Soon Heng intended for Soon Huat and his son, Mr Lim Yong Yeow Thomas (“Thomas”), to receive the Properties instead of SLH. Thus, the claimant filed SUM 2781, where she sought, among others, an injunction to restrain the transfer of the Properties to Soon Huat and Thomas pending the final determination of OC 158 and any appeals therefrom. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Against this background, on 22 August 2022, Soon Heng and Soon Huat filed affidavits to oppose SUM 2781. Soon Huat exhibited the Emails in his affidavit.

</div> In that affidavit, Soon Huat explained that he did so because three of the Group A beneficiaries sent a letter dated 15 June 2022 (the “15 June 2022 Letter”) that made reference to one of the said Emails, which Soon Huat took to be the Group A beneficiaries waiving the “without prejudice” privilege which attached to the Emails.

</div> When I asked Mr Tan about the legal basis of this principle, Mr Tan alluded to broad public policy reasons but could not point me to an authority that regarded this principle as a specific exception to “without prejudice” privilege. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The relevant issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 With the parties’ positions in mind, there are, in my view, four relevant issues that I will need to address.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether the claimant has standing to assert “without prejudice” privilege.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, whether the Emails are protected by “without prejudice” privilege.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, assuming that the claimant has standing to assert “without prejudice” privilege, and the Emails are protected by “without prejudice” privilege, whether the claimant has waived such privilege.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, even if the claimant has not waived “without prejudice” privilege, whether any exception to the privilege applies in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I turn now to deal with each of these issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the claimant has standing to assert “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 It is trite law that “communications in the course of negotiations genuinely aimed at settlement of a dispute are protected by ‘without prejudice’ privilege” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Cytec Industries Pte Ltd v APP</span><span class="font-italic"> Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Cytec</span>”) at [14], citing <span class="font-italic">Rush</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council </span>[1989] AC 1280 (“<span class="font-italic">Rush</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tompkins</span>”) at 1299). However, as a threshold issue, a third party cannot claim “without prejudice” privilege if it took “no part in the ‘without prejudice’ negotiations, either personally or through an agent” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-B Chew Investments Pte Ltd v Lim Tjoen Kong </span>[1989] 2 SLR(R) 149 (“<span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-B Chew (HC)</span>”) at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Yeo Hiap Seng v Australia Food Corp Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 336 provides guidance. There, a contractual dispute arose between the plaintiff and the two defendants in relation to the supply of fruit juice by the plaintiff to the first defendant. The second defendant, being the director of the first defendant, applied to expunge parts of the plaintiff’s affidavit which exhibited negotiations between the plaintiff and the first defendant protected by “without prejudice” privilege. The High Court upheld the Assistant Registrar’s decision to dismiss the second defendant’s application. In doing so, the court reiterated the principle in <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-B Chew (HC)</span> as follows (at [14]–[15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14  … The issue in the instant case is whether the second defendant who was never at or represented in the negotiations can now claim that certain exhibits in the affidavit of James Loke filed on 6 September 1990 are privileged from disclosure … In my view, the second defendant can only succeed if she can show that she is entitled to claim the privilege.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15  In the case of <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-B Chew Investments Pte Ltd v Lim Tjoen Kong</span> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 149, P Coomaraswamy J held that the privilege on “without prejudice” negotiations applies to statements by the parties and the solicitors respectively acting for them. If a party took no part in the “without prejudice” negotiations either personally or through an agent, he cannot claim the privilege. Accordingly, I am of the view that the second defendant’s appeal against the decision of the learned assistant registrar of 10 January 1991 cannot succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Accordingly, the defendants are correct that a party needs to show, as a threshold issue, that he or she has standing by having taken part in the “without prejudice” privilege negotiations or communications either personally or through an agent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision: the claimant has standing to assert “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In my judgment, the claimant has standing to assert “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails. This is because, at the times when the Emails were exchanged, the claimant was a party to these exchanges through Mallal &amp; Namazie, who was representing her and Soon Heng. Indeed, Soon Heng expressly admitted to this in his affidavit dated 12 May 2023, when he said that “Group B (comprising myself and the <span class="font-italic">Claimant</span> and excluding Soon Huat) <span class="font-italic">was represented by Mallal</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Namazie</span>” [emphasis added].

They were summarised in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Mariwu </span><span class="font-italic">Industrial Co (S) Pte Ltd v Dextra Asia Co Ltd and another </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 807 (“<span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span>”) (at [24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 23 of the Evidence Act is a statutory enactment of the common law principle relating to the admissibility of “without prejudice” communications based on the policy of encouraging settlements. In <span class="font-italic">Muller v Linsley and Mortimer</span> [1996] PNLR 74 (“<span class="font-italic">Muller</span>”) at 77, Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) explained this principle in these words:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head</span> [[1984] Ch 290] shows that the [“without prejudice”] rule has two justifications. Firstly, the public policy of encouraging parties to negotiate and settle their disputes out of court and, secondly, an implied agreement arising out of what is commonly understood to be the consequences of offering or agreeing to negotiate without prejudice. In some cases both these justifications are present; in others, only one or the other.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The words in s 23 contemplate two different situations that invoke the underlying rationales of the “without prejudice” rule. The first situation is where there is an express condition that any admission made by either party in the context of negotiations to settle a dispute is not to be “given”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, admissible in evidence against the party making the admission. The situation applies to all communications made expressly “without prejudice”. The second situation is where an admission is made “under circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given”. This situation will cover cases where even though a statement is not expressly made “without prejudice” the law holds that it is made without prejudice because it was made in the course of negotiations to settle a dispute: see the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">Bradford</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Bingley plc v Rashid</span> [2006] 1 WLR 2066 at [13] (“<span class="font-italic">Bradford</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Bingley</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The first, and the primary rationale, is public policy. Indeed, as the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Greenline-Onyx Envirotech Phils, Inc v Otto Systems Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 40 (“<span class="font-italic">Greenline-Onyx</span>”), “without prejudice” privilege “is founded on the public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences rather than to litigate them to the finish” (at [14], citing <span class="font-italic">Rush</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tompkins </span>at 1299). As such, “parties should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything said in the course of negotiations may be used to their prejudice in the course of proceedings” (at [14], citing <span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head </span>[1984] Ch 290 at 306). The second rationale is grounded in contract, in that “without prejudice” communications constitute an implied agreement arising out of what is commonly understood to be the consequences of offering or agreeing to negotiate without prejudice (see <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In so far as s 23 of the EA expresses only the broad principles behind “without prejudice” privilege and does not specify the scope of its operation, many of the detailed rules governing the operation of “without prejudice” privilege must be discerned from the common law (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-B Chew (HC) </span>at [15]). I turn to examine these rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, the existence of a dispute and an attempt to compromise it are at the core of the “without prejudice” privilege. As such, “without prejudice” privilege cannot be involved where no dispute exists (see <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [30]). Indeed, the communications in respect of which privilege is claimed must arise in the course of genuine negotiations to settle a dispute (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand </span><span class="font-italic">Perez De La Sala v Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and others and other appeals </span>[2018] 1 SLR 894 (“<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span>”) at [67]). In addition to the existence of a dispute, communications are protected by “without prejudice” privilege when such communications involve statements or conduct amounting to admissions against a party’s interests. The rationale behind this was explained by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng Construction Pte Ltd v Singapore Telecommunications Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 433 (“<span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>”) in the following terms (at [43]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A statement or action that appears on its face to go against the interest of the maker might be seized upon by the opposite party as an admission. This may take the form of statements which are prejudicial in any number of ways. Where one party enters into negotiations with another to explore the possibilities of settlement, it makes sense of course to attempt to convince the opponent of the weaknesses of his position; but it is not unusual – even common – to seem to acknowledge possible weaknesses in one’s own case. Even the level of an offer may be seen as a barometer of the offering party’s enthusiasm for the merits of his own position, and while that may be quite irrelevant if the communication was cloaked by the privilege, one can see that most litigants would avoid any attempt at settlement if there was a risk that their offers to settle were later going to be raised against them as a sign of weakness. It is thus in the overall spirit of encouraging negotiations that parties be sufficiently protected when they “lay their cards on the table”. ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As such, where correspondence shows an intention to compromise a dispute, or contains such an offer, this would amount to an admission against interest that can attract “without prejudice” privilege. This, as Menon JC explained in <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>, is entirely consistent with the rationale of encouraging parties to speak frankly in the course of their negotiations, without concern that anything which they have said can be used against them in the event of litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, when determining whether a particular correspondence is protected by “without prejudice” privilege, the use of the label “without prejudice” is important but not conclusive. As the High Court explained in <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan Enterprises Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Yak Thye Peng </span>[2017] SGHC 313 (“<span class="font-italic">Swee Wan</span>”) (at [10], citing <span class="font-italic">Cytec </span>at [16]), “attaching a ‘without prejudice’ label to a communication does not conclusively or automatically render it privileged”. This is consistent with the focus that the law has on the substantive rather than just the form. However, this does not mean that the use of a “without prejudice” label should be completely disregarded. On the contrary, as the High Court also explained in <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan </span>(at [10]), “[t]he presence of such words would, however, place the burden of persuasion on the party who contends that they should be ignored”. This is again consistent with the idea that the law attributes importance to a person’s conduct, especially if it was knowing and intentional. As such, the intentional use of the “without prejudice” label has to mean something, and the very least that should lead to is that the party who contends that it should be ignored bears the burden of proving so. Further, correspondence that is not expressly labelled as being “without prejudice” will be privileged if it is written in reply to a correspondence that is so labelled, or is part of a continuing sequence of negotiations, whether by correspondence or orally (see Bankim Thanki QC, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Privilege </span>(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2011) at para 7.13). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Third, “without prejudice” privilege can also arise in a multi-party situation. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mariwu </span>recognised (at [28]) that because “the rationale of the s 23 [EA] privilege is to encourage settlements … [there is] no inconsistency between that section and <span class="font-italic">Rush</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tompkins</span>”. In the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Rush</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tompkins</span>, a dispute arose between the plaintiffs, the first defendant, and the second defendants over the construction of some buildings. As the plaintiffs and the first defendant reached an out-of-court settlement, this left only the plaintiffs and the second defendants engaged in litigation. The court denied the second defendants’ application for discovery of the correspondence between the plaintiffs and the first defendant leading to their settlement, because the correspondence was protected by “without prejudice” privilege. Lord Griffiths explained why it was important for “without prejudice” privilege to apply to a multi-party situation (at 1301):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Suppose the main contractor in an attempt to settle a dispute with one subcontractor made certain admissions[. It is] clear law that those admissions cannot be used against him if there is no settlement. The reason they are not to be used is because it would discourage settlement if he believed that the admissions might be held against him. But it would surely be equally discouraging if the main contractor knew that if he achieved a settlement those admissions could then be used against him by any other subcontractor with whom he might also be in dispute. The main contractor might well be prepared to make certain concessions to settle some modest claim which he would never make in the face of another far larger claim. It seems to me that if those admissions made to achieve settlement of a piece of minor litigation could be held against him in a subsequent major litigation it would actively discourage settlement of the minor litigation and run counter to the whole underlying purpose of the “without prejudice” rule. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Indeed, in so far as “without prejudice” privilege applies in a two-party situation to promote settlement negotiations, the same privilege applies to a multi-party situation to protect settlement negotiations between some of the parties, even if the other parties are not willing to resolve the matter amicably. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Further, the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank v Lippo Marina Collection Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2018] 4 SLR 391 provides a useful summary on the application of “without prejudice” privilege to a multi-party situation (at [103]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As noted by Prof Pinsler, s 23(1) of the EA does not itself contemplate multi-party litigation (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Pinsler on Evidence</span> at para 15.014). However, in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Mariwu</span>, the Court of Appeal recognised as applicable at common law the leading House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Rush</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> &amp; Tompkins v Greater London Council</span> [1988] 3 All ER 737 (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Rush</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> &amp; Tompkins</span>”): “Given our interpretation that the rationale of the s 23 privilege is to encourage settlements, I can see no inconsistency between that section and <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Rush</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> &amp; Tompkins</span>” (at [28]).

Accordingly, the common law principles on without prejudice privilege apply in this case: the privilege protects from disclosure admissions made in the course of genuine negotiations to settle actual or contemplated litigation (see <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Matthews</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> &amp; Malek</span> at para 14.02).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision: some of the Emails are protected by “without prejudice” privilege</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 With the above principles in mind, I find that all of the Emails are protected by “without prejudice” privilege, save for the last email from Mr Wee sent on 9 November 2020 at 4.42pm, for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Emails were intended to further discuss the issues in dispute that the meeting of 7 August 2020 was meant to resolve </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Generally, I agree with the claimant that there remained disputed issues that were not resolved at the meeting of 7 August 2020.

In <span class="font-italic">BE</span>, the husband and wife had dinner in an attempt to reconcile their marriage. During the dinner, the husband presented his wife with an agreement to sign. This agreement stated, among others, that the wife shall continue to live in her property in London. The wife did not sign the agreement. She later sought to adduce the agreement as evidence to prove that she was domiciled in England, in support of her argument that the English court had jurisdiction. The husband sought to redact the agreement on the basis that it was made in the course of settlement negotiations. The English High Court, proceeding on the assumption that there was a dispute between the parties, held that the parties could not be said to have met to compromise the dispute as the wife merely attended a dinner with her husband and was not aware that it was an opportunity to negotiate (at [24]). Applying this to the present application, I have no difficulty agreeing with Mr Singh that the court must have regard to the circumstances from which the Emails originated from, when assessing whether they are protected by “without prejudice” privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With this general premise in mind, I, however, disagree with the defendants’ characterisation of the meeting as being “less a discussion and more a declaration of the position taken by the Group A Beneficiaries”.

I say this for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 First, the meeting of 7 August 2020 was apparently called for because it had been proposed that the transfer of the Properties and the Assignment Amount take place in a manner which departed from what was stated in the Amended Deed.

Thus, when the Emails were exchanged between the parties’ lawyers, starting with the email sent by Mr Wee on 18 August 2020 at 10.47am, it was clear that the Emails were sent as a continuation of the discussion of the various issues raised at the meeting on 7 August 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The fact that the Emails were meant to continue the parties’ discussion of the issues that had remained unresolved from the meeting on 7 August 2020 can be seen from the email that Mr Tan had sent on 24 August 2020 at 1.38pm, in which Mr Tan wrote at paragraph 28 that:

The parties were trying to find a middle ground to resolve their dispute. Although, as we now know, the parties did not manage to resolve their dispute amicably, this does not mean that the Emails had not been an attempt to compromise that dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, I do not think that <span class="font-italic">all </span>of the Emails reveal such an attempt to resolve the parties’ dispute.

</div> While marked as being “without prejudice”, this email contains a host of allegations and contains no hint of an attempt to settle or compromise the parties’ dispute. Indeed, it expressly states at paragraph 5.2 that “[y]ou and your clients are free to do as they wish”. There is no attempt to settle or compromise the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Accordingly, I find that all the Emails, save for the one sent by Mr Wee on 9 November 2020 at 4.42pm, were intended to further discuss the issues in dispute that the meeting on 7 August 2020 was meant to resolve. This therefore cloaks them with “without prejudice” privilege.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Emails were marked as being “without prejudice” and were sent by lawyers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I am fortified in my conclusion above by the fact that some of the Emails were marked as being “without prejudice” and were sent by lawyers. In my view, it is significant that several of the Emails were marked as being “without prejudice”. Notably, the first of the Emails, which was sent by Mr Wee on 18 August 2020 at 10.47am, was marked “without prejudice”.

</div> This shows that Mr Wee, who, being a lawyer, obviously can be taken to know the effect of the “without prejudice” label, regarded the purpose of his email to be for the discussion of the issues arising from the meeting on 7 August 2020, and with a view of settling them with the other parties. Moreover, Mr Wee continued to label his other emails (which are part of the Emails) as “without prejudice”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Indeed, when the other lawyers replied to this first email, there were indications that they regarded the subsequent correspondence to be “without prejudice”. First, in his email sent on 23 September 2020 at 6.15pm, Mr Tan ended his email at paragraph 27 by stating that his firm “will send your firm <span class="font-italic">an </span><span class="font-italic">open letter on the foregoing </span>shortly” [emphasis added].

</div> Although this email of 23 September 2020 was not marked as “without prejudice”, Mr Tan must have regarded this to be so, otherwise there would be no need for his firm to send an open letter that is distinct from the said email.

</div> Third, none of the other lawyers protested the use of the “without prejudice” label by Mr Wee and others, even when they were responding directly or indirectly to Mr Wee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thus, as the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [24]), it is important that correspondence is marked as “without prejudice” and more so if the correspondence was written by lawyers. This places the burden on the defendants, who are now urging the court to ignore the “without prejudice” label, to explain why the Emails are not privileged. Apart from the last email sent by Mr Wee on 9 November 2020 at 4.42pm, I am not satisfied that the defendants have provided a satisfactory explanation in this regard. Indeed, I do not think that it is satisfactory for the defendants to now explain before me that the “without prejudice” labels were used by the lawyers at the time only “out of caution”, when it is not clear what this caution is about. Instead, for the reasons I explained earlier, I do not think that the parties were so resolute in their positions that there was no compromise to be made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For all of these reasons, I find that all of the Emails, save for the last email from Mr Wee sent on 9 November 2020 at 4.42pm, are protected by “without prejudice” privilege. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the claimant has waived “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having decided that all but one of the Emails are protected by “without prejudice” privilege, I turn now to consider if the claimant has waived such privilege.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Although s 23 of the EA does not address the doctrine of waiver, the Singapore courts have accepted that the doctrine of wavier applies to “without prejudice” privilege (see <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan </span>at [14]). The applicable law in relation to waiver is trite. First, waiver requires the consent of both parties (see <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan </span>at [14], citing the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Krishna Kumaran s/o K Ramakrishnan v Kuppusamy s/o Ramakrishnan </span>[2014] 4 SLR 232 at [22]). Apart from an express waiver, an implied waiver of privilege can only be effective if it is clear and involves “conduct that unequivocally points to an intention not to rely on the privilege” (see <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng </span>at [61]). This must be proven to the standard of a balance of probabilities based on “clear evidence” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lau Chin Eng and another v Lau Chin Hu and others </span>[2009] SGHC 225 at [17]). As such, the fact that a party makes reference to the existence of a privileged document (but not its contents) cannot be taken as a waiver of “without prejudice” privilege. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>, Menon JC noted that a “single reference to the letter in the context of correspondence between the parties themselves” did not amount to a waiver of privilege (at [61]). This can be contrasted with <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-B Chew (HC)</span>, in which there was a waiver of privilege because the parties had not only referred to “without prejudice” communications, but also on affidavit “descended into the details of what had actually transpired” (at [24]). Indeed, “[r]ather than close the door of privilege, the defendant and his solicitors opened it even wider” (at [24]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Greenline-Onyx</span>, the defendant failed to assert “without prejudice” privilege over certain documents that had been included in the agreed bundle of documents for the trial of the matter (at [20]–[22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Second, a party cannot unilaterally waive privilege only to claim it later when his opponent makes reference to those communications (see <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-B Chew (HC) </span>at [22]). This is consistent with the rule against cherry picking, that one party may not cherry pick parts of documents that were favourable and retain privilege for parts that were unfavourable (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Tentat Singapore Pte Ltd v Multiple Granite Pte Ltd and others </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 42<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Third, there is no requirement that waiver must result in injustice or detriment to the other party. This is because waiver is a rule of evidence and should not be confused with waiver as a form of proprietary estoppel, which is a rule of equity (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Lim Tjoen Kong v </span><span class="font-italic">A-B Chew Investments Pte Ltd </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 168<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision: the claimant did not waive “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 With the above principles in mind, I find that the claimant did not waive “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails. First, I do not think the fact that the Group A beneficiaries referred to one of the Emails in the 15 June 2022 Letter is material because the claimant was not even a party to that Letter. Thus, she cannot be taken to have waived any privilege. Second, if the defendants’ argument is that the claimant has waived privilege by not objecting to the contents of the 15 June 2022 Letter being disclosed in Soon Heng’s and Soon Huat’s affidavits, I disagree. This is because the claimant did not discuss the contents of the Emails. Further, the 15 June 2022 Letter only contains a passing reference to <span class="font-italic">one </span>of the Emails, and did not discuss its contents. As such, this cannot, without more, amount to unequivocal conduct that is sufficient to waive privilege. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Accordingly, I find that the claimant did not waive “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether any exception to “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails applies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The final issue that I must consider is whether any exception to “without prejudice” privilege over the Emails applies. The defendants have raised two exceptions: (a) the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception; and (b) the doctrine of approbation and reprobation, which I shall consider in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law on the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Muller</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">exception</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Although the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception has received considerable judicial attention in the UK, little – if at all – has been said about it in Singapore. In this regard, I will set out the relevant cases discussing the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception in the UK, before turning to how it may potentially apply in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The </span>Muller<span class="font-italic"> exception in </span><span class="font-italic">the UK</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It is appropriate to begin with the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Muller</span>, from which the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception emanated. The brief facts are as follows. The plaintiffs sued the defendants – who were their solicitors – for negligence. The plaintiffs had consulted the defendants about a dispute between the plaintiffs and shareholders and directors of a company, which eventually culminated in a settlement. In the course of that dispute, the plaintiffs claimed the defendants negligently submitted an unstamped transfer document that led to the first plaintiff’s dismissal from the said company. As a result, the first plaintiff was forced to sell his shares in the company. The share price subsequently increased. One of the issues in the parties’ dispute was whether the settlement constituted a reasonable attempt by the plaintiffs to mitigate their damage. The plaintiffs sought to withhold disclosure of documents leading to the settlement based on “without prejudice” privilege. The court, which comprised Hoffmann, Swinton Thomas, and Leggatt LJJ, ordered the plaintiffs to disclose the documents. Hoffmann LJ reasoned his decision on an exception to “without prejudice” privilege:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If one analyses the relationship between the without prejudice rule and the other rules of evidence, it seems to me that the privilege operates as an exception to the general rule on admissions (which can itself be regarded as an exception to the rule against hearsay) that the statement or conduct of a party is always admissible against him to prove any fact which is thereby expressly or impliedly asserted or admitted. The public policy aspect of the rule is not in my judgment concerned with the admissibility of statements which are relevant otherwise than as admissions, i.e. independently of the truth of the facts alleged to have been admitted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Many of the alleged exceptions to the rule will be found on analysis to be cases in which the relevance of the communication lies not in the truth of any fact which it asserts or admits, but simply in the fact that it was made. Thus, when the issue is whether without prejudice letters have resulted in an agreed settlement, the correspondence is admissible because the relevance of the letters has nothing to do with the truth of any facts which the writers may have expressly or impliedly admitted. They are relevant because they contain the offer and acceptance forming a contract which has replaced the cause of action previously in dispute. Likewise, a without prejudice letter containing a threat is admissible to prove that the threat was made. A without prejudice letter containing a statement which amounted to an act of bankruptcy is admissible to prove that the statement was made; see [<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Daintrey </span>[1893] 2 QB 116]. Without prejudice correspondence is always admissible to explain delay in commencing or prosecuting litigation. Here again, the relevance lies in the fact that the communications took place and not the truth of their contents. Indeed, I think that the only case in which the rule has been held to preclude the use of without prejudice communications, otherwise than as admissions, is in the rule that an offer may not be used on the question of costs; a rule which, as I have said, has been held to rest purely upon convention and not upon public policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hoffmann LJ’s reasoning was that the public policy rationale of “without prejudice” privilege did not apply to statements that are relevant, not because of the truth of any fact it asserts or admits, but simply on the fact that <span class="font-italic">it was made</span>. On the other hand, Swinton Thomas and Leggatt LJJ reasoned their decisions on the basis that the plaintiffs had waived any “without prejudice” privilege that protected the negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The subsequent cases and the discussions of the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception therein have centered around the following concerns: (a) whether the exception undermines the rationales behind “without prejudice” privilege; (b) what the basis for the exception is; and (c) what the test for the exception is. The upshot of these concerns is that the status of the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception is very much in doubt in the UK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The first concern is that the exception undermines the rationales behind “without prejudice” privilege. As mentioned earlier, the primary rationale is the public policy of encouraging parties to settle their disputes rather than litigate them. Indeed, in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span><span class="font-italic"> plc v Procter &amp; Gamble Co </span>[2000] 1 WLR 2436 (“<span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>”), Walker LJ stated as follows (at 2443–2444 and 2448–2449): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Without in any way underestimating the need for proper analysis of the rule, I have no doubt that busy practitioners are acting prudently in making the general working assumption that the rule, if not “sacred” (<span class="font-italic">Hoghton v Hoghton</span> (1852) 15 Beav. 278, 321), has a wide and compelling effect. That is particularly true where the ‘without prejudice’ communications in question consist not of letters or other written documents but of wide-ranging unscripted discussions during a meeting which may have lasted several hours. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At a meeting of that sort the discussions between the parties’ representatives may contain a mixture of admissions and half-admissions against a party’s interest, more or less confident assertions of a party’s case, offers, counter-offers, and statements (which might be characterised as threats, or as thinking aloud) about future plans and possibilities. As Simon Brown LJ put it in the course of argument, a threat of infringement proceedings may be deeply embedded in negotiations for a compromise solution. Partial disclosure of the minutes of such a meeting may be, as Leggatt LJ put it in <span class="font-italic">Muller</span>, a concept as implausible as the curate’s egg (which was good in parts). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But to dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications (except for a special reason) would not only create huge practical difficulties but would be contrary to the underlying objective of giving protection to the parties, in the words of Lord Griffiths in [<span class="font-italic">Rush</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tompkins</span> at p.1300]: “to speak freely about all issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise and, for the purpose of establishing a basis of compromise, admitting certain facts.” Parties cannot speak freely at a without prejudice meeting if they must constantly monitor every sentence, with lawyers or patent agents sitting at their shoulders as minders.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As such, Walker LJ proposed adopting a broader approach in respect of the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception, such that communications between negotiating parties are protected by “without prejudice” privilege as a whole, and the court should not dissect parts of such communications as <span class="font-italic">not</span> being privileged. For convenience, I term this the “Broad Approach”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Walker LJ’s concern was echoed in the House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">Ofulue v Bossert </span>[2009] AC 990 (“<span class="font-italic">Ofulue v Bossert</span>”). In Lord Rodger’s words, although “it would be possible to carve out an exception along those lines”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the <span class="font-italic">Muller</span> exception, “[t]he question is whether creating such an exception would be consistent with the overall policy behind the rule” (at [39]). In the same judgment, Lord Neuberger also highlighted that the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception does not consider the contractual rationale behind “without prejudice” privilege (at [95]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Despite the very great respect I have for any view expressed by Lord Hoffmann, and the intellectual attraction of the distinction which he draws, I am inclined to think that it is a distinction which is too subtle to apply in practice; I consider that its application would often risk falling foul of the problem identified by Robert Walker LJ in the passage quoted above. In any event, the observation appears to be limited to the public policy reason for the rule, and says nothing about the contractual reason, which plainly applies here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 For completeness, I note that in the UK Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Oceanbulk Shipping and Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v TMT Asia Ltd and others </span>[2011] 1 AC 662, Lord Clarke stated as follows (at [27]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The without prejudice rule is thus now very much wider than it was historically. Moreover, its importance has been judicially stressed on many occasions, most recently perhaps in <span class="font-italic">Ofulue v Bossert </span>[2009] AC 990, where the House of Lords identified the two bases of the rule and held that communications in the course of negotiations should not be admissible in evidence. It held that the rule extended to negotiations concerning earlier proceedings involving an issue that was still not resolved and refused, on the ground of legal and practical certainty, to extend the exceptions to the rule so as to limit the protection to identifiable admissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The second concern is the unclear basis for the exception. As Fancourt J held in the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Briggs and others v Clay and others </span>[2019] EWHC 102 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Briggs</span>”), the exception may be justified on two alternative bases, and it was unclear which was the true basis for Hoffmann LJ’s decision (at [49]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There therefore appear to be two bases for Hoffmann LJ’s decision. The first is that the without prejudice rule only applies to protect admissions, not facts that are relevant independently of their truth or falsity, and the defendant was not seeking to rely on the content of the without prejudice negotiations to prove any admissions. The second basis is that the plaintiff himself had raised (or “put in issue”) the reasonableness of the negotiations; that issue could not be determined without disclosure of the negotiations, and the public policy underlying the rule was not infringed by ordering disclosure in favour of the defendant for the purpose of the second claim. The shareholders were not parties to the second claim or (apparently) affected by its outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 <span class="font-italic">Briggs</span> is additionally relevant for the gloss that it adds to the test set out in the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the third concern I have identified above. Indeed, it is clear that there is no one settled test in the application of the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception. As Fancourt J puts it in <span class="font-italic">Briggs</span>, “the general principle that bringing a claim or making an allegation does not disentitle a party to rely on without prejudice privilege may well be qualified <span class="font-italic">where an issue is raised that is only </span><span class="font-italic">justiciable upon proof of without prejudice negotiations</span>” (at [99]) [emphasis added]. In his view, this test is reflected in the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Muller</span>, where all three judges “considered it to be material that the plaintiff had put in issue the reasonableness of his negotiations with the shareholders and that that issue would not be justiciable without disclosure of the negotiations” (at [98]). However, as later cases show, the test only resulted in further confusion as to what the test for the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception really is. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thus, in the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Berkeley Square Holdings and others v Lancer Property Asset Management Ltd and others </span>[2020] EWHC 1015 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”), Roth J applied the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception as developed in <span class="font-italic">Briggs</span>. His interpretation of “fairly justiciable” was whether “the evidence is so central to an issue which the party resisting disclosure has introduced that there is a serious risk that there will not be a fair trial if that evidence is excluded” (at [83]). On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, Roth J admitted the relevant evidence, because “if the material is not admitted, the court at the trial will be misled” (at [88(iii)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 When <span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>went on appeal, the English Court of Appeal, however, voiced concerns about the seeming extension of the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception (see <span class="font-italic">Berkley Square Holdings Ltd and others v Lancer Property Asset Management Ltd and others </span>[2021] 1 WLR 4877 (“<span class="font-italic">Berkley</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”)). Richards LJ raised the following concerns: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A new exception was developed by Fancourt J in <span class="font-italic">Briggs </span>and Roth J in <span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>. This exception “would apply where one party raises an issue which cannot, or cannot fairly, be decided without recourse to evidence of without prejudice negotiations or communications but the party raising the issue resists disclosure or use of such evidence” (at [84]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is uncertainty over the word “justiciable”. The word is conventionally used to describe an issue that the court will not consider because of its subject matter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it must be impossible to determine the issue without recourse to the “without prejudice” evidence. However, Roth J in <span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>set the bar lower, by referencing whether the court is able to fairly determine an issue and to the centrality of the evidence (at [87]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It is unclear whether the exception “is available in both two-party cases and three-party cases. If it is available where the person resisting disclosure or admission has not waived privilege, it would logically appear to be as applicable in a two-party case as in a three-party case” (at [88]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) There “would need to be careful consideration of whether this exception would involve an unacceptable interference with the public policy of encouraging compromises which is the reason for the without prejudice rule” (at [89]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Despite his concerns, Richards LJ ultimately concluded that <span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>was “not the case to decide whether a new exception of this type exists” because it was unnecessary on the facts of the case (at [90]). That said, it is clear that Richards LJ had expressed considerable doubt about the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I conclude my analysis of the development of the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception in the UK by stating that there is uncertainty over whether the exception should even apply as a matter of principle, and even if it applies, what the scope of the exception is. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The </span>Muller<span class="font-italic"> exception in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The relevant cases </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Turning then to how the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception may apply in Singapore, I begin with the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Quek Kheng Leong Nicky and another v Teo Beng Ngoh and others and another appeal </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 181 (“<span class="font-italic">Quek Nicky</span>”), which discussed <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> (at [23]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The rule against the admission of “without prejudice” communications is, however, subject to a number of exceptions.

For brevity, I reproduce only what Walker LJ in <span class="font-italic">Unilever </span>said about the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception (at 2444–2445):<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) As Hoffmann LJ noted in <span class="font-italic">Muller’s </span>case, when the issue is whether without prejudice communications have resulted in a concluded compromise agreement, those communications are admissible. <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Tomlin v Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd.</span> [1969] 1 WLR 1378 is an example.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) In <span class="font-italic">Muller’s </span>case (which was a decision on discovery, not admissibility) one of the issues between the claimant and the defendants, his former solicitors, was whether the claimant had acted reasonably to mitigate his loss in his conduct and conclusion of negotiations for the compromise of proceedings brought by him against a software company and its other shareholders. Hoffmann LJ treated that issue as one unconnected with the truth or falsity of anything stated in the negotiations, and as therefore falling outside the principle of public policy protecting without prejudice communications. The other members of the court agreed but would also have based their decision on waiver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Contrary to the defendants’ submission, I do not think that <span class="font-italic">Quek Nicky </span>can be taken as authority that the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception applies in Singapore. In my view, when the Court of Appeal referred to <span class="font-italic">Unilever </span>and the exceptions to “without prejudice” privilege therein, the court did not go so far as to say that those exceptions apply in Singapore, and more specifically, that the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception applies. Even if the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception applies in Singapore, the development of the exception in the UK since <span class="font-italic">Quek Nicky </span>was decided in 2009 requires that I nevertheless determine the true scope of the exception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 There are two High Court decisions that I consider to be relevant to my decision: <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng </span>and <span class="font-italic">CSO v CSP and another </span>[2023] SGHC 24 (“<span class="font-italic">CSO</span><span class="font-italic"> v CSP</span>”). First, in <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>, Menon JC considered the issue of whether “without prejudice” privilege applies to negotiations on quantum even if there has been an admission of liability. Menon JC cited <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> and alluded to the Broad Approach (at [49]–[51]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49  It was not disputed that the letter, at the very least, involved negotiations over the amount that might be paid and this was not as a matter of pure indulgence. The policy reasons behind the “without prejudice” privilege have been shortly stated in the cases referred to above at [9]. In a nutshell, the underlying policy justification for the rule is:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[P]arties should be encouraged so far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations … may be used to their prejudice in the course of the proceedings.

In such situations, even though one party may have admitted to liability, as long as there remains a dispute as to the extent of that liability, the policy interests are implicated. The privilege is thus equally well justified since it is just as important to the avoidance of the litigation of such matters. It is plain that if parties cannot agree on the specific settlement <span class="font-italic">amount</span>, they will continue to litigate that issue.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51  In my judgment, the same result can also be seen to be justified <span class="font-italic">in principle</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> ([12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Robert Walker LJ stated that it would be undesirable to “dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications”. The rationale for this proposition is that if there is a risk that some part of the communications that take place in circumstances where the parties are trying to come to a settlement may later be found not to be privileged, it would inhibit the discussions as a practical matter. In my judgment, the same sort of practical difficulties would arise if the “without prejudice” rule were held not to apply to negotiations directed at settling disputes on quantum.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Second, in <span class="font-italic">CSO v CSP</span>, the High Court discussed the interaction between s 23 of the EA and the common law rule on “without prejudice” privilege, holding that such privilege applied to the whole of “without prejudice” communications and not only admissions.

Likewise, a party might during negotiations assert a claim or defence that is not later pursued in court proceedings – it should not be prejudiced by the other party being able to make forensic use of that discrepancy.

It is not only communications that “constitute” admissions that are privileged; communications that “involve” admissions (and also involve non-admissions) are privileged too.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74     The Court of Appeal (at [86]) noted the argument that “the broader purpose of without prejudice privilege is to provide parties with a general freedom to negotiate, and therefore <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">things which go beyond admissions against interest should be capable of being protected</span>” [emphasis added]. The court did not disagree with this. On the contrary, the court (at [68] and [90]) approved of the observations in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Schering Corporation v CIPLA Ltd</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[2004] EWHC 2587 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Schering</span>”)[, ]a decision that applied the Broad Approach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75     In <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Schering</span>, the court held that a certain letter was a “negotiating document”, <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span>, a document indicating a willingness to negotiate, and as such the letter was protected by “without prejudice” privilege. The letter contained two paragraphs asserting the author’s confidence, on the basis of legal advice, that the other party’s patent was invalid, and a further paragraph to the effect that the author’s confidence in the correctness of its position was so great that it felt it is safe to proceed without regard to the other side’s position if negotiations were not entered into and resolved satisfactorily. The court however held that “the overall message continues to be one of wishing to negotiate” (at [21]). The court did not dissect out identifiable admissions (such as references to willingness to negotiate) and withhold protection from the rest of the “without prejudice” communications (such as the author’s assertions of the strength of its own position). The <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">whole</span> letter was privileged, not just the identifiable admissions in it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76      <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Ernest Ferdinand</span> (which endorsed <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Schering</span>) does not preclude the Broad Approach.

As the EA codified only the law of evidence existing at the time of its enactment, new rules of evidence can be given effect to only if they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the EA or their underlying rationale (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 239 at [117], cited with approval in the Court of Appeal decisions of <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 447 at [116] and <span class="font-italic">ARX v Comptroller of Income Tax </span>[2016] 5 SLR 590 at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 With s 2(2) of the EA in mind, I find that the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception does not apply in Singapore. This is because the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception is incompatible with the public policy and contract rationales behind “without prejudice” privilege. For the public policy rationale, I broadly agree with Walker LJ’s explanation in <span class="font-italic">Unilever</span> that parties will be unable to speak freely in negotiations if they are preoccupied with determining which portion of their negotiations falls within the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception and is admissible as evidence. For the contract rationale, as Lord Neuberger alluded to in <span class="font-italic">Ofulue v Bossert</span>, it is unclear how the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception is compatible with the contract rationale for “without prejudice” privilege. This is because if the basis for “without prejudice” privilege is the implied agreement between negotiating parties that their communications are privileged, for the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception to apply, a similar implied agreement must apply. Yet, I find it difficult to fathom how there can be such an implied agreement, especially when the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception requires dissecting parties’ negotiations into admissions and all other communications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Further, in so far as the Broad Approach applies in Singapore, I consider that it will be inconsistent to adopt the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception in Singapore. This is because, as I mentioned above, the Broad Approach prevents the court from dissecting communications that are protected by “without prejudice” privilege. Yet, an application of the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception requires the court to undertake this exact process of dissection. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision on the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Muller</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> exception: </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the exception does not apply</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Given my finding that the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception does not apply in Singapore, I reject the defendants’ argument that the claimant is precluded from relying on “without prejudice” privilege for the Emails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the event that I am wrong, and the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception applies in Singapore, I similarly reject the defendants’ argument that the claimant is precluded from relying on “without prejudice” privilege for the Emails. This is because, applying the test for the extended <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception as developed in <span class="font-italic">Briggs </span>and <span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, I do not find that the defendants have satisfactorily particularised an issue which cannot, or cannot fairly, be decided without recourse to the Emails. In any event, when Mr Singh realised that the <span class="font-italic">Muller </span>exception had been subject to such trenchant criticism in <span class="font-italic">Berkeley</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, he dropped his reliance on the exception without more.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law on the doctrine of approbation and reprobation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I turn then to Mr Tan’s argument that the claimant should not be allowed to approbate and reprobate. The law on the doctrine of approbation and reprobation has been comprehensively explored by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1296 (at [101]–[118]) and I need not add to it. To briefly summarise, the doctrine is a principle of equity that a person who accepts a benefit under an instrument must adopt it in its entirety and renounce any other rights that are inconsistent with it. For instance, a person who has benefitted from a judgment cannot allege the invalidity of the judgment that conferred him the benefit. The doctrine extends more broadly to a situation of inconsistent positions asserted against different parties in different proceedings, as long as the party has received an actual benefit as a result of an earlier inconsistent position, as reflected in the English decisions of <span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers </span>and <span class="font-italic">First National Bank plc v Walker </span>[2001] 1 FLR 505. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Unlike the common law doctrine of election, the doctrine of approbation and reprobation does not require the electing party to make a conscious choice between alternative rights and remedies, but a party’s election that gives rise to a prior position must still be reasonably clear to be effective (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Aries Telecoms</span><span class="font-italic"> (M) Bhd v ViewQwest Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 108 at [5]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the context of the present application, I consider that there may also be a related issue of whether a party may use “without prejudice” privilege to escape disclosure obligations, such as in without notice applications under the Rules of Court 2021 (the “ROC 2021”). In my view, no such concern arises. This is because when communications are protected by “without prejudice” privilege, the parties have no obligations to disclose this to the court. I raise O 9 r 3 of the ROC 2021 as an example, which states that “without prejudice” communications must not be disclosed to the court:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Non‑disclosure (O. 9, r. 3)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span>  Subject to the law governing the admissibility of evidence at trial, any communication made in the course of a case conference in any action or proceedings must not be disclosed to the Court conducting the trial of the action or proceedings if such communication —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) has been stated by any of the parties to the action or proceedings to be “confidential” or “without prejudice”; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) has been marked by the Registrar or Judge (as the case may be) as being “confidential” or “without prejudice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, in so far as communications are protected by “without prejudice” privilege, parties have no obligation to disclose them to the court. On the contrary, they are obliged to <span class="font-italic">not </span>disclose them to the court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision on the doctrine of approbation and reprobation: the doctrine does not apply</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 With the above principles in mind, I find that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation does not apply here. In my judgment, the claimant has not simultaneously accepted a benefit and renounced any rights inconsistent with that benefit. The claimant is seeking only to strike out the Emails, and not the 15 June Letter. As a result, the defendants can rely on the 15 June Letter in SUM 2781. Accordingly, and contrary to the defendants’ submission, the doctrine of approbation and reprobation does not apply in the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I also do not find that the claimant has, by relying on “without prejudice” privilege, failed to make any material disclosure in SUM 2781. This is because, as I set out above, when communications are protected by “without prejudice” privilege, the parties have no obligation to disclose them to the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For all these reasons, I allow the claimant’s application to the extent that I find that all of the Emails, save for the one sent by Mr Wee on 9 November 2020 at 4.42pm, are protected by “without prejudice” privilege. I accordingly order that all these Emails, as well as the relevant paragraphs, be expunged from the affected affidavits as set out in the present application. The defendants are to refile the affected affidavits, without the expunged materials, within 14 days of this decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Unless the parties are able to agree on costs, they are to write in with their submissions limited to seven pages each, also within 14 days of this decision.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Ka Luon Eddee, Tnee Zixian Keith, Lee Pei Hua Rachel and Natalie Ng Hai Qi (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sarbjit Singh Chopra, Roshan Singh Chopra and Sakthi Vel s/o Raman (Selvam LLC) for the first, third and fifth defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Teng Muan and Loh Li Qin (UniLegal LLC) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Jedidiah Low Yeow Chin (Ark Law Corporation) for the fourth defendant (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
