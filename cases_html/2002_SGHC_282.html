<i xmlns="">
<p>The facts</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        HH Media-Tech Pte Ltd (the

plaintiffs) are a company incorporated in Singapore and are in the business of selling

electronic components and developing e-commerce applications. The plaintiffs were

previously known as Honhee Pte Ltd. The company's managing-director is Tang Boon Siew

(Tang) who took over the running of the family business in 1986. His sister Shirley Tang

Boon Ser (Shirley) is the plaintiffs' accounts/administration manager. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        Kim Yong Hyun (the

defendant) is a South Korean national who is a director and (majority) shareholder in a

company called DS Media Pte Ltd (DSM) as well as of another company called Duplex

Electronics Pte Ltd (Duplex), before it was struck off the Registry of Companies on 26

January 2002.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        Tang first met the

defendant in 1992 when the latter was the research and development chief at Thomson

Singapore (Thomson), designing television chassis. The parties met again in 1998 by which

time, the defendant had left Thomson, had started DSM and was selling television

components to Korea and Japan.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        In 1996, the plaintiffs'

business was concentrated on selling television parts to customers in India and the Middle

East, for manufacture of television sets (TV sets). Tang decided there was potentially

good profits to be made if the plaintiffs went into the business of supplying television

chassis to poorer countries; such countries could then produce local branded TV sets

cheaper and cheaply, instead of paying much higher prices for TV sets made under

established brands like Sony and Panasonic.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        Tang then met up with the

defendant to discuss his business plan. Tang wanted the defendant to design the television

chassis which the plaintiffs' customers could then assemble and turn into custom-made TV

sets. As a result of their discussions, an oral agreement (the agreement) was concluded in

May 1998 between the plaintiffs and the defendant whereby the defendant agreed to design

and develop a series of micro-processor ICs, layouts and modules for the plaintiffs

(collectively referred to as components), for use in televisions kits (TV kits) to be sold

by the plaintiffs. It was also agreed that the plaintiffs would pay the defendant a

development fee for each of the components to be supplied by the defendant, through his

company DSM. The development fee would be incorporated into and form part of, the price

for each of the components.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        One reason (according to

Tang) for the defendant's willingness to enter into the agreement was the fact that DSM

was then not doing well at all. The defendant needed financial assistance to keep his

company afloat and to pay his staff. In May 1998 itself, the plaintiffs advanced S$80,000

to the defendant. Between 8 May 1998 and February 2000, the loans extended by the

plaintiffs to the defendant and or DSM totalled US$488,257.55 and S$120,000 of which

US$331,890.18 and S$10,000 respectively, had been repaid by the defendant. According to

the plaintiffs, the advances were for the defendant to purchase/pay for 'key' components,

elaborated upon in para 9 below.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        Besides the advances which

the plaintiffs made to the defendant, Tang alleged that the company assisted the defendant

in other ways. The plaintiffs allowed him to use rent-free, a portion of the plaintiffs'

office at Commonwealth Drive, which the plaintiffs renovated at their own cost ($7,000).

The plaintiffs also bore the movers' costs when the defendant shifted in. The defendant

occupied the plaintiffs' premises between March and June/July 1999, when he moved out of

his own accord. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        The defendant's profit

under the agreement would be the 'mark-up' he charged the plaintiffs for the components.

The defendant was only to be responsible for providing technical support and supplying the

components whereas the plaintiffs had to bear the credit risks (from their customers and

suppliers), and the costs of logistics such as warehousing, packing,

transportation/shipping, as well as bank charges.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        To be able to

purchase/source for the components, the plaintiffs needed the defendant, who had the

necessary expertise and contacts (from his days with Thomson and Samsung), to provide a

list for the components. Consequently they asserted, it was the defendant's responsibility

to check with suppliers regularly and to update the price list for the components, as well

as their availability. Key components however (which would include the micro-processor

chip and power module), would be ordered by and delivered to, the defendant who would sell

them (personally or through his nominated company) to the plaintiffs, presumably again

with a mark-up for his profit. The plaintiffs claimed they would advance monies to the

defendant (at his request) to enable him to buy the key components. The defendant would

consequently know the total cost of the entire chassis. Tang would discuss with the

defendant before coming up with the final selling price of the chassis to customers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        The plaintiffs left it to

the defendant to handle complaints from customers regarding the technical aspect of

things. It was for the defendant to solve the customer's problem and if necessary, to

change the list of components so as to eliminate the problem for future orders. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        The first order which the

plaintiffs secured after entering into the agreement, was from a company called Marcon

Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Marcon) which expressed an interest to manufacture TV sets

in Thailand. A Thai public company called Distar Electric Corporation (Distar) was

supposed to assemble and manufacture the TV sets with a chassis to be provided by the

plaintiffs/the defendant. To that intent and purpose, the four (4) parties signed a

contract dated 8 April 1998 (the contract). Unfortunately, the contract was never

performed as Distar changed its mind about manufacturing the TV sets. Eventually, a

Malaysian company Setron Sdn Bhd was contracted to manufacture the TV sets (5,000 units)

instead, with chassis supplied by the plaintiffs/the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        In November 1998, Tang

and the defendant visited Egypt and Turkey to look for business opportunities. In the

course of the trip, they met up with representatives of an Egyptian company called

International Electrical Products Company (IEP) which eventually became the plaintiffs'

customer. IEP had the moulds and design for manufacturing TV sets. The company wanted the

plaintiffs/the defendant to design the internal circuitry and electronics, find suppliers

for all the components, trouble- shoot and export all the parts to IEP to enable the

latter to assemble a complete chassis for their production of TV sets. On its part, IEP

would make the cabinets and source for the picture tubes elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        Tang and the defendant

managed to secure an initial order for 7,000 units of chassis from IEP on that trip, which

the plaintiffs shipped to IEP in February 1999. Payment from IEP for that first and

subsequent orders were by letters of credits. It usually took 2-3 months for a letter of

credit from IEP to come through to the plaintiffs; this was due to the difficulty of

finding American dollars in Egypt. IEP would place its orders 3-6 months ahead of delivery

time. According to Tang, the plaintiffs would normally not place orders for components

with suppliers (including the defendant) until after their receipt of the letters of

credit. Nevertheless business with IEP continued satisfactorily until June 2001. However,

over time, their letters of credit to the plaintiffs took longer and longer to arrive,

despite Tang's pressing of IEP.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        On the other hand, the

defendant's prices to the plaintiffs increased steadily. Initially, he charged the

plaintiffs US$2.10 for the micro-processor. Gradually, the defendant increased his price,

first to US$4.80 and then to US$6.90. On a few occasions, Tang requested the defendant not

to increase his price when the former mentioned his intention to do so to Tang, the reason

being it would cut into the (already thin) profit margins of the plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        The only hitches in the

business relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant when it subsisted, were the

periodic delays in shipments to the plaintiffs' customers, due to a number of reasons.

Sometimes, the plaintiffs encountered problems with suppliers and they had to revert to

the defendant for alternative solutions. At other times, the customer changed the make of

the picture tubes, necessitating a change in components at the plaintiffs' end. On other

occasions, the defendant discovered defects which had to be rectified, when he did random

testing of the components.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        The plaintiffs claimed

that the agreement provided that the components developed by the defendant would be sold

exclusively and solely to the plaintiffs and their customers. Further, the defendant would

not sell TV kits incorporating the components, to the plaintiffs' customers without the

plaintiffs' consent. Neither would the defendant solicit any work/orders from the

plaintiffs' customers without the latter's consent.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        In June 2001, Tang

ascertained from one of the plaintiffs' suppliers that the defendant had supplied

components direct to IEP. At that time, IEP had an outstanding order of 75,000 units of

chassis, with the plaintiffs. Efforts made by Tang to contact the defendant were

fruitless, despite 20 or more attempts. The plaintiffs alleged they also discovered that

the defendant had attempted to solicit one other of the plaintiffs' customers, an Iranian

company called Silk Road Manufacturing (Silk Road), from whom the plaintiffs had secured a

contract for a television mould in March 2000, followed by an order for 10,000 sets of

chassis in December 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        The relationship between

the plaintiffs and the defendant soured as a result of what the plaintiffs discovered in

June-August 2001. The plaintiffs' advances to the defendant had ceased by February 2000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        The plaintiffs'

solicitors made a demand on 6 February 2002 of the defendant for repayment of the balance

of US$156,367.37 and S$110,000 owed on the advances made by the plaintiffs; the defendant

did not comply with the demand.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The claim</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        Consequently, the

plaintiffs commenced these proceedings against the defendant in April 2002, claiming the

aforementioned two (2) sums, an account of profits made from sales of television

components and kits to the plaintiffs' customers and to customers solicited by the

defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        In the (lengthy) defence

and counterclaim which he filed to the plaintiffs' statement of claim, the defendant

alleged that:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the agreement provided that the plaintiffs would bear the entire

    research and development (R&amp; D) costs of the components;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) in consideration for (i), the parties agreed that the plaintiffs

    could sell the components to the plaintiffs' customers as well as to the parties' mutual

    customers;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) all intellectual property rights, including design of the

    components, would be retained by the defendant through DSM as his agent;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the plaintiffs would arrange the logistics and bear the costs, of

    selling to the parties' mutual customers;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) DSM would incorporate a development fee of about US$3.00 into each

    television set or components sold by DSM to the plaintiffs;</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) all profits derived from sales to the parties' mutual customers

    would be shared equally between the plaintiffs and DSM. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        The defendant asserted he

was instrumental in introducing IEP (as well as Silk Road) to the plaintiffs. He contended

that the plaintiffs lost IEP as a customer due to poor service. The defendant asserted he

had never agreed that IEP would be the plaintiffs' exclusive customer, nor had he agreed

that the plaintiffs were solely entitled to sell TV kits to the plaintiffs' customers and

he could not, without the plaintiffs' consent or, that he was not permitted to solicit any

work from the plaintiffs' customers relating to design, development and or sale of

micro-processor ICs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        The defendant did not

dispute the advances made to him by the plaintiffs save for three (3) amounts namely,

S$20,000 (given in October 2000), US$31,367.36 (by way of a letter of credit in favour of

Mitsubishi (Mitsubishi) in August 1999) and S$10,000 (given in February 2000). He

contended however that the advances made by the plaintiffs were in any case set-off

against discounts DSM had given (for micro-processors ICs) at the request of Tang,

totalling US$177,456.52 (for which he furnished a breakdown). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        The defendant alleged it

was the plaintiffs who were in breach of the agreement by failing to provide funding for

R&amp;D after February 2000. Even so, he alleged that he continued to supply the

plaintiffs with TV kits for the purpose of selling to IEP as well as to Silk Road.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        The defendant

counter-claimed against the plaintiffs for:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) discounts he had given to the plaintiffs on micro-processors sold

    by DSM;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) an account of profits derived from sales of TV kits/components the

    plaintiffs made from IEP and other customers;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) failing to take delivery of components ordered by the plaintiffs

    under the plaintiffs' purchase order no. HH/366//10/100 dated 1 December 2000 and under

    the defendant's tax invoice D1-21003HH dated 29 January 2001;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the sum of US$300,000 for loss of development fees resulting from

    the aborted contracts between the plaintiffs and IEP as well Silk Road Manufacturing.</p>
<p align="justify">(v) the sum of US$43,775 (inclusive of 3% GST) for the cost of

    developing software, micro-processor and chassis, under DSM's offer sheet no. 0S2002HH

    dated 17 January 2000. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The defendant quantified his claim under item (ii) at US$460,198.85.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        In its Reply and Defence

to Counterclaim, the plaintiffs:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) said it was at IEP's repeated requests that it was mutually agreed

    between Tang and the defendant that the price of components would be reduced so as to make

    the plaintiffs' price of TV kits more competitive with those manufactured by China and

    Korea. The defendant continued to receive his development fee;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) averred that as there were no new components to be developed after

    February 2000, there was no need for further loans to be extended to the defendant for R

    &amp; D;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) contended that it was the defendant's delay in delivering

    components that caused the plaintiffs to be unable to comply with IEP's delivery schedule

    for television kits. The defendant then took advantage of the situation to approach IEP

    direct to solicit for orders of TV kits incorporating the components;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) denied the various heads of the defendant's counterclaim.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs' case</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        I start my review by

referring to the testimony of Tang (PW1), who, with his sister Tang Boon Ser (Shirley)

were the plaintiffs' two (2) witnesses. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        Tang (who is known to the

defendant as Victor Tang) has had experience in special export business in electrical

goods and in electronics since 1982. He exported Sony and Akai TV sets and radio-cassettes

to African countries, India and Pakistan. However, those export sales comprised assembled

sets, not what he and the defendant did under the agreement.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        Cross-examined, Tang

testified that he understood from the defendant that the plaintiffs' profit margin on each

TV kit could be as high as US$10-$12. In reality however, the plaintiffs only made US$2 or

less per kit, on top of all the commercial risks they had to bear, whilst the defendant,

who was only responsible for the technical aspects, received a development fee of US$3.00

per kit regardless of what the plaintiffs made or lost. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        Tang's attention was

drawn to a draft agreement (2AB6-7) he had handed to the defendant sometime at end 1999

but which was back-dated to 12 May 1998. He explained that the plaintiffs' auditors had

been chasing him to regularise the loans the company had made to the defendant; so his

general manager drafted the document for discussion between the parties. However, the

defendant refused to sign as the draft agreement contained a clause stating that the

intellectual property arising out of the defendant's R&amp;D work would belong to the

plaintiffs. As a result, the plaintiffs stopped their advances to him in February 2000.

When he testified, the defendant's explanation for not signing was that the terms of the

draft did not reflect what the parties had agreed. Tang said he had also chased the

defendant to sign a loan agreement to no avail. He agreed with counsel for the defendant

that the micro-processors for the TV sets had to be purchased from the defendant/DSM as

only the defendant had access to the chip from Mitsubishi. Tang pointed out that the

plaintiffs were totally dependent on the defendant as, if there was even one (1) component

missing, the entire TV kit would not work. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        As for the three (3)

advances made by the plaintiffs which the defendant disputed, Tang's testimony was as

follows:-</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) $20,000 paid to the defendant in October 1998</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The defendant had called him (frequently) to say he (the defendant)

needed the money urgently. Tang instructed Shirley to arrange to pay the amount to the

defendant. Shirley then had a sum of US$20,000/- which she was changing into Singapore

dollars. Shirley in turn instructed the plaintiffs' production manager John Khoo Kim Huat

(Khoo) to change the foreign into local currency (S$33,720) with a moneychanger and to

deliver S$20,000 therefrom to the defendant. Shirley and Khoo's affidavit corroborated

Tang's evidence in this regard. Khoo deposed that he had been instructed to obtain the

defendant's signature to the plaintiffs' payment voucher when he handed over the S$20,000.

However, the defendant had refused to sign the payment voucher on 2 October 1998. After

Khoo had telephoned Shirley (who then checked with Tang), he was told to hand over the

cash without the need for the defendant to sign the payment voucher, which instruction

Khoo complied with. This item is no longer in issue as at the trial, the defendant

conceded the claim. Consequently, by agreement between the parties, Khoo was not called to

testify.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(ii) <i>sum of US$31,367.36 paid on 5 August 1999</i> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Tang explained that this advance related to the first order from IEP.

The defendant had ordered key components from Mitsubishi for which he did not pay.

Instead, the defendant represented to Mitsubishi that the plaintiffs would make payment,

by a fax dated 18 June 1999, resulting in Mitsubishi amending their invoice to substitute

the plaintiffs' name for DSM's. Mitsubishi then looked to the plaintiffs for payment. When

Tang called the defendant on Mitsubishi's invoice to the plaintiffs, he was told that the

defendant was cash-strapped and the plaintiffs were requested to settle the said invoice

on the defendant's behalf. Consequently, the plaintiffs treated their payment to

Mitsubishi as a loan to the defendant.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(iii) cash of $10,000/- handed to the defendant in February 2000</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This amount was personally handed over by Tang to the defendant, at the

plaintiffs' office. Tang testified he remembered it clearly as it was the only time he had

handed cash to the defendant. Tang pointed out that the defendant's contention that the

plaintiffs' advances were investments in R&amp;D is not sustainable because the defendant

did not work exclusively for the plaintiffs. Moreover, the plaintiffs' agreement was with

the defendant personally, not with DSM or any of his other companies. Further, DSM had

design contracts with other companies (such as Toshiba Electronics).</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defendant's counterclaim</p>
<p align="justify">(a)    discounts </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.        Tang denied the

defendant/DSM had given discounts to the plaintiffs. On a few occasions when the defendant

indicated to Tang that he wanted to increase the price of micro-processor chips, Tang

requested him not to do so or, to moderate the increase so as not to affect the

plaintiffs' margin since, their prices to their customers were fixed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.        Similarly, Tang opined

that the defendant's claim for account of profits from the plaintiffs was baseless.

Indeed, it was the defendant who had to account to the plaintiffs for profits he had made

from selling television kits to the plaintiffs' customers.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(b)    loss of development fees </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.        The defendant had claimed

US$210,000 and US$90,000 for loss of the orders of IEP and Silk Road for 70,000 and 30,000

television kits respectively. Tang also questioned the bona fides of this claim; the

defendant had taken away IEP's business from the plaintiffs when there was an outstanding

order of 75,000 TV kits. As the letter of credit never came from IEP for this order, the

plaintiffs did not issue a purchase order for nor did the defendant develop, any kits for

this order. The same explanation applied to Silk Road; their order for 30,000 kits was

never formally placed with the plaintiffs and in turn with the defendant because, the

company's letter of credit (which covered an earlier completed order of 10,000 sets) had

lapsed by then. Similarly, the plaintiffs had never placed any order with the defendant as

shown in his offer sheet no. 0S2002HH. Indeed, Tang saw it for the first time in court. It

was also unlike the defendant not to have asked for advance payment from the plaintiffs

for this order. However, when he was cross-examined, it was put to Tang that the

plaintiffs had actually made an advance payment of US$25,500/- (see 2AB 250) on or about

18 February 2000, towards the aforesaid offer sheet.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(c)    account of profits </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.        Tang pointed that that

the profits due to the defendant had already been disbursed between the parties and

nothing more was due to the defendant, over and above the US$3/- he charged and which the

plaintiffs paid, for each component.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defendant's case</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.        I move now to consider

the defendant's testimony. Besides himself, the defendant called another witness, Ahmed

Ibrahim (Ibrahim) from IEP, for his case. By agreement between the parties, the calling of

defendant's third witness (Jeon Young Sek), was dispensed with, as the plaintiffs had

conceded the only fact stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief namely, that he

introduced IEP to the defendant sometime in July 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.        In his written testimony

(para 6), the defendant set out his own version of the terms of the verbal agreement he

had reached with Tang, these were:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the plaintiffs would provide the defendant with R&amp;D funding of

    S$50,000-$60,000 per month;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) in exchange for funding, the plaintiffs would be allowed to sell

    the TV kits to the plaintiffs'/the parties' customers;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the plaintiffs would purchase components for the TV kits based on

    a list provided by the defendant;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) DSM would charge a development fee of US$3/- per kit to cover

    DSM's operating costs such as staff salaries and other overheads;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) the plaintiffs would be responsible for sale logistics including

    packing, storage and shipping; </p>
<p align="justify">(vi) profits from sales of TV kits/components would be shared equally

    between the plaintiffs and DSM;</p>
<p align="justify">(vii) intellectual property rights arising from the R&amp;D would

    remain with the defendant.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.        The defendant claimed

that he, together with 3-4 other engineers often worked 12-13 hours per day developing the

micro-processors for the TV kits. He acknowledged that the plaintiffs made several

payments to him/his various companies some of which the plaintiffs requested him to repay

immediately. The defendant listed out (in para 11 of his affidavit) the dates and amounts

he/his companies had received from the plaintiffs, between 8 May 1998 until 25 May 2000.

He added that it was agreed between him and Tang that two (2) payments made by the

plaintiffs namely $60,000 (paid to Duplex in March 1999) and $51,890.19 (paid to DSM in

May 1999) would be set-off against DSM's invoice no. IC5T90004466 for US$101,890.18. The

set-offs formed part of the agreed facts between the parties before trial commenced. There

is therefore no need to dwell on the items further.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.        Other facts agreed

between the parties before trial commenced included the following:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the plaintiffs' purchase order no. HH/366/PO/10/00 dated 1 December

    2000 was cancelled on the invitation of the defendant;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) DSM issued a credit note no. CN-21003HH dated 19 June 2001 for the

    sum of U$166,342.90 in favour of the plaintiffs for the plaintiffs' cancelled purchase

    order;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the defendant/DSM did not issue any pro forma invoice for the

    plaintiffs' oral order of an additional 30,000 units of the same components ordered in

    their cancelled purchase order.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.        I turn now to the

defendant's testimony on the two (2) advances of the plaintiffs which remain disputed:-</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i)    $10,000 cash in February 2000 </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In his written testimony, the defendant merely deposed that to the best

of his knowledge and recollection, the plaintiffs never made this payment either to him or

to DSM. Cross-examined (N/E17), he maintained he could not recall receiving the money at

Tang's office; he had 'no idea'. It was pointed out to the defendant by counsel for the

plaintiffs that, after disputing (in his pleadings and affidavit evidence) receiving cash

of $20,000 from the plaintiffs in October 1998, the defendant did a <i>volte face</i> and

instructed his lawyers to admit to the claim in October 2002. Consequently, counsel

questioned the defendant whether the same could be said of this loan - it was extended to

the defendant but he had no recollection of it. No satisfactory answer was given by the

defendant in this regard.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(ii)    payment to Mitsubishi of US$31,367.36</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In para 15 of his affidavit, the defendant had this to say of the

claim:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">I confirm that the plaintiffs had paid for the

    electronic components on DSM's behalf. However this formed part of the plaintiffs' funding

    of the R&amp;D works. Further or in the alternative, I am liable to pay the said sum in

    light of my defence of set-off and counterclaim a set out below, I will elaborate on them

    in greater detail below. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Such a confusing statement is no answer to the plaintiffs' claim on its

merits. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.        Although he repeatedly

maintained that the sums paid to him periodically by the plaintiffs were for R&amp;D

funding (save for 6 items), the defendant testified that he nevertheless returned

US$331,890.18 and S$10,000 to the plaintiffs, because Tang requested him to do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.        The defendant admitted

under cross-examination that he charged the plaintiffs more than US$3/- per TV kit. In

this regard, reference was made to the plaintiffs' purchase order no. HH/PO/10/00 dated 20

October 2000 (1AB197) wherein the defendant charged the plaintiffs US$3.65 per chip

whereas his purchase price from Mitsubishi was US$2.75 (see 3AB18). He admitted his profit

in actual fact was about US$4.86 per TV kit. However, he denied counsel's suggestion that

his profits from the plaintiffs were between US$663,390 and US$799,890 (see 1AB197A) from

such mark-ups. He defended his mark-up on the basis that heavy investment was required for

his/his company's R&amp;D. He also asserted that the aforesaid purchase order was for a

micro-processor different from others he had developed for the plaintiffs earlier. No

evidence was produced to substantiate this contention. Based on US$3 per kit, the

defendant conceded his profit could be about US$409,500, based on the total number

(136,500) of micro-processors he supplied to the plaintiffs throughout their relationship.

However, the defendant pointed out that the sum had to be divided by 37 months, which

meant the monthly profit was only $11,067.57. The figure of US$409,500 should be

contrasted with the plaintiffs' profit which, calculated at US$2/- per kit based on Tang's

and Shirley's unchallenged testimony, would amount to US$273,000; this approximates ? of

the profits made by the defendant, who unlike the plaintiffs, did not have to bear any of

the attendant commercial risks.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.        No documents were

produced in court to show that the defendant had even once asked the plaintiffs for an

account of his 50% share of profits before he filed his counterclaim; neither was it

stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Even so, the defendant insisted he had

repeatedly asked Tang orally but to no avail; Tang's excuse to him was that the profits

were not high, the plaintiffs were in financial difficulties and, the profits were needed

to cover the plaintiffs' expenses.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.        The defendant did not

deny selling micro-processors direct to IEP. This was also confirmed by IEP's

representative (Ibrahim) who testified. However, he denied it was part of the agreement

between himself and the plaintiffs that he could not sell direct to IEP or to any of the

plaintiffs' other customers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45.        Although he acknowledged

cancelling the plaintiffs' purchase order HH366/PO/10/00 by DSM's credit note no. 21003HH,

the defendant contended that DSM was still keeping the goods under the cancelled purchase

order. He denied he cancelled the plaintiffs' order because he was unable to fulfil the

order, due to these remarks in the said credit note: </p>
<font size="3" xmlns=""><i>
<p align="center">'The good are not able to be delivery'</p></i></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The defendant claimed to have placed orders with suppliers for

components based on the cancelled purchase order, referring to his purchase order to

Mitsubishi dated 23 October 2000 (at 3AB18). However, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed

out that the plaintiffs' said purchase order <u>came later</u> (1 December 2000). The

defendant explained the discrepancy by saying (N/E 47) that was how business was done

– he would normally pre-order as he was aware of the plaintiffs' requirements,

despite the financial risks involved. Time was also needed to source for what they wanted.

For the same reason, the defendant pre-ordered components for the plaintiffs' tentative

order (which did not materialise), of 30,000 TV kits from Silk Road. Such pre-orders,

placed months in advance of the plaintiffs' purchase orders (see 3AB9) resulted in his

claim of US$460,198.85. I did not find the defendant's explanation at all convincing not

to mention that before the plaintiffs' writ of summons was filed, he had never once

broached this claim with them. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46.        In relation to his

alleged discounts to the plaintiffs, for which he counter-claimed US$177,456.52, the

defendant admitted under cross-examination (N/E 82) that his invoices did not reflect such

discounts; neither were there any other documents which recorded the discounts, nor was

there any agreement between himself and the plaintiffs that, the discounts were to be

repaid to him. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47.        It was not easy to

understand the defendant's evidence which was translated from the Korean language; his

attempts to speak in English did not help. His recollection of events and dates was also

poor. At times, his oral testimony contradicted either his own affidavit or the documents

in court, as exemplified in the preceding paragraph; in those instances he would resort to

oral orders from the plaintiffs or verbal agreements reached with Tang, to explain the

discrepancy. At other times, his oral evidence was something new; it was either not

pleaded in his defence/counterclaim or not reflected in his written testimony. Further,

both from his pleadings and from his testimony (oral and written), it was clear that the

defendant made and could see, no distinction between himself and his companies (including

DSM) when it came to advances taken from and dealings with, the plaintiffs. The advances

he took were either for his own purposes or for his company, depending on the need.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48.        As earlier stated (para

36), the defendant's (only) other witness was Ibrahim (DW2), the custom clearance

department manage of IEP. Ibrahim corroborated the defendant's claim that the defendant

was instrumental in introducing the plaintiffs to IEP. He also supported the defendant's

claim that the plaintiffs lost IEP as a customer because of poor service. Ibrahim

complained there were late shipments or partial deliveries from the plaintiffs, resulting

in the stoppage of production of TV sets by IEP and causing the latter to lose potential

sales of approximately 75,000 TV sets in the second half of 2000. Further, due to

inaccurate shipping documents, IEP had to pay double (import) taxes in many instances,

referring to specific bills of lading as examples. Notwithstanding IEP's complaints,

Ibrahim alleged that the plaintiffs did nothing to address the problems. As a result, IEP

decided to cease business with the plaintiffs and instead dealt with DSM direct, with

whose services IEP was happy. Under cross-examination, Ibrahim agreed that while he was

aware of the delay in the plaintiffs' shipment, he did not know the reasons therefor nor

who was responsible either for the delay or the short-shipments. Consequently, his

testimony did not help to advance the defendant's case. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49.        It would be appropriate

at this juncture to refer to the plaintiffs' version of the reasons for the delay and

short shipments to IEP. Tang had testified (N/E22) it was impossible to fulfil IEP's order

within the 45 days stipulated under their letters of credit, because the plaintiffs had to

buy components from 20-50 suppliers, bearing in mind they had to depend on the defendant

to first come up with the buying list. In such cases, the plaintiffs would ask IEP to

extend the expiry dates of the letters of credit issued to the plaintiffs, at the latter's

cost. If for one example, IEP decided to change the picture tube, it necessitated the

plaintiffs starting all over again to source for parts, causing an inevitable delay.

Further, it was impossible to count each and every component packed for shipment. If IEP

complained of short shipment of any parts, the plaintiffs accepted the complaint at face

value and would ship the short-supplied components (at their own cost) to IEP

subsequently, resulting again in delay. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50.        Shirley also dealt with

the issue of delay in her testimony. In her affidavit (paras 30-50), she deposed that the

fault largely lay with the defendant. She identified three (3) purchase orders of the

plaintiffs namely, HH55/PO/3/2000, HH65/PO/3/200 and HH/86/PO/3/2000 as examples. The

defendant was paid in advance as he had requested but, although he issued an invoice

(0005/1042/HHPL) and delivery order (0005/1042/HHPL) giving a delivery date of 6 May 2000,

he did not meet the deadline. Instead, deliveries for these orders were only made on 19

May, 31 May and 12 July 2000. Indeed for one micro-processor DSM 225-050SP, the 10,000

units ordered were not delivered until October 2000, after confirmation by IEP on 24 July

2000; the defendant did not deny this allegation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51.        Shirley alleged that at

other times, the defendant made mistakes either in the components the plaintiffs needed to

procure or, in the pricing. She said the resultant to-ing and fro-ing between the

plaintiffs, the defendant and suppliers was very time-consuming. Further, 1999-2000 was a

supplier's market which meant that changes to components list caused further delays in

getting the components from suppliers, who were all overloaded and could not cope, with

orders. For all the problems the plaintiffs encountered with the components list, the

plaintiffs' expected profit of US$5/- per chassis never materialised, it was less than

US$2/-.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52.        With regard to IEP's

complaint of paying double import duties, Shirley explained that because of delay on the

part of the defendant, the plaintiffs decided on one occasion to ship the bulk of the

components first (for an order for 18,000 sets), before expiry of IEP's letter of credit,

whilst waiting for the remaining items to be supplied. She understood from IEP

subsequently that the plaintiffs' shipment posed problems with the Egyptian customs

authorities. She blamed the defendant and said IEP was aware that the fault did not lie

with the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53.        Shirley deposed in her

affidavit that the defendant lost interest in the joint business with the plaintiffs and

it became increasingly difficult to contact him; the defendant would push responsibilities

to his engineer H W Lee. He would not assist the plaintiffs even where he or his engineer

committed errors although he continued to demand and to receive, advance payment from them

for his purchase of components made on the plaintiffs' behalf.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The findings </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54.        I have set out in the

preceding paragraphs the sum total of the testimony adduced from the four (4) witnesses

who testified. Arising therefrom, I have arrived at the findings set out in the following

paragraphs. I start by saying that I much prefer the testimony of the plaintiffs as given

by the two (2) Tang siblings, as opposed to the defendant's. I have no doubt that Tang and

his sister Shirley were truthful in their testimony. Earlier (para 47), I had made certain

observations on the defendant's testimony. I now add one further adverse comment to those

observations -- the defendant did not come across as either convincing or truthful.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs claim</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55.        On a preponderance of the

evidence adduced, I find that the plaintiffs have discharged the burden and proved that,

the advances they made to the defendant and or DSM from time to time were not and could

not have been for purposes of R&amp;D. Details of the loans were set out in Shirley's

affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Counsel's cross-examination of her did not cast doubt on

any of the figures. In reality, the plaintiffs made the loans to accede to the defendant's

demand that they not he, bear the cost of components the defendant had to procure in order

to develop the micro-processor the plaintiffs needed for the TV kits, well <u>before</u>

the defendant invoiced them. The monies advanced could not have been for R&amp;D as the

defendant claimed since, he repaid a large part thereof, which evidence he did not deny.

The defendant's explanation that he refunded the loans at Tang's request is incredible. If

indeed they were payments for R&amp;D, he was <u>not at all obliged</u> to repay the sums,

regardless of what demands the plaintiffs/Tang made and the reasons therefor.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56.        On the first disputed

loan, the documents (including the defendant's own fax dated 18 June 1999 to Mitsubishi at

1AB47) proved that the plaintiffs paid on the defendant's behalf in August 1999, the sum

of US$31,367.36 which he owed to Mitsubishi. In any event, the defendant did not put

forward any credible defence (save on the question of set-off) to this claim. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57.        As for the second

disputed loan, I also find on a balance of probabilities, that Tang did hand cash of

S$10,000 to the defendant in February 2000; again the defendant's testimony (that he could

not recall this loan) was unconvincing. Consequently, I award the plaintiffs judgment for

the total outstanding sums of US$156,367.37 and S$110,000, with interest at 6% from date

of the writ (2 April 2002) until date of this judgment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58.        Turning next to the

plaintiffs' other claim for an account of profits, I entertain little doubt that the

defendant deliberately went out of his way to cut them out from further dealings with IEP

(which he had introduced to the plaintiffs), resulting in their losing the company's

outstanding order for 75,000 units of TV kits, which he then supplied. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59.        Where IEP is concerned,

it would not matter whether it was the understanding between the parties that the

defendant would not approach the plaintiffs' customers direct. I find that the defendant

took away the plaintiffs' order of 75,000 TV kits units. It is also my view that it must

be an implied term in the agreement between the parties based on <i>The Moorcock</i> test

that, the defendant would not approach let alone 'poach', the plaintiffs' customers. What

the defendant did was reprehensible, his conduct reflecting him as a person without morals

or scruples. Accordingly, the defendant must account to the plaintiffs for the profits he

made in fulfilling IEP's order(s) and orders placed by Silk Road Manufacturing, if any.

The Registrar shall hold an inquiry in that regard and the costs of such inquiry shall be

reserved to the Registrar.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defendant's counterclaim </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60.        The defendant's claim for

discounts is clearly unsustainable, in the light of his own admissions under

cross-examination, as set out in para 46 above.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61.        As for the defendant's

other claims:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) share of profits arising from plaintiffs' sale of TV kits —

    apart from his bare assertion (which I do not believe), the defendant had no evidence to

    support this claim. The parties' course of dealings certainly did not suggest any profit

    -sharing arrangements, bearing in mind that the agreement did not constitute a

    partnership;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) loss of US$300,000 development fees — this claim is

    completely unfounded. The defendant did not produce one iota of evidence in support

    thereof. It was Tang's testimony which I accept, that if the plaintiffs did not fulfil a

    customer's order, then no development charge was payable to the defendant. Considering it

    was his own conduct which caused the plaintiffs to lose the outstanding order of 75,000

    (not 70,000) TV kits from IEP, the defendant had the gall to claim US$210,000 relating to

    the unfulfilled order. Similarly, his claim for US$90,000 relating to Silk Road's

    purported order is also dismissed;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) claim for US$460,198.85 for cost of components ordered by the

    plaintiffs — it was part of the agreed facts between the parties when trial

    commenced, that the plaintiffs' purchase order no. HH/366/PO/10/00 had been cancelled <u>at

    the invitation of the defendant</u> and the defendant then issued credit note no.

    CN21003HH in the plaintiffs' favour for the cancelled order. How then can he mount this

    claim? The fact that the defendant's closing submissions did not address this claim

    reinforces my finding.</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) DSM's offer sheet no. 0S2002HH for US$43,775 — this claim is

    equally unmeritorious and is hereby dismissed. I believe Tang's testimony that he/the

    plaintiffs had not seen this document before the trial; it was concocted by the defendant.

    I had pointed out to counsel for the defendant (N/E 85) that it was illogical to suggest

    to Tang (para 21 <i>supra</i>) that the plaintiffs had made a <u>second</u> part-payment

    of US$25,500 towards this offer sheet, when the plaintiffs never made a <u>first</u>

    part-payment at all. Apart from counsel's suggestion to Tang, no evidence was adduced from

    the defendant to connect DSM's invoice DI-2008HH (at 2AB250) for US$25,500 to this offer

    sheet. Further, no evidence was tendered to prove the plaintiffs' payment of the invoice.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In contrast to the plaintiffs, the defendant did not, prior to the

commencement of these proceedings, make any demand of the plaintiffs for any item he now

counterclaims. Such omission lends credence to my belief that his claims are false.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i>Conclusion</i> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62.        Accordingly, there will

be judgment for the plaintiffs as claimed with costs to be taxed on the standard basis,

unless otherwise agreed. The defendant's counterclaim is dismissed with costs.</p>
