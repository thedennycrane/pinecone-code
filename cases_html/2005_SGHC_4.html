<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1<span>         </span> 
On 9 May 1994 at about 6.30am, Henry Adolphus Lassiter (“HAL”) was crossing 
the junction of Stevens Road/Scotts Road from Draycott Drive when a motor 
vehicle driven by the defendant, To Keng Lam (alias Jeanette Toh) (“the 
Driver”), collided with him. As a result, HAL was killed. He was 48 years old 
then. He left behind his widow, Ann Masters Lassiter (“AML”), who was also 48 
years old then and four daughters. On 5 May 1997, AML filed an action in 
the High Court for her own benefit and the benefit of other dependants of HAL. 
Consent judgment was subsequently entered against the Driver on the basis of 45% 
liability, with 55% liability attributed to HAL.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span>         </span> 
AML claimed the following:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> Loss of 
inheritance;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> Loss of 
support;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> 
Professional fees for post-mortem estate planning;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span>       </span> Various 
other items as special damages; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e)<span>       </span> Damages 
for loss of bereavement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span>         </span> 
The assessment of damages was heard before an assistant registrar (“AR”) between 
28 February to 28 June 2002. The claims for loss of inheritance and 
loss of support were restricted by AML to claims for AML alone, <i>ie</i> 
excluding the daughters. On 29 June 2002, the AR delivered a written 
judgment. The AR decided as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> The claim 
for loss of inheritance was dismissed;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> The claim 
for loss of support (which the AR referred to as a claim for loss of dependency) 
was assessed at US$130,000 per annum x eight years = US$1,040,000;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> The claim 
for professional fees for post-mortem estate planning was dismissed;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span>       </span> Most of 
the various items claimed as special damages were allowed;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e)<span>       </span> The 
damages for bereavement were allowed at $10,000.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span>         </span> 
The AR also made an award on costs although counsel for both sides had asked him 
to defer his decision on costs for the time being.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span>         </span> 
The Driver filed an appeal, being Registrar’s Appeal No 600066 of 2002, 
against the AR’s decision in respect of the loss of support and on costs. AML 
also filed an appeal, being Registrar’s Appeal No 600067 of 2002 against 
the AR’s decision in respect of the following:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> Loss of 
inheritance;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> Loss of 
support;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> 
Professional fees for post-mortem estate planning; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span>       </span> Damages 
which were not allowed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span>         </span> 
Both appeals were heard by me and I now set out my decision and reasons. I would 
also mention that at the outset, Mr Michael Hwang SC, counsel for AML, 
said that there was no claim for dependency for the daughters under AML’s 
appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Loss of 
inheritance</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span>         </span> 
As I mentioned, AML made a claim for loss of inheritance. She was the main 
beneficiary under HAL’s will. HAL was an entrepreneur who, it was alleged, 
preferred to put most of the profits he made back into his businesses rather 
than have a higher earned income. Mr Hwang used the term “loss of 
inheritance” and “loss of savings” interchangeably and Mr Quentin 
Loh SC, counsel for the Driver, proceeded along those lines as well. It 
seems to me that “loss of inheritance” is not necessarily the same as “loss of 
savings” and I shall elaborate on this later. The claim for loss of inheritance 
was the largest head of claim. It was also the most contentious both on the law 
and on the facts. I will deal with the law first.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>The 
law</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span>         </span> 
Mr Loh submitted that the claim for loss of inheritance was part of a claim 
for lost years by an estate and that the estate’s claim for lost years was 
abolished in Singapore in 1987. That was why AML made the claim for loss of 
inheritance under a dependency claim. Mr Loh also submitted that a claim 
for loss of inheritance was not maintainable under a dependency 
claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span>         </span> 
Mr Hwang accepted that an estate’s claim for lost years was abolished in 
Singapore in 1987. However, he submitted that a claim for loss of inheritance 
was maintainable under a dependency claim in any event.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span>       </span> As HAL died 
on 9 May 1994, the applicable legislation is the Civil Law Act 
(Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed) and not the 1999 Revised Edition. The relevant 
sections are ss 7, 12 and 14, and I set out below the relevant provisions 
thereof:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7.—(1) Subject to this section, on 
the death of any person, all causes of action subsisting against or vested in 
him shall survive against, or, as the case may be, for the benefit of his 
estate:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Provided that this subsection shall not 
apply to causes of action for defamation or seduction or for inducing one spouse 
to leave or remain apart from the other or to any claim for damages on the 
ground of adultery.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(2)<span>       </span> Where a 
cause of action survives as aforesaid for the benefit of the estate of a 
deceased person, the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate of that 
person –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> shall not 
include –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(i) any exemplary damages; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii) any damages for loss of income in 
respect of any period after that person’s death;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> 
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c) 
<span>      </span> where the death of that person 
has been caused by the act or omission which gives rise to the cause of action, 
shall be calculated without reference to any loss or gain to his estate 
consequent on his death except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses may be 
included.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(3) 
<span>      </span> …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(4) 
<span>      </span> The rights conferred by this 
section for the benefit of the estates of deceased persons shall be in addition 
to and not in derogation of any rights conferred on the dependants of deceased 
persons by section 12 and so much of this section as relates to causes of action 
against the estates of deceased persons shall apply in relation to causes of 
action under that section as applies in relation to other causes of action not 
expressly excepted from the operation of subsection (1).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(5) 
<span>      </span> …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12.—(1) If death is caused by any 
wrongful act, neglect or default which is such as would (if death has not 
ensued) have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover 
damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable if death had 
not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death 
of the person injured.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(2) 
<span>      </span> Subject to section 13(2), 
every such action shall be for the benefit of the dependants of the person 
(referred to in this section and in sections 13 and 14 as the deceased) 
whose death has been so caused.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(8) 
<span>      </span> In this section, “dependant” 
means –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a) 
<span>      </span> the wife or husband of the 
deceased;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b) 
<span>      </span> any parent, grandparent or 
great-grandparent of the deceased;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c) 
<span>      </span> any child, grandchild or 
great-grandchild of the deceased;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d) 
<span>      </span> any person (not being a child 
of the deceased) who, in the case of any marriage to which the deceased was at 
any time a party, was treated by the deceased as a child of the family in 
relation to that marriage;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e) 
<span>      </span> any person who is, or is the 
issue of, a brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the deceased.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14.—(1) In every action brought 
under section 12, the court may award such damages as are proportioned to 
the losses resulting from the death to the dependants respectively except that 
in assessing the damages there shall not be taken into account –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> any sum 
paid or payable on the death of the deceased under any contract of assurance or 
insurance;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b) 
<span>      </span> any sum payable as a result of 
the death under the Central Provident Fund Act; or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c) 
<span>      </span> any pension or gratuity which 
has been or will or may be paid as a result of the death.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(2)<span>       </span> 
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(3)<span>       </span> In an 
action brought under section 12 where there fall to be assessed damages payable 
to a widow in respect of the death of her husband, there shall not be taken into 
account the remarriage of the widow or her prospect of remarriage.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(4)<span>       </span> If the 
dependants have incurred funeral expenses in respect of the deceased, damages 
may be awarded in respect of those expenses.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span>       </span> As can be 
seen, s 7(2)(a)(ii) excludes an estate’s claim for damages for loss of 
income in respect of any period after the death of the victim. For completeness, 
I would add that s 8 abolished the right to damages for loss of expectation 
of life except for one qualification which is unnecessary for me to 
mention.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12<span>       </span> It is 
necessary to go into some detail of the history of the legislation and cases of 
fatal accidents. I will focus first on the English position as Singapore 
legislation on fatal accidents has followed English legislation closely most of 
the time.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13<span>       </span> Under the 
common law, a personal action did not survive a person’s death. This was 
considered to be unsatisfactory with the industrial revolution and the use of 
trains and later, motor vehicles. In England in 1846, Lord Campbell’s Act 
(the Fatal Accidents Act) was passed to allow claims to be made for the death of 
the victim for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the victim. 
Although there was no reference to dependants, Lord Campbell’s Act was 
considered to be for the benefit of dependants and not the estate. Since then, 
there have been various legislation affecting such claims, for example, the 
Fatal Accidents Act 1864, the Fatal Accidents Act 1959 and the Fatal 
Accidents Act 1976.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14<span>       </span> In the 
meantime, the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 was passed in 
England. It provided that a cause of action survived a person’s death for the 
benefit of his estate, subject to some exceptions which are immaterial for 
present purposes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15<span>       </span> Prior to 
1978, where a person’s death was caused by the negligence of another person, the 
wrongdoer was liable to compensate the deceased’s estate for loss of expectation 
of life but not for loss of future earnings. Secondly, the wrongdoer was also 
liable to compensate the dependants of the deceased for their loss of support 
which was known as a dependency claim or a loss of dependency. This claim would 
be derived from but was not equivalent to the deceased’s loss of future 
earnings. Thirdly, the wrongdoer was liable to compensate any person or the 
deceased’s estate for any additional disbursements incurred on account of the 
accident. However, the law on this began to change in 1978.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16<span>       </span> In 
<i>Pickett v British Rail Engineering Ltd</i> [1979] 1 All ER 774 
(“<i>Pickett</i>”), a healthy 53-year-old man could have worked all the way 
until the retirement age of 65. However, due to exposure to asbestos, his life 
expectancy was cut short to just one year. He sued for the loss of expectation 
of his life and for the loss of future earnings for that one year. Liability was 
not denied. The defendants only challenged the claim on the question of quantum. 
The trial judge allowed the claim for loss of expectation of life but only 
awarded him damages for loss of earnings during the one-year period that he was 
expected to survive. The plaintiff appealed. He died before the matter reached 
the Court of Appeal. His widow took over the action as the administratrix of his 
estate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17<span>       </span> The Court 
of Appeal did not award any sum for loss of earnings beyond the actual survival 
period. The administratrix appealed to the House of Lords contending that a much 
larger amount ought to have been awarded in respect of loss of future 
earnings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18<span>       </span> A majority 
of the House of Lords allowed her appeal. They allowed the claim for loss of 
earnings during the deceased’s lifetime rather than the shortened span of his 
life. What weighed heavily on the minds of the Law Lords there was the fact that 
had they not allowed the appeal, the widow would be left with no recourse or 
claim for her loss of dependency.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19<span>       </span> 
Lord Wilberforce said at 778:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This creates a difficulty. It is assumed 
in the present case, and the assumption is supported by authority, that if an 
action for damages is brought by the victim during his lifetime, and either 
proceeds to judgment or is settled, further proceedings cannot be brought after 
his death under the Fatal Accidents Acts. If this assumption is correct, it 
provides a basis, in logic and justice, for allowing the victim to recover for 
earnings lost during his lost years.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This assumption is based on the wording 
of s 1 of the 1846 Act (now s 1 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976) and 
is not supported by any decision of this House. It cannot however be challenged 
in this appeal, since there is before us no claim under the Fatal Accident Acts. 
I think, therefore, that we must for present purposes act on the basis that it 
is well founded, and that if the present claim, in respect of earnings during 
the lost years, fails it will not be possible for a fresh action to be brought 
by the deceased’s dependants in relation to them.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20<span>       </span> He 
continued at 781:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">My Lords, in the case of the adult wage 
earner with or without dependants who sues for damages during his lifetime, I am 
convinced that a rule which enables the ‘lost years’ to be taken account of 
comes closer to the ordinary man’s expectations than one which limits his 
interest to his shortened span of life. The interest which such a man has in the 
earnings he might hope to make over a normal life, if not saleable in a market, 
has a value which can be assessed. A man who receives that assessed value would 
surely consider himself and be considered compensated; a man denied it would 
not. And I do not think that to act in this way creates insoluble problems of 
assessment in other cases. In that of a young child (cf <i>Benham v 
Gambling</i>) neither present nor future earnings could enter into the matter; 
in the more difficult case of adolescents just embarking on the process of 
earning (cf <i>Skelton v Collins</i>) the value of ‘lost’ earnings might be real 
but would probably be assessable as small.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">There will remain some difficulties. In 
cases, probably the normal, where a man’s actual dependants coincide with those 
for whom he provides out of the damages he receives, whatever they obtain by 
inheritance will simply be set off against their own claim. If on the other hand 
this coincidence is lacking, there might be duplication of recovery. To that 
extent injustice may be caused to the wrongdoer. But if there is a choice 
between taking a view of the law which mitigates a clear and recognised 
injustice in cases of normal occurrence, at the cost of the possibility in fewer 
cases of excess payments being made, or leaving the law as it is, I think that 
our duty is clear. We should carry the judicial process of seeking a just 
principle as far as we can, confident that a wise legislator will correct 
resultant anomalies.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">21<span>       </span> In 
<i>Pickett</i>, the victim himself had commenced action and obtained judgment 
before he died. However, in <i>Gammell v Wilson</i> [1981] 1 All ER 578 
(“<i>Gammell</i>”), two claims for loss of future earnings were allowed in cases 
where the plaintiffs, in two separate actions, were the parents of two young men 
who had been killed in accidents as a result of the negligence of the respective 
defendants. The claims were made under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 in the first 
case, and the Fatal Accidents Acts 1846 to 1959 in the second case, by the 
plaintiffs on behalf of themselves as dependants and on behalf of the estate of 
the deceased under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (the “1934 
Act”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">22<span>       </span> At the 
hearing of the appeals before the House of Lords, the defendants contended that 
under the 1934 Act, a deceased’s estate was not entitled to recover damages for 
loss of future earnings because the cause of action for such earnings was a 
“gain to the estate” while the loss of earnings was a “loss to the estate”, and 
that in accordance with s 1(2)(c) of the 1934 Act, damages under the 1934 
Act were to be calculated without reference to any loss or gain to the estate 
consequent on the victim’s death. The appeals were dismissed by a majority of 
the House of Lords on the basis that the right to recover damages for loss of 
future earnings vested in the deceased immediately before his death, and not on 
his death, and the right passed to his beneficiaries whether they were his 
dependants or not. Section 1(2)(c) of the 1934 Act is <i>in</i> <i>pari 
materia</i> with s 7(2)(c) of the Civil Law Act. Paragraph (1) of the 
headnote of the report states, <i>inter alia</i>:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Accordingly, even though it produced a 
result which was neither sensible nor just, the House was constrained to hold 
that the plaintiffs were entitled to the damages awarded for the lost years 
despite the fact that those damages far exceeded the amount to which they were 
entitled under the 1976 Act as dependants.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">23<span>       </span> 
Lord Diplock said at 583:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">If the deceased [in <i>Pickett</i>] had 
died before judgment in his action had been entered his widow would have had her 
cause of action under the Fatal Accidents Acts. This would have enabled her to 
recover the value of the provision that he would have made for her needs out of 
his earnings during those 11 ‘lost years’. But because he died after the 
judgment his dependent widow was deprived of that cause of action, and the 
general damages for pain and suffering recoverable on behalf of his estate, of 
which she was the sole beneficiary, fell considerably short of the sum that she 
would have been likely to recover under the Fatal Accidents Acts as the amount 
of the dependency if that cause of action had remained open to her.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Here was an obvious injustice which this 
House remedied by overruling <i>Oliver v Ashman</i> and holding that a living 
plaintiff could recover damages for loss of earnings during the lost years, but 
that in assessing the measure of such damages there should be deducted from the 
total earnings the amount that he would have spent out of those earnings on his 
own living expenses and pleasures since these would represent an expense that 
would be saved in consequence of his death. In the case of a married man of 
middle age and of a settled pattern of life, which was the case of 
Mr Pickett, the effect of this deduction is to leave a net figure which 
represents the amount which he would have spent on providing for his wife and 
any other dependants, <i>together with any savings</i> that he might have set 
aside out of his income. <i>If one ignores the savings element, which in most 
cases would be likely to be small, this net figure is substantially the same as 
the damages that would have been recoverable by the widow under the Fatal 
Accidents Acts: it represents the dependency</i>. So, in the particular case of 
Mr Pickett’s widow the result was to do substantial justice.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">My Lords, if the only victims of fatal 
accidents were middle-aged married men in steady employment living their lives 
according to a well-settled pattern that would have been unlikely to change if 
they had lived on uninjured, the assessment of damages for loss of earnings 
during the lost years may not involve what can only be matters of purest 
speculation. But, as the instant appeals demonstrates and so do other unreported 
cases which have been drawn to the attention of this House, in cases where there 
is no such settled pattern (and this must be so in a high proportion of cases of 
fatal injuries) the judge is faced with a task that is so purely one of 
guesswork that it is not susceptible of solution by the judicial process. 
Guesses by different judges are likely to differ widely, yet no one can say that 
one is right and another wrong.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Where Parliament has intervened by 
passing the Fatal Accidents Acts, the law relating to damages for death 
recoverable by dependants is sensible and just with the possible exception of 
the case of widows who have remarried or become engaged to do so by the time the 
action is heard. I join with your Lordships in thinking that it is too late for 
anything short of legislation to bring the like sense and justice to the law 
relating to damages for death recoverable by the estate of the 
deceased.</span></p>

Lord Fraser of Tullybelton said at 588:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It is, no doubt, just and sensible that, 
where the death of the family breadwinner is caused by the negligence of some 
other person, that person should be liable to compensate the deceased’s 
dependants for the injury which they have suffered from the death. The main 
element of injury <i>will normally be loss of support. Such compensation is 
provided for by the Fatal Accidents Act 1976</i>. But it seems to me difficult 
to justify a law whereby the deceased’s estate, which may pass to persons or 
institutions in no way dependent on him for support, can recover damages for 
loss of earnings, or other income, which he would probably have received during 
the ‘lost years’. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25<span>       </span> I have 
cited the above judgments not only to emphasise the point about the injustice of 
double recovery but because the judgments indicated that in England, loss of 
savings is not part of a dependency claim. I will come back to this point 
again.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">26<span>       </span> After the 
decision in <i>Gammell</i>, the UK Parliament passed the Administration of

<i>Gammell</i> was followed reluctantly by the Singapore Court of Appeal in 
<i>Low Kok Tong v Teo Chan Pan</i> [1982–1983] SLR 346 (“<i>Low Kok 
Tong</i>”) where the claim was made under s 8 of the Civil Law Act 
(Cap 30, 1970 Rev Ed) before the amendments in 1987. Lai Kew 
Chai J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at 350, 
[14]-[15]:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">We have, however, considered it necessary 
to state at the end of this judgment that the effect of our decision, 
reluctantly arrived at, could give rise to some undesirable consequences. It 
could be questioned with some justification why persons other than the actual 
dependants of a deceased should be unjustly enriched by an award to the estate 
for the ‘lost years’. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">… It is the province of our legislature 
to reform the law.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">28<span>       </span> Following 
the amendments in England by the 1982 Act and <i>Low Kok Tong</i>, Singapore 
similarly amended its legislation in 1987 so that an estate of a deceased person 
was disallowed from claiming damages for loss of income for the lost 
years.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">29<span>       </span> In 
Parliament, the then Second Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar, said 
on 4 March 1987 (<i>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</i> 
vol 49 at cols 66–69):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This Bill will make certain reforms to 
the law relating to damages payable in cases of fatal accidents. This is 
necessary because of a change in the law brought about by a judicial decision in 
the United Kingdom House of Lords in 1981. Similar amendments have been made to 
the laws of other countries such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Before 1981, when a person died in a 
fatal accident caused by the negligent act of another person, the wrongdoer was 
liable to compensate –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">First, the deceased’s estate for the 
deceased’s loss of expectation of life;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Secondly, to compensate the dependants of 
the deceased for the loss sustained by them on account of his death, what is 
known as “loss of dependency” claim; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Thirdly, any additional disbursements 
incurred by any person or the deceased’s estate on account of the 
accident.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The income which the deceased would have 
earned had he not died was not a part of the damages payable by the wrongdoer. 
In other words, damages for what is known in the legal jargon as the “lost 
years” could not be claimed by the deceased’s estate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">However, the law on this was changed in 
1981 when the United Kingdom House of Lords decided the case known as <i>Gammell 
v Wilson</i>. The House of Lords in that case decided that damages for the “lost 
years” could be claimed by the estate of a person killed in a fatal 
accident.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">That case was followed by our Court of 
Appeal in 1982 because it was based on the interpretation of a United Kingdom 
statutory provision which is similar in all respects to section 8(2) of our 
Civil Law Act.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Certain undesirable consequences may 
arise from this changed state of the law:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">First, double compensation may be payable 
in cases where the deceased’s dependants are not also beneficiaries of the 
deceased’s estate. The wrongdoer may have to pay damages to both the deceased’s 
estate for “lost years” and to his dependants for their “loss of dependency”, a 
result which surely cannot be acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Secondly, where the deceased has no 
dependants, other persons, eg, distant relatives, may receive a “windfall” and 
be unjustly enriched by such an award.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Thirdly, the estate claim for the “lost 
years” is often higher than the “loss of dependency” claim. In some cases, 
dependants may obtain damages which are more than their actual loss of 
dependency. Such cases include cases where the dependants are already elderly 
and are likely to have died before the deceased person had he not met with a 
premature death in an accident.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Sir, the need to reform this 
unsatisfactory state of the law was recognized by the House of Lords in the case 
of Gammell itself. Nearly all the judges in Gammell’s case called for 
legislative intervention. So too in our own Court of Appeal, quote 
Mr Justice Lai who called for reform, “It is in the province of our 
legislature to reform the law.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The third amendment, as mentioned, Sir, 
the dependants of the deceased person can always claim for loss of dependency. 
However, at present the law recognizes only a few categories of persons as 
dependants for this purpose. Only the spouse, parent, grandparent, child, 
stepchild and grandchild of the deceased are eligible to claim for loss of 
dependency. Under our existing law, other relatives who are actually dependent 
on the deceased but who do not fall within these narrow categories cannot claim 
for loss of dependency, eg brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces. In order to 
prevent undue hardship or injustice, the Bill seeks to extend the categories of 
dependants to also include –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> brother, 
sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece and first cousin of the deceased.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> child 
treated by the deceased and his wife as a child of their family;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> 
great-grandchildren or great-grandparent of the deceased.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">I need to add, Sir, that to succeed in 
any such claim for dependency a person must not only fall within the categories 
of dependency which we have now enlarged, but must also be able to prove to the 
court that he was actually financially dependent on the deceased 
person.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">30<span>       </span> 
Mr Hwang submitted that allowing AML to claim for loss of inheritance under 
a dependency claim would not cause any of the three undesirable consequences 
mentioned by Prof Jayakumar. Firstly, there would be no double 
compensation. Secondly, there would be no unjust enrichment as a person like AML 
would have to qualify as a dependant first. Thirdly, since the estate claim for 
lost years was abolished, there was no question of aged dependants getting more 
than their actual dependency. They would not be entitled to claim for loss of 
savings even on a dependency claim as they would in the ordinary course of 
events have passed away before the deceased.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">31<span>       </span> While it is 
true that a dependant’s claim for loss of inheritance was not one of the stated 
consequences to be avoided, this does not necessarily mean that such a claim 
should be allowed. I still have to consider what the law in Singapore before the 
1987 amendments was. Accordingly, when Mr Hwang cited <i>Ho Yeow Kim v Lai 
Hai Kuen</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 246</nobr> for the proposition that the 1987 
amendments did not alter the law on dependency claims, I had no difficulty 
accepting that proposition. However, that proposition still did not answer the 
question whether a claim for loss of inheritance was maintainable in a 
dependency claim in Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">32<span>       </span> 
Mr Hwang submitted numerous authorities for the proposition that both in 
England and in Singapore, a dependant could claim for loss of inheritance. 
Indeed, Mr Hwang submitted that so long as a claimant came within the 
definition of a dependant and had a reasonable expectation of benefit from the 
deceased, then it would not matter whether the expectation was <i>qua</i> 
dependant or <i>qua</i> estate. He argued that the process of succession, 
whether on intestacy or otherwise, was merely the mechanics of transmitting the 
money to a dependant.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">33<span>       </span> 
Mr Hwang relied on <i>Franklin v The South Eastern Railway Company</i> 
(1858) 3 H&amp;N 211 at 213–214; 157 ER 448 at 449 where 
Pollock CB said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The statute does not in terms say on what 
principle the action it gives is to be maintainable, nor on what principle the 
damages are to be assessed; and the only way to ascertain what it does, is to 
shew what it does not, mean. Now it is clear that damage must be shewn, for the 
jury are to “give such damages as they think proportioned to the injury.” It has 
been held that these damages are not to be given as a solatium; but are to be 
given in reference to a pecuniary loss. … It is also clear that the damages are 
not to be given merely in reference to the loss of a legal right, for they are 
to be distributed among relations only, and not to all individuals sustaining 
such a loss; and accordingly the practice has not been to ascertain what benefit 
could have been enforced by the claimants, had the deceased lived, and give 
damages limited thereby. If then the damages are not to be calculated on either 
of these principles, nothing remains except they should be calculated in 
reference to a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit, as of right or 
otherwise, from the continuance of the life.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">34<span>       </span> In 
<i>Dalton v The South-Eastern Railway Company</i> (1858) 4 CB (NS) 296 
at 305; 140 ER 1098 at 1102, Willes J said that “legal liability 
alone is not the test of injury in respect of which damages may be recovered 
under Lord Campbell’s Act … but … the reasonable expectation of pecuniary 
advantage by the relation remaining alive may be taken into account by the 
jury”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">35<span>       </span> Although 
the judgments in these two cases appeared wide enough to include a claim for 
loss of savings by a dependant, they did not actually deal with such a 
claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">36<span>       </span> In <i>Pym v 
The Great Northern Railway Company</i> (1862) 2 B&amp;S 759; 121 ER 
1254, an action was brought by a plaintiff as widow and administratrix of a 
gentleman of fortune on behalf of herself and eight children to recover 
compensation under Lord Campbell’s Act. She claimed, <i>inter alia</i>, the 
savings which the deceased would have set aside for the benefit of his wife and 
children. Cockburn CJ was of the view that such a claim was sustainable in 
principle although he was aware of the serious consequences which would ensue in 
the event of a fatal accident happening from negligence to an individual of a 
very large fortune. However, he thought that that was a matter for the 
Legislature, <i>ie</i> as to whether any limit should be put on the liability. 
Although this decision showed that savings may be taken into account in a 
dependency claim, it should be borne in mind that at that time there was no 
legislation to allow a claim by the estate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">37<span>       </span> The test of 
a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit was reiterated in <i>Taff Vale 
Railway Company v Jenkins</i> [1913] AC 1 but this case did not 
expressly deal with the question of savings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">38<span>       </span> <i>Nance v 
British Columbia Electric Railway Company Ld</i> [1951] AC 601 
(“<i>Nance</i>”) was an appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia to 
the Privy Council. The issue there was whether there was contributory negligence 
on the part of the deceased and whether there was a misdirection by the trial 
judge to the jury. However, the Privy Council also dealt with the quantum of 
damages. On the quantum of damages, Viscount Simon said at 614:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The second question is, what principles 
the court of first instance should itself apply in determining the quantum of 
damages under the relevant British Columbian legislation, which reproduces with 
inconspicuous differences the Fatal Accidents Acts in force in the United 
Kingdom. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The claim to damages in the present case 
falls under two separate heads. First, if the deceased had not been killed, but 
had eked out the full span of life to which in the absence of the accident he 
could reasonably have looked forward, what sums during that period would he 
probably have applied out of his income to the maintenance of his wife and 
family? … Secondly, in addition to any sum arrived at under the first head, the 
case has been argued <i>on the assumption, common to both parties, that 
according to the law of British Columbia it would be proper to award a sum 
representing such portion of any additional savings</i> which he would or might 
have accumulated during the period for which, but for his accident, he would 
have lived, as on his death at the end of this period would probably have 
accrued to his wife and family by devolution either on his intestacy or under 
his will, if he made a will.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">39<span>       </span> As 
Mr Loh stressed, there was no issue in <i>Nance</i> that savings were 
claimable in a dependency claim. This is important because <i>Nance</i> is cited 
in subsequent cases and textbooks as authority for the proposition that a claim 
for loss of savings is maintainable in a dependency claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">40<span>       </span> In 
<i>Mallet v McMonagle</i> [1970] AC 166 (“<i>Mallet</i>”), a claim 
was made under the Fatal Accidents Act. Lord Diplock said at 
174–175:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">To assess the damages it is necessary to 
form a view upon three matters each of which is in greater or less degree one of 
speculation: (1) the value of the material benefits for his dependants 
which the deceased would have provided out of his earnings for each year in the 
future during which he would have provided them, had he not been killed; 
(2) the value of any material benefits which the dependants will be able to 
obtain in each such year from sources (other than insurance) which would not 
have been available to them had the deceased lived but which will become 
available to them as a result of his death; (3) the amount of the capital 
sum which with prudent management will produce annual amounts equal to the 
difference between (1) and (2) (that is “the dependency”) for each of the years 
during which the deceased would have provided material benefits for the 
dependants, had he not been killed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">41<span>       </span> As can be 
seen, there was no express mention about savings in <i>Mallet</i>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">42<span>       </span> In 
<i>Taylor v O’Connor</i> [1971] AC 115 (“<i>Taylor</i>”), the House 
of Lords, in assessing damages for a dependency claim under the Fatal Accidents 
Acts, took into account the savings which the deceased would have made provision 
for but for his death. Lord Reid said at 127–128:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The general principle is not in doubt. 
They are entitled to such a sum as will make good to them the financial loss 
which they have suffered and will suffer as a result of the death. But future 
loss is necessarily conjectural. If all had gone well, the husband would have 
earned very large sums for a long period so that he could have maintained them 
at least at their standard of living at the time of his death and made other 
provision for their future.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It had been assumed that the wife’s 
dependency ought to be calculated on the footing that it would have ceased when 
the husband ceased earning. I do not think that is right in this case. Before he 
reached 65 he would have been able to make ample provision for the future, 
whether or not he survived, and I think that, if one is to be realistic, 
dependency should be taken on the basis that she would be maintained at the same 
rate of expenditure throughout her life. We were informed that her expectation 
of life was about 21 years.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">I regard this as the main element in the 
respondent’s claim, and I think that any discount for contingencies should be 
comparatively small. She or the daughter would also have an interest in any 
capital which the deceased might have accumulated before his death. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">But take the present case. The respondent 
will have the £10,000 [being the amount saved so far] to which I have referred 
and damages in respect of (a) loss of her dependency and (b) loss of 
her interest in the savings which the husband would have made.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">43<span>       </span> 
Lord Pearson said at 141–142:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><i><span lang="EN-GB">The lost benefit.</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB">The next step was to estimate the pecuniary benefit which the 
dependants, the respondent and the daughter, probably would have derived from 
the earnings of the deceased over the 15-year or 18-year period if the earnings 
had not been lost. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The judge estimated that of the 
deceased’s net spendable income, estimated at £6,000 per annum, two-thirds, that 
is, £4,000 per annum, would have enured to the benefit of the respondent and the 
daughter. That must include both elements of the lost pecuniary benefit, namely, 
the maintenance element and the savings element. Presumably the deceased would 
in the later years of his working life have been both maintaining the family and 
saving for the benefit of the family. The savings would have provided some 
present financial security not only for the deceased but also for the respondent 
and the daughter, and probably the savings or the residue of them would 
ultimately have been inherited by the respondent and the daughter or one of 
them. I think the £4,000 per annum was a moderate estimate of the lost 
benefit.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">44<span>       </span> Although 
this case appeared to be authority for the proposition that future savings 
should be taken into account in a dependency claim, it seems to me that the 
point was not in issue there. While Lord Reid appeared to treat the loss of 
savings as a separate head of claim to loss of dependency, the judgments of the 
law lords do not indicate any argument that loss of savings should rightfully be 
a claim by the estate. Lord Reid also did not think that the dependency 
ought to be calculated on the footing that it would have ceased when the husband 
ceased earning. While it may be true that a wife’s dependency does not actually 
stop when her husband stops earning, the fact is that, in Singapore, a wife’s 
dependency claim is calculated with reference to when the husband would stop 
earning had he not been killed in the accident.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">45<span>       </span> Although I 
have not cited from the judgment of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
<i>Taylor</i>, I note that he referred to Viscount Simon’s judgment in 
<i>Nance</i> as regards the additional amount the husband in <i>Taylor</i> would 
probably have saved. However, as I have stressed, <i>Nance</i> had assumed that 
future savings are claimable in a dependency claim. It seems to me that 
<i>Taylor</i> was no more an authority to support AML’s claim for loss of 
inheritance than my decision in <i>Tan Harry v Teo Chee Yeow Aloysius</i>
<nobr>[2004] 1 SLR 513</nobr> (“<i>Tan Harry</i>”) was such an authority. I will 
come back to <i>Tan Harry</i> later.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">46<span>       </span> Mr Loh 
submitted that <i>Taylor</i> has not been subsequently cited as authority for 
the proposition that future savings are claimable as part of a dependency claim. 
I note that, for example, although <i>Taylor</i> was referred to in <i>Cookson v 
Knowles</i> [1979] AC 556 (“<i>Cookson</i>”), the House of Lords 
there did not say that future savings were claimable in a dependency claim. In 
<i>Cookson</i>, Lord Diplock said at 567 and 568:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">When the first Fatal Accidents Act was 
passed in 1846, its purpose was to put the dependants of the deceased, who had 
been the bread-winner of the family, in the same position financially as if he 
had lived his natural span of life. In times of steady money values, wages 
levels and interest rates this could be achieved in the case of the ordinary 
working man by awarding to his dependants the capital sum required to purchase 
an annuity of an amount equal to the annual value of the benefits with which he 
had provided them while he lived, and for such period as it could reasonably be 
estimated they would have continued to enjoy them but for his premature death. 
Although this does not represent the way in which it is calculated such a 
capital sum may be expressed as the product of multiplying an annual sum which 
represents the “dependency” by a number of years’ purchase. This latter figure 
is less than the number of years which represents the period for which it is 
estimated that the dependants would have continued to enjoy the benefit of the 
dependency, since the capital sum will not be exhausted until the end of that 
period and in the meantime so much of it as is not yet exhausted in each year 
will earn interest from which the dependency for that year could in part be 
met.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">47<span>       </span> At 571, 
Lord Diplock also said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Quite apart from the prospects of future 
inflation, the assessment of damages in fatal accidents can at best be only 
rough and ready because of the conjectural nature of so many of the other 
assumptions upon which it has to be based. The conventional method of 
calculating it has been to apply to what is found upon the evidence to be a sum 
representing “the dependency,” a multiplier representing what the judge 
considers in the circumstances particular to the deceased to be the appropriate 
number of years’ purchase.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">48<span>       </span> Although 
<i>Cookson</i> did not expressly say that savings were to be excluded in a 
dependency claim, the subsequent case of <i>Gammell</i> did say this. I refer 
again to the judgments of Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser of 
<span>Tullybelton</span> which I have cited at [23] and [24] above.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">49<span>       </span> I come now 
to the interesting case of <i>Cape Distribution Ltd v O’Loughlin</i> 
[2001] EWCA Civ 178 (“<i>O’Loughlin</i><span>”</span>). The judgment 
of Latham LJ sets out the facts in some detail as well as the reasons for 
his decision. He said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1.<span>        </span> On 
the 13th May 1995 Mr O’Loughlin died. He was 50 years of age, having been 
born on the 17th September 1944. His death was due to mesothelioma contracted as 
a result of exposure to asbestos dust while working for the appellants at their 
factory in Uxbridge for four months in 1966. On the 2nd July 1999, Forbes J 
awarded his widow, the respondent, a total of £284,652.38 inclusive of interest 
in respect of the claims which she had made arising out of her husbands 
[<i>sic</i>] death on her own behalf, and on behalf of the two teenage sons of 
the marriage, under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, and of his estate under the 
Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. Of this award, £164,035.95 
represented the loss of past and future financial dependency under the Fatal 
Accidents Act, and interest. In this appeal, the appellants challenge the 
judge’s findings upon which he based this part of his award.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2.<span>        </span> This 
appeal raises once again the difficult question of how to assess the value in 
monies worth of the loss of a husband and father when the family’s financial 
affairs are not straight forward. Mr O’Loughlin had, together with a 
partner, run a successful plant hire business in Ireland for some years. The 
respondent’s claim was, however, based upon Mr O’Loughlin’s business 
activities in and after 1989, when he severed his relationship with his partner. 
Although to begin with, these activities were based on plant hire, through the 
medium of two companies, Ready Hire Ltd and Green Hire Ltd, they gradually 
concentrated on property development, so that by 1994, the year before his 
death, property formed the sole basis of the family’s finances. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3.<span>        </span> When 
he started property dealing in 1989, the family owned three properties, 
including the matrimonial home which was subject to a mortgage. Excluding these 
properties, he had, by the time of his death built a property portfolio of some 
seven investment properties worth approximately £750,000, three of which were 
subject to commercial mortgage of approximately £120,000. These properties were 
held in the name of Mr O’Loughlin and the respondent, or Ready Hire Ltd. He 
also had a 50% share in two companies together with Mr Howley, which owned 
two other properties. He was obviously successful; and by the time of his death 
he had repaid the mortgage on the family home. Mr O’Loughlin’s income tax 
returns disclosed substantial income receipts. His gross income was £92,527 for 
the year ending 1992, £49,097 for 1993, £51,828 for 1994, and £59,283 for 1995. 
These figures are to a great extent artificial, in significant part constructed 
so as to take as much fiscal advantage as possible of the period leading up to 
his death. The rental receipts which underpinned his and the company’s annual 
earnings were approximately £32,000. After his death, the respondent did not 
suffer any immediate financial disadvantage. She received the full value of all 
Mr O’Loughlin’s capital assets. Although before his death she would help in 
a secretarial capacity, she never involved herself in the management or 
development of the properties. After his death, she attempted to do so, but 
found that she did not have the necessary skills. In order to maintain her life 
style, she has sold three of the properties and enjoys the investment income 
from these as well as the rental from the remainder. She has not been able to 
carry on the property development side of the business. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4.<span>        </span> On 
behalf of the respondent, it was submitted to the judge that the court had to 
approach the assessment of damages on the basis set out by Staughton LJ in 
<i>Wood-v-Bentall Simplex Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] PIQR 332</nobr> at 
349:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">One then turns to the case where the 
income is in part derived from labour and in part from capital. Suppose that the 
husband owns a boarding house and that he and his wife run it together. If he 
should happen to be killed by a negligent wrongdoer and his widow inherits the 
house and continues to run it, should she recover to the extent of her 
dependency on the whole of the profit of the boarding house? This is not very 
different from the present case. My answer is that one must again determine what 
the dependants have lost. No question of deduction arises. The court has to 
ascertain how much loss has arisen because the deceased is no longer alive and 
able to work, and how much the deceased’s income is derived solely from capital 
which the dependants have inherited.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5.<span>        </span> On 
that basis it was contended that the loss to the dependants as a result of 
Mr O’Loughlin’s death was his flair, experience and entrepreneurial skills 
to manage and develop the property portfolio and the financial benefits that 
that would bring to the family. It was contended that he would have continued to 
have done so until at least aged 60. As a result, it could have been anticipated 
that he would have increased the portfolio and the rental income by acquisition 
and development which are clear benefits which the dependants have now lost. It 
was submitted that the most secure way to assess the value of these services 
would be to determine what it would cost to replace them. A Mr Potterton of 
a firm of estate agents produced a report in which he assessed the cost of 
replacing these services at £28,000 per annum.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6.<span>        </span> For 
the appellants, it was submitted that in truth, the dependants had lost little. 
The full value of the capital assets remained available to them. They had the 
benefit of the rental income and interest on investments from the whole of the 
capital assets of Mr O’Loughlin. They submitted that it was wholly 
inappropriate to assess the dependency on the basis of a valuation of the loss 
of services. This, it was submitted, failed to take any account of the fact that 
the evidence before the judge showed that for the period immediately after his 
death, the respondent, and therefore the family, had lost little. More 
fundamentally, it was submitted that no proper basis had been put before the 
court on behalf of the respondent to determine the true nature and extent of the 
dependency which could enable the court to come to a proper conclusion as to the 
true value of the dependency.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.<span>       </span> The 
starting point must be the terms of the relevant provision in the Fatal 
Accidents Act 1976. Section 3(1) provides:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In the action such damages, other than 
damages for bereavement, may be awarded as are proportioned to the injury 
resulting from the death to the dependants respectively.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This provision replicates, though not in 
precisely the same words, the basis upon which damages have been assessed since 
the passing of the Fatal Accidents Act 1846. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12.<span>       </span> The first 
clear expression of this principle to which we have been referred is in the 
judgment of Erle CJ in <i>Pym v Great Northern Railway Company</i>, which I 
have already cited. However, in <i>Taff Vale Railway v Jenkins</i> [1913] 
1 AC 1 the courts first recognised that a claim could be made in respect 
of services rendered gratuitously by the deceased. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13.<span>       </span> This 
principle has been applied time and time again by the court in cases where the 
claimant has lost the services of a wife or mother. It has also been applied to 
the loss of a husband’s services as handiman [<i>sic</i>], gardener, or any 
other such service activity as has been lost and has a money value in the sense 
that it will cost money to replace. I can see no difference in principle between 
the loss of services of that domestic nature, and the loss of services which 
have a positive financial value to the family. For example, a husband may be so 
skilled and successful in dealing with the family’s investments that he has no 
need of a stockbroker or other financial adviser. His death, whatever other loss 
may result, will mean that the family will have to replace that expertise and 
advice at the appropriate market cost. That cost is as much a loss to the family 
as could be the cost of a gardener. And, clearly, the position cannot be 
different, indeed it is a fortiori, if the family’s sole source of support is 
the investment portfolio managed by such a husband.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15.<span>       </span> In the 
present case, the judge came to the clear conclusion that the dependants had 
lost the flair and business acumen which would, by clear inference have resulted 
in a successful development of the property portfolio which represented the 
family’s assets, with consequential increases in both the capital and the income 
value of that portfolio. In my view the judge was clearly correct in concluding 
that the dependants had thereby suffered a loss capable of being measured in 
money terms. He could, as submitted by Mr Alliott, have been asked to 
embark upon a complex evaluation of the extent to which the portfolio managed by 
Mr O’Loughlin would have been more valuable than the assets managed by the 
respondent. This would have involved a comparison of on the one hand, the likely 
increase in income and capital to be expected from prudent investment by 
somebody on the respondent’s behalf of these assets, for she herself on the 
judge’s findings, could not be expected to have managed them herself, and a 
projection of the increase in income and capital values of the portfolio based 
upon an extrapolation from Mr O’Loughlin’s success between 1989 and 1995. 
It seems to me that such an exercise, although theoretically possible, would be 
so riddled with uncertainty and speculation as to make it difficult for a judge 
to find a secure basis for any conclusions that he might seek to 
reach.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16.<span>       </span> But one 
thing is certain, namely that the respondent would have to have professional 
advice in order to manage the family assets properly and effectively. The cost 
of such advice therefore represents the most secure basis from which to attempt 
to place a pecuniary value on the loss to the dependants arising from 
Mr O’Loughlin’s death. Whether she chooses to have such an advisor or not 
is another matter. But the fact will always remain that she and the dependants 
will have lost the services of Mr O’Loughlin as the manager of the family 
assets, and that loss is capable of being valued in money terms. I have no 
doubt, in these circumstances, that the judge was entitled to take the course 
that he did.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17.<span>       </span> … Implicit 
in the judge’s findings is the conclusion that Mr O’Loughlin, with his 
flair, could have produced greater benefit to the dependants than a manager 
could. It follows that not only is there no benefit that I can see which could 
sensibly be prayed in aid by the appellants in reduction of the damages, but 
this is not a case in which the cost of replacing services would exceed the 
level of the lost dependency.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">50<span>       </span> 
Judge LJ said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">23.<span>       </span> The 
features of the deceased’s working life which created difficulties in the ready 
calculation of the appropriate level of damages to be allowed to his dependants 
was that his formal earnings were very modest. Concentrating exclusively on the 
formal level of his remuneration gives a wholly misleading picture of the true 
financial worth of his working life. Sometimes, of course, the pay and rewards 
of an individual do not appear to bear any realistic relationship to the 
notional value which might be attributed to the efforts and responsibilities 
borne by him, whether as an employee, or for that matter, self-employed. Some 
are under-paid: some run businesses which are, for reasons quite unconnected 
with their own abilities, unsuccessful. In cases like these, where the earnings 
figures of the deceased in the period leading up to his illness and death come 
to be analysed, there is no gainsaying the actual figures. So, unless, for 
example, there is evidence to suggest that the individual in question would have 
changed jobs for better rewards, the notional, often subjective, evaluation of 
what an individual’s work should have produced, as opposed to what it did 
produce, is usually irrelevant. However where, as in the present case, the 
deceased chose to reward himself very modestly while simultaneously increasing 
his assets, or put another way, in effect took his rewards for his labour partly 
in income and partly by building up his capital and income creating assets, it 
would be wholly unjust to assess the damages due to his dependants (or for that 
matter, if rather than causing death, his injuries had made him permanently 
unemployable) as if the calculation of any consequent loss should be based 
exclusively on the modest salary he paid himself. And the difficulties of 
ascertaining the appropriate and fair figure does not mean that the loss is 
speculative, or unproved. It is merely difficult to quantify.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">24.<span>       </span> Faced with 
the difficulties inherent in a claim arising from the dependency on a deceased 
whose financial position was neither based exclusively, or nearly exclusively, 
on income, nor exclusively or nearly exclusively on income derived from capital, 
Forbes J accepted the submission that the calculation of the loss sustained 
by the dependants in this case would best be ascertained by evaluating “the 
likely cost of maintaining developing and enhancing the property portfolio which 
existed at the date of Mr O’Loughlin’s death”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25.<span>       </span> That 
approach followed from his conclusion, first, that despite her best efforts, the 
widow of the deceased lacked her husband’s flair and skill as a property 
developer, a view confirmed by the fact that by 1997 she had sold three of the 
properties without reinvesting the proceeds in further properties, and second, 
by the concessions made by the accountant’[s] evidence called by the defendants 
that the deceased’s efforts in managing the property portfolio and maintaining 
it, produced a clear economic benefit to the family as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">26.<span>       </span> I agree 
with Mr Alliott’s submission that this was an unusual, probably indeed 
unconventional approach. The question however is whether it was inconsistent 
with principle, or whether the result was disproportionate. In my view, in this 
case it was not. Indeed although the analogy is incomplete, as Latham LJ’s 
judgment demonstrates, it is well established that the value of the unpaid 
services provided by a deceased for his (or her) family may properly involve 
reference to the cost of supplying someone else to provide them. I merely sound 
the cautionary note that where the court is invited to adopt an unusual or 
unconventional approach in a case of this kind, an additional burden is imposed 
on the judge to ensure that the more conventional approach would not provide the 
fairest way to do justice between the parties, and, even if he is satisfied that 
it would not, he should stand back from the figure to which the unconventional 
approach had led him and examine whether it fairly reflected the practical 
realities of the case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">51<span>       </span> 
Schiemann LJ agreed with both judgments. Consequently, the appeal of the 
defendants was dismissed with costs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">52<span>       </span>
<i>O’Loughlin</i> is interesting because it is a case after the UK had abolished 
the estate’s right to claim loss of future earnings and the achievements of 
Mr O’Loughlin were similar in nature to those of HAL although not as 
spectacular. Significantly, Mr O’Loughlin, like HAL, chose to reward 
himself modestly while increasing his assets. On the other hand, 
Mr O’Loughlin did not face the liquidity problem that HAL had come to face 
before HAL’s death, a point which I shall elaborate on later.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">53<span>       </span> In 
<i>O’Loughlin</i>, it was the defendant’s counsel who suggested that the trial 
judge should have considered the extent to which Mr O’Loughlin’s portfolio 
as managed by him would have been more valuable than the portfolio as managed by 
his wife. Latham LJ was of the view that this exercise would be too 
speculative. He therefore preferred the trial judge’s approach of awarding a sum 
equivalent to the cost of replacing the services which Mr O’Loughlin 
performed, such services being that of a skilled property manager. Naturally, 
such services alone would not be an adequate assessment as Mr O’Loughlin, 
like HAL, was more than a skilled property manager. He was an entrepreneur with 
considerable business acumen. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal decided that 
that would be an appropriate basis to make an award for loss of 
services.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">54<span>       </span> Before me, 
AML’s claim for loss of inheritance was not presented on the basis of a loss of 
HAL’s services but rather a loss of what HAL would have accumulated. It seems to 
me that if such a claim had been made in <i>O’Loughlin</i>, the defendant’s 
counsel would not have objected. Indeed, as I have said, it was he who suggested 
that such an exercise be undertaken subject to a deduction for what the wife 
could have accumulated on her own efforts. It appears that the Court of Appeal 
was of the view that such an exercise was not objectionable in principle but 
that it was too speculative to be undertaken.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">55<span>       </span> Therefore, 
although the claim in <i>O’Loughlin</i> for loss of services was not the same as 
AML’s claim for loss of inheritance, it can be said that the Court of Appeal in 
that case did not object to a claim for loss of inheritance in principle. 
However, it was not argued in <i>O’Loughlin</i> that a claim for loss of 
inheritance is actually a claim to be made by the estate, and not the 
dependants, and that since the estate may not claim for loss of income after the 
1982 amendment a claim for loss of inheritance or indeed for loss of services 
which result in the accumulation of wealth is not maintainable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">56<span>       </span> Therefore, 
as regards the claim for loss of Mr O’Loughlin’s services, it seems to me 
that while one may say that there is no difference in principle between the loss 
of services of a domestic nature and the loss of services which have a positive 
financial value, there may well be a difference in the result. Services of a 
domestic nature, while perhaps having some sort of financial value, do not 
result in the kind of accumulation of wealth discussed in <i>O’Loughlin</i> 
whereas those which have a positive financial value usually do. It is important 
to bear in mind that in the accumulation of wealth, it is really the estate that 
benefits. The dependants do not benefit <i>qua</i> dependants unless the 
accumulation results in an increase in the amount spent on them annually, which 
is a different point. Likewise, there may be services with a positive financial 
value which have an immediate financial impact on the dependants and are 
maintainable in a dependency claim, but that again is a different 
point.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">57<span>       </span> While it 
may seem unjust from a plaintiff’s point of view that a claim for loss of 
inheritance should not be allowed in Singapore because of the 1987 amendment, it 
seems to me that the question is what our Legislature intended. This brings me 
back to the question whether a claim for loss of inheritance is maintainable in 
a dependency claim in Singapore. I have so far considered the English position, 
which is not clear, and the Privy Council decision in <i>Nance</i><span>,</span> 
which has been cited in English cases, as well as in Malaysian and Singapore 
cases as I will elaborate later.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">58<span>       </span> In Hong 
Kong, there has also been an amendment to disallow the estate from claiming 
future earnings but with the important proviso that the estate may claim for the 
deceased’s accumulation of wealth. Section 20(2)(b)(iii) of the Hong Kong 
Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap 23), 
states:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Where a cause of action survives as 
aforesaid for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person, the damages 
recoverable for the benefit of the estate of that person shall, where the death 
of that person has been caused by the act or omission which gives rise to the 
cause of action not include any damages for loss of property, whether income or 
otherwise, in respect of any period after his death, <i>except in so far as the 
court is satisfied that, but for the act or omission that gave rise to the cause 
of action, the deceased would have achieved an accumulation of wealth by the 
time that he would otherwise have died, in which case damages may be awarded in 
respect of the loss of that wealth</i>:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Provided that damages awarded under this 
sub-paragraph shall be subject to such deduction as the court considers it just

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">59<span>       </span> The Law 
Reform Commission of Hong Kong’s <i>Report on Damages for Personal Injury and 
Death</i>, which was presented on 5 October 1984, shows that in Hong Kong, 
a dependency claim does not include a claim for savings, although there was a 
suggestion by Roberts CJ that it should. Hence the Commission recommended 
that the estate claim for savings should be retained although the rest of its 
claim for loss of income was to be abolished. I quote parts of the report which 
said at ch XI, pp 54–60, 64–69:</span></p>

(4<sup>th</sup> ed, 1975) vol 1, pp 235-6 as follows –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Start with the deceased’s net income at 
the date of his death: estimate how much of this he spent on himself: then, if 
his pattern of life justifies the assumption, take the remainder of his net 
income as being spent for the benefit of his dependants.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In estimating how much the deceased spent 
on himself, no account is taken of expenditure on things the cost of which 
continues unabated after his death, such as mortgage payments, lighting and 
heating.</span></p>

The claim under LARCO</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.8<span>     </span> Section 20 of 
the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance (‘LARCO’) provides, as a 
general rule, that on the death of any person all causes of action vested in him 
shall survive for the benefit of his estate. This means that the persons named 
in the deceased’s will or, where there is no will, those entitled to claim under 
his intestacy will obtain any damages recovered in respect of such causes of 
action.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.14<span>   </span> … 
The English Court of Appeal has recently decided, however, that the calculation 
of living expenses for the purposes of the LARCO award are slightly different 
from those calculated under the FAO. For the purposes of the FAO the living 
expenses are those sums which the deceased would have spent <u>exclusively</u> 
on himself, whereas under LARCO they include a pro rata share of sums spent for 
the joint benefit of the deceased and others (eg rent) (see <u>Harris</u> v 
<u>Empress Motors Ltd</u> (1984) 1 WLR 212).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.15<span>   </span> 
Another approach has been suggested in Hong Kong by Roberts CJ in <u>Wong 
Sai-chuen v Tam Mei-chuen</u> –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">I suggest that it is open to a trial 
judge, having assessed the FAO dependency:-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> to apply 
this figure as the first part of the free balance, unless there is evidence that 
the amount of dependency might have varied during the lost years;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> to add to 
that the deceased’s notional savings during his lost years.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">As a starting point, it would be 
reasonable, in my view, to adopt the formula … of taking 10% of the deceased’s 
net earnings as the amount of the notional savings … The natural thrift of the 
inhabitants of Hong Kong suggests that this is not an unreasonable 
assumption.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.16<span>   </span> This 
approach recognises that a person’s income may be used for three purposes – for 
supporting his dependants, for personal expenses, and for savings. Whereas a 
claim under the FAO only relates to the amount spent on the dependants, a claim 
under LARCO should be for the whole of the net income minus the personal 
expenses, and therefore should include any savings. Hong Kong courts have in a 
number of cases therefore awarded more under LARCO than under the FAO 
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Reform 
options</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.27<span>   </span> We 
are in no doubt that the law relating to damages for the lost years in fatal 
cases is in need of reform. In our view, the fact that a defendant may have to 
pay double compensation, under the FAO and LARCO, cannot possibly be justified. 
We have therefore considered three ways of improving the law, 
namely:-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> to abolish 
the claim under the FAO;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> to abolish 
the claim under LARCO;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> to retain 
both claims, but limit the claim under LARCO to the loss of net 
savings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">We now propose to consider each 
option.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Option (a)</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.28<span>   </span> 
Lord Scarman stated in <u>Gammell v Wilson</u> that the ‘logical, but 
socially unattractive, way of reforming the law would be to repeal the Fatal 
Accidents Act … This would leave recovery to the estate; and the dependants 
would look, as in a family where the breadwinner is not tortiously killed, to 
him (or her) for their support during life and on death. They would have the 
final safeguard of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 
1975.’</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.29<span>   </span> We 
are against this approach for several reasons. In our view it is the dependants 
of the deceased who are in the greatest need of compensation in respect of the 
financial loss caused by the death. It is therefore wrong to allow the estate to 
claim the financial loss, since the money may not go to those dependants. It is 
true that certain dependants may claim reasonable provision out of the estate 
under the Deceased’s Family Maintenance Ordinance but this is a round-about 
procedure and in any event it only protects a limited class of persons. 
Furthermore the class under the FAO is well established and the courts are used 
to dealing with such claims. We conclude, as did Lord Scarman that ‘the 
protection of the fatal accidents legislation has been with us for so long that 
[we] doubt whether its repeal would be welcomed.’</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Option (b)</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.30<span>   </span> The 
second approach is to abolish the claim under LARCO for damages for the lost 
years in fatal cases. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.31<span>   </span> 
There are, however, arguments against the complete abolition of the LARCO claim. 
The main criticism of the present law is that it allows double recovery in 
respect of the money which would have been spent on the dependants of the 
deceased. If the LARCO claim were to be abolished, however, it would mean that 
the deceased’s estate would be deprived not only of the sums which would have 
been spent on the dependants, but also of the amount which the deceased would 
have saved. This leads us to consider our third option.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Option (c)</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.32<span>   </span> This 
option involves the retention of claims under both the FAO and LARCO, but is 
aimed at eliminating any double recovery. As has been pointed out above, double 
recovery may occur because the sums that would have been spent on the deceased’s 
dependants are not deducted from the LARCO award. This anomaly could be overcome 
by requiring the courts to make such a deduction. The effect would be that the 
LARCO award would be calculated by reference to the net savings which the 
deceased would have made had he lived a normal lifespan (the “net savings 
method”). Such an approach was in fact adopted in the Hong Kong case of <u>VSL 
Engineers (HK) Ltd v. Yeung Wing</u> <nobr>[1981] HKLR 407</nobr>, and although 
the Court of Appeal subsequently disapproved this method of calculation, Roberts 
CJ thought it had some attraction. He observed that –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The net savings method has attractions. 
It involves a relatively simple calculation. It treats the amount which the 
deceased handed to his wife for her maintenance in the same way as that which he 
handed to her for his maintenance. It ensures that there would accrue to the 
deceased’s estate only what, had he lived, would have been found in it at his 
death, because he would have saved it. And it avoids the inflation of LARCO 
awards by the amount of the dependency, which will appear in the FAO award as 
well.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(See <u>Wong Sai-chuen dec’d v Tam 
Mei-chun</u> (1982) Civ App No 133 of 1981)</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Since the net savings method takes into 
account the sum which the deceased would have spent on his dependants there is 
no overlap between the LARCO claim and awards under the FAO. No merger of these 
awards should therefore take place.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.33<span>   </span> This 
approach is also consistent with the rule that in assessing damages for 
pecuniary loss, the principle of full compensation should be applied. 
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Where the deceased would have saved part 
of his income during the lost years there is no doubt that his estate has been 
deprived of that money. Damages should therefore compensate the estate for this 
loss.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Our 
recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.34<span>   </span> The 
provisional view of the sub-committee was that option (c) should be adopted. 
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.35<span>   </span> Some 
commentators pointed out that it was incorrect to regard the net savings as the 
only surplus left from the net income after deductions are made for personal 
expenses and sums spent on the dependants. We acknowledge the logic of this. 
There may be other amounts which were dealt with in other ways by the deceased. 
Nevertheless we are of the view that the estate should only be able to claim for 
the loss of those sums which would have been saved by the deceased. If other 
uses made by the deceased of his money were to be taken into account we feel 
this would create an unacceptable level of speculation as to whether that money 
should be regarded as a loss to the estate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.36<span>   </span> 
Another commentator considered that lost years awards had considerably increased 
the level of awards and that the social cost of this increase was not justified. 
We sympathise with this view but do not consider that this should lead us to 
recommend that total abolition of damages for the lost years. Our recommendation 
that only the loss of savings should be recovered would, if implemented, reduce 
the level of awards considerably.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.37<span>   </span> The 
same commentator also regarded the degree of speculation involved in lost years 
claims as unacceptable. This does seem to us to be a valid criticism. A degree 
of speculation enters into claims for loss of dependency under the FAO, but in 
the case of claims under LARCO, the amount of speculation may be much greater. 
In some cases the courts have held that where some matters are very speculative 
they would simply consider the facts as at the date of death and not make any 
guesses as to what the future might hold (see eg L<u>ee Kai-cheung</u> v <u>Yim 
Tat-kuen</u> (1983) HCA No 1374 of 1983). In our view this approach should 
be adopted in all cases relating to lost years in fatal cases. We recommend that 
a LARCO claim for damages for the lost years should only lie in respect of the 
loss of saving during the lost years, and that such a loss should be calculated 
on the basis of the established pattern of savings (if there is one) of the 
deceased prior to the accident. This approach will eliminate speculation as to 
the future savings habits and will make settlements easier to arrange. It will 
enable the estate of a deceased person with an established pattern of savings 
(eg a middle-aged family man) to recover the loss of future savings, but will 
eliminate claims in the case of a young person with no savings pattern. In our 
view this approach is preferable to the total abolition of damages for the lost 
years and yet has a degree of certainty and simplicity.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.38<span>   </span> The 
discussion of the lost years has so far concentrated on the loss of income 
during those years. In most cases this will be the only financial loss in that 
period. It is possible, however, that there may be other losses. In the recent 
cases of <u>Adsett</u> v <u>West</u> [1983] 3 WLR 437 it was held 
that a claim for the lost years could include a claim for the loss of an 
inheritance during those years. That decision led to the rather bizarre result 
that the father of the deceased who was the beneficiary of the estate, could 
claim for his son’s loss of inheritance from the father. In our view such losses 
should not be recoverable as being too speculative. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">60<span>       </span> In the 
summary of its recommendations, the Commission said (at ch XIII, 
p 81):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13.26<span>   </span> The 
law relating to the ‘lost years’ in fatal cases should be reformed 
(paras 11.1-27). The claim under LARCO for the lost years should be reduced 
so that it represents only the net savings which the deceased would have made 
during the lost years. The award should be calculated on the basis of the 
established savings pattern (if any) of the deceased at the time of the accident 
(paras 11.32–40).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">61<span>       </span> The 
Commission suggested the following terms of amendment on this point (at p 
93):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2.<span>        </span> 
Section 20 of the principal Ordinance is amended –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> 
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> in 
subsection (2) by deleting paragraph (a) and substituting the following 
–</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">“(a)<span>     </span> shall not include 
–</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(i) 
<span>       </span> …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii) 
<span>      </span> …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(iii) 
<span>     </span> …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(iv)<span>      </span> any damages for 
loss of income in respect of any period after his death, except where before the 
date on which the cause of action accrued he had established a pattern of making 
savings from income, in which case the damages shall include an amount 
calculated on the basis of that pattern, subject to such deduction as the court 
thinks fit on account of the accelerated payment of any such lost income for 
which damages are awarded;”; …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">62<span>       </span> As it 
turned out, the amendment was in different terms from those proposed by the 
Commission. I have set out the actual amendment in [58] above. It seems that in 
Hong Kong, the estate may claim for loss of accumulation of wealth which is not 
confined to any established pattern of savings. Be that as it may, it is clear 
that in Hong Kong, a dependency claim does not include a claim for loss of 
savings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">63<span>       </span> Closer to 
home is the Malaysian case of <i>Chan Yoke May v Lian Seng Co Ltd</i>
<nobr>[1962] MLJ 243</nobr>. There, Suffian J was considering the amount of 
damages to be awarded under s 7 of the Civil Law Ordinance 1956. 
Citing <i>Nance</i>, he was of the view that the amount the deceased would have 
saved should be included in the general damages. Again, there did not seem to be 
any dispute on the point in that case. Furthermore, Mr Hwang did not cite 
any recent Malaysian case which would demonstrate that in Malaysia, a claim for 
loss of inheritance is maintainable in a dependency claim. On the other hand, 
Mr Loh did not cite any recent Malaysian case which would demonstrate that 
a claim for loss of inheritance is not maintainable in a dependency 
claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">64<span>       </span> For 
Singapore, neither counsel cited a case which was exactly on the point. However, 
Mr Hwang relied on <i>Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd v Lim Soon Yong</i> 
[1982–1983] SLR 167 (“<i>Lim Soon Yong</i>”). There, the plaintiff’s 
husband was killed in a motor accident on 26 May 1979, <i>ie</i> before the 
1982 amendment in the UK and before the 1987 amendment in Singapore. The 
plaintiff brought a dependency claim under s 8 of the Civil Law Act 
<i></i>(Cap 30, 1970 Rev Ed) on behalf of herself as well as the 
children and parents of the deceased. No claim was brought on behalf of the 
estate. One of the heads of claim was the contributions the deceased and his 
employer would have made to the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) for his account. 
Contributions to the CPF are special savings mandated by law in Singapore and at 
that time could be withdrawn by the wage earner when he reached 55 years of age. 
This was one of the issues that the Court of Appeal had to grapple with. 
F A Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said 
at 169, [14]–[15]:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The contention of the appellants is that 
the CPF contributions cannot form part of a dependency claim. It is money held 
in trust by the CPF Board and when the contributor reaches the age of 55 it 
would go to the contributor. If the contributor dies before the age of 55 the 
money is paid to the nominee, but not as a dependant. It is not money on which 
the family depends from day to day.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">We are unable to accept the contention of 
the appellants. CPF contributions are not chargeable with estate duty. The money 
does not go to the estate of the contributor. In this case it goes to the widow 
and the parents of the deceased. Had the deceased lived to the age of 55 he 
would have withdrawn the sum standing to his credit in the CPF and the widow and 
children would necessarily have benefited from the deceased having this money if 
not for this accident. In our view, therefore, the CPF contributions do form 
part of the widow’s dependency claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">65<span>       </span> The 
defendant appealed to the Privy Council (reported at [1985] 1 WLR 
1075) and the sole issue there was whether the claim for the CPF 
contributions was maintainable. The Privy Council was aware that the appellant 
was contending that such a claim should have been made by the estate instead. In 
delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Sir Edward Eveleigh cited the 
judgment of the Court of Appeal below. He also cited the judgment of Viscount 
Simon in <i>Nance</i> regarding the assumption that, according to the law of 
British Columbia, it would be proper to award a sum representing a portion of 
any additional savings which the deceased might have accumulated. 
Sir Edward was of the view that Viscount Simon was dealing with a 
dependency claim and not an estate claim. Sir Edward then said at 
1079–1080:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The deceased would have continued to 
contribute [to the CPF] and so would his employer if the accident had not 
occurred for payment was compulsory under the Act [meaning the CPF Act]. … Had 
he died before the age of 55 his dependants would have been entitled to their 
portions by virtue of section 12(5). The deceased might have lived beyond 
55 and withdrawn the sum standing to his credit. In that event it is reasonable 
to infer that he would have used the money not only for his own benefit but for 
the benefit of his dependants. To the extent that he did not spend it he would 
have saved it and his dependants, particularly his widow who was younger than he 
was, would reasonably have expected to inherit from him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The fact that the deceased’s estate might 
have had a claim for the value of lost contributions to the Fund in no way 
affects the right of the dependants to claim for their own loss. The fact that, 
in England, before the Administration of Justice Act 1982 damages could be 
claimed by the estate for loss of the ability to earn over the “lost years” (see 
<i>Gammell v Wilson</i>) did not take away the right of dependants to claim for 
their loss of dependency. The claim by the estate might affect the valuation of 
the claim by the dependants to the extent that they benefited from the estate 
but the two claims are independently sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">66<span>       </span> The 
approach of the Privy Council in <i>Lim Soon Yong</i> was not exactly the same 
as that of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal considered the CPF 
contributions as distinct from the estate of the deceased and allowed such 
contributions to be claimed because the deceased would have withdrawn the sum 
standing to his credit in the CPF and spent it on his wife and children before 
his death, although he had aged parents as dependants too. While the Privy 
Council took into account the point that the deceased would have withdrawn his 
CPF savings and spent it on his dependants (and not just on the wife and 
children), the Privy Council also took into account the fact that the wife was 
likely to have inherited whatever the deceased would have saved from so much of 
his CPF contributions which would not have been spent. The Privy Council also 
appeared to have been influenced by the fact that at that time, the estate was 
not precluded by law from claiming the savings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">67<span>       </span> With 
respect, it seems to me that the Privy Council had erred in taking into account 
the fact that the wife would have inherited the savings from the CPF 
contributions. That would have been an estate claim. As I have said, in 
<i>Nance</i>, it was assumed that a claim for savings was maintainable in a 
dependency claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">68<span>       </span> <i>Lim Soon 
Yong</i> has since been cited with approval in Singapore to allow a dependency 
claim to include a claim for future CPF contributions. Apparently, it has not 
been cited for the proposition that future savings are claimable in a dependency 
claim. Indeed, if future savings had been generally claimable in a dependency 
claim, the CPF contributions would not have been an issue in <i>Lim Soon 
Yong</i>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">69<span>       </span> 
Accordingly, it is my view that <i>Lim Soon Yong</i> is not an authority that 
supports AML’s claim for loss of inheritance. Instead, it suggests that such a 
claim is not maintainable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">70<span>       </span> I come now 
to my decision in <i>Tan Harry</i>. There, the dependants were aged parents of 
the deceased who died intestate on 1 October 1999 after an anaesthetic 
procedure administered by the first defendant. The deceased was not married and 
had no children. One of the issues there was the amount of the multiplicand. The 
plaintiffs contended that the multiplicand used by the assistant registrar 
should be increased by, <i>inter alia</i>, taking into account 50% of the 
deceased’s savings. I did not take into account the deceased’s savings because 
it was unlikely that the plaintiffs would have outlived the deceased but for the 
unfortunate incident. It can be argued that had the plaintiffs been the younger 
wife and children of the deceased, I would have taken into account the savings 
and hence, in principle, a claim for loss of savings is maintainable in a 
dependency claim. However, in <i>Tan Harry,</i> it was assumed that loss of 
savings was a maintainable claim in a dependency claim. Neither counsel for the 
first defendant, <i>ie</i> the anaesthetist, or counsel for the second 
defendant, <i>ie</i> the hospital, had taken the point that a claim for loss of 
savings is really an estate claim and hence not maintainable in view of the 1987 
amendment. On the facts in <i>Tan Harry</i>, I did not take into account the 
loss of savings, but for a different reason. In the circumstances, <i>Tan 
Harry</i> is not authority for the proposition that a claim for loss of savings 
is maintainable in a dependency claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">71<span>       </span> As I 
mentioned in <i>Tan Harry</i>, the <i>Practitioners’ Library –</i>
<span> </span> <i>Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal 
Accidents</i> (Butterworths Asia, 2001) suggests that the dependency claim is 
calculated by adding up all the benefits received by the dependants or by 
splitting the deceased’s income into what he would have spent on himself and on 
his dependants. There is no express mention therein about loss of savings 
although that is not expressly excluded either. It seems to me that if loss of 
savings were part of a dependency claim, it would have been expressly mentioned 
as a head of claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">72<span>       </span> It seems 
that, generally, cases in England and in Hong Kong deal with loss of savings as 
a part of earned income. This is different from the kind of claim which AML is 
making under loss of inheritance. AML is claiming for something over and above 
HAL’s earned income. In that context, loss of savings is not interchangeable 
with loss of inheritance.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">73<span>       </span> Coming back 
to the speech of Prof Jayakumar when he was moving the second reading of 
the Bill on the 1987 amendments, the minister was clearly aware of amendments 
made in the UK and in Hong Kong as he had alluded to them. He said similar 
amendments had been made in other countries but he did not say identical 
amendments had been made there. He must have been aware that in Hong Kong the 
claim for loss of savings is not part of the dependency claim and was saved for 
the estate claim. As I have said, the Hong Kong amendment allows a claim for 
loss of accumulation of wealth which is potentially larger than a claim for loss 
of savings <i>per se</i>. Singapore does not have that provision. The question 
then is whether Singapore omitted to provide for a loss of inheritance or loss 
of savings claim for the estate claim because that was already part of the 
dependency claim or irrespective of it being excluded from the dependency claim. 
I am of the view that it was the latter. Such a claim has not been recognised as 
such by the Singapore courts. While this may appear unjust to claimants like 
AML, there are considerations at the other end of the scale. Such claims are by 
nature in the minority. The majority of people working in Singapore would be 
salaried workers, not entrepreneurs. Even among entrepreneurs, not all are 
successful and few can claim to be very successful. Of those few, there would be 
some who pay themselves modest salaries and bonuses while keeping the rest of 
their gains for accumulation of further wealth. Others would still pay 
themselves huge salaries and bonuses while also keeping a part of their gains 
for accumulation of further wealth. However, in either case, where the 
entrepreneur has been very successful, the claim for loss of inheritance would 
be very large indeed. Such a burden would eventually be borne by the public who 
pay premiums for all kinds of insurance cover. A few would benefit at the 
expense of the majority. In any event, it is not for this court to say how the 
scales should be balanced. Suffice it for me to conclude that at present, the 
Legislature has decided that the scales should be in favour of the majority by 
not including the Hong Kong proviso which allows an estate to claim for loss of 
accumulation of wealth. For present purposes, I equate the loss of accumulation 
of wealth with a loss of inheritance although the former would probably not 
include the kind of claim for loss of inheritance as in <i>Adsett v West</i>
<span>[1983] QB 826<i>.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">74<span>       </span> I would 
mention that to allow dependants to claim for loss of inheritance would be to 
introduce a host of complexities. Supposing a child dependant would remain a 
dependant for only one more year after the death of the deceased but 
nevertheless has a reasonable expectation of being a beneficiary of the estate 
as she is named as a beneficiary in the deceased’s will. Will that child be 
entitled to claim her entire share of the loss of inheritance proportionate to 
what was given to her in the will or only a small percentage thereof, and if the 
latter, how would that percentage be calculated? Take another example. Supposing 
a wife has her own successful career and is dependent on her husband to a small 
extent, but enough to qualify her as a dependant. There are child dependants who 
enjoy more financial support from the deceased when he was living than the wife 
but the children will not remain as dependants for very much longer. The wife is 
named as the main beneficiary in the deceased’s will. Would that mean that she 
is entitled to claim more for herself than the children in the loss of 
inheritance claim?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">75<span>       </span> Perhaps it 
is preferable to allow an estate claim for loss of inheritance with a cap on the 
quantum and with a qualification that such a claim is permissible only to the 
extent that the beneficiaries of the estate are also dependants so as to avoid 
benefiting distant relatives of the deceased. That will not address all the 
complexities I have mentioned and others not mentioned, but it will address the 
apparent injustice that someone like AML will face. In any event, that is a 
matter for the Legislature, as I have said.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">76<span>       </span> I should 
mention that Mr Hwang also referred to cases from the US, Canada and 
Australia to support the claim for loss of inheritance. It is unnecessary for me 
to deal with them as they do not assist me to reach a conclusion on the 
Singapore position. It is also unnecessary for me to refer to the various 
textbooks which Mr Hwang cited as they rely on cases which I have dealt 
with.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Quantum of the claim for 
loss of inheritance</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">77<span>       </span> In the 
circumstances, the quantum of the claim for loss of inheritance is academic. 
However, as much time was spent on this issue, I will say something about it.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">78<span>       </span> HAL had 
attended Georgia State College on a scholarship. After graduation, he began 
working as an actuary with Life Insurance Company. In 1970, he resigned from his 
job and began selling life insurance with Aetna Life &amp; Consulting Company 
(“Aetna”) and sold life insurance policies with premiums amounting to more than 
one million dollars. It was during this period that he began to study real 
estate investments. While selling life insurance, he began to make investments 
in real estate and deal in real estate on weekends. By 1972, he quit his job at 
Aetna and devoted his efforts to using real estate to accumulate 
wealth.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">79<span>       </span> In the 
early 1970s, HAL bought inexpensive land in outlying rural areas, sub-divided 
them and sold the sub-divided land to others. By the middle of the 1970s, he 
focused on buying timber land. He would sell standing timber on the land before 
completing his land purchases. In this way, he used the proceeds of the timber 
sales to pay for most or all of the purchase prices for the land and standing 
timber. He was a very hardworking man, working at least 16 hours a day for seven 
days a week and subsequently, lesser hours on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. He 
had no hobbies.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">80<span>       </span> HAL 
rewarded himself modestly, as much of the available funds were reinvested in 
land or used to pay bank borrowings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">81<span>       </span> In 1983, 
HAL moved his business office from a house to an office complex. By the end of 
the 1980s, HAL and a business partner, James Baker, were in the process of 
building a 58,000 sq ft, freestanding office building or corporate 
centre.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">82<span>       </span> In 1983, 
HAL’s family moved to a larger home and he invested in a condominium unit in 
Florida where the family took their summer vacations.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">83<span>       </span> From 1990, 
HAL’s salaried income from the two companies he controlled increased. The two 
companies were Lassiter Properties, Inc (“LP”) in which he had a 100% interest 
and MDI International, Inc (“MDI”) in which he had a 98% interest. On 
6 February 1991, HAL also obtained a lease and option to purchase an 
approximately 10,000 sq ft house in Emerald Drive which was the only 
house situated on a four-acre peninsula on Lake Spivey in South 
Atlanta.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">84<span>       </span> 
Dr Bruce A Seaman was the expert witness for AML’s claim for loss of 
inheritance. He has an impressive <i>curriculum vitae</i>. He is a tenured 
Associate Professor of Economics and a Senior Associate in the Fiscal Research 
Program in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University 
at Atlanta, Georgia. He formerly served as Chair of the Department of Economics. 
He also has other appointments and was President of the Association for Cultural 
Economics International at the time he issued his first and supplemental reports 
on February 2001 and 2002. He has various professional affiliations and awards. 
He has various fields of specialisation including Law and Economics/Forensic 
Economics and Economic Impact Analysis. He has numerous publications and has 
extensive experience as an expert witness in civil trials and has testified in 
numerous trials involving damages related to the value of a deceased’s life in 
cases throughout the US.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">85<span>       </span> In his 
first report, Dr Seaman noted that HAL’s estate was estimated at about 
$39.1m as at the date of his death. Using a five-year period from 1985 to 1990 
as an example, he said HAL’s net wealth grew from about $25m to about $150m. The 
compound annual growth rate was nearly 43%. Notwithstanding some financial 
problems confronted by HAL in the early 1990s which HAL had to deal with through 
the bankruptcy courts, Dr Seaman was of the view that this led to a 
temporary reduction in HAL’s wealth at the time of death and HAL was “again 
poised to accumulate wealth”. Using 20% or 25% of the 43% compound annual growth 
rate would yield a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% or 10.75%. Assuming HAL 
worked until 70 years of age, Dr Seaman estimated HAL’s net worth to be 
about $234m to $358m. If these figures were calculated to the value as at, say, 
the date of his first report, <i>ie</i> 15 February 2001, Dr Seaman 
estimated the loss of inheritance to be between about $98m to $149m, but in any 
case, no lower than about $66m.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">86<span>       </span> In 
Dr Seaman’s supplemental report dated 25 February 2002, he included an 
alternative approach by suggesting a 10.75% growth rate between 1994 to 2001 and 
4.3% growth rate (being half of 8.6%) beyond 27 February 2002. HAL would 
have accumulated about $155m. The present value of that sum as at 
27 February 2002 would be about $69m.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">87<span>       </span> However, 
Mr Loh submitted that Dr Seaman was an unreliable witness.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">88<span>       </span> Firstly, he 
submitted that although Dr Seaman had mentioned that HAL had faced some 
financial complications through the bankruptcy courts, Dr Seaman had not 
stated plainly in either of his reports that HAL had in fact filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1991.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">89<span>       </span> Secondly, 
although Dr Seaman had listed the documents he had considered for his 
reports, he did not list any bankruptcy documents which he subsequently admitted 
he had considered, like a reorganisation plan and disclosure 
statement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">90<span>       </span> Thirdly, 
during the evidence-in-chief of Dr Seaman, he decided to lower his 
assessment about the loss of inheritance to 45% of $66m, <i>ie</i> about $30m, 
which he said would be his most defensible case for loss of 
inheritance.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">91<span>       </span> Fourthly, 
Mr Loh submitted that Dr Seaman had not mentioned in his reports the 
change in banking regulations from 1990 resulting in a savings and loan crisis 
(“S&amp;L crisis”) which affected the viability of HAL’s real estate business. 
Loans were no longer easily available for the purchase of undeveloped land. On 
the other hand, Dr Seaman claimed during cross-examination that he had 
taken the S&amp;L crisis into account as it changed how HAL was going to do 
business.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">92<span>       </span> Fifthly, 
Dr Seaman had used the years 1985 to 1990 to derive the compounded annual 
growth rate of nearly 43%. However, this was the highest growth rate for HAL. 
The period between 1990 and 1994 would show instead a negative growth 
rate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">93<span>       </span> Sixthly, 
Dr Seaman had not mentioned in either of his reports that HAL had been 
indicted under the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization 
(“RICO”) Act which would affect his standing with banks. Dr Seaman claimed 
in cross-examination that he had taken this into account.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">94<span>       </span> Seventhly, 
Mr Loh criticised some errors in calculations made by Dr Seaman which 
it is not necessary for me to set out.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">95<span>       </span> Eighthly, 
Mr Loh pointed out that Dr Seaman was floating around various figures 
as the loss of inheritance. I have mentioned some of them above. Others were 
mentioned by Dr Seaman during oral testimony.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">96<span>       </span> Ninthly, 
Dr Seaman had claimed during cross-examination that HAL’s estate was worth 
actually $100m as at the date of his death. It was reduced to $39.1m because of 
a downward adjustment made by the US government because of a key man discount 
since HAL was no longer around. However, eventually Dr Seaman had to accept 
that no such discount was applied to reach the $39.1m figure.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">97<span>       </span> Tenthly, 
Mr Loh submitted that Dr Seaman’s recommendations relied heavily on 
the views of others as Dr Seaman did not know HAL personally. 
Dr Seaman himself said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">However, there is no doubt that at the 
time of his death, he was again poised to continue to accumulate wealth, as 
attested to by the other affidavits and financial documents that serve as a 
record in this case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">98 
<span>      </span> I am of the view that the 
arguments made by Mr Loh were well taken. Notwithstanding Mr Hwang’s 
attempts to counter Mr Loh’s arguments in order to portray Dr Seaman 
as a reliable and conservative expert witness, it is clear to me that 
Dr Seaman was nothing of the sort. It was telling that Mr Hwang made 
the following oral submissions before me:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> 
“</span><span lang="EN-GB">At the end of the day, I would not place so much 
emphasis on Dr Seaman’s evidence as expert evidence. He is putting together 
a bunch of assumptions. In saying how much [HAL] would have earned, his guess is 
as good as yours or mine”;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> 
“</span><span lang="EN-GB">He is a vehicle for a mathematical table of 
possibilities”;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> 
“</span><span lang="EN-GB">Seaman gave us a platform to make our arguments which 
we could have made without him”;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span>       </span> 
“</span><span lang="EN-GB">We do not rely on Dr Seaman as the primary prover 
of the point that [HAL] was poised to accumulate wealth”;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e)<span>       </span> 
“</span><span lang="EN-GB">All we are offering Dr Seaman for is to offer a 
methodology”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span>99       </span> 
Furthermore, AML herself was not a credible witness. In her first affidavit of 
evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), she had suggested that things were looking up from 
1990. For example, she said in para 21 of her first AEIC that by 1990, HAL 
was not required to reinvest every dollar in the business to reach his goals. 
Commencing in 1990 until his death in 1994, his salaried income from LP and MDI 
steadily increased. Paragraph 22(a) of her first AEIC mentioned how, in 
February 1991, HAL obtained a lease and option to purchase the Emerald Drive 
property I have mentioned. Paragraphs 40 and 41 of her first AEIC stated 
how HAL’s land dealings were conducted in his own personal way and as there was 
no one to take his place, AML had to adopt a ten-year liquidation plan for LP 
and HAL’s individual land holdings. Paragraph 42 of her first AEIC stated 
that HAL was providing the leadership, vision and direction, and financing for 
MDI. In the preceding years before his death, MDI had been increasing its gross 
revenues and net profits. MDI continued to operate profitably in 1995 as a 
result of momentum but because of the void in leadership, vision and direction 
caused by HAL’s death, MDI started to experience a net operating loss from 1996 
which increased annually. By 1999, MDI itself had to file for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">100<span>     </span> 
As Mr Loh submitted, although LP was HAL’s main business, AML’s first AEIC 
did not dwell on its business between 1990 and 1994 and focused instead on MDI. 
It was after Dr Seaman’s first report was disclosed that Mr Loh had an 
inkling about the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings involving HAL and three 
of his companies, <i>ie</i> LP, Ansley Development Corporation and Little 
Henry’s Food Stores Inc. Mr Loh subsequently learnt that on 4 November 
1991, HAL had filed such proceedings for himself and the three companies. LP 
actually had a negative worth of $5.497m as at HAL’s death.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">101<span>     </span> 
Even for MDI, the Disclosure Statement filed for its own bankruptcy proceedings 
revealed that increasing revenues disguised some fundamental problems that had 
developed by early 1994, <i>ie</i> before HAL’s death, and ultimately proved 
impossible to overcome. This Disclosure Statement listed five factors for the 
fundamental problems:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> MDI’s 
products were subjected to increasing competition from other companies. By the 
beginning of 1994, the Small Computer Systems Interface (“SCSI”) Express product 
of MDI was experiencing competition from companies which were much better 
capitalised than MDI and therefore enjoyed much larger budgeting for marketing, 
and for research and development;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> MDI’s 
concentration on a Novell operating platform subjected its products to 
competition from Microsoft NT;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> MDI was 
not able to reorient its SCSI Express products to Microsoft NT 
because:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(i)<span>        </span> MDI 
had limited funds to undertake the necessary research and 
development;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(ii)<span>       </span> MDI had 
aligned itself with Novell as a marketing partner, and had embedded itself in a 
distribution and reseller network which was oriented toward Novell 
products;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span>       </span> Novell 
changed its relationship from a marketing partner to a competitor;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e)<span>       </span> The 
two-tier sales channel MDI used was falling apart due to a series of 
consolidations, bankruptcies and liquidations of distributors with whom MDI had 
traditionally done business.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">102<span>     </span> 
A sixth factor was the death of HAL. However, as Mr Loh pointed out, a 
Mercer Capital valuation report, which had been prepared for estate filing, had 
mentioned that HAL had been withdrawing money from MDI to repay part of his 
loans to MDI because of his other financial commitments and so critical 
investments were not being made in product development and in strengthening the 
balance sheet.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">103<span>     </span> 
Mr Hwang, however, relied on Daniel Pieplow’s evidence that had HAL been 
alive, he would have addressed MDI’s problems. Mr Pieplow was the Chief 
Financial Officer of MDI. Yet, HAL’s involvement in MDI was described in a 
newspaper article as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">As he begins to expand and diversify his 
holdings … Lassiter will have to bring in outside talent, partners and 
expertise. And he’ll have to curb his compulsive risk taking. A case in point: 
In 1987 Lassiter invested $3 million in Micro Design International Inc … With no 
knowledge for computers, Lassiter apparently based the investment on an employee 
who heard about the deal from a neighbour who knew a fellow who knew the man who 
ran the company. Two years later Lassiter filed suit … claiming he’d been duped 
… The case has since been settled with Lassiter now assuming total control of 
Micro Design.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">104<span>     </span> 
It seems to me that in view of MDI’s problems even when HAL was alive, HAL was 
not the panacea for MDI’s problems as Mr Pieplow wanted to believe. 
However, the same newspaper article also described HAL as a driven self-made 
millionaire from the wrong side of Atlanta and described his one goal in life to 
be a billionaire and his overriding interest to be to catch and surpass the 
ultimate dealmeister, Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">105<span>     </span> 
Mr Hwang emphasised that HAL was a healthy, hardworking, intelligent, 
experienced and skilled entrepreneur. He was not a one-trick pony. Furthermore, 
HAL’s estate was worth $39.1m and this was a figure assessed by the relevant 
government organisation in the US.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">106<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh argued that the estate was hardly worth anything. HAL’s gross estate 
was supposed to be worth $57.1m. From that sum, $10.1m should be deducted for 
insurance. He had debts of about $7.9m leaving a net amount of about $39.1m. Of 
this sum, about $20m was in stocks and bonds and this included stocks in MDI 
which was valued at about $18.3m by Mercer Capital but which eventually turned 
out to be worthless. There was also a loan of about $6.8m by HAL to MDI which 
would also be worthless since MDI was going down. Mr Loh also submitted 
that even AML had claimed that MDI was not worth $18.3m in order to minimise 
estate taxes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">107<span>     </span> 
I am of the view that even if MDI were worthless, HAL’s estate was still worth 
about $14m, <i>ie</i> after deducting $18.3m and $6.8m from $39.1m. Furthermore, 
as Mr Hwang had stressed, HAL himself was not insolvent although he was 
facing liquidity problems. The Chapter 11 reorganisation for HAL and his 
three companies received creditor support and they were supposed to be paid 
100 cents to the dollar with interest at prime plus one per cent although 
this would be over perhaps 15 years. There was no suggestion of any default. I 
accept that with the reorganisation, HAL would have been free to engage in 
deals. He was a hardworking self-made man with proven entrepreneurial skills. 
This is not a case of an infant victim where the evidence about the ability to 
earn income or accumulate wealth would be sparse.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">108<span>     </span> 
On the other hand, HAL’s successes were more in respect of his property deals 
for which he would have had to be able to borrow large sums of money easily. He 
would not be able to do this with the change in banking regulations. Secondly, 
his reputation would have been tarnished by the Chapter 11 proceedings and 
the charges under the Georgia RICO Act. Thirdly, he took great risks. In the 
same newspaper article I have mentioned, AML was quoted as saying:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[HAL] is a gambler. He thrives on it. If 
something went wrong, we’d be gone tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">109 <span>    </span> In 
the circumstances, while it may be likely that HAL would have been able to 
continue providing AML with the same level of financial support as he had done 
before his death, it is difficult to say that he would have continued to 
accumulate wealth to the tune of millions of dollars and to say exactly how much 
wealth he would have accumulated. Accordingly, I would not have awarded more 
than $1m for loss of inheritance if that claim were maintainable in a dependency 
claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Loss of 
support</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">110<span>     </span> 
As regards the claim for loss of support, Mr Loh submitted that because AML 
would derive income from HAL’s estate which was assessed at $39.1m, the interest 
on that alone would be sufficient to compensate AML for her loss of support. 
Hence, AML had in fact suffered no loss. Mr Loh relied on <i>dicta</i> in 
<i>Kandalla v British Airways Board</i> [1980] 1 All ER 341, where 
Griffith J said at 349:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">As a further illustration, consider the 
position of a very high earner of 38 years of age who is also possessed of a 
large fortune. Suppose he is contributing £10,000 per annum to the support of 
his wife and family during his lifetime and on his death leaves them an estate 
of, say, £500,000. The interest on the estate is more than adequate to replace 
the dependency of £10,000 per annum and so the accelerated benefit from the 
estate extinguishes any Fatal Accidents Acts claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">111<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh also submitted that although I had said in <i>Tan Harry</i> that 
there should be no deduction for whatever a younger spouse may receive by way of 
inheritance, I should re-consider that decision. I also mention that although 
AML was of the same age as HAL, Mr Loh did not suggest that she was likely 
to pre-decease HAL but for the accident and Mr Loh’s argument was on the 
premise that AML would have survived HAL but for HAL’s accident.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">112<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh’s argument about interest being earned on HAL’s estate of $39.1m was 
on the contingency that I might not agree with his contention that HAL’s estate 
was not worth that amount at the time of his death.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">113<span>     </span> 
In any event, whether HAL’s estate was worth $31.1m, or $14m if MDI were 
worthless, I am of the view that I should not take into account the interest 
earned from the capital for the purpose of determining the quantum of AML’s loss 
of support.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">114<span>     </span> 
In <i>Tan Harry</i>, I had referred to the Privy Council decision in <i>Kassam v 
Kampala Aerated Water Co Ltd</i> [1965] 2 All ER 875. In that case, 
the Privy Council decided that there should not be a deduction in a dependency 
claim for the acceleration of benefit which the young dependants had received 
from the estate of the deceased, having regard to the anticipated savings which 
the deceased might reasonably have been expected to make. This decision was 
cited with approval by Choor Singh J in <i>Neo Seo Thun v Ng Peng Hui</i> 
[1975–1977] SLR 345. In <i>Tan Harry</i>, I was of the view that there 
should not be any deduction for the acceleration of benefit where the dependants 
would in any event ultimately inherit the assets, although at a later time. That 
view was expressed in the context of the question as to whether there should be 
a deduction for the acceleration of capital. If there should not be a deduction 
for the acceleration of capital, there should also not be a deduction for the 
interest earned on capital. I see no reason to depart from the view I expressed 
in <i>Tan Harry</i> on the point.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">115<span>     </span> 
It was not suggested by Mr Loh that the capital as at HAL’s death would 
have been eventually lost by HAL had he not been killed. In any case, that is 
too speculative an occurrence for me to give any weight to.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">116<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh also submitted that AML should not be entitled to claim for loss of 
support because, after HAL’s death, AML was drawing salaries from LP and MDI in 
excess of what HAL had been providing her. Mr Loh relied on <i>Yap Ami v 
Tan Hui Pang</i> <nobr>[1982] 2 MLJ 316</nobr> (“<i>Yap Ami</i>”). In that case, 
the deceased was killed in a hunting accident. He was a partner in a business 
and was drawing a certain sum per month. After his death, the partnership 
continued to pay the dependants what the deceased used to draw. The trial judge 
found that there the dependants did not suffer any loss. In fact they were 
getting more than when the deceased was still living as he would have retained a 
portion of what was drawn for his personal needs. The dependants’ appeal to the 
Federal Court of Malaysia was dismissed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">117<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh also referred to <i>Jung Estate</i> <i>v Krimmer</i> (1990) 
47 BCLR (2d) 145 (“<i>Jung</i>”). The deceased was a director of a company. 
He was drawing a salary of $74,000 of which he provided $36,000 for family 
expenses. After he died, his widow drew a director’s fee of $50,000. In that 
case, the widow did not claim for loss of dependency.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">118<span>     </span> 
Therefore, although Mr Loh accepted that the law is such that what a 
dependant earns after the death of the deceased should be disregarded for the 
claim for loss of support, Mr Loh submitted that an exception exists where 
the dependant does not actually go out to the market and get a job but continues 
to draw the deceased’s salary in his stand as in the cases of <i>Yap Ami</i> and 
<i>Jung</i>. Mr Loh relied on AML’s evidence that as chairperson of the 
board of LP, she had no choice other than to adopt a ten-year liquidation plan 
for LP. As the chairperson of the board of MDI, she had attempted to retain 
managers but eventually MDI was no longer able to continue its operations. 
Mr Loh also relied on the evidence of Mr Pieplow who said that when 
AML and one of her daughters became involved in MDI, they did not really have 
any experience and one of the first things that had to be done was to make up a 
dictionary to explain basic terms to them. Thus Mr Loh submitted that AML 
was not employed by LP and MDI for her abilities but rather so that she could 
draw salaries from these two companies.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">119<span>     </span> 
I am prepared to accept that AML was paid, not so much for her abilities but 
because she was the wife of HAL. However, there was insufficient evidence before 
me to say how much should be attributed solely to her efforts and how much to 
her status as HAL’s wife. While AML was overpaid, this is different from saying 
that she was paid for doing nothing. It appears that she did put in additional 
effort to do what she could, even if that was not enough.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">120<span>     </span> 
In <i>Yap Ami</i>, there was no suggestion that any of the dependants had done 
anything to earn the amount paid by the business after the deceased’s death. In 
<i>Jung</i>, the plaintiff did not pursue a claim for what the deceased had been 
paid and so it is of limited persuasive weight.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">121<span>     </span> 
Ultimately, AML had to take on certain roles in LP and MDI which she would not 
have had to if HAL had not been killed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">122<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh further argued that from 1997 onwards, AML’s salary began to dwindle 
because of the eventual collapse of MDI as well as LP. For LP, it had a negative 
value as at HAL’s death. Accordingly, Mr Loh submitted that even if HAL had 
been alive, the financial support he had been providing would have been 
similarly reduced.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">123<span>     </span> 
In my view, this argument assumes that HAL would not have been able to turn 
things around and that he would not have been able to engage in other deals 
which would have been profitable. I am not prepared to make that 
assumption.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">124<span>     </span> 
In the circumstances, I am of the same view as the AR that AML is entitled to 
claim for loss of support and there is to be no deduction either for interest on 
capital inherited or for the amounts she earned from LP and MDI after HAL’s 
death. I come now to the multiplicand for loss of support.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Multiplicand</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">125<span>     </span> 
Paragraph 4(c) of the Statement of Claim asserts that HAL gave a total of 
$250,000 as financial support for AML and her four daughters. Yet, in 
para 22(e) of AML’s first AEIC, she alleged that at the time of HAL’s 
death, he was providing approximately $160,000 per year either by direct 
payments to her or in kind for her daughters and herself. Then, in para 28 
of the same affidavit, AML said she had various needs for support which HAL 
would have provided and she listed out various items totalling $294,199 per 
year. Subsequently, in the Opening Statement for AML for the assessment, her 
claim for loss of support was reduced to $198,516 per year.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">126<span>     </span> 
Mr Siva Murugaiyan, who was AML’s other counsel, sought to explain the 
discrepancy between the figures of $160,000 per year and $198,516 per year in 
paras 5 to 6 of his written submission as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5.<span>        </span> In 
paragraph 22(e) of the Plaintiff’s affidavit, she has put forward a sum of 
US$160,000.00. The difference[s] between this sum and the present sum of 
US$198,516.00 are essentially as follows.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span>       </span> As regards 
clothing and food, the $160,000.00 per year claim includes $15,600.00 per year 
for “food, clothing and incidentals”. The present claim separates food 
($11,511.00) and clothing ($15,000.00). The difference of $10,911.00 per year 
relates primarily to the portion for food.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span>       </span> The 
$160,000.00 only included a sum of $3,600.00 for transport which only took into 
account a monthly charge of $300.00. Whereas the present claim for 
transportation is for $15,386.00 per annum which includes other costs of running 
a car including purchase, insurance and maintenance. This accounts for a 
difference of $11,786.00.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span>       </span> The 
$160,000.00 claim did not include any medical expenses. The present claim 
includes medical expenses of $3,059.00.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span>       </span> The 
$160,000.00 per year amount did not include health insurance. The present claim 
includes health insurance of $2,370.00.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e)<span>       </span> The 
$160,000.00 per year claim did not include entertainment. The present updated 
claim includes $4,598.00 for entertainment. Paragraph 22 overlooked any 
expenses for entertainment, though HAL provided entertainment, usually by cash 
outlays.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(f)<span>       </span> The 
$160,000.00 sum also did not include miscellaneous incidentals which would 
inevitably be incurred in the normal course of life. The present claim for 
$198,516.00 includes a sum of $3,892.00.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6.<span>        </span> The 
above sums add up to $36,616.00 which is approximately the difference between 
the present claim of $198,516.00 and the $160,000.00 claim put forward in 
paragraph 22.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">127 <span>    </span> 
However, this submission did not explain how AML had come to make the alleged 
errors in the first place or why four sets of figures had been advanced for loss 
of support for AML and her daughters.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">128<span>     </span> 
Mr Murugaiyan also submitted that AML’s evidence (presumably he meant her 
evidence for the sum of $198,516) was supported by the evidence of Herman 
Kooymans who was the accountant of HAL personally as well as for LP and other 
affiliated companies since 1987.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">129<span>     </span> 
Paragraph 11 of Mr Kooymans’ first affidavit stated various amounts of 
money which HAL paid to AML or for her benefit. However, the amounts included 
salaries drawn by AML from LP. A breakdown of Mr Kooymans’ figures can be found 
in a report prepared by Mr Foong Daw Ching, an expert witness for the 
Driver. Mr Foong is a certified public accountant and a partner of 
M/s TeoFoongWongLCLoong. The breakdown is as follows:</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">130<span>     </span> 
So, even if the salary to AML were to be included and assuming Mr Kooymans’ 
figures above are correct, they would still show an annual figure of less than 
$160,000 per year, <i>ie</i> $525,396.05 ÷ 40 months x 12 months = $157,618.82 
per year, and not $198,516 per year.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">131<span>     </span> 
Paragraph 5.2.6 of Mr Foong’s report states that based on a review of 
the cheques exhibited in Mr Kooymans’ first affidavit, the total payment by 
HAL to AML for the same 40-month period does not exceed $326,011.49. This works 
out to less than $98,000 per year. Yet in para 6.2.3 of Mr Foong’s 
report where he commented on AML’s estimation of $160,000 per year, 
Mr Foong estimated the annual support to AML to be $130,000 per year at 
most, after deducting schooling expenses for the daughters. The AR had adopted 
this $130,000 as the multiplicand.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">132<span>     </span> 
Mr Kooymans had criticised Mr Foong’s estimation of $130,000 per year 
because AML had not included her daughter’s education expenses in 
para 22(e) of her first AEIC when she mentioned the figure of $160,000 per 
year. I note that while AML did not mention the daughter’s education expenses as 
part of the $160,000 figure, she did indicate that the $160,000 was to support 
her daughters and herself. In any event, Mr Foong had made his own checks 
and calculations from the documentary evidence supplied to support AML’s 
claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">133<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh submitted that AML’s salary from LP before HAL’s death should not be 
taken into account as loss of support, citing <i>Burgess v Management Committee 
of the Florence Nightingale Hospital for Gentlewomen</i> [1955] 
1 All ER 511 (“<i>Burgess</i>”). In that case, the widower was suing 
for his loss of dependency as a result of the death of his wife. They were 
professional dancers and it was his contention that his income had been affected 
as he could no longer have his wife as his dance partner. It was held in that 
case (as set out in the headnote of the report) that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[D]amages for injury to a husband 
resulting from the death of a wife were only recoverable under the Fatal 
Accidents Act, 1846, s 2, if they were attributable to the relationship of 
husband and wife, and as no benefit arose from the dancing partnership of the 
plaintiff and his wife which could properly be attributed to their relationship 
as husband and wife, no damages were recoverable for the value of the wife to 
the plaintiff as his dance partner.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">134<span>     </span> 
I am of the view that <i>Burgess</i> is not applicable to the facts before me. 
The salary which was paid to AML before HAL’s death was not because of her 
business relationship with HAL but because of their relationship as husband and 
wife. It was HAL’s way, <i>qua</i> husband, of providing AML with some financial 
support and apparently she did no work or little work to earn that 
salary.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">135<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh also submitted that Mr Foong’s figure of $130,000 per year did not 
take into account other expenses of the daughter although the Opening Statement 
for the Driver had urged that Mr Foong’s figures be adopted. It seems to be 
from Mr Foong’s summary worksheet that the expenses of the daughters, other 
than the educational expenses, were minor and I am not inclined to make a 
deduction for other expenses for the daughters.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">136<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh further submitted that AML had exercised her option to purchase the 
Emerald Drive property on 28 December 1995 and had reduced her outlay on 
the mortgage of her house from $7,587.67 a month to $5,646.06 a month, a 
reduction of more than 25% or $23,299.08 per year. He submitted this should be 
taken into account as well. However, Mr Loh’s reference to p 29 of 
AML’s first AEIC to support this factual assertion is not borne out by the said 
p 29.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">137<span>     </span> 
In the circumstances, I am of the view that the multiplicand should remain as 
$130,000 per year.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Multiplier</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">138<span>     </span> 
After considering the range of multipliers in a number of local cases, HAL’s 
health, his hardworking habits and the nature of his work, the AR adopted a 
multiplier of eight years.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">139<span>     </span> 
Mr Murugaiyan had sought 16 years before the AR. Before me, he sought 14 to 
16, alternatively 12 or 13 and, then, at least 10 to 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">140<span>     </span> 
Mr Murugaiyan relied on a judgment of Judith Prakash J in <i>Lim Fook 
Lau v Kepdrill International Incorporated SA</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 917</nobr> where he claimed that the judge had said that it was not unusual for 
professionals or businessmen to work to their late 60s or even their 70s. That 
was not an accurate representation of what Prakash J said. What the judge 
said, at 921, [9], was that the deceased doctor, who died when she was nearly 30 
years old, “could probably have worked till her late 60s”. Prakash J then 
took the view that the deceased would therefore have a further working life of 
between 30 to 35 years but for the accident.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">141<span>     </span> 
Be that as it may, I accept that in view of HAL’s good health and working habits 
as well as his very ambitious character, it was likely that he would have worked 
to 70 years old. He was killed when he was 48 years old and AML was also 48 
years old then. Having considered the same range of multipliers as the AR did, I 
am of the view that a multiplier of ten years is fair.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">142<span>     </span> 
As I said in <i>Tan Harry</i>, the multiplier is to be calculated from the date 
of HAL’s death.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Claim for professional 
fees</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">143<span>     </span> 
After HAL’s death, the only will that was discovered was one made by him in 1970 
which did not take into account subsequent changes in the law which would have 
enabled HAL to devise all his assets to AML without taxes. As a result, the US 
government assessed HAL’s estate taxes to be about $14m plus interest which 
amounted to a total of about $20m. AML disputed the assessment on the grounds 
that prior to HAL’s departure to Singapore and his death, HAL had evinced an 
intention to update his estate planning and execute a new will to take into 
account changes in the law. Consequently, lawyers’ fees, valuers’ fees, 
accountants’ fees and other related expenses were incurred to dispute the US 
government’s assessment. The amount incurred was said to be $1,269,422.33, 
although the pleadings claimed a total of $984,971 only for such expenses. The 
US Tax Court ruled in favour of the estate on 19 October 2000 that no taxes were 
payable. Mr Hwang submitted that had the US Tax Court not ruled 
accordingly, the $20m tax would have been a separate head of claim under the 
principle in <i>Davies v Whiteways Cyder Co Ltd</i> [1975] QB 262 
(“<i>Davies</i>”). Accordingly, he submitted that AML should be entitled to 
claim the professional fees incurred to avoid such taxes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">144<span>     </span> 
In <i>Davies</i>, the deceased had made gifts of property and money to his wife 
and son. Within seven years of the gifts, he was killed in an accident. 
Accordingly, the value of the gifts was taken into account for the purpose of 
estate duty and an additional sum became payable as estate duty. The widow and 
son claimed, <i>inter alia</i>, the additional estate duty against the owners 
and driver of the lorry which had collided with the deceased’s car. 
O’Connor J allowed this claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">145<span>     </span> 
Mr Loh submitted that <i>Davies</i> is distinguishable on the facts. There 
the gifts had already accrued to the dependants. Mr Loh submitted that 
<i>Davies</i> is not authority for the proposition that a dependant can claim 
for post-mortem estate planning. The AR decided that AML’s claim for the 
professional fees did not fall within a dependency claim as it was an estate 
claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">146<span>     </span> 
I am also of the view that such a claim is an estate claim and not a dependency 
claim. Therefore, I will not allow it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">147<span>     </span> 
The tax initially imposed was for the account of the estate and the expenses 
incurred to avoid the tax was for the benefit of the estate. Any benefit which 
AML would have derived from HAL’s estate would have been <i>qua</i> beneficiary 
of the estate and not <i>qua</i> dependant.</span></p>

In Mr Hwang’s summary of reliefs claimed, there is an item of $85,000 for 
post-trial non-recurring expenses for the weddings of Christy and Cheryl 
Lassiter. The AR had awarded $60,000 for such expenses. As AML’s appeal had been 
confined to a claim for herself as dependant, it is not open for AML to claim 
for an increase for such expenses. Secondly, this claim was not even pleaded. 
Thirdly, no reason was given to show that the AR’s decision on this claim was 
wrong. Therefore, I will not increase the aforesaid wedding expenses to 
$85,000.</span></p>
