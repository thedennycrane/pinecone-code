Cur Adv Vult</em></strong></font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Introduction</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        This action arose out of

the proposed development of a 7- screen cineplex at Parkway Parade Shopping Centre

("Parkway Parade"). It was a sizeable project no less complicated by the fact

that the site for the proposed cineplex was to be on common property belonging to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        As early as 1994, the

parties to this action were in discussions for the development of the cineplex. Initially,

the proposal was for the Plaintiffs to undertake the construction of the cineplex and

thereafter lease the cineplex for 21 years from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. Some years

later, owing to changes in circumstances, the Plaintiffs decided not to undertake the

entire project. Further negotiations for a revised development scheme where the Plaintiffs

would only lease the cineplex started in March 1999. Negotiations between the parties came

to an end with the sale of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants’ interest in Parkway Parade

in February 2000. In the end, no lease was signed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        In this action, the

Plaintiffs are claiming repayment of various sums of money totalling $1,846,900 as money

had and received by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs’ use. The Defendants are

resisting the claim primarily on the ground that the money was part of the

Plaintiffs’ share of non-refundable differential premium paid to the Land Office for

permission to develop the proposed cineplex. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants assert that, on

the contrary, it is the Plaintiffs who owed them money. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants have

filed a cross-claim in this action for either $1,618,100 or $1,200,000 being the balance

of the Plaintiffs’ share of agreed contribution towards differential premium

("DP"). </p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The Parties</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        The 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs, United Artists Singapore Theatres Pte Ltd ("UAST"), are a company

incorporated in Singapore. At all material times, UAST managed and/or operated some

cinemas in Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs, Pacific Media PLC ("Pacific Media"), are a public listed company

incorporated in the United Kingdom and are in the media business. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs are a joint venture company of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs and United Artists

Theatre Circuit Ltd ("United Artists"). Both corporations exercise joint

management of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs. However, in late 1998 or thereabouts, Pacific

Media bought United Artists’ stake in UAST and consequently acquired full control of

the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs. That explains the change in the team involved in the

negotiations from Tom Elliot of United Artists in Denver, Colorado to Michael Buckley of

Pacific Media in London. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants, Parkway Properties Pte Ltd ("PPPL"), are a company incorporated in

Singapore and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parkway Holdings Limited ("PHL").

Until February 2000, PPPL owned 76% of the strata lots in Parkway Parade. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        The 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants, Management Corporation Strata Title Plan no. 1008 ("MCST"), are the

management corporation incorporated for Parkway Parade and is constituted under the Land

Titles (Strata) Act. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        PPPL and PHL were the

owners of Parkway Parade until it was sold in February 2000. Tan Kai Seng

("Tan") is a director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants and PHL. Tan’s

involvement with the cineplex project started about 1997. At all material times, he was

also chairman of MCST. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        At all material times, Soh

Seok Yian ("Elizabeth") was the Group Property Manager of the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants. She was also the executive director of Development Planning &amp; Management

Pte Ltd ("DPM") and she was involved in the cineplex project throughout. Until

the sale of Parkway Parade, DPM, a subsidiary company of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants,

was the managing agent of MCST. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        On the side of the

Plaintiffs, the dramatis personae were Tom Elliot of United Artists and Michael Buckley of

Pacific Media. Gary Quick became involved in the cineplex project from about February

1998. Gary Quick was the only witness for the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        For present purposes, I

will refer to the Defendants, DPM and PHL collectively as "Parkway", only

distinguishing between them where necessary to draw a distinction as between the status,

rights and obligations of the companies. It is apparent that in their dealings, the

parties made no distinction between DPM, MCST, PPPL and PHL.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The Witnesses</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        The negotiations over the

period of seven years were well documented. The written testimony of Gary Quick and of

Elizabeth with whom Tan adopted as his affidavit of evidence-in-chief provide a

chronological account of events reconstructed with the aid of contemporaneous documents in

the case. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        Tan and Elizabeth did not

have a good recollection of events than they actually had. Gary Quick was a shade better.

It is understandable, especially when their evidence is given years after the event. On

matters outside of what had been recorded in the contemporaneous documents, I am unable to

regard any of the three witnesses as reliable historians. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        The parties here have

documented the progress and outcome of their negotiations. The issue whether they have

entered into a binding contract at law, and if so on what terms, is primarily to be

resolved by construing, objectively, the documents in their factual setting. The

intentions of the individuals participating and their beliefs then or later, as to the

effect of the documents are irrelevant except to the limited extent to which such matters

form part of the factual setting. See <i>Harmony Shipping Co. S.A. v Saudi –Europe

Line Ltd</i> [ 1981] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 337 at 414.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        Therefore, the

testimonies of the witnesses on matters of individual intention and belief are, unless

they are properly material to the factual setting, excluded from my review of the evidence

in coming to a decision on whether there was:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(i)    a concluded and binding agreement between the

parties under either the original or revised plan and/or;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(ii)    a concluded and binding free-standing agreement

between the parties in respect of a contribution from the Plaintiffs towards the payment

of DP to the Land Office.</p>
<b xmlns=""><u>
<p align="justify">The Dispute</p></u>
<p align="justify">(1) The Plaintiffs’ case</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        The Plaintiffs’ case

for money had or received is pleaded on various alternative bases. They are: (i) total

failure of consideration; (ii) mistake of fact; (iii) recovery of monies

paid/deposits/advances made in the course of negotiations for a contract which never

materialised; (iv) recovery of monies/advances made in connection with a contract wholly

executory on the Defendants’ part or which had been terminated.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        Alternatively, the

Plaintiffs’ pleaded case is that, if there is a finding that there existed a binding

agreement between the parties prior to the sale of Parkway Parade, the Defendants are

liable for damages in the sum of $1,846,900 in that they had breached this agreement by

not ensuring that the new owners continue with the cineplex project with the Plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        In respect of a payment

in the sum of $346,900 made on 14 January 1999, the Plaintiffs’ pleaded case, as an

alternative to a claim for restitution, is based on the Defendants’ alleged agreement

to refund the money. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(2) The Defendants’ case</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        The Defendants say that

the total sum of $1,846,900 was the Plaintiffs’ partial payment of their share of

agreed contribution towards DP. They were paid to PPPL to on-pay to the Land Office or to

reimburse PPPL for payments made on the Plaintiffs’ behalf to the Land Office. The

Plaintiffs are therefore not entitled to claim the money back as money had and received.

The payments were not advances or deposits paid in the course of negotiations for a lease

of the cineplex. There was no total failure of consideration or operative mistake of fact.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        In any event, no

restitution is permissible at law, as the Defendants had changed their position in that

the money was paid to the Land Office and is not refundable. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        Further, the refund of

the sum of $346,900 was superseded by the Plaintiffs’ offer of 4 August 1999 to

utilise this money as part payment of DP which offer was accepted by the Defendants on 6

August 1999. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants alleged that as the Plaintiffs had agreed to contribute either $3,465,000 or

$3,046,900 towards DP, the Plaintiffs still owed them the sum of $1,618,100 or

alternatively $1,200,000 being DP paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants at the

Plaintiffs’ request and on their behalf. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants accordingly

counterclaim against the Plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants further pleaded that if the court finds that there was a binding contract to

lease the cineplex, they counterclaim the sum of $7,442,857 as damages.</p>
<b xmlns=""><u>
<p align="justify">Contract Claim</p></u>
<p align="justify">(1) Is there a binding agreement under either the original plan or

revised plan for a straight lease?</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        Although raised in

pleadings by both sides, it was not seriously argued that there was a concluded contract

under either the original or revised plan. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        In fact, on 2 May 2000,

lawyers acting for PPPL in the sale of Parkway Parade to Lend Lease took the position that

there was no concluded contract between the parties and they told the lawyers of Lend

Lease so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        In respect of both

arrangements, the documentation showed that the negotiations between the parties were

"subject to contract". I will first deal with the various exchanges of

correspondence pertaining to the original plan on this topic.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) Original Plan - Construction of shell structure, fit-out and lease

arrangement</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        In the early 1990s,

Parkway had envisaged a multiplex cinema in Parkway Parade. This project would involve

demolishing the play deck and construction of a cinema structure from the car park below.

In those days, Parkway was in discussions with Golden Village Entertainment (S) Pte Ltd

for the purchase of the common property at the top level of the Shopping Centre Podium

Block and for the construction and operation of a multiplex cinema. The idea back then in

1993 was for PPPL to enter into a joint venture with Golden Village Katong Pte Ltd. In the

end, negotiations came to naught. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        In 1994, United Artists

came on the scene. It expressed interest to construct and operate a cinema at Parkway

Parade. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        The site of the

development was to be on common property owned by MCST. Both PPPL and MSCT were interested

in turning the proposed site into an entertainment centre for Parkway Parade. For PPPL, it

would be a significant attraction to draw repeat visitors to Parkway Parade and improve

human traffic flow throughout the shopping centre thereby enhancing the value of the

property. MCST’s interest is that it would enjoy higher rental income for space that

was not being optimally used.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        As owner of Parkway

Parade, the project was very much led and driven by PPPL. PPPL’s participation was

important to the Plaintiffs. Under the Land Titles Act, a special resolution of 75%

majority in general meeting must be passed to approve improvements to the common area.

Together with an associated company, PPPL had a 78.9% majority, thus ensuring support for

the project. In that sense, Tan accepted that PPPL at all material times had effective

control of MCST (NE 536/539).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        Negotiations began as

long ago as August 1994. Up to early 1999, the arrangement envisaged was for the

Plaintiffs to take on the role of developer of the cineplex, design, manage and operate

the cineplex ("original plan"). The scheme involved the execution of a

Conditional Agreement dealing with the construction of the main structure of the cineplex

and execution of a Lease Agreement. The prospective contracting parties were UAST and

MCST.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.        In November 1995, Jones

Lang Wootton put together the outcome of initial discussions in a document entitled

"Principal Heads of Terms". It was forwarded on 15 November 1995 to Parkway for

approval and the lawyers to prepare the legal documentation. On the top right corner of

the document are the words "Subject to Contract and Management Corporation

Approval". This Principal Heads of Terms, under Jones Lang Wootton’s letterhead,

was unsigned. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.        Sometime thereafter, Chor

Pee &amp; Partners ("CPP") representing MCST drafted two documents: Conditional

Agreement and Lease Agreement. The first drafts of the Conditional Agreement and Lease

Agreement were dated 4 December 1995. After some discussions between United Artists and

Parkway, the revised drafts dated 30 January 1996 were forwarded to Tom Elliot on 31

January 1996. Later, a Corporate Guarantee was required. It would appear that in April

1996, a draft Corporate Guarantee was sent to United Artists for comments.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.        Gerald Crewe, Corporate

Counsel of United Artists, wrote to Parkway on 4 October 1996 for a soft copy of the

drafts. Parkway attended to the request and in the covering letter dated 7 October 1996,

Parkway told United Artists to take note that "the draft Conditional Agreement and

Lease and our draft Corporate Guarantee are Private &amp; Confidential and are Strictly

Subject to Contract". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.        The original plan was

unique in that the cinema operator rather than the landlord would fork out substantial

funds to develop the shell structure, fit out and operate the cineplex. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.        There were many

unresolved differences between the parties. As an illustration, on 13 December 1996,

United Artists informed Parkway and CPP that they have a great number of problems with the

third revised drafts of 18 October 1996 and feared an impasse because of very fundamental

differences.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.        Between December 1995 and

June 1998, no fewer that ten drafts of the Conditional Agreement and Lease Agreement were

prepared. They reflected the on-going negotiations that over the years had proceeded

somewhat languidly due to setbacks or events that had cropped up at different stages and

times. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.        The first in the series

of events concerned the unsuccessful planning application for the cineplex. There was

nearly a nine-month interval between the second and third drafts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.        On 6 February 1996, URA

refused the initial planning application for the cineplex. A fresh application was

submitted in April 1996. On 24 May 1996, the application was again rejected. An appeal was

lodged in June 1996. A re-submission of the planning application was made on 16 August

1996. Provisional permission was finally given on 15 November 1996. All in all planning

approval took over nine months to attain.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.        At the end of February

1996, United Artists expressed concern that having spent a lot of money on design and

redesigning for the cinema, approval of MCST had till then not been given. On 1 March

1996, Jones Lang Wootton informed United Artists that Parkway have obtained in principle

approval of Management Council of MCST. But, the matter was not brought to the General

Meeting as the amount of the development charge was at that time unknown. Management

Council wanted to be first apprised of MCST’s "potential liabilities i.e. the

development charge levy". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.        The parties only knew for

sure in November 1996 that DP rather than development charge was payable. Another setback

to the conclusion of the deal concerned the amount of DP assessed by the Land Office. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.        Until then the

discussions were premised on a desktop assessment of $10m with United Artists contributing

$3.465m. PPPL would support the cineplex with a contribution of up to a ceiling of $5m.

Should DP exceed $8.640m, the idea then was to ask the prospective landlord, MCST, to

contribute up to a sum of $1.535m <font size="3">(AB 446)</font>. In the overall scheme of

things, a corporate guarantee was required to secure the performance and compliance of

UAST during the period of construction should MCST be required to contribute to the

payment of DP. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.        By way of explanation,

the DP amount initially assessed by the Land Office on 6 March 1997 was $17.644m excluding

GST. Repeated appeals were lodged for a review and reassessment. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.        Unless the amount of DP

was reduced, the project would not be viable. The Plaintiffs were not disposed to discuss

the drafts until the issue of DP was resolved. For this reason, negotiations on the many

outstanding issues between CPP and Arthur Loke &amp; Partners ("ALP"),

representing the Defendants stopped in May 1997. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45.        The appeal and re-appeal

process were protracted and it was only after many months of representations that on 26

January 1998, the Land Office reassessed the amount of DP payable at $8.469m without GST. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46.        After the Land

Office’s decision, the matter was revived with CPP sending revised drafts of the

documents dated 19 February 1998 to ALP under cover of a letter of the same date. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47.        The decision of the Land

Office was announced at a time when United Artists itself was undergoing corporate

changes. It coincided with a merger of United Artist with two other US cinema operators

and a Dallas corporation acquiring United Artists as well Pacific Media’s decision to

increase its equity holding in UAST. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48.        Despite Defendants’

overtures for a commitment to the project, Pacific Media, who eventually took over United

Artists’ shares in UAST, was in no position to respond until the corporate exercise

was finalised and funding for the cineplex project approved and secured.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(ii) Revised Plan- straight lease arrangement</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49.        The ownership change of

UAST coincided with the Asian currency crisis in 1997/1998. In early 1999, Pacific Media

inquired of Parkway to help finance the building of the cineplex. Pacific Media raised

with Parkway the possibility of finding a contractor to build and finance the shell

structure.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50.        Owing to Pacific

Media’s financial constraints, the parties in March 1999 discussed and explored the

possibility of PPPL or its nominee, MCST, taking over the development of the shell

structure leaving the Plaintiffs responsible for the fitting out works and operation of

the cineplex under a lease (" the revised plan"). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51.        On 5 May 1999, the

Plaintiffs were informed that its <i>"offer [based on revised plan] for the operation

of the proposed multiplex will be considered a new undertaking - which is subject to

contract, and to further negotiations."</i> [emphasis added]</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52.        It was only after the

application for planning approval was transferred to MCST that Parkway in June 1999

started to show some interest in the Plaintiffs’ proposals for a straight lease

arrangement forwarded in March and May 1999. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53.        On 21 June 1999, Parkway

advised the Plaintiffs in a letter marked "Without Prejudice &amp; Subject to

Contract" that their offer to lease and operate the proposed cineplex was being

<p align="justify" xmlns="">55.        On this revised plan,

there were three working draft leases. The first working draft lease was dated 16

September 1999 followed by a second working draft on 25 November and the third dated 2

December 1999. The intended lease of the cineplex, which was to be executed between the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, was never signed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56.        In February 2000, the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants sold their interest in Parkway Parade. The Plaintiffs were told of the sale in

March 2000. With the sale, all negotiations between the Plaintiffs and Parkway on the

intended lease effectively ceased. In July 2000, the Plaintiffs indicated to the new

owners their decision to withdraw from the cineplex project.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57.        It is well settled that

the phrase "subject to contract" makes it clear that the intention of the

parties is that neither of them is to be contractually bound until a contract is signed.

The negotiations remain subject to and dependent upon the preparation of a formal

contract. Either party may withdraw from the negotiations before a final agreement has

been concluded: <i>Winn v Bull (1887) 7 Ch 29 at 32;</i> <i>Spottiswoode, Ballantyne &amp;

Co Ltd v Doreen Appliances Ltd</i> [1942] 2 KB 32 at 35; <i>Chillingworth v Esche </i>[1924] 1 Ch 97 at p 109 &amp; 114; <i>Derby &amp; Co Limited v ITC Pensions Trust Limited</i>

[1977] 2 AER 890 at 896. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58.        Elizabeth (DW1) was asked

for her understanding of the phrase "subject to contract". She said: "..we

usually use that [phrase] when negotiating terms with parties we deal with." She

agreed that ordinarily "subject to contract" means parties have to enter in a

written contract before terms are binding. To her understanding, the expression

"subject to contract " used in correspondence means the " contract has not

been signed [yet]." She was similarly aware that parties were entitled to cease

negotiations and walk away. Further, she was advised by CPP and in-house counsel to mark

her letter of 21 June 1999 "subject to contract". She confirmed that her lawyers

would have vetted her letter of 6 August 1999. Hence the suggestion that the letter was

marked "subject to contract" on legal advice. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59.        Tan (DW3) also was

familiar with and knew what the phrase "subject to contract" meant. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60.        Gary Quick (PW1) was

aware and accepted that further discussions or negotiations with Parkway under the revised

plan was "subject to contract". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61.        It is clear from the

relevant documents that the parties negotiated throughout on a "subject to

contract" basis so much so that until both parties executed a written contract, no

binding agreement could subsist. The communications between the parties are consistent and

reinforce the view that each side recognised that no binding contract was in existence.

The solicitors were working on the drafts of the formal contract or lease that were never

finalised and executed. This process started in 1995 under the original plan and then the

revised plan and continued right through to February 2000 with no fewer than thirteen

drafts being produced. </p>
<p xmlns="">62.        Given the history of this case, nature

and importance of the transaction, which was by no means insignificant in terms of

magnitude, complexity and cost, it is less likely that the parties would have wanted to

bind themselves on 6 August 1999. In my view, the 6 August letter, which was deliberately

made "subject to contract", was nothing more than a conditional acceptance of

the Plaintiffs’ overall rental package of 4 August 1999. The conditional acceptance

would result in a contract when a formal lease was signed. Until then, either party was

entitled to walk away from the negotiations. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63.        I therefore find that no

form of a binding agreement under either the original plan or revised plan to fit out and

operate the cineplex under a lease was ever concluded. I am satisfied that the parties

deliberately left matters not just for future discussions but also for future agreement.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(2) Is there an agreement to pay differential premium and, if so, the

amount of the Plaintiffs’ share of differential premium</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64.        On this issue, the

Defendants’ pleaded case is that there was an alleged agreement between the parties

that out of the $8,469,000 non-refundable DP payable to the Land Office, the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants was to contribute $5m and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs was to contribute

$3,465,000 or alternatively $3,046,900. It is also the Defendants’ pleaded case that

the agreement was reached either in January 1996 or January 1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65.        An analysis of the events

set out below under the heading "The Four Payments" and evidence as to the

parties’ conduct of negotiations after the 6 August 1999 all confirm that there was

no concluded and enforceable free-standing agreement between the parties for the

Plaintiffs to contribute towards DP in the sum of $3,465,000 or $3,046,900. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66.        As I have stated, the

most I can extract from the evidence is that as of 6 August 1999, there was a conditional

acceptance by the Defendants of the Plaintiffs’ offer of 4 August 1999 to pay DP of

$3,046,900 if a lease agreement was entered into between the UAST and MCST. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67.        Negotiations made

progress since 6 August 1999, but the parties nevertheless remained in a state of

negotiations conducted subject to contract. The actions of the parties’ solicitors in

working on the drafts of the proposed lease, the correspondence and communications between

them, and also between the parties, were clearly more consistent with the parties on each

side recognising no binding contract was in existence until execution of the lease. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68.        On the evidence, I find

that there was no separate binding contract between the Plaintiffs and Defendants to pay

non-refundable DP in the sum of $3,465,000 or $3,046,900.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Claim in Restitution - Money Had and Received</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69.        Although various

alternative bases of the claim in restitution were pleaded by the Defendants, the real

issue in this case comes down to simply this: What was the intention and purpose behind

the four payments in question as between the Plaintiffs and Defendants and upon what terms

were the four payments made? </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70.        The various payments

totalling $1,846,900.00 were made in 1999 at a time when the parties were in a state of

negotiations made subject to contract. Generally, payments effected conditional upon a

contract being granted or monies paid during negotiations for a contract that never

materialised are dealt with by reference to the law concerning pre-contract deposits.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) The Law</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71.        A pre-contract deposit is

prima facie recoverable if the prospective contract in connection with which the payment

is made does not come into existence: <i>Halsbury’s Law of England</i> Vol 9(1) (4<sup>th</sup>

Ed Reissue)  1134; <i>Chillingworth v Esche</i> [1924] 1 Ch 97;<i> Masters &amp; Anor v

Cameron</i> [1954] 91 CLR 353.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72.        It is generally

appropriate to describe a payment before contract as a "deposit". However, it is

important to note the different legal effect of a pre-contract deposit and a deposit paid

upon or after entry into a binding contract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73.        The difference between a

pre-contract deposit and a deposit paid upon or after the conclusion of a contract

(referred to as a ‘contract deposit’) was explained by Pennycuick V.C. in <i>Potters

v Loppert</i> [1973] Ch 399.</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I turn now to the law in relation to pre-contract

  deposits…Unless and until a contract is concluded, the prospective purchaser can

  require the return of the deposit at any time, and upon conclusion of the contract, the

  deposit assumes the position of an ordinary contract deposit." (p. 413)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74.        On contract deposit he

added: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">" ..a [contract] deposit serves the dual purpose of an earnest to

  bind the bargain and as part payment of the purchase price. The deposit is frequently paid

  to some person - usually the estate agent or a solicitor employed by the vendor as a

  stakeholder. Broadly, it is the duty of the stakeholder to deal with the deposit according

  to the event" (p. 405). </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75.        Since <i>Howe v Smith</i>

[1881] 27 Ch 89, the nature of a contract deposit (as opposed to a pre-contract deposit)

is settled in English law. At p 101, Fry LJ said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Money paid as a deposit must, I conceive be paid on some terms

  implied or expressed. In this case no terms are expressed, and we must therefore inquire

  what terms are to be implied… The terms most naturally to be implied appear to me in

  the case of <i>money paid on the signing of a contract</i> to be that in the event of the

  contract being performed it shall be brought into account, but if the contract is not

  performed by the payer it shall remain the property of the payee. It is not merely a part

  payment, but it is then also an earnest to bind the bargain so entered into, and creates

  by the fear of its forfeiture a motive in the payer to perform the rest of the

  contract." </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">….</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">".. [T]he earnest is lost by the party who fails to perform the

  contract. That earnest and part payment are two distinct things… They are separate

  acts. .. The deposit in the present case is the earnest or <i>arrha</i> of our earlier

  writers; that the expression used in the present contract that the money is paid "as

  a deposit and in part payment of the purchase-money" relates to the two alternatives,

  and declares that in the event of the purchaser making default the money is to be

  forfeited and that in the event of the purchase being completed the sum is to be taken in

  part payment."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76.        As to whether a payee is

entitled to retain a pre-contract payment depends in each case upon the construction of

the document or correspondence under which that payment is made. The onus is on the payee

to displace the prima facie rule and to show a right to retain the pre-contract payment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77.        So, unless the prima

facie rule is displaced, a pre-contract payment would in law be made on terms which

required that if a formal contract is executed, the money is to be applied and treated as

a contract deposit and a part payment on the transaction so contracted for, and if there

is no executed contract, the money should be returned to the payer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78.        The Plaintiffs have

referred me to <i>Chillingworth v Esche </i>which the Defendants have dismissed as not

relevant. I disagree with the Defendants. In <i>Chillingworth v Esche</i>, the prospective

purchaser paid some money as deposit and in part payment of the purchase price for a

transaction for the sale of land, which was "subject to a proper contract to be

prepared by the vendor’s solicitors". The prospective purchaser subsequently

refused to proceed with the transaction and claimed the return of the deposit. The

question that had to be asked [as in the present case] was whether on the evidence (which

was entirely documentary) the deposit was intended to pass irrevocably to the vendor if

the purchaser did not enter into the transaction (per Pollock MR at p 108 and per

Warrington LJ at p 111). The Court of Appeal held that on the evidence it was not so

intended. The prima facie rule was not displaced and the Court of Appeal gave judgment in

the prospective purchaser’s favour for the return of the deposit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">79.        Mr. Micklem for the

prospective vendor argued that the money was paid by way of guarantee that the purchaser

will not break off negotiations for reason other than default of the vendor. It was argued

that even though the purchasers were entitled to determine the negotiations, the deposit

would nevertheless be forfeited. Mr. Luxmoore for the prospective purchaser contended that

the deposit was paid in anticipation of a binding contract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">80.        Pollock MR agreed with

Counsel for the prospective purchaser that money paid on deposit is prima facie

recoverable on the ground that there never was a contract. He said: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"…It is.... no part of the business of this Court to concern

  itself with the question why the negotiations [subject to contract] in this case came to

  an end and whether any one is to blame in the matter, but the duty of the Court is to note

  that as no contract was entered into the deposit would prima facie be returnable. What

  ground is there then for saying that the purchasers who were entitled to break off

  negotiations have thereby lost the deposit? That they were entitled not to complete the

  purchase seems clear, and I do not accept the view that the purchasers were paying the

  deposit as a guarantee or earnest of good faith that they would complete the purchase [by

  entering into a formal contract], because they could have revoked what had up to that time

  been agreed upon at any moment. It seems to me that when once the negotiations came to an

  end the rights of the parties were gone, and the purchasers were entitled to receive their

  money back. " (p. 106)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">81.        Pollock MR continued: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"…In all the circumstances of this case, I think the deposit

  is recoverable by the purchasers. There was no provision made in the documents which would

  justify the vendor in declining to return it; though if he had, by appropriate words, made

  provision for that in the document, such a provision could have been upheld." (p.

  108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">82.        Warrington LJ, noting

that the document was "subject to a proper contract to be prepared by the

vendor’s solicitors" observed:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"…But where, as here, there is no binding contract, where the

  whole matter is left indefinite, it seems impossible to say that the purchasers pay the

  deposit as a guarantee to carry out the bargain, when by the document they have entered

  into they have not bound themselves to carry out any bargain. …. The purchaser has

  not bound himself, but in order to show a definite intention he is willing to part with

  money, and run the risk of the vendor spending the money and being unable to return it if

  negotiations are broken off. The purchasers contend that this is a deposit paid in

  anticipation of a final contract and nothing more. That seems to be the true view."

  (p. 112)</p>
<p align="justify">" ..I look on the whole payment as being sufficiently explained as

  being an anticipatory payment intended only to fulfil the ordinary purpose of a deposit if

  and when the contemplated agreement should be arrived at." (p. 115). </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">83.        In such a situation, the

payee has no title to the pre-contract payment: <i>Masters v Cameron</i> at p364. Neither

can he claim it as a gift. Walker LJ in <i>Guinness Mahon &amp; Co Ltd v Kensington LBC</i>

[1998] 3WLR 829 said: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">" Where a supposed contract is void ab initio, or an expected

  contract is never concluded, as in <i>Chillingworth v Esche</i>, no enforceable obligation

  is ever created…. An advance payment made in such circumstances is not a gift and is

  not to be treated as a gift. " (p. 850)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">84.        On the question of

"consideration", Walker LJ pointed out three possible meanings: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In English law the expression "consideration" has at

  least three possible meanings. Its primary meaning is the "advantage conferred or

  detriment suffered" (<i>Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Green</i> [1981] AC 513, 531)

  which is necessary to turn a promise not under seal into a binding contract. In the

  context of failure of consideration, however, it is, in the very well known words of

  Viscount Simon LC in <i>Fibrosa Spolka Ackyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Comber Barbour Ltd</i>

  [1943] AC 32 , 48 :"generally speaking, not the promise which is referred to as the

  consideration, but the performance of the promise." Then there is the older and

  looser , …usage of "consideration" as equivalent to the Roman law

  "causa" reflected in the traditional conveyancing expression , "in

  consideration of natural love and affection…" (p.847)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">85.        In the context of a

"total failure of consideration" where the contract never materialises, the

pre-contract payment is recoverable as the consideration for that payment has failed. See

Birks <i>Introduction to the Law of Restitution</i> (1985) ( pp 223-224) quoted with

approval by Walker LJ in <i>Gribbon v Lutton</i> [2002] 2 WLR 842 at pp 858-859; Goff

<p align="justify" xmlns="">87.        The payments were made in

the course of negotiations which had been conducted "subject to contract". The

documented evidence before me set the matrix for all four payments for the proposed lease

under the revised plan. They spelled out the purpose and character of the payments and the

proposed use in future of the payments.<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4"> </font>It is

proper to look beyond payment instructions sent to Pacific Media’s bankers and to

Ocean Cargoes Ltd &amp; Others v Banco Do Brasil S.A.</i> [1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 68.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">88.        I begin with a

chronological account of the events leading to the last three payments. I will deal with

the first payment later.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">January to March 1999</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">89.        This period was the

beginning of the change over from the original plan to the revised plan.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">90.        On 14 March 1999, UAST

proposed a "straight lease deal". In this proposal, Parkway would bear the DP

amount and the costs of demolition, construction of shell structure and interior walls

built to the specification of the Plaintiffs. UAST would pay a base rent fixed at $3.75

psf or 18% of admission revenue, whichever was the higher. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">91.        On 15 March 1999, UAST

sent a similar proposal with slight adjustments to occupancy and the recalculations showed

that MCST would start earning additional rental at a 26.65% occupancy rate. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">92.        On 23 March 1999, the

Plaintiffs proposed depositing a sum of $1m with the Defendants over the period of the

building works to demonstrate their commitment to their part of the project, which sum was

to be released to the Plaintiffs once they had completed their fitting out works and

opened the cinema. The $1m would be released to the Defendants in the event the Plaintiffs

were not able to finish their part of the project due to problems with financing. <font size="3">(AB 1172).</font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1)" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1)" xmlns="">93.

        The proposals were rejected and the Plaintiffs

were told on 26 March 1999 to hand over the project to Parkway. At the same time, Parkway

acknowledged the Plaintiffs’ inability to proceed under the original plan. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">94.        At this stage, Parkway

was in talks with Cathay as an alternative operator and had written to Cathay on 1 March

1999 that PPPL would support the proposal to MCST for Cathay to be cinema operator of the

cineplex. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">95.        The Plaintiffs were

rather confused by Parkway’s letter of 26 March 1999 which coincided with a

subsequent call from someone in Parkway’s office who had wanted clarification on the

rent proposal. In the result, Pacific Media asked Parkway on the same date to </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"..confirm that you are still happy to entertain entering into a

  lease arrangement with us under which we fit the cinema rather than construct the

  shell…Obviously we would be happy to facilitate a hand-over of the shell construction

  part of the project to you as soon as you would like."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">96.        On 27 March 1999, Parkway

told UAST:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">" If Michael is REALLY REALISTIC &amp; CONFIDENT of the sale of

  his investment and willing to promise and do the necessary to commit in a REAL way, maybe

  he and you can reconsider your lease proposal. My personal sentiments are that – in

  view of the change in the proposal it will take a substantial move on Michael’s part

  to persuade the Council and general body." <font size="3">(AB 1186)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">97.        Two days later, Pacific

Media replied:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"…I can assure you once again that we would like to complete

  and operate the cinema for you. Gary will be sending you a proposal tomorrow with a

  revision of the rental which we believe is fair to both parties. This will be a base rent

  against a percentage of net admission revenue which will provide you with an increased

  income stream dependent upon the success of the cinema. Gary has prepared these figures in

  the knowledge that I am revising our <i>overall proposal to include a payment to

  yourselves</i> to cover in excess of S$3 million (sic) of the premium payable to the Land

  Office. </p>

<blockquote xmlns="">

  to S$2.7 million which would make out total contribution a little over S$3 million given

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">98.        The amount of DP proposed

was less than the figure of $3,465,000 under the original plan and it omitted reference to

interest. It is telling that the Defendants at no time protested or objected to a reduced

DP contribution. They never sought to remind the Plaintiffs of an alleged agreement

whereby the Plaintiffs were obligated to contribute DP in the sum of $3,465,000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">99.        On 30 March 1999, the

Plaintiffs revised their last rental proposal so as to include $3,046,900 for DP. The DP

proposal was expressly stated to be based on Michael Buckley’s letter dated 29 March

1999 attached to Gary Quick’s fax. This $3,046,900 included the earlier payment of

$346,900 plus six quarterly instalments of $450,000 each, the first instalment commencing

9 September 1999. <font size="3">(AB 1189).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">100.        With DP included in the

overall package, the base rent was reduced to $2.75 psf versus 15% of net admissions

revenue, whichever was higher.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">101.        On the same day, Parkway

replied to the Plaintiffs. Parkway complained that it was not an improvement over the

earlier proposal of $3.75 psf. <font size="3">(AB 1191).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">102.        Further to that, revised

rental proposals from the Plaintiffs were sent to Parkway on 31 March 1999. This time the

base rent was increased to $3.25 psf versus 16% of net admissions revenue, whichever was

the higher. Again it was expressly stated that the base rent proposal was based "..on

United Artists making total payments towards the premium of S$3,046,900 [per

Michael’s proposal]". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">103.        Up to this stage, it is

clear the Defendants had accepted and recognised that there was no binding agreement on

the Plaintiffs to pay DP. It is significant that at no time prior to this or for that

matter even after the Plaintiffs demanded repayment of $1,846,900 did the Defendants

raised the existence of a concluded agreement to pay DP in the sum of either $3,465,000 or

$3,046,900. At no time was there ever a request for payment of the unpaid balance DP. It

was only raised, as confirmed by Counsel for the Defendants, for the first time in the

Counterclaim. These objective and cogent indications speak for themselves. The written

statements in correspondence suggest that the Defendants never believed that a contract

binding on the Plaintiffs to pay DP ever existed.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Transfer of application of the project to MCST (April –May 1999)</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">104.        As April 1999 commenced,

Parkway concentrated on the expeditious substitution of MCST in place of UAST as the named

applicant of the cineplex. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">105.        The second 10% of DP was

due on 9 April 1999. On 8 April 1999, Parkway paid the second deposit of 10% in the sum of

$906,331.50 inclusive of GST and late interest payment. In their covering letter, Parkway

told the Land Office that they would be writing to notify them of an alternative cinema

operator. Parkway at the same time sought the Land Office’s support to allow a change

of applicant’s name. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">106.        Notably, Parkway did not

ask the Plaintiff for their share of the DP nor did they inform them of their intention to

make payment to the Land Office. That is yet another indication that no agreement binding

on the Plaintiffs to pay DP existed. At this material date, the Plaintiffs have yet to

transfer the approval to PPPL or its nominees. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">107.        As at 30 April 1999, the

Plaintiffs had offered $3,046,900 towards DP as part of the overall rental package for the

straight lease arrangement. Parkway all but ignored the offer preferring to concentrate on

securing a switch in the named applicant of the cineplex. URA had advised that since

written permission was still valid, a change of applicant’s name would not be an

issue. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">108.        On 5 May 1999, MCST

confirmed its willingness to consider undertaking the responsibility of being the

developer "subject to terms to be agreed with UAST for the transfer of responsibility

as ‘developer’ for the project". <font size="3">(AB 1221)</font>. The terms

of the transfer of responsibilities are set out in CPP’s letter dated 20 May 1999.

See AB 1237</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">109.        MCST also considered the

<i>"proposed agreements for UAST to undertake the demolition, development and

operation of the 7-screen cineplex at Parkway Parade to be null and void"</i>. UAST

was told that their "..<i>offer for the operation of the proposed multiplex will be

considered a new undertaking-which is subject to contract, and to further

negotiations."</i></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[emphasis added] <i></i></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">110.        On 7 May 1999, MCST

requested UAST to put forward their "last best offer." UAST responded two days

later and they essentially put forward the same 31 March 1999 proposal. <font size="3">(AB

1226)</font>. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">111.        On 13 May 1999, UAST

again confirmed to MCST that they would no longer be able to continue as the developer of

the cinema project. They confirmed their agreement to MCST undertaking the responsibility

as developer. Gary Quick stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I sincerely regret the inconvenience caused and wish to reconfirm

  our commitment and continued interest in negotiating a new contract to fit-out and operate

  the cinema. We are ready willing and able to proceed immediately." <font face="CG Times (W1)" size="3">(AB 1231)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">112.        Following from that

letter, the Plaintiffs on 19 May 1999 wrote to the Chief Planner, URA, and the consultants

namely the architects, quantity surveyors and structural engineers and informed them that

MCST would take over the project as developer effective from 19 May 1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">113.        The terms of the

transfer came on 20 May 1999. CPP wrote to ALP on 20 May 1999 <font size="3">(AB 1237)</font>:

</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"..We are further instructed that your clients have no objections

  development of the proposed cineplex and <i>the matter shall be treated as null and void

  and neither party shall have any claims against the other in respect thereof.</i></p>
<p align="justify">Please let us have your confirmation on the foregoing on an urgent

  basis…" </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">114.        Here in this letter, the

refund of $346,900 was looked upon as payment <i>towards</i> DP rather than a

reimbursement of DP to Parkway. The matter was also expressly treated as null and void and

neither party shall have any claims against the other in respect thereof.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">115.        On 21 May 1999, PPPL

wrote separately to UAST to confirm that once the plans and documents have been handed

over to MCST, PPPL "will return (without deductions or interest) the $346,900 paid on

14 January 1999". Tan requested particulars of bank account to enable PPPL to effect

the telegraphic transfer. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">116.        Again in this letter,

which was written by Tan, the nature of the payment of 14 January 1999 was not described

as a reimbursement as it is now claimed. The Defendants were ready and wanted to return

the first payment of $346,900 to the Plaintiffs. The inference to be drawn from this is

that Parkway was willing and prepared to bear the entire DP. So far, Parkway had at that

stage paid close to $1.8m to the Land Office. At that time, the application was already

transferred or in the process of being transferred to MCST.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Payment of $346,900 on 14 January 1999</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">117.        I will now interrupt the

chronological account of the facts to deal briefly with the January 1999 payment of

$346,900.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">118.        In my view, at the time

Parkway made payment of the first 10% of DP to the Land Office there was clearly no

binding agreement to contribute towards DP. At the stage of the original plan, there was

merely a provisional understanding or limited consensus which was subject to contract (as

opposed to a concluded bargain) that the Plaintiffs as developer of the cineplex would

contribute $3,465,000 towards DP, PPPL a sum of $5 million and the excess, if any, to be

borne by MCST. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">119.        Prior to Parkway paying

the first 10% of DP to the Land Office, Parkway indeed tried to bind the Plaintiffs to

this contribution. Tan wrote first on 16 April 1998 <font size="3">(AB 732)</font>

followed by a letter dated 22 April 1998 from PPPL’s lawyers M/s Tan &amp; Tan

enclosing a Deed Of Undertaking and a Deed of Assignment for the Plaintiffs’

attention. <font size="3">(AB 747)</font>. The Plaintiffs were required to sign and return

the confirmation to Tan’s letter of 16 April by 24 April 1998 before PPPL paid Land

Office the first 10 % of DP. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">120.        The Plaintiffs did not

provide the confirmation sought. ALP on 24 April 1998 told M/s Tan &amp; Tan that they

would take clients’ instructions on the Deed of Undertaking. <font size="3">(AB 755).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">121.        Eventually, the

Plaintiffs, through ALP, gave a qualified undertaking on 24 April 1998 for the payment of

the first 10% of DP. It was couched in language which only obliged the Plaintiffs to pay

their share of the balance of the DP when the Conditional Agreement was signed. If it was

not signed by end of May 1998, the Plaintiffs would pay interest on their share of the

balance of the DP from 1<sup>st</sup> June 1998 to date of payments of that balance.

Should the Conditional Agreement not be signed at all, two scenarios would follow: the

Plaintiffs would reimburse PPPL for its payment of the Plaintiffs’ share of the first

10% of DP payment to the Land Office if the project ended there. But if the application,

plans and drawings were assigned to PPPL, there would be no reimbursement to PPPL. <font size="3">(AB 756).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">122.        This communication is

significant as it demonstrates that the Plaintiffs had no intention to pay DP at all if

the Defendants continued with the project and took over as developer. The refund of

$346,900 contained in CPP’s letter of 20 May 1999 is consistent with this thinking.

As a term of the transfer of application to MCST, all prior arrangements on the original

plan were treated as null and void and the money was agreed to be returned to the

Plaintiffs. This is the clean break Parkway wanted. According to Elizabeth’s internal

memo, she received legal advice to "terminate UA early – to avoid

‘misleading’ them". See AB 1168 </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">123.        Tan’s oral

testimony <font size="3">(NE 586)</font> that it is "beyond doubt that if they [the

Plaintiffs] had not committed, we would not have paid the DP in April 1998" is

contradicted by the contemporaneous documents. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">124.        On 13 January 1999,

Pacific Media remitted $346,900 to PPPL. This remittance was not pursuant to the qualified

undertaking given in April 1998. Quick in 165 of his affidavit of evidence-in- chief

said that he and Michael Buckley had dinner with Parkway’s representative on 5

January 1999. Over dinner, Parkway sought to pressure the Plaintiffs into making some sort

of initial or advance payment towards the intended project. In his written testimony,

Quick said that the January 1999 remittance was an advance payment. From the evidence, it

appears that Quick, had during cross-examination, mistakenly agreed with Counsel for the

Defendants that the payment was a reimbursement to the Defendants rather than an advance

payment. Thus, contrary to the submission of the Defendants, the payment of $346,900 in

January 1999 did not discharge any debt owing to PPPL. There was no debt at all in the

first place to speak of. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">125.        Even if the January

remittance was meant to reimburse PPPL the Plaintiffs’ share of the first 10% of DP

paid at the request of the Plaintiffs and on their behalf, the status of this payment

changed following the Defendants’ agreement to refund the money in May 1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">126.        The Defendants’

pleaded case is that there was an agreement by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs to contribute

DP. This agreement, according to the Defendants, was reached either in 1996 or in January

1999. The negotiations under the original plan were subject to contract and the payment of

DP was a term of the Conditional Agreement that was never finalised and signed. Neither

was the Deed of Undertaking finalised and signed. Further, exchanges of correspondence do

not show any concluded agreement to pay DP in the sum of $3,465,000. Definitely by end May

1999, any possible or arguable hint of an agreement to pay DP had been treated as null and

void. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">127.        ALP on 16 July 1999 had

written for the $346,900 to be returned to Pacific Media. The money was to be returned on

the basis of a clean break. <font size="3">(AB 1301)</font>. However, there was no purpose

subsequently in pressing for its return since the Plaintiffs wanted to remain as the

operator of the cineplex under the revised plan. In my view, the Plaintiffs left the

January 1999 payment with the Defendants as part of the $1m good faith deposit offered by

Pacific Media under the revised plan. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">128.        As Gary Quick said, the

refund was "rolled into the new proposal" (<font size="3">NE 71)</font>. It was

part of the overall package and as it was already in the Defendants’ hand it was

incorporated as part of the good faith deposit in July 1999. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">129.        I now return to the

history of events in June - September 1999.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">June – September 1999</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">130.        Earlier in the month on

9 June 1999, DPM had sent to Council Members the offers from both UAST and Cathay. After

Council Members met on 16 June, a decision was made to request financial commitment on

performance from the respective operators. This would allow Council Members to endorse the

party to be selected as cinema operator. At that time, the sale of Pacific Media’s

internet business was not yet completed. The latter had on 9 June, requested PPPL to

postpone giving "this contract to any other party until after 30 June" which was

when the announcement of the sale and purchase of Pacific Media’s internet business

was expected. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">131.        According to draft

minutes of Council Meeting held on 16 June 1999, whilst Pacific Media was not ready,

Cathay was "ready to commit to an offer of the lease for the operation of the

cineplex based on the terms submitted in the table at Appendix 2." Also

"Cathay..had expressed that they are ready to sign the lease agreement if the

management council can accept their terms." See AB 1285. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">132.        Tan, in his oral

testimony, confirmed that in June 1999, Cathay was the only party with whom the Defendants

were still talking to. By this time, the Defendants had made payment of the second 10%

instalment of DP to the Land Office in April 1999 without calling upon the Plaintiffs to

contribute their share unlike previously with the first payment. Also by this time, MCST

had taken over as developer of the project. These are objective indications consistent

with there being no binding agreement between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants to

contribute towards DP in the sum of $3,465,000 or $3,046,900.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">133.        Earlier in the month,

URA was told on 8 June 1999 that MCST had taken over as named applicant developer from

UAST. MCST also alluded that it was considering the project with another party who will

require an amendment to the proposed layout submitted by UAST. The proposed layout was

10-15% smaller than the approved layout. In view of this, MCST was seeking an adjustment

to the amount of DP. On 16 June 1999, MCST wrote a similar letter to Land Office for

adjustment of the DP. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">134.        Parkway responded to the

Plaintiffs’ offer of 9 May 1999 on 21 June. The language used by Parkway was

deliberate with the intention to start afresh their relationship and re-negotiate. Not

only was the subject matter headed " Interest to lease and operate the proposed

cineplex at Parkway Parade", the letter was marked "Without Prejudice &amp;

Subject to Contract". Parkway advised the Plaintiffs that whilst their offer to lease

and operate the proposed cineplex was being reviewed by Management Council, the latter

had: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"…requested .. an undertaking from your organization - as a

  form of financial commitment during this period of finalisation of the proposed leased

  terms and conditions. </p>
<p align="justify">The form of financial commitment may be in a confirmation of your

  financial status to commit to the proposed project with a reference from your bank and

  with a "performance guarantee".</p>
<p align="justify">We appreciate if you would revert by 30 June 1999 on the above to

  demonstrate your ability to undertake the proposed project." <font size="3">(AB 1265)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">135.        The Plaintiffs were not

willing or able to provide a banker’s performance bond. On 25 June 1999, the

Plaintiffs instead proposed other means of security (<font size="3">AB 1271</font>): </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><p align="justify">As a gesture of good faith we would be prepared to</p></i> <i>deposit

  with you the sum of $500,000 which would be forfeited should we fail to complete the

  project.</i> This offer is made <i>without prejudice and subject to contract</i> expressly

  on the understanding that it would be available to us to complete the contract and would

  not be held by you once the Cineplex had commenced operations." 

  <blockquote>
<p align="justify">[emphasis added] </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">136.        There was continual

doubt in the Defendants’ minds over the Plaintiffs’ ability to carry through

with the project since the proceeds of disposal of the internet business were not

earmarked for the project and furthermore Pacific Media was going on a fund raising

exercise for US$25 m. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">137.        On 13 July 1999, Pacific

Media told Parkway that they were confident of their financial ability to complete the

project so much so that they would be prepared to place a deposit with Parkway on the

following terms<font size="3">:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I believe that you currently have a <i>deposit from us of

  S$345,000</i> towards the premium payable to the Land Office. I would be happy to give you

  a further deposit of $500,000 upon signing a lease making a total of $845,000. This money

  would be used as a final payment of our portion of the premium but the whole amount of

  S$845,000 would be released to your company as a penalty payment if we were unable to

  complete the construction of the cinema successfully. Whilst I would expect the interest

  accruing on this money to be paid to us on an agreed time scale, this interest would also

  be waived in the event of non-completion which means that you would receive a penalty

  payment of close to S$1 m if we did not fulfil our part of the contract. </p>
<p align="justify">I am sure that you will agree <i>this proposal is a significant gesture

  of good faith</i> regarding our intentions and our ability to complete the project. …

  I suggest that we now ask our respective lawyers to prepare a new lease for signature in

  the very near future. I will be in Singapore next week and would be happy to meet you to

  finalise any outstanding points and to sign the lease if it can be prepared within that

  time scale..<font size="3">" (AB 1298)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">138.        It is quite clear from

this letter that the intended purpose was for the $346,900 to form part of the good faith

deposit which was supplemented by an "additional deposit" of $500,000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">139.        Parkway viewed this

proposal as minuscule. There is a handwritten note with the comment that $1m was

"peanuts". <font size="3">(AB 1299)</font>. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">140.        Pacific Media increased

the amount of the "additional" good faith deposit from $500,000 to $600,000 on

20 July 1999: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I feel that the offer contained in my letter of 13<sup>th</sup>

  July to Elizabeth Soh regarding the <i>additional deposit</i> of $500,000 which we are

  sufficient for you to execute the lease with us. As a final gesture of goodwill I am

  prepared to <i>increase the additional deposit from $500,000 to $600,000 in the hope that

  we can now execute the lease and proceed with our joint development</i>." <font size="3">(AB 1303)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[emphasis added]</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">141.        At this stage, the total

good faith deposit came up to $946,500 (i.e. $346,900 plus $600,000).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">142.        The proposal of 20 July

was revised again three days later. This time the Plaintiffs proposed a corporate

guarantee from Pacific Media to secure the performance of the lease by UAST. The lease

would be in the name of UAST: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In order to resolve this long standing situation I am now

  prepared to send you a letter from Pacific Media guaranteeing the obligations of UAST <i>if

  that company enters into a lease with you to construct and operate the proposed multiplex</i>

<p align="justify">You will understand that I am prepared to do this in the belief

  that the funding of this development will not present any difficulties…</p>
<p align="justify">I suggest that we now proceed to sign the lease once it has been

  amended to reflect the latest agreed proposals between us and I see no reason why this

  could not be achieved before the end of next week. <i>I hope that this proposal is

  acceptable, being much more substantial than all previous offers of support.</i>" <font size="3">(AB 1310)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">143.        The proposal was not

acceptable to Parkway. Pacific Media on 26 July wrote to Tan of PPPL: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">" As I explained to the[Council] meeting, we are basically putting

  all of the Group resources behind this project in that the lease will taken in the name of

  the effect of providing you with the day to day cash flow from Singapore in support of the

<p align="justify" xmlns="">151.        Pacific Media on 9

August 1999 wrote to Parkway to confirm the provision of the corporate guarantee and of

the terms under which it is given. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">152.        The next communication

was a fax from Parkway dated 24 August 1999 reminding Pacific Media of the due payment of

DP in the sum of $450,000 on 9 September 1999 and requesting remittance by 7 September

1999. A reminder was sent on 3 September . The letter requested "payment to allow us

to facilitate payment to Land Office". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">153.        On the same day, Pacific

Media confirmed that the money would be sent by 9 September. The money was remitted on 9

September 1999. The next payment of $450,000 was remitted on 15 December 1999. In the

Plaintiffs’ bank application for remittance of the various payments to PPPL, the

words "Differential Premium" was written in the box "Details to be notified

to beneficiary". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">154.        The contemporaneous

documents showed that PPPL, meanwhile, had intended to pay the balance of the DP to the

Land Office in full. Elizabeth said that she spoke to Michael Buckley and Quick about

this. This oral testimony is not in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief nor recorded in any

of the contemporaneous documents. In  289 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Quick

stated that the Plaintiffs were not informed of and were completely unaware about

Parkway’s full payment of the balance of DP on 9 September 1999. Under

cross-examination, he said he did not recall having this conversation. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">155.        Earlier, Parkway had on

7 September 1999 asked the Land Office for waiver of interest on the basis that full

payment of the balance 80% of DP would be paid by 10 September 1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">156.        On 9 September 1999,

Parkway paid the remaining 80% of DP plus GST. After that, Land Office reverted with its

decision not to waive interest. The Defendants paid interest on 31 December 1999. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">157.        In my view, that

Defendants took themselves out of the instalment plan and paid the remaining 80% of DP in

full in order to improve their chances of securing a waiver of interest charge from the

Land Office.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(3) Findings and Decision </p>
<p align="justify">(i) Intention and Purpose behind the Four Payments</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">158.        The Plaintiffs’

contention is that the various payments were made (i) in the course of negotiations for

the intended lease;(ii) with a view to securing and/or in consideration of the intended

lease; and/or (iii) to account of their anticipated obligations under the intended lease.

The Plaintiffs submitted that the payments were advances made in good faith to evidence

their sincerity and commitment to the project and on the assumption that the intended

lease agreement was going to be finalised and executed in due course. The Plaintiffs

relied on <i>Chillingworth v Esche</i> and <i>Goff &amp; Jones: The</i> <i>Law of

Restitution (5<sup>th</sup> ed.)</i> pp 43 and 665 in support of their claim<i>.</i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">159.        The Defendants’

submission is that the payments were remitted as non-refundable DP for the Land Office.

The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants had paid DP to the Land Office at the Plaintiffs’

request and the four payments were meant to reimburse the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants for

the Plaintiffs’ share of their contribution towards DP payment, which had been agreed

at either $3.465 m or $3.046 m. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">160.        Since I have decided

that there was no concluded free-standing agreement binding on the Plaintiffs to

contribute towards DP, the primary contention of the Defendants falls away. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">161.        Quick’s oral

evidence is that the Plaintiffs need not have to pay DP to the Land Office. By July/August

1999, the Plaintiffs were no longer developer of the project. MCST had taken over from

them. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">162.        Quick’s testimony

is that DP under the straight lease arrangement was part of the overall offer. (NE 77).

Pacific Media’s letter dated 29 March 1999 expressly stated that the Plaintiffs have

included contribution of DP as part of the Plaintiffs’ <i>overall proposal </i>to fit

out and operate the cineplex. The offer to contribute DP was a sweetener to enhance their

overall package to make it more attractive to the Defendants. (NE 54,57,59). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">163.        The Defendants certainly

viewed the DP contribution of $3.046m to be an integral part of the rental package. An

illustration of this is from the Defendants’ comparison of the offer from Cathay with

the Plaintiffs’. In the computation of net rental income of the Plaintiffs’

offer, the benefit of the DP contribution was amortised over different projected lease

periods and matched to their respective rental income streams. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">164.        The Plaintiffs’

offer was more financially attractive than Cathay’s. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">A contribution by the Plaintiffs towards DP in their proposal was

important to the Defendants as it reduces the upfront costs needed for the cineplex

project and hence reduces the overall funding requirements of the project. In the event

that Cathay was chosen as the cinema operator, borrowings for the project would have been

a net $2,531,900 more resulting in a higher interest bill. Further, the full repayment of

the borrowings would be stretched by a further six years from year 2013 (based on

UAST’s offer) to year 2019 (based on Cathay’s offer). See <font size="3">AB

1319-1324. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">165.        Yet the Defendants

wanted tangible assurance from the Plaintiffs of their commitment and financial ability to

do the deal. Cathay’s financial standing was acceptable to the Defendants but not

their offer. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">166.        Parkway told URA on 22

June 1999: "[W]e are in the process of determining the financial standing of each

party to enable MCST to make a prudent decision so as to allow us to proceed on the

project."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">167.        It is clear that in June

1999, the Plaintiffs turned down Parkway’s request that a performance bond from a

bank be provided. Other options were then offered in a series of communications that ended

with the undertakings from the Plaintiffs on 28 July 1999. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">168.        An examination of all

the circumstances gathered mainly from the contemporaneous documents showed what the

parties were about. In fact, they showed that the payments were made in response to the

attitude of the Defendants which at that time was one of serious concern as to whether the

Plaintiffs would financially be in a position to see through and hold up to their end of

the bargain after the lease of the cineplex was awarded to them. At that time, the shell

structure had yet to be constructed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">169.        In <i>Guardian Ocean

Cargoes Ltd &amp; Ors v Banco do Brasil SA</i> [1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 68, the same

inquiry as in the present case was before Hirst J, namely, the purpose and intent of the

payments made before contract. There the plaintiffs recovered judgment for repayment of

US$600,000 deposited with the defendant bank as a token of good faith in a proposed

shipbuilding re-financing deal in which negotiations broke down after 5 years. The prima

facie rule on pre-contract deposits was not rebutted and the plaintiffs in <i>Guardian

Ocean, </i>as<i> </i>in <i>Chillingworth v Esche</i> succeeded in recovering the money

back. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">170.        In <i>Guardian Ocean</i>,

the object of the negotiations was for the plaintiffs (who had demise chartered the

"Golden Med") to take over the responsibilities of the owners who had defaulted

on the shipbuilding contract and loan from the bank, and for the transaction to be

refinanced by the defendant bank. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">171.        Negotiations were

protracted and spread over a five-year period. Draft contracts were produced but revised

due to constant changes to proposals as the value of the vessel dropped in a deteriorating

shipping market. During the five years, the plaintiffs traded the vessel commercially.

Relations broke down with the bank’s arrest of the vessel. In the end, no contract

was ever entered into between the bank and the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">172.        The plaintiffs argued

that the money was deposited with the bank as a token of genuine intent for future use in

the intended acquisition by the plaintiffs of the vessel "Golden Med" and was

only to be applied by the bank for that purpose if negotiations between the plaintiff and

bank for the refinancing of the vessel were successful; the remittance were conditional on

the conclusion of the financing deal. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">173.        The original proposal

for the 3 remittances emanated from Mr. Juchem who was the in-house lawyer of the shipyard

in order to give [like in the present case] a tangible assurance to the bank that the

plaintiffs were financially sound, and that they were serious in their intent to take over

the shipbuilding contract. In his written testimony, he said the payments were intended to

show good faith on the part of the buyers (the plaintiffs) and to help influence the bank

to grant the loan. Once made it should be possible to convince the bank that their loan

would be repaid. The goodwill payments would show the bank that the "Golden Med"

was really up to date again, and help influence them to go ahead and loan the remainder of

the required funds. He went on to testify that knowing the bank, it was important that a

prospective new borrower should show a willingness to make a substantial payment on

account and as a sign of goodwill before concluding the deal. The importance and

significance of the plaintiffs making a goodwill payment totalling US$600,000 must be

viewed against the attitude of the bank. (p81)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">174.        Mr. Juchem said that

everyone expected the deal to go through and the money applied to the promissory notes,

but everything was meant to be dependent on the refinancing being secured. The intention

was to make a deposit not a payment, and the money would be set against the promissory

note debt when the final refinancing documents were signed. (p81) </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">175.        Mr. Petropoulos for the

plaintiffs testified that he made it clear that his prime concern in entering the

negotiations for refinancing was to minimize his losses and safeguard the investment he

had already made in two vessels. He said that the goodwill payments were to convince the

bank of the company’s sincerity, and to be applied towards the purchase price if the

refinancing went through; he never considered making an outright payment. (p82)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">176.        The bank’s position

on the other hand, was that the remittances were outright payments.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">177.        It is the bank’s

case that prior to the first remittance of US$200,000 the scheme was fundamentally changed

and that instead of mere conditional deposits, outright payments were proposed to be made

by the plaintiffs on behalf of Timber Point for the credit of the yard in payment of the

dishonoured promissory notes. The bank contended that these were voluntary payments made

unconditionally and therefore irrecoverable by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">178.        Hirst J considered the

same question as in <i>Chillingworth v Esche</i>, namely, was it intended that the

payments should pass outright and irrevocably to the bank whatever the outcome of the

negotiations or only if those negotiations resulted in a concluded refinancing. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">179.        The bank argued that the

evidence of Mr. Juchem and Mr. Petropoulos did not support the plaintiffs’ case of a

conditional payment. Hirst J did not agree with the bank’s analysis of the evidence.

Hirst J said that " ..when Mr. Juchem referred in [his written statement] to

"goodwill payment", "payments for a specific purpose", "payments

as a sign of good faith" and the like, he was intending to refer to the payments

being conditional [i.e contingent upon the conclusion of a refinancing deal]." (p.

83) </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">180.        The importance and

significance of Mr. Petropoulos making a goodwill payment of US$600,00 must be viewed

against the attitude of the bank [in the same way as the Defendants’ concern here

about the financial ability of the Plaintiffs]. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">181.        Quick’s testimony

is that he had no reason to doubt that a lease would not be signed. Even though the

negotiations had been conducted "subject to contract", the parties to this

action had been discussing the cineplex project for so long that both parties had

confidently expected a formal contract to eventuate. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">182.        The payments were

"inextricably linked" and made in anticipation of the intended lease. ( 270.20

of Quick’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief; NE 66). The sum of $346,900 was held by

the Defendants to account of future liability under the intended lease. See ( 270.22 of

Quick’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief.) </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">183.        After 6 August 1999,

there were negotiations on what would happen to the DP contribution of $3.046m in the

event of default of performance of the executed lease. To illustrate, there were

negotiations on a refund of the $3.046m if MCST was not able to hand over the shell

structure by 28 February 2001 to the Plaintiffs to fit out and there were negotiations on

the future use of the $600,000 such as applying the money to the instalment payments.

There was even a proposal on 4 October 1999 to utilise part of the $600,000 towards the

rental deposit which is equal to three months’ base rent required under the draft

lease and the balance applied towards the last instalment payment of $450,000 due on 9

December 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">184.        Quick’s evidence is

that there was no reason to make the payments except for the lease. Without the lease,

there was no reason for the Plaintiffs to contribute towards DP. Elizabeth and Tan

accepted that. They also agreed that the Land Office’s approval obtained from payment

of DP would be meaningless to the Plaintiffs without a lease from MCST. (NE 391,169 and

545). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">185.        The statements in the

documented evidence referred to "gesture of good faith", "good faith

payment", "good faith deposit", ‘deposit", ‘additional

deposit" and "additional good faith deposit". Quick disagreed with Counsel

for the Defendants who suggested in a question put to him that the four payments were not

deposits or advances.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">186.        A significant feature of

the present case is that the Defendants had asked the Plaintiffs for tangible assurance of

their financial ability to undertake and complete the revised plan. I would characterise

the four payments as pre-contract deposits which served as an indication of the

Plaintiffs’ confidence with funding, genuine interest and seriousness in being the

cinema operator of the cineplex at Parkway Parade. The four payments were deposited with

the Defendants as tangible assurance of genuine intent. In my view, the four payments were

to be kept aside and held against the conclusion of a final lease and for use of the money

deposited after the lease was signed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">187.        I accept the

Plaintiffs’ evidence that the payments were made in anticipation of the lease. They

were not intended to be outright payments. There was no commercial reason for the

Plaintiffs to pay $1.8m, which is not an insignificant amount of money as non-refundable

DP without or regardless of a signed lease. The Plaintiffs needed a long lease to recoup

their investment. Quick’s evidence that the Plaintiffs paid because they thought they

would get a lease, is clear indication that they never intended to make outright payments

equivalent to gifts. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">188.        Tan (NE 616) accepted

Counsel’s suggestion put to him that "the [various] payments were [made] <i>to

account</i> of Plaintiffs’ obligation to MCST under the intended lease

arrangement." [emphasis added] In other words, the payments were to be used to fulfil

the terms of the lease if and when that is executed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">189.        The DP contribution to

MCST is reflected in the draft lease and is an obligation that only arises if the lease

was signed. The six quarterly instalments in Clause 4 of the working draft lease followed

the timetable for payment to the Land Office. The same schedule was used as a matter of

convenience. If indeed the money from the Plaintiffs were meant to pay the Land Office,

the date of instalment payment would have been a couple of days earlier than the due date

of payment to the Land Office. The obligation to pay DP under the intended lease was to

MCST and not PPPL. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">190.        The Plaintiffs had

expected the lease to be executed before any of the six instalments began. But

negotiations on the terms of the intended lease were still on-going at the time Parkway

sent reminders to the Plaintiffs to pay. It is evident that the Plaintiffs remitted the

payments in September and December 1999 of $450,000 each as good faith pre-contract

deposits. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">191.        The good faith payment

was recorded in ALP’s letter of 26 November 1999 which commented on Clause 3.12 of

the working draft lease and CPP’s note to the clause. Clause 3.12 deals with the

consequence of MCST’s inability to give UAST access to the shell structure after 28

February 2001 for fitting out works. In the event, the tenant may rescind the lease. The

only refund that was provided was the lease deposit of three months. ALP said: " [W]e

are of the firm view that our client’s continuing contribution towards the DP in good

faith must be refunded if your clients are unable to hand over the premises to our clients

for the fitting out works by the agreed date". </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">192.        It is clear from the

correspondence that the remittance of $600,000 as well as the earlier sum of $346,900 were

to be treated together as a good faith pre-contract deposit. </p>
<p xmlns="">193.        The $346,900 was already in hand. The

Plaintiffs remitted $600,000 in July 1999. From the correspondence, the $346,900 and

$600,000 were referred to as the "deposit" and "additional deposit"

respectively. The $600,000 was referred to by Elizabeth as a "holding deposit"

for the landlord. A "holding deposit" is a term used to describe pre-contract

deposits. It is generally paid by a "prospective purchaser" or "prospective

lessor" such as in the case of the Plaintiffs who had made the payment subject to

contract. See <i>Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings v NMBE Pty Ltd</i> (1999) 9 BPR 16,679 at

p16,687. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">194.        The $600,000 was

transferred to MCST’s bank account on 3 August 1999 where it was kept for sometime.

The transfer of the money back to PPPL by journal entry in February 2000 was between PPPL

and MCST. That accounting entry does not in my view change the purpose and intention of

the payment as between the Plaintiffs and Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">195.        I find, on the evidence,

that the four payments, namely, the sum of $346,900, $600,000 and each of the $450,000

remittances were pre-contract deposits. In the case of the $346,900 remitted in January

1999 it was subsequently agreed in May 1999 to be refunded to the Plaintiffs. By

July/August 1999, the Plaintiffs permitted it to be retained by the Defendants as part of

good faith deposit. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(ii) The terms, if any, upon which the payments were made</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">196.        I now consider the

terms, if any, upon which the four payments were made. Were they to be non-refundable in

the event the lease was not signed? Where there is no contract and in the absence of any

express term governing the pre-contract deposit to the contrary, the prima facie rule is

that the money is to be returned to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">197.        The Defendants’

contention is that the Plaintiffs knew that DP paid to the Land Office was not refundable.

That may be so. But in this case, the question is whether or not the Plaintiffs paid the

money on the basis that it would be non-refundable if the parties failed to execute a

lease for the cineplex and not whether the Plaintiffs knew that DP paid to the Land Office

was non-refundable.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">198.   <i>     Sydney Harbour Casino

Holdings Ltd v NMBE Pty Limited</i>, is a case where the parties had agreed that the

deposit should be returned if a lease was signed but not otherwise. The Court of Appeal

held that as a matter of construction, it is not possible to imply from that express

provision the converse situation whereby the payee is to retain the deposit if no lease

was entered it. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">199.        In that case the

appellant Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd ("SHCH") wanted to lease the

premises from the respondent NMBE. In negotiating the lease agreement, SHCH paid a

"holding deposit" to the respondent pending completion of the formal document.

The appellant found cheaper premises and decided not to proceed with the lease. SHCH sued

for repayment of the amount paid. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">200.        Before Rolfe J, NMBE

submitted that if NMBE failed in establishing a binding contract for the lease of the

premises had been entered into, SHCH might still not succeed in recovering the $300,000.

SHCH’s evidence showed that the $300,000 was paid by it to NMBE in consideration for

NMBE not negotiating with other prospective lessees whilst it was negotiating with SHCH,

and that the only basis upon which SHCH was entitled to recover it was if a binding

agreement was entered into. The agreement was subject to the condition that the $300,000

would be refundable upon the execution of the lease. This line of argument did not find

favour at the appellate level. The parties’ mind were directed to what was to happen

if the lease was executed. Nothing was said about what was to happen in the event that the

negotiations did not end with execution of a lease.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">201.        In that circumstance,

the appellate court held: " …where neither party had directed their minds to

what would happen if an executed lease did not eventuate, no express agreement could be

inferred as to what would happen in this event. In this situation it is necessary to have

recourse to the law relating to pre-contract deposits." </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">202.        On appeal, it was held

that NMBE had no right to keep the deposit because a pre-contract deposit is prima facie

recoverable if the prospective contract it is connected with does not come into existence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">203.        <i>Gribbon v Lutton</i>

[2002] 2 WLR 842, is a case where the parties had stipulated as to what is to happen to

the deposit if no contract is signed. On the facts, the Court of Appeal held the

solicitors were negligent in failing to secure an enforceable bipartite agreement under

which the deposit would have been forfeited had the purchaser failed to purchase the land.

The Court of Appeal recognised that the vendor’s claim to the money could be enforced

not because he had given consideration for the promise but because he has imposed a burden

on the purchaser by stipulating that the deposit was non-refundable should there be no

concluded contract.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">204.        As to what to do with

the $1,846,900 paid if the lease was not signed, I find that the parties here were silent

both orally and in writing. I agree with the Court of Appeal in <i>Sydney Harbour</i> that

the inference to be drawn from the parties’ "consequent silence in their

..writings and words on the question what would happen to the deposit in the event no

lease was executed" is that "they made no express agreement at all about what

would happen in that event." Once that stage in the analysis of the evidence is

reached, the issue is to be determined in accordance with the law on pre-contract

deposits. On this approach, the money is to be returned to the Plaintiffs. In my judgment,

the Defendants have not displaced the prima facie rule to show a right to retain the

pre-contract payments.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">205.        The Defendants argued

that the Plaintiffs had assumed the risk of their payments where the parties were

negotiating on a "subject to contract" basis and everybody knows that there is a

risk that at the end of the day, either side may back out if the negotiations before a

contract is executed. <font face="CG Times (W1)">Given my findings, this argument also

fails.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">206.        The negotiations were

"subject to contract". The phrase "subject to contract" means, as

matter of construction, that the four payments were conditional on the conclusion and

execution of the lease. The only consideration for the payment was the making of that

contract. Without a signed lease, the consideration for the payments fails. On the

evidence, applying the law relating to pre-contract deposits, the Plaintiffs are entitled

to recover the total sum of $1,846,900 on the ground of total failure of consideration.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">207.        It is evident from the

documented evidence that PPPL was representing MCST in the negotiations in respect of the

proposed cineplex project. Elizabeth reported to and took instructions from Tan. I

therefore find that PPPL was at all material times the agent for MCST. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">208.        Both Defendants are

liable to repay $1,846,900 to the Plaintiffs. The money was remitted to PPPL and received

by PPPL as agent of the prospective lessor, MCST. The intended lease between 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants did not materialise. In the circumstances, both

are liable to repay the sum of $1,846,900. See <i>Gribbon v Lutton</i> [2002] 2 WLR 842 at

843.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(4) The Defendants’ submissions on the claim in restitution</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">209.        The Defendants’

contention for declining to return the money was based on the alleged ground that there

was an agreement to contribute<b> </b>towards DP and the monies were paid to the Land

Office as part of the Plaintiffs’ share of the contribution. They were to reimburse

PPPL for payment of DP made on behalf of the Plaintiffs at their request. These arguments

fall on the way side as there is no free-standing contract to contribute towards DP. I

have also found that the total sum of $1,846,900 was not paid on terms that if no lease

were executed, the money would irrevocably pass to and be retained by the Defendants. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">210.        Counsel for the

Defendants further submitted that the payments were made in exchange for an opportunity to

negotiate the terms of the lease. The payments were for a confirmed offer of the proposed

cineplex. The Defendants argued that the words "confirmed offer of a lease" in

Parkway’s letter dated 28 July 1998 comprised an opportunity or chance to negotiate

the terms of a lease. There was therefore consideration for the payment. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">211.        In support of this

argument, Counsel relied on Tan’s oral testimony of Tan (NE 546):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"…DP is payable when approval [was obtained] from [the]

  authorities. For all intents and purposes [a] lease should have been struck at that time.

  In order to secure the right to stay in the deal a payment has to be made. Would say DP

  has to be paid in order to stay in [the] game for negotiations…."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">212.        This oral testimony is

not stated in Tan’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Neither is it in Elizabeth’s

affidavit. In fact, she repeatedly denied during cross-examination that the payments were

for a confirmed offer from Parkway.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">213.        The Plaintiffs’

contention is that the "opportunity to negotiate" argument was not pleaded. The

Defendants disagreed and said that their argument is consistent with their pleaded case

that failure of consideration was partial. I agree with the Plaintiffs on the pleadings

point. The constituent facts making up a plea of partial consideration must be pleaded.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">214.        In any event, the

Defendants’ argument is really nothing more than a promise to negotiate or continue

to negotiate a lease agreement subject to contract. This is not consideration recognised

by law. An arrangement or agreement whereby the parties agree to negotiate in the future

will not be enforced on the ground that the agreement is incomplete, uncertain or is not

supported by consideration. Accordingly the law does not recognise as an enforceable

contract, an agreement to agree or negotiate a contract: <i>Courtney and Fairbairn Ltd v

Tolaini</i> <i>Bros</i> <i>(Hotels) Ltd</i> [1975] 1 WLR 297; <i>Mallozzi v Carapelli SpA</i>

(1976) 1 Lloyd’s Rep 407; <i>Walford v Miles </i>[1992] AC 128. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">215.        The Defendants submitted

that Plaintiffs’ claim for restitution is based upon the doctrine of unjust

enrichment. It is not disputed that the underlying principle of an action for money had

and receive is unjust enrichment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">216.        All three elements of

unjust enrichment- benefit, at the plaintiffs’ expense and unjust

"factor"-are undoubtedly present on an analysis of the payments based upon the

doctrine of unjust enrichment. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">217.        Here the payments were

made while negotiations were ‘subject to contract’ and the deal failed to

materialise. Given the conclusions reached in this judgment, the Defendants have no right

to retain the money. Since they cannot retain the money, they are unjustly enriched. </p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Other Issues</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">218.        There is no need to deal

with the other alternative issues, which will only arise if I reached the opposite

conclusion on the central issue.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">219.        Given my findings, the

facts in evidence fall short of satisfying the elements of the defence of change of

position. </p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">220.        There be judgment for

the Plaintiffs against the Defendants in the sum of $1,846,900 with interest thereon at 6%

per annum from the date of the writ to date of Judgment and costs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">221.        As a corollary to this

decision in favour of the Plaintiffs, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants’ Counterclaim is

therefore dismissed with costs.</p>
