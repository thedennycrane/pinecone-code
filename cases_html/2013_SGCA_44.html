        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Civil Appeal Nos 82 and 83 of 2012
                    (“CA 82” and “CA 83” respectively) are
                    appeals against the decision of the High Court in Suit No 89 of 2010
                    (“Suit 89”). CA 82 is the appeal by the fifth defendant,
                    Alwie Handoyo (“Alwie”). CA 83 is the appeal by the first
                    defendant, Chan Sing En (“Chan”). The first plaintiff, Tjong Very
                    Sumito (“Tjong”), and the second plaintiff, Iman Haryanto
                    (“Iman”), are the respondents (collectively “the
                    Respondents”) in CA 82 and CA83. There was originally a third
                    plaintiff in Suit 89, Herman Tintowo (“Herman”), but he
                    discontinued his action on 13 January 2012 and is not a party to the
                    appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The dispute between the parties is over the
                    payment of the purchase price of US$18m under a sale and purchase agreement
                    (“the first SPA”) for the purchase of shares in an Indonesian
                    company. Tjong, Chan and Alwie were involved in a transaction with several
                    parties, including Magnus Energy Group Ltd (“MEGL”) which is a
                    Singapore public-listed company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Antig
                    Investments Pte Ltd (“Antig”), as well as two offshore shell
                    entities, Aventi Holdings Limited (“Aventi”) and Overseas Alliance
                    Financial Limited (“OAFL”). The first SPA was entered into between
                    the Respondents and Herman (collectively “the Plaintiffs”) as the
                    seller of the shares, and Antig as the purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The circumstances surrounding the transaction
                    are murky, to say the least. In a nutshell, this was a convoluted transaction
                    the true nature of which appears to have been intentionally masked through the
                    interposition of layers of apparently legitimate transactions. As is often the
                    case with such questionable transactions, when business partners’
                    relationships sour and disputes arise, the unravelling of the transaction
                    presents considerable legal difficulties. The present case is no different, as
                    the lengthiness of the decision of the High Court judge (“the
                    Judge”) in <em>Tjong Very Sumito and others v Chan Sing En
                        and others</em> [2012] 3 SLR 953 (“the Judgment”)
                    bears testament.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The protagonists</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Tjong is the main protagonist in the dispute. He
                    set up PT Deefu Chemical Indonesia (“PT Deefu”) on
                    5 December 2000 with Iman. Tjong and Iman are brothers while Herman is
                    their friend. Although the relevant agreements were entered into between Antig
                    and the Plaintiffs, Tjong conducted the negotiations with Chan. Tjong was
                    introduced to Alwie by a mutual acquaintance, and Alwie in turn introduced Tjong
                    to Chan. Tjong claimed that he is not well versed in English. He knows words and
                    phrases but is unable to carry on a full conversation in English. Nevertheless,
                    he has not disclaimed any of the relevant agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Chan played a pivotal role throughout the
                    negotiations and execution of the relevant agreements. He was the managing
                    director of MEGL up till 1 June 2008. He was also a director of Antig up
                    till 15 May 2008 when he resigned. He was the point man for MEGL and Antig
                    in the negotiations and execution of the first SPA. Chan has known Alwie and
                    Johanes Widjaja (“Johanes”), the third defendant in Suit 89,
                    since 1999–2000 and has business dealings with both of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Alwie is a businessman based in Jakarta,
                    Indonesia. He holds various directorships and owns shares in a number of
                    Indonesian companies. He was introduced to Tjong sometime in the late 1990s by a
                    mutual acquaintance, one Mr Rahardjo. Alwie has known Johanes since 2000 or
                    2001 and had business dealings with him prior to this dispute. Alwie and Johanes
                    are key participants in this dispute as they are the directing mind and will of
                    OAFL and Aventi, the two entities which were paid a sizeable portion of the
                    US$18m purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The dispute arises from a sale and purchase of
                    shares in PT Deefu. In early August 2004, PT Deefu and Tjong paid US$1.2m
                    for 100% of the share capital of PT Batubaraselaras Sapta
                    (“PT Batubara”), the principal value of which resided in the
                    company’s ownership of the right to mine and extract coal from the Kuaro
                    coal formation at Kabupaten Pasir, East Kalimantan, Indonesia (“the
                    Concession”). PT Deefu’s shares were held by Tjong, Iman, and
                    Herman in the percentages 72.7%, 20% and 7.3% respectively. However, for all
                    intents and purposes, the controller of the Concession was Tjong. For ease of
                    reference, the shareholdings in PT Batubara and PT Deefu are
                    represented by the following diagram:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events prior to the first SPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It appears that the Plaintiffs did not have the
                    funds to develop and operate the Concession. Even though they had purchased the
                    shares in PT Batubara in early August 2004, by 11 August 2004 thereabouts,
                    they attempted to sell 67% of PT Batubara to one Mr Tjokrosaputro for
                    US$8m. The deal with Mr Tjokrosaputro fell through. Had the deal with
                    Mr Tjokrosaputro materialised, the Plaintiffs would have gained at least
                    US$6.8m almost <em>instantly</em> from the
                    “flipping” of their purchase of PT Batubara, despite at the
                    same time retaining a 33% stake.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first SPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Plaintiffs secured what appears on first
                    blush to be an even “better” deal just three months later. On
                    23 November 2004, the Plaintiffs entered into the first SPA with Antig
                    under which the Plaintiffs sold a total of 72% of the shareholding in PT Deefu
                    to Antig for US$18m. 72% of PT Deefu translates to roughly 68.4% of
                    PT Batubara, almost identical to the size of the shareholding which the
                    Plaintiffs had tried to sell to Mr Tjokrosaputro. In other words, the
                    Plaintiffs on paper stood to gain approximately US$10m <em>more</em> than what they would have obtained from the failed
                    transaction with Mr Tjokrosaputro in just a space of three months. As we
                    shall elaborate below (see [69]–[83], and [86]–[87]), there is more
                    than meets the eye to this “better” deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The deal, which was to be completed on
                    13 June 2006 (“the Completion Date”), was structured in a way
                    that left Tjong with 28% of the shareholding of PT Deefu after the sale.
                    The purchase price of US$18m was to be paid partly in cash and partly by an
                    allotment and issuance of shares in MEGL, the Singapore-listed parent company of
                    Antig. Of the purchase price of US$18m, US$6m was to be paid to Tjong, US$10m in
                    cash and shares to Aventi, and US$2m in cash and shares to OAFL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The supplemental agreements and various letters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Plaintiffs and Antig then entered into
                    four supplemental agreements. The first three supplemental agreements are not
                    particularly significant, but do help to convey a fuller picture of the entire
                    transaction. It is the fourth supplemental agreement which is central to the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first supplemental agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The terms of the first supplemental agreement
                    dated 3 January 2005 (“the first Supplemental”) are
                    immaterial to the present dispute. It merely provided that MEGL agreed to pay
                    Tjong US$300,000 upon the execution of the first Supplemental and that the due
                    diligence period was extended by a further 30 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second supplemental agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The second supplemental agreement dated
                    18 February 2005 (“the second Supplemental”) was executed to
                    clarify the extent of the Plaintiffs’ shareholding in PT Deefu. It
                    provided that the original number of issued and fully paid-up ordinary shares in
                    PT Deefu as reflected in the first SPA was incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 18 February 2005 letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Prior to the signing of the second
                    Supplemental, there was a meeting between Tjong, Chan and Alwie at Alwie’s
                    office. Tjong claimed that Alwie explained some of the terms of the first SPA at
                    this meeting, including the fact that part of the purchase price would be paid
                    to Aventi and OAFL in order to help Tjong save on tax liabilities to the
                    Indonesian Government. This meeting and the conversation that transpired is
                    critical, as will be evident later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the same day that the second Supplemental
                    was signed, Tjong purportedly prepared a letter – with the help of a
                    distant relative, Dr Irwan Sutisna Jahja, who is conversant with the
                    English language, and another brother, Iman Malik, which read (when translated)

                    respectively. He claimed that he personally gave the letter to Chan after the
                    signing of the second Supplemental. Chan and Alwie, however, denied receiving
                    the letter. The 18 February 2005 Letter was allegedly also mailed to Antig
                    on 14 March 2005. Pertinently, both MEGL and Antig filed affidavits on
                    17 October 2011 stating that they have never received that document. We
                    note that no credible evidence confirming that the 18 February 2005 Letter
                    was received by Antig, MEGL, Chan or Alwie was adduced by Tjong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is worth noting that the 18 February
                    2005 Letter directly contradicts cl 4.02(4) of the first SPA which
                        states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 7 March 2005 letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 7 March 2005, the parties signed a
                    letter which provided that the Plaintiffs would bear the costs involved in
                    obtaining an extension of time for the commencement date of the operation of the
                    Concession (“the 7 March 2005 Letter”). PT Batubara had
                    previously entered into an agreement with the Government of the Republic of
                    Indonesia which provided that mining operations under the Concession shall be
                    deemed to commence on 20 November 2005. The 7 March 2005 Letter also
                    stated that Antig shall provide a loan of up to US$1.5m to the Plaintiffs to
                    meet the costs and expenses for the application for extension of time; any loans
                    made shall be set off against the US$18m purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The third supplemental agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The third supplemental agreement dated
                    19 July 2005 (“the third Supplemental”) set out variations,
                    amendments and modifications to the first SPA as are required to carry out the
                    preliminary extract of coal at a site under the Concession. A key term in the
                    third Supplemental concerned the loans which Antig was to extend to the
                    Plaintiffs for the purpose of the preliminary extraction operations. It was
                    agreed that these loans would not exceed US$2m. Upon completion of the first
                    SPA, any loans would be treated as working capital of PT Batubara. However,
                    if the first SPA was terminated, the Plaintiffs would be liable for the
                    repayment of the loans to Antig.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The fourth supplemental agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The fourth supplemental agreement dated
                    19 August 2005 (“the fourth Supplemental”) is the most
                    crucial to this dispute. Pursuant to cl 2.2 of the fourth Supplemental, the
                    payment terms under cl 4.02(2) in the first SPA were varied. We shall refer
                    to cl 4.02(2) as varied by the fourth Supplemental as “the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In essence, the sums payable to Tjong, Aventi
                    and OAFL remained the same, though Aventi would now receive a larger amount of
                    cash in lieu of MEGL shares. This was, according to Chan, to placate the
                    Singapore Exchange (SGX) which had objected to MEGL’s issuance of shares
                    amounting to US$9.5m to Aventi – which was originally planned under
                    cl 4.02(2) – as that would make Aventi a major shareholder of MEGL.
                    The other significant difference is that the Amended Clause 4.02(2)
                    explicitly referred to Aventi and OAFL as parties “authorised to receive
                    [the sums] for and on behalf of the [Plaintiffs]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Under the first SPA, the status of Aventi
                    and OAFL as parties authorised to receive the purchase price was only set out in
                    the “Definitions” section and not within
                cl 4.02(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We pause to note that notwithstanding the
                    18 February 2005 Letter, none of the supplemental agreements, in particular
                    the fourth Supplemental, modified cl 4.02(4) of the first SPA (see [17]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Genesis of the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events on or around Completion Date</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The completion of the sale and purchase took
                    place in Indonesia on 13 June 2006. At this meeting which was attended by,
                        <em>inter alios</em>, Tjong, Chan and Alwie, Tjong was
                    given two documents to sign which he did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first document was a letter from Antig to
                    the Plaintiffs explaining that the net amount payable to Tjong on the Completion
                    Date was US$1,970,109.65 instead of the agreed US$2.5m. The difference reflected
                    the amount that Antig had loaned to the Plaintiffs pursuant to the 7 March
                    2005 Letter (see [18] above). The second document was a letter from Tjong to
                    Antig requesting Antig to issue cheques for the sums of S$2,803,009 and
                    S$334,429 as partial settlement of the remaining amounts payable under the first
                    SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Chan then presented two cheques for the sum of
                    S$2,803,009 (equivalent to US$2,289,999) and S$334,429 (equivalent to
                    US$210,000) to Tjong. Tjong claimed that Chan made him sign on the photocopy of
                    the two cheques to make it seem like Tjong had received both cheques. Chan kept
                    the cheque for the equivalent sum of US$210,000, which was made in favour of
                    Coutts Bank, even though Tjong asked for it. Chan asserted that the US$210,000
                    cheque was made at the request of Tjong and was meant for Alwie as his
                    commission fees for brokering the deal. Tjong denied that there was any
                    agreement to pay a commission to Alwie.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The next day, 14 June 2006, Tjong
                    purportedly gave a letter dated 13 June 2006 to Alwie (“the
                    13 June 2006 Letter”). According to Tjong, he handed the same letter
                    to Chan in Singapore a few days later at the Hyatt Hotel. The letter reads (when
                        translated):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With this, I informed that I had received the power of attorney from

                        OAFL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Tjong claimed that he gave Chan this letter
                    not because of the terms of the fourth Supplemental, but because of the
                    impression he had from the meeting in February 2005 when Chan and Alwie
                    purportedly told him that the payments to Aventi and OAFL were for his
                    (Tjong’s) benefit. However, Chan claimed that the first time he had sight
                    of the 13 June 2006 Letter was in Suit 89. He denied receiving the
                    letter and disputes the authenticity of the letter. Alwie too stated that he did
                    not receive a copy of the 13 June 2006 Letter, and that he only found out
                    about the letter when he received an affidavit filed by Tjong on 8 February
                    2010 in support of the Plaintiffs’ application for a Mareva injunction
                    against him (“the Mareva Injunction”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Guarantee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Sometime in July 2006, Antig requested the
                    Plaintiffs to provide further documents. Tjong said he did not respond as he
                    wanted assurance that the US$12m which was payable to Aventi and OAFL under the
                    first SPA (“the Balance Purchase Price”) would be paid to him.
                    Tjong claimed that he met up with Chan in Singapore at the Hyatt Hotel sometime
                    in September 2006 when he told Chan that he would not provide the documents
                    unless Chan gave an assurance that all the monies would be paid to him, and not
                    to Aventi and OAFL. Tjong said that by this time, he no longer trusted Chan and
                    therefore requested Chan to provide this assurance. Chan allegedly agreed that
                    he would personally guarantee that Tjong would receive the full US$18m. Tjong
                    went to Chan’s office subsequently to pick up the guarantee which Tjong
                    claimed was already signed even before he arrived (“the
                    Guarantee”) (see [169] below). Tjong provided Antig with the requested
                    documents after obtaining the Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The enforceability of the Guarantee is a key
                    issue in CA 83. Chan denied executing the Guarantee and averred that the
                    Guarantee was fabricated by Tjong. He also pointed out that the existence of the
                    Guarantee was only revealed at a very late stage of the proceedings on
                    22 June 2011, when the Plaintiffs applied to amend their Statement of Claim
                    for a second time, which amended Statement of Claim was eventually filed on
                    13 July 2011 (“the Amended Statement of Claim”). Suit 89
                    was commenced on 8 February 2010 and there had already been an earlier
                    amendment to the Statement of Claim on 25 August 2010. The absence of any
                    reference to the Guarantee in this earlier version of the Statement of Claim was
                    conspicuous. It was also not referred to or produced in the Plaintiffs’
                    earlier application for the Mareva Injunction in February 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second and third SPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Despite the Guarantee, the Balance Purchase
                    Price was not paid to Tjong. Tjong claimed that when he met Chan in Singapore on
                    one occasion after the Guarantee was provided to him, Chan made it clear to him
                    that if he wanted the Balance Purchase Price, he had to sell his remaining 28%
                    stake in PT Deefu and his 5% stake in PT Batubara (“the
                    Remaining Shares”) to “MEGL/Antig or [Chan’s] group”
                    for US$2m. According to Tjong, Chan further said that if Tjong refused to sell
                    the Remaining Shares, the following may occur:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     Tjong would not be paid the Balance
                        Purchase Price; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chan will cancel the first SPA; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     PT Deefu would issue more shares
                        to its shareholders in return for capital injection and Tjong’s
                        remaining 28% stake in PT Deefu would be diluted as he was not in a
                        position to pay for any new PT Deefu shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Tjong claimed that under these circumstances,
                    he agreed to sell the Remaining Shares. Two sale and purchase agreements were
                    subsequently entered into on 12 July 2007 (“the second SPA”
                    and “the third SPA”). Under the second SPA, Tjong sold his entire
                    5% shareholding in PT Batubara to one Jake Pison Hawila
                    (“Jake”) for US$320,000. Under the third SPA, Tjong sold his
                    remaining 28% shareholding in PT Deefu to Advance Assets Management Ltd
                    (“AAML”) for US$1.68m. The sole shareholder and director of AAML
                    was one Edwin Sugiarto (“Edwin”), the ninth defendant in
                    Suit 89. In early 2008, Jake and Edwin (through AAML) sold the
                    PT Batubara and PT Deefu shares they had acquired from Tjong to an
                    Australian listed company, APAC Coal Limited (“APAC”), for
                    AUD$12.64m. APAC is a subsidiary of MEGL. Chan stated that he did not know Jake
                    or Edwin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The circumstances leading to the entering of
                    the second and third SPAs is another key issue in CA 83. According to
                    Alwie, he had approached Jake and Edwin – his friends and business
                    associates – to purchase the Remaining Shares. Alwie had done so as he had
                    been informed by Chan that Tjong wanted to sell the Remaining Shares for US$2m.
                    Chan in turn claimed that Tjong had first approached him for a US$2m loan from
                    MEGL. According to Chan, Tjong said that he needed the funds for his other
                    investments as well as to settle some legal problems in Indonesia. Chan said
                    that Tjong was willing to pledge the Remaining Shares to MEGL to secure the
                    loan. However, Chan said that MEGL was not interested in increasing its stake in
                    PT Deefu (through Antig) since it already had majority control.
                    Nevertheless, Chan offered to help Tjong ascertain if others were interested in
                    acquiring the Remaining Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events leading to the commencement of Suit 89</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On 2 November 2007, Tjong made two
                    statements (“the Discharge Letters”) which were substantially
                    similar. They provided that Tjong agreed to release and discharge Antig and its
                    affiliated companies and their officers from any and all claims, and that Tjong
                    confirmed that he had no claim against Antig and its affiliated companies or any
                    third party in respect of the acquisition of the shares of PT Batubara.
                    Tjong admitted to signing the Discharge Letters, but stated that the Discharge
                    Letters were prepared by Chan who requested him to sign. According to Tjong, he
                    did not understand what was in the Discharge Letters but signed them anyway as
                    Chan told him that he had to sign them to receive the Balance Purchase Price.
                    Tjong asserted that in any event, the Discharge Letters have no binding effect
                    under either Singapore or Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On 12 November 2007, Chan met up with
                    Tjong in Singapore. At this meeting, Tjong signed more documents given to him by
                    Chan. According to Tjong, he signed those documents as he was told by Chan that
                    they were necessary if he wanted to receive the Balance Purchase Price. After
                    Tjong had signed the documents, Chan handed him a cheque for the sum of
                    S$1,630,038. This was the amount stated in one of the documents signed by Tjong
                    as being the “final amount of the Balance Purchase
                        Price”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> due to Tjong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On that same day, Tjong prepared a letter
                    which he gave to Chan the next day (“the 12 November 2007
                    Letter”). It reads (when translated):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">As with the other letters which Tjong purportedly gave, Chan denied
                    receiving the 12 November 2007 Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     According to Tjong, Chan was uncontactable
                    after the 12 November 2007 Letter was given to him. It was around that time
                    that he instructed solicitors to recover the Balance Purchase Price. He was also
                    concerned about the final payment of US$3.7m to Aventi which was supposed to
                    take place on 13 June 2008, being 24 months after the Completion Date.
                    Unknown to Tjong, the US$3.7m payable to Aventi had already been satisfied by a
                    payment of US$3,492,800 by Antig to Aventi on 7 November 2007. Chan claimed
                    that Aventi had requested for early payment and offered Antig a 5.6% discount in
                    return. Antig agreed after considering the prevailing fixed interest rates and
                    pointed to an announcement by MEGL on the SGXNet on 13 November 2007
                    declaring the early settlement payment to Aventi. However, no evidence has been
                    adduced to show that Aventi had first requested for early payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the dark over the early payment,
                    Tjong’s solicitors, on behalf of the Plaintiffs, wrote to Antig on
                    9 April 2008:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our clients instruct us that a sum of US$3.7 million is due for
                        payment in June 2008. Our clients hereby give you notice that they require
                        the said payment to be made to TJONG VERY SUMITO. Our clients specifically
                        convey to you that any payment or purported payment to Aventi Holdings Ltd
                        (“Aventi”) will not be recognised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Despite at least two reminders, there was no
                    response from Antig. The Plaintiffs commenced Suit No 348 of 2008
                    (“Suit 348”) on 20 May 2008 to prevent Antig from making
                    the US$3.7m payment to Aventi. Upon an application by Antig, this court stayed
                    Suit 348 in favour of arbitration (see <em>Tjong Very Sumito and
                        others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R)
                    861).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Suit 89 was then commenced by the Plaintiffs
                    on 8 February 2010 against 11 defendants which included Chan, Alwie, Antig,
                    MEGL, Aventi and OAFL. The Plaintiffs’ claims revolved around two main
                    issues: (a) the non-payment of the Balance Purchase Price; and (b) the
                    entrance into the second and third SPAs. It should be noted that in 2011, Antig
                    and MEGL commenced arbitration against the Plaintiffs which ultimately led to a
                    stay of proceedings in Suit 89 against Antig and MEGL. The Plaintiffs
                    subsequently discontinued the court proceedings against Antig and MEGL entirely.
                    Hence, neither Antig nor MEGL filed a defence or took a position in respect of
                    the claims made against Chan and Alwie.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ pleaded cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the purposes of the present appeals,
                    except where relevant, the claims against the other nine defendants will not be
                    elaborated upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiffs’ claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At the outset, it is useful to state that
                    Antig had paid out a total of US$17.7m in cash and shares to Tjong, Aventi and
                    OAFL in the amounts that each were entitled to contractually under the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2). This is undisputed. The US$300,000 shortfall based on the
                    total purchase price of US$18m was explained by Antig as being due to the
                    discounts given by Aventi for early payment of the amount due to Aventi. The
                    Plaintiffs’ case is that the full US$18m should have been paid to Tjong
                    and not to other parties. They claimed:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     The total cash payment of US$550,000
                        (“OAFL Cash Payment”) and allotment and issuance of 42,102,727
                        MEGL shares (“OAFL Shares Payment”) (collectively “the

                    Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        total cash payment of US$5,372,800 (“Aventi Cash Payment”) and
                        the allotment and issuance of 124,856,364 MEGL shares to Aventi
                        (“Aventi Shares Payment”) (collectively “the Aventi
                        Payments”) were also not authorised by the Plaintiffs. In particular,
                        the Plaintiffs neither knew nor consented to the early payment of the Aventi
                        Cash Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Together with the losses Tjong allegedly
                    suffered by selling his Remaining Shares under the second and third SPAs, the
                    Plaintiffs mounted the following claims against Chan and Alwie:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>
<b>AGAINST CHAN
                    ALONE</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     
            <u>The Guarantee Claim</u>: Chan is liable
                        under the Guarantee as the Plaintiffs were not paid and did not receive the
                        Balance Purchase Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <u>The Duress Claim</u>: The sale
                        of the Remaining Shares under the second and third SPAs was procured under
                        duress. Chan was one of the parties who had caused the duress and is
                        therefore liable to Tjong for the losses suffered by Tjong in selling the
                        Remaining Shares below value.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <u>The Undue Influence Claim</u>:
                        The sale of the Remaining Shares under the second and third SPAs was
                        procured through undue influence exercised by Chan. Chan is therefore liable
                        to Tjong for the losses suffered by Tjong in selling the Remaining Shares
                        below value.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <u>The second and third SPAs Misrepresentation
                            Claim</u>: Chan had fraudulently misrepresented that Tjong would
                        be paid the Balance Purchase Price if he sold the Remaining Shares according
                        to the terms of the second and third SPAs. Tjong relied on his
                        misrepresentation and sold his Remaining Shares, but was not paid the
                        Balance Purchase Price. Chan is therefore liable to Tjong for the losses
                        suffered by Tjong in selling the Remaining Shares below value, as well as
                        the Balance Purchase Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_e"></a>(e)     
            <u>The second and third SPAs Unlawful
                            Means Conspiracy Claim</u>: Chan had conspired with other
                        defendants to cause Tjong to enter into the second and third SPAs through
                        duress, undue influence, deceit and/or fraudulent misrepresentation with the
                        intention of injuring Tjong. Chan is therefore liable to Tjong for the
                        losses suffered by Tjong in selling the Remaining Shares below
                    value.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a_3"></a>(a)     
            <u>The OAFL Trust Claim</u>:
                        The OAFL Payments were not intended to be a gift from the Plaintiffs.
                        Further, OAFL knew that the OAFL Payments were not rightfully due to it. It
                        therefore holds the OAFL Payments on either a resulting trust or
                        constructive trust for the Plaintiffs. The corporate veil of OAFL should be
                        lifted to make Alwie personally liable to return the OAFL
                    Payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b_4"></a>(b)     
            <u>The OAFL Unjust Enrichment Claim</u>: OAFL
                        and/or Alwie are also liable to return the OAFL Cash Payment to the
                        Plaintiffs as money had and received by OAFL.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c_5"></a>(c)     
            <u>The OAFL Conversion
                            Claim</u>: The Plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of the
                        42,102,727 MEGL shares comprising the OAFL Shares Payment. OAFL unlawfully
                        and without consent of the Plaintiffs took into their possession the
                        allotment of the MEGL shares. This amounted to conversion of the
                        Plaintiffs’ right to ownership or immediate possession of the MEGL
                        shares. The corporate veil of OAFL should be lifted and OAFL and/or Alwie
                        are liable in damages for conversion of the MEGL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>
<b>AGAINST BOTH CHAN AND

</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a_7"></a>(a)     
            <u>The first SPA Misrepresentation Claim</u>:
                        Chan and Alwie had deceived or fraudulently misrepresented to the Plaintiffs
                        the nature and structure of cl 4.02(2) both in its original and amended
                        form. Effectively, the Plaintiffs were led to believe that the US$18m
                        purchase price would be paid to them. Chan and Alwie are therefore liable
                        for the Plaintiffs’ loss of the Balance Purchase
                    Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b_8"></a>(b)     
            <u>The Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim</u>: Chan and Alwie
                        had conspired with the other defendants to use unlawful means, namely deceit
                        and fraudulent misrepresentations, to cause damage to the Plaintiffs. They
                        are therefore liable for the Plaintiff’s loss of the Balance Purchase
                        Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c_9"></a>(c)     
            <u>The US$210,000 Trust Claim</u>: There was no
                        legitimate reason for a payment of US$210,000 to a Coutts Bank account which
                        belonged to Alwie. The US$210,000 was not intended to be a gift to Chan
                        and/or Alwie and therefore Chan and/or Alwie hold(s) the sum on a resulting
                        or constructive trust for the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d_10"></a>(d)     
            <u>The US$210,000 Unjust
                            Enrichment Claim</u>: Chan and Alwie are also liable to return
                        the US$210,000 as money had and received by Chan and/or
                Alwie.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Chan’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Chan disputed all the claims made against
                    him:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chan denied making any of the
                        misrepresentations relating to the first, second and third SPAs alleged by
                        Tjong. He further claimed that none of the Plaintiffs had relied on any of
                        the alleged misrepresentations and did not suffer loss or damage upon such
                        reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chan
                        denied executing the Guarantee. He claimed that it was fabricated and
                        asserted that in any event, the Guarantee was unenforceable and had no legal
                        effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     Chan
                        denied that the Balance Purchase Price was payable to Tjong. The sums paid
                        by Antig were in accordance with the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_d"></a>(d)     Chan denied agreeing with any of the other defendants to do an
                        unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means to injure the
                        Plaintiffs, and asserted that he had no intention and did not cause any
                        person to carry out an act to injure the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_e"></a>(e)     Chan denied receiving the US$210,000
                        payment from the Plaintiffs. Thus, he is not liable under any resulting or
                        constructive trust, or claim for unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_f"></a>(f)     Chan denied the allegations of duress
                        and undue influence. He claimed that there was no threat or illegitimate
                        pressure exerted on Tjong to induce him into entering into the second and
                        third SPAs. Tjong exercised his own free will in entering into the
                        agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Chan further relied on the Discharge Letters
                    signed by Tjong. Chan argued that any cause of action which the Plaintiff may
                    have had against him was released or waived pursuant to the Discharge Letters.
                    The Plaintiffs’ claims against him are therefore
                unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alwie’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Alwie’s defence was straightforward. His
                    main line of defence was that the OAFL Payments as well as the US$210,000
                    payment were legitimately received by OAFL pursuant to the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2), in accordance with the first SPA read with the fourth
                    Supplemental. Thus, the claims in respect of these sums founded on trust, unjust
                    enrichment and conversion were unmeritorious. Alwie also denied the claims
                    founded on misrepresentation and conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Judge dismissed most of the
                    Plaintiffs’ claims. However, he found in favour of the Plaintiffs in
                    respect of (a) the Guarantee Claim, (b) the second and third SPAs
                    Misrepresentation Claim, (c) the OAFL Unjust Enrichment Claim, and (d) the
                    OAFL Conversion Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Consequently, the Judge held that Chan is
                    liable to Tjong for (a) US$12,471,227, being the difference between the
                    US$18m and what Tjong received, and (b) damages for Tjong’s losses
                    flowing from sale of the Remaining Shares under the second and third SPAs. The
                    Judge also ordered OALF and/or Alwie to pay the Plaintiffs (a) US$550,000,
                    and (b) damages to be assessed for the conversion of the 42,102,727 MEGL
                    shares. Aventi was also ordered to pay the Plaintiffs damages of S$27,468,400
                    for the conversion of 124,856,364 MEGL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Judge provided that if the Plaintiffs
                    recovered damages from Aventi and OAFL and/or Alwie in respect of the conversion
                    of the MEGL shares, the Plaintiffs shall refund to Chan such amount representing
                    double recovery, up to a maximum of US$5.75m which is the original value of the
                    total number of MEGL shares which were issued. Curiously, the Judge did not
                    provide that if the Plaintiffs recovered the US$550,000 from OAFL and/or Alwie,
                    that same amount shall be refunded to Chan to prevent double
                recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ submissions on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 83</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Chan’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Chan’s submissions in this appeal
                    focuses on two aspects, namely the Guarantee Claim and the second and third SPAs
                    Misrepresentation Claim. With regard to the Guarantee Claim, counsel for Chan,
                    Mr Ang Cheng Hock SC (“Mr Ang”), raised the
                    following arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Guarantee was fabricated
                        by Tjong. It was unconventional in form and highly irregular, and the text
                        in the Guarantee was superimposed onto the document which bore Chan’s
                        signature (“Superimposition Argument”). The expert evidence by
                        Ms Michelle Novotny (“Ms Novotny”), which included
                        two reports (“Novotny’s first Report” and
                        “Novotny’s second Report”), supported the
                        Superimposition Argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, even if the Guarantee was genuine, it should be
                        construed as a guarantee for Antig’s performance of its obligations
                        under the first SPA and not as an indemnity which the Judge found. The
                        construction of the Guarantee as a guarantee and not an indemnity is
                        consistent with (a) the commercial context and payment structure of the
                        first SPA, (b) the plain words used in the Guarantee, and (c) the
                        contemporaneous evidence and conduct of the Tjong and
                    Chan.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the
                        Discharge Letters released Chan from any further liability under the first
                        SPA in respect of payments which had already been paid out by Antig. In
                        other words, the Discharge Letters ratified all payments made by Antig as of
                        2 November 2007, the date of the Discharge Letters, and confirmed that
                        such payments were in accordance with Antig’s obligations under the
                        first SPA. Thus, Chan was no longer liable to Tjong as at 2 November
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     With regard to the second and third SPAs
                    Misrepresentation Claim, Mr Ang canvassed the following arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Chan did not represent that
                        he would ensure that Tjong would be paid the Balance Purchase Price if Tjong
                        entered into the second and third SPAs (“the
                        Representation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Representation is not even actionable as a
                        misrepresentation as it is a statement of what Chan would do in the future.
                        Such a statement of a future act is not actionable but is, at best, a
                        promise which is not enforceable for want of, amongst other things,
                        consideration and intention to enter into binding legal
                    relations.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        even if the Representation is actionable, it was not fraudulently made as
                        Chan honestly believed that Tjong would receive “full payment”
                        under the first SPA, and did subsequently take steps to ensure that payment
                        would be made. The fact that Chan had procured Antig to pay Aventi is not
                        evidence of dishonesty as the first SPA provided that Aventi was authorised
                        to receive payments on behalf of the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, in any event, Tjong had not
                        been induced into entering into the second and third SPAs by the
                        Representation. Tjong had access to independent lawyers and other sources of
                        advice at the material time. Further, as the Judge had found, there is
                        nothing to show that Tjong had intended to sell the Remaining Shares for
                        more than US$2m but was instead coerced by Chan into selling them for US$2m.
                        Tjong’s decision to sell the Remaining Shares at US$2m was an
                        independent and conscious decision motivated by his desire to
                        “flip” the Concession for a quick profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_e"></a>(e)     Last but not least, the Remaining
                        Shares were not sold below value. The Remaining Shares were effectively
                        minority stakes and a minority discount must be applied accordingly when
                        compared to the US$18m purchase price under the first SPA. The price of the
                        Remaining Shares subsequently sold to APAC is also not reflective of the
                        value of the Remaining Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Respondents’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Counsel for the Respondents, Mr Peter
                    Gabriel (“Mr Gabriel”), basically rehashed the reasons
                    provided by the Judge. On the Guarantee Claim, Mr Gabriel argued:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Guarantee is genuine and not
                        fabricated by Tjong. Novotny’s first Report does not assist Chan as it
                        does not meet the standard of proof required to establish forgery.
                        Novotny’s second Report should not be admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if Ms Novotny’s expert
                        reports are admitted, all they show is that there was superimposition of the
                        signature and text in the Guarantee. It does not show that this
                        superimposition was done by Tjong. Thus, forgery or fabrication is not made
                        out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Guarantee is in the nature of an indemnity. It was meant to ensure that
                        Tjong received the full purchase price <em>if</em>
                        Antig, Aventi and/or OAFL failed to pay Tjong.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Discharge Letters do not assist Chan because
                        they were not related to the sale and purchase of the PT Deefu
                        shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Gabriel’s arguments on the
                    second and third SPAs Misrepresentation Claim are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge’s factual finding
                        that Chan had made the Representation was based on his observation that Chan
                        was not a credible witness. The Judge believed Tjong’s testimony and
                        this should not be disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Representation is a statement of intention which Chan
                        did not honestly hold. Chan could not have honestly believed that the
                        Respondents would receive the full US$18m if Tjong sold his Remaining Shares
                        under the second and third SPAs. Such a representation is
                    actionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Representation induced Tjong into selling the Remaining Shares and this is
                        actionable even if it was not the sole reason. As long as the Representation
                        was actively present in Chan’s mind, which it was, the Representation
                        is actionable. In the present case, the Judge had found that the
                        Representation was a “significant factor” that induced Tjong
                        to sell, and this finding should not be reversed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 82</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Alwie’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In CA 82, Mr Sivakumar Murugaiyan
                    (“Mr Murugaiyan”) and Dr Tang Hang Wu
                    (“Dr Tang”), counsel for Alwie, made the following
                    submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Tjong is not entitled to sue
                        in relation to shares held in the name of Herman as Herman had discontinued
                        his action and was not a party before the Judge. An equitable owner cannot
                        maintain an action without the legal owner being a party to the
                        action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        OAFL and/or Alwie are not liable for the OAFL Unjust Enrichment Claim as
                        (i) there is no unjust factor in OAFL’s receipt of the OAFL Cash
                        Payment, and (ii) OAFL’s enrichment from the OAFL Cash Payment
                        was not at the Respondents’ expense. On the first point, the
                        Judge’s finding of an absence of authority on the part of OAFL to
                        retain the OAFL Cash Payment does not constitute an unjust factor. On the
                        second point, the enrichment was not at the Respondents’ expense as
                        OAFL Cash Payment came from Antig, not the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the OAFL Conversion Claim fails
                        because (i) the MEGL shares from the OAFL Shares Payment are not
                        capable of being converted, and (ii) the Respondents did not have a
                        right of immediate possession to the MEGL shares. On the first point,
                        conversion only applies to tangible property and not intangible rights. The
                        exception to this rule is “documentary intangibles” such as
                        cheques. Only bearer shares and share certificates together with indorsed
                        blank transfer forms are regarded as “documentary
                        intangibles”. The 42,102,727 MEGL shares are neither and hence cannot
                        be converted. On the second point, the Respondents do not have a right to
                        immediate possession as their claim against OAFL is a <em>chose</em> in action for a right of transfer of the MEGL shares,
                        and <em>choses</em> in action cannot be possessed.
                        Further, the Respondents cannot be considered as bailors as they do not have
                        a proprietary right in the shares. Lastly, there was no agency relationship
                        between OAFL and the Respondents which gave rise to an immediate right of
                        possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the corporate veil should not have been lifted as the Judge had not
                        found that OAFL was a mere device, sham or façade used by
                    Alwie.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Respondents’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Gabriel contended:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Herman had executed a Power
                        of Attorney which authorised Tjong to commence proceedings in respect of the
                        shares in PT Deefu which were legally owned by
                    Herman.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the
                        four elements required to establish a claim in unjust enrichment were found
                        to be met by the Judge. The “unjust factor” in this case is
                        that OAFL “cannot in conscience retain the money [the OAFL Cash
                        Payment]”. This unjust enrichment was at the expense of the
                        Respondents as OAFL received the OAFL Cash Payment knowing that it belonged
                        to the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the MEGL shares can be converted as they are supported by
                        physical share certificates held in the Central Depository (“the
                        CDP”). The Respondents have the requisite standing to sue for
                        conversion as they had a right to immediate possession of the MEGL shares as
                        the owner of the MEGL shares, or alternatively, as the principal of OAFL,
                        who acted as its agent in receiving the MEGL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, there is no dispute that Alwie
                        is the directing mind and will of OAFL. Given that OAFL had been abused to
                        further an improper purpose by wrongfully converting and misappropriating
                        the OAFL Payments, the corporate veil ought to be
                lifted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the light of the parties’
                    submissions, there are two main issues in CA 83:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Guarantee is enforceable
                        against Chan and if so, whether the Guarantee is in the nature of a
                        guarantee or an indemnity (the “Guarantee Issue”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether Chan is
                        liable for fraudulently misrepresenting to Tjong that he would be paid the
                        Balance Purchase Price if he entered into the second and third SPAs (the
                        “Misrepresentation Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In respect of CA 82, the three main
                    issues are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Respondents are entitled
                        to sue in relation to shares held in the name of Herman given that Herman
                        had already discontinued his action; and whether the corporate veil of OAFL
                        should be lifted such that Alwie would be personally liable for orders made
                        against OAFL (the “Gateway Issues”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether OAFL was unjustly enriched by
                        the OAFL Cash Payment (the “Unjust Enrichment Issue”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether
                        OAFL had converted the 42,102,727 MEGL shares from the OAFL Shares Payment
                        (the “Conversion Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As all the parties premised their submissions
                    on Singapore law being the applicable law for all the issues, we shall address
                    these issues using Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary issues</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Credibility of witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The court should be wary of the maxim
                        <em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</em> – false
                    in one thing, false in everything. That the evidence of a witness need not be
                    rejected <em>in toto</em> simply because it is unreliable
                    or untrue in some parts is firmly established. In <em>Chai Chien
                        Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [72],
                    this court cited with approval the <em>dicta</em> of Raja
                    Azlan Shah FJ (as he then was) in <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)</em> [1977] 1 MLJ 15 at
                    19:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be
                        believed in its entirety or not at all. A court is fully competent, for good
                        and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to
                        reject the other. It is, therefore, necessary to scrutinize (<em>sic</em>) each evidence very carefully as this involves
                        the question of weight to be given to certain evidence in particular
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In <em>Khoon Chye Hin v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1961] MLJ 105.1 (“<em>Khoon
                        Chye Hin</em>”), Thomson CJ stated (at 107):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it is clear
                        that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest of
                        his evidence must be scrutinised with great care and indeed with suspicion.
                            <em>To say, however, that because a witness has been
                            proved a liar on one or two points then the whole of his evidence "must
                            in law be rejected" is to go too far and is wrong</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This principle, though applied usually in criminal proceedings, no
                    doubt has equal application in civil cases. <em>Khoon Chye
                        Hin</em> was cited with approval by Yong CJ in <em>Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 957 at [44],
                    which was in turn recently applied by Belinda Ang J in <em>Trans-World (Aluminium) Ltd v Cornelder China (Singapore)</em> [2003]
                    3 SLR(R) 501 at [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The correct approach that the court should
                    adopt in such cases is to appraise the witness’s entire evidence in the
                    context of all the other evidence and circumstances of the case. A flawed
                    witness may be telling the truth on some matters: <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 24 at
                    [103]. It is only where the grain and the chaff are so inextricably linked that
                    evidence from a witness who has been shown to be extremely unreliable may
                    perhaps be discarded <em>in toto</em>; the mere fact that
                    some part of a witness’s evidence is found to be deficient, unreliable or
                    simply untrue is usually insufficient to justify the rejection of his or her
                    evidence <em>in toto</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As noted by the Judge, Chan was a deeply
                    unsatisfactory and unhelpful witness who no doubt was untruthful on certain
                    issues. However, that does not warrant a complete rejection of Chan’s
                    evidence. This Court must objectively scrutinise his evidence to separate the
                    grain from the chaff. At the same time, we note that the Judge had relatively
                    little to comment on Tjong’s credibility as a factual witness. From our
                    reading of the evidence on record, we are of the view that Tjong was as
                    unsatisfactory a witness as Chan, if not more. We provide three non-exhaustive
                    examples.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     First, Tjong stated on numerous occasions that
                    he is not well-versed in English and has difficulty understanding the key
                    documents such as the first SPA and the supplemental agreements which are
                    recorded in English. The evidence suggested otherwise. One of Tjong’s
                    former solicitors, Mr Manjit Singh, gave evidence that Tjong is in fact
                    able to understand English. There was written correspondence between
                    Mr Manjit Singh and Tjong in English. There is no suggestion that Tjong had
                    given the impression to Mr Manjit Singh that the correspondence should be
                    written in another language or that the correspondence should be translated.
                    Further, Tjong did not just sign one or even two documents; he signed the first
                    SPA, the four supplemental agreements, and several other letters, most of which
                    were in English. Most of these documents were signed without the presence of
                    lawyers. If Tjong really had difficulty with the English language, he would have
                    sought assistance in deciphering the documents before signing any of them. A
                    businessman signing commercial documents written in a language in which he is
                    not competent would ordinarily seek professional assistance. The fact that Tjong
                    did not do so lends credence to the suggestion that his command of the English
                    language is not as poor as he has portrayed it to be. Tjong was, after all, a
                    seasoned businessman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Second, Tjong’s explication of his
                    understanding of the role of Aventi and OAFL in the transaction shifted numerous
                    times in the course of the proceedings. At one point, he claimed that no
                    payments were to be made to Aventi and OAFL. That does not square with the fact
                    that even under the original cl 4.02(2), Aventi and OAFL were already
                    expressly included as recipients of the purchase price. Then, at some later
                    point, Tjong claimed that he was amenable to payments being made to him
                        <em>through</em> Aventi and OAFL to enable him to save
                    on tax expenses which he would otherwise have incurred in Indonesia. His case in
                    the end, elucidated by Mr Gabriel during oral arguments, was that he did
                    not care whether monies were routed to or through Aventi and OAFL, as long as he
                    ultimately received US$18m. We find Tjong’s inability to give a consistent
                    version of his position discomforting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Third, Tjong’s explanation for raising
                    the Guarantee at a relatively late stage of proceedings is more than
                    implausible. He claimed that the Guarantee had been locked away in an
                    “iron safe” in Jakarta, and that he had been unable to retrieve it
                    as Chan had made a police report against him in Indonesia which prevented him
                    from returning.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> There was no evidence
                    of the alleged police report made against Tjong. In the end, the Guarantee was
                    purportedly retrieved by Tjong’s wife who brought it to Singapore.
                    Evidently, Tjong did not have to be present in Indonesia to retrieve the
                    Guarantee. His explanation for the delay in producing the Guarantee is nothing
                    short of being incredible. We should point out that the Judge, too, appeared to
                    disbelieve his evidence on this point (see the Judgment at [194]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     With such patent inconsistencies inherent in
                    his evidence, there is no clear reason for the court to prefer Tjong’s
                    evidence over Chan’s or even Alwie’s for that matter. We stress once
                    again that the court should always test witnesses’ testimonies against the
                    objective evidence to distinguish fact from fiction, truth from falsity. In the
                    present case, given that the credibility of each of the key witnesses is, to
                    some extent, suspect, the objective evidence therefore plays a crucial role in
                    ascertaining what could have taken place. We turn now to what we consider to be
                    the most decisive piece of objective evidence, the first SPA.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Chan and Alwie’s explanation of the
                    Amended Clause 4.02(2) was this. Tjong was only supposed to receive US$6m,
                    and the remaining US$2m and US$10m payments to OAFL and Aventi were profits to
                    Alwie and Johanes respectively. In short, Alwie and Johanes were assisting Tjong
                    in “flipping” the Concession by helping to find buyers. The
                    arrangement between the three of them was that Tjong would only get US$6m from
                    any eventual sale and Alwie and Johanes would pocket the difference. Aventi and
                    OAFL were, in <em>that</em> sense, receiving part of the
                    purchase price for and on behalf of the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Judge rejected this interpretation of the
                    Amended Clause 4.02(2). He thought that a plain reading of the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) meant just what it said – that Aventi and OAFL were to
                    hold such payments “for and on behalf of” the Plaintiffs. In other
                    words, the Plaintiffs were entitled to receive the full US$18m purchase price,
                    albeit through Aventi and OAFL as intermediaries. The Judge’s difficulty
                    with Chan and Alwie’s contention was apparent during the cross-examination

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     We respectfully disagree with the
                    Judge’s interpretation. The plain meaning of “for and on
                    behalf” does not necessarily imply that Aventi and OAFL were holding the
                    payments as <em>agents</em> of the Plaintiffs. We are not
                    persuaded that the plain meaning of “for and on behalf” in the
                    Amended Clause 4.02(2) imports the understanding that Tjong would be
                    entitled to the full US$18m under the first SPA. In fact, the word
                    “receive” preceding the phrase “for and on behalf”
                    supports Chan and Alwie’s interpretation that Aventi and OAFL were
                    entitled to receive the payments as third party beneficiaries to the first
                    SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The first SPA is not a lengthy document; it is
                    not drafted with excessive legal verbiage; and the crucial payment terms are
                    expressly and clearly worded. Specifically, the Amended Clause 4.02(2)
                    spells out the values of the cash payments and MEGL share payments due to both
                    Aventi and OAFL. Tjong must therefore have known that a substantial portion of
                    the US$18m would be paid to Aventi and OAFL. That is not in doubt. He may not
                    have known who the controlling minds of Aventi and OAFL were, but he would have
                    certainly assumed that the two entities must have been connected to Chan and
                    Alwie, the two people that he had been negotiating with. Why these payments were
                    made to Aventi and OAFL and the nature of Aventi and OAFL’s entitlement to
                    retain these payments become clearer when one turns to the context of the entire
                    transaction, from the events that took place prior to the signing of the first
                    SPA to the amendments in the fourth Supplemental.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Context of the transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Tjong wanted to “flip” the
                Concession</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Tjong admitted during cross-examination that
                    he was looking to “flip” the Concession for a quick profit. From
                    the sequence of events, it is apparent to us that that was indeed Tjong’s
                    motivation. Led by Tjong, the Plaintiffs had purchased the Concession through
                    the purchase of shares in PT Batubara in August 2004. They then tried to
                    sell a majority stake in PT Batubara to Mr Tjokrosaputro almost
                    immediately (see [8]–[9] above). The Plaintiffs clearly had little or no
                    interest in holding on to a controlling stake in the Concession. When that
                    transaction was aborted, Tjong then put word out that the Plaintiffs owned a
                    Concession and were looking to sell it. Alwie introduced Tjong to Chan, and the
                    first SPA with Antig was entered into shortly thereafter. All this happened
                    within a short span of three months from the time the Plaintiffs purchased the
                    Concession. The inference which the factual matrix invites us to draw is that
                    Tjong was keen to “flip” the Concession. After the failure to
                    close the sale to Mr Tjokrosaputro, Antig presented itself as the perfect
                    buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Given that the proposed deal with
                    Mr Tjokrosaputro was only worth US$8m, if the entire purchase price of
                    US$18m under the first SPA was to be paid to the Plaintiffs, it would have been
                    nothing short of a massive windfall for them. Nothing had changed in the short
                    span of time between the failed deal with Mr Tjokrosaputro and the new deal
                    with Antig that would have justified such a large premium. It was for this
                    reason that Alwie contended that what had happened was that he had already
                    obtained a commitment from Tjong that the Plaintiffs would sell 72% of
                    PT Deefu (which works out to 68.4% of PT Batubara) for US$6m. However,
                    the contractual purchase price would be inflated to US$18m. Alwie and Johanes
                    would then pocket the difference, for their role as facilitators, by structuring
                    U$12m of the purchase price to be paid through OAFL and Aventi, which they
                    respectively controlled. We find this arrangement suggested by Alwie to be
                    entirely plausible. Tjong’s counsel could not even begin to explain why
                    such an elaborate scheme had been conjured merely to ease his client’s
                    alleged tax liabilities without any corresponding benefit to the other counter
                    parties. It bears mention that even at US$6m, the Plaintiffs would still have
                    made a huge profit – more than five times their capital outlay – in
                    a matter of three months. Granted, they would have received US$2m less than they
                    would have under the aborted deal with Mr Tjokrosaputro; however, Tjong
                    still received a handsome profit while retaining a slightly over 30% stake in
                    PT Batubara. Against this backdrop, Tjong would have ample reason to be
                    content to let Chan and Alwie resolve the details regarding the payment of the
                    remainder of the inflated price. That was perhaps why he signed with alacrity
                    the first SPA and the subsequent supplemental agreements despite his alleged
                    lack of proficiency in English and, more importantly, apparently without taking
                    legal advice. As far as Tjong was concerned, his share of the deal was US$6m.
                    How the other parties wanted to apportion the balance US$12m and via what
                    mechanism was immaterial to Tjong. Even if they stood to gain a larger share of
                    the purchase price, that was the necessary condition for Tjong’s US$6m and
                    he consented to that arrangement. That, as we see it, was the basis of the
                    deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Against this context, the phrase “for
                    and on behalf” in the Amended Clause 4.02(2) becomes clearer. The
                    Plaintiffs would, on paper, be selling their stake in PT Deefu for US$18m.
                    In reality, the understanding was that Tjong would only receive US$6m. The
                    remainder would be paid to Aventi and OAFL. It is in this sense that Aventi and
                    OAFL were receiving the US$12m “for and on behalf” of the
                    Plaintiffs (see also [146], [152] and [157] below). To put it another way, as
                    far as Antig was concerned, the payment to Aventi and OAFL would be deemed to be
                    a payment made to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Tjong’s inconsistent explanations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Tjong’s inconsistent explanations as to
                    why he agreed to the Amended Clause 4.02(2) do not assist the
                    Respondents’ cause. When the first SPA was signed, Tjong claimed that he
                    did not read the terms. He claimed that he only found out about the channelling
                    of payments to Aventi and OAFL in a meeting in February 2005 where Alwie
                    explained the payment terms under original cl 4.02(2) to him. It was then
                    that he learnt of the alleged tax benefits. According to Tjong, he told Alwie at
                    the meeting that he disagreed that the payments should go to (or through) Aventi
                    and OAFL. Yet, in the same breath, he claimed that Chan told him that the two
                    companies belonged to Chan, and that these payments were to help Tjong save on
                    taxes. Yet, around the same time but presumably after this meeting, Tjong then
                    purportedly gave Chan and Alwie the 18 February 2005 Letter which stated,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that he was not associated to
                    Aventi and OAFL, did not owe them any debt, and had never instructed Antig to
                    pay them any part of the purchase price (see [15] above). Inexplicably, Tjong
                    signed the second Supplemental on that same day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Finally, in spite of all these protestations,
                    he subsequently agreed to the fourth Supplemental on 19 August 2005, six
                    months later, which reaffirmed that payments were to be made to Aventi and OAFL.
                    This chain of events seriously undermines Tjong’s credibility on this
                    issue. If Tjong had already stated in the 18 February 2005 Letter that the
                    purchase price should not go through Aventi and OAFL, why was this not reflected
                    in the fourth Supplemental? More unusually, why did he agree to the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) which on its plain wording required Antig to do precisely
                    the thing that Tjong had told Chan and Alwie not to do in his 18 February
                    2005 Letter? Why did he not seek independent legal (or other) advice and verify
                    the contents of the documents he signed? Mr Gabriel conceded when pressed
                    by us that there was “no logical answer”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     At the very least, Tjong’s case
                    vacillated uneasily between one where he accepted Chan’s purported
                    assurance that the payments were for tax reasons and one where he flatly denied
                    that any payments should be made to Aventi and OAFL, even though he has chosen
                    not to plead <em>non est factum</em> in respect of the
                    first SPA or the fourth Supplemental. These two explanations are mutually
                    exclusive. Tjong’s testimony raises more red flags than it provides
                    answers; it is unclear what his case really is at the end of the day. Indeed,
                    during oral arguments, Mr Gabriel suggested yet another explanation: it was
                    Chan who had inserted the phrase “for and on behalf” in the
                    Amended Clause 4.02(2) in order to comply with the SGX requirements.
                    Tjong’s clumsy and inconsistent explanations of the nature of the
                    transaction at various stages of the proceedings appear to be desperate attempts
                    to claw back monies which he had expressly agreed Antig should pay to Aventi and
                    OAFL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Reducing Tjong’s tax liabilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     To dispel any residual doubts, we also address
                    Tjong’s case at its highest, <em>ie</em>, that by the
                    time the fourth Supplemental was signed, he had agreed to the payments to Aventi
                    and OAFL as reflected in the Amended Clause 4.02(2) on the purported
                    understanding that it would reduce his tax liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In the first place, there is little commercial
                    reason for a buyer to gratuitously advise the seller on how to avoid taxes,
                    especially when there is no indication that such advice contributed to a
                    reduction of the negotiated purchase price. Moreover, it is Tjong’s own
                    evidence that he did not hire Indonesian lawyers to determine if the arrangement
                    with Aventi and OAFL indeed helped him to save tax. Tjong claimed that he
                    trusted Chan, but it should be noted that Tjong is a seasoned businessman who
                    had not met Chan or dealt with him in any previous capacity. There is simply no
                    sensible reason for Tjong, dealing with Chan on an arm’s length basis, to
                    believe Chan to such a great extent. There is also no credible evidence
                    suggesting that Tjong believed that Chan had some special knowledge of the tax
                    regime in Indonesia which Tjong, being an Indonesian businessman himself, did
                    not possess.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Those considerations aside, even if we accept
                    that Tjong’s alleged potential tax savings was the basis for his entering
                    into the fourth Supplemental, on what basis was he expecting Aventi and OAFL to
                    return to him the payments made to them? If this was a pass-through arrangement,
                    when and how was payment to be made to Tjong? This is a serious flaw in
                    Tjong’s case. There is nothing in the first SPA or any of the supplemental
                    agreements providing for a return of the payments from Aventi and OAFL. It must
                    be remembered that Aventi and OAFL are not parties to the first SPA or any of
                    the supplemental agreements. There is no evidence of any extraneous agreements
                    for the repayment of the monies and shares which were to be paid to Aventi and
                    OAFL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     We acknowledge that it may appear somewhat odd
                    that Tjong would willingly give up US$12m of the purchase price to Alwie and
                    Johanes (and, by extension, possibly Chan) for their role in helping to find a
                    buyer. This curiosity, however, presupposes that Tjong was strongly convicted
                    that he would have been able to find another buyer willing to pay a similar
                    price. Taking into account the circumstances leading up to the deal with Antig
                    (see [74] above), it is commercially understandable that Tjong wanted to realise
                    the Plaintiffs’ paper profit, even if the condition was that part of the
                    purchase price would be paid to Alwie and Johanes for their involvement in
                    securing the buyer. It is worth noting that Tjong was no stranger to giving
                    commissions. He admitted giving a US$90,000 commission to Mr Rahardjo, who
                    had introduced him to Alwie. Against that inference, we find it more
                    unbelievable that Tjong, a seasoned businessman, would agree to have <em>two-thirds</em> of the purchase price paid to two entities
                    which he admitted he had no prior connection to, without first having a firm
                    arrangement with the entities as to how the monies and shares would be returned
                    to him, simply because he was told by the representative of the other
                    contracting party that this mechanism would help him save tax. This conclusion
                    requires one to believe that Alwie, Johanes and Chan were altruistic and wanted
                    to act in the best interests of Tjong without obtaining any benefit in return.
                    There is no reason why Alwie, the middleman broker who introduced Chan to Tjong
                    and is himself a businessman, would have voluntarily set up a deal without first
                    extracting a substantial benefit for himself. Tjong’s case is all the more
                    fantastical given that he was not advised by lawyers during the negotiations and
                    at the time of the signing of the first SPA and supplemental agreements. He
                    could not have, at the relevant time of contracting, conceived of the causes of
                    action in trust, conversion and unjust enrichment – which he adroitly
                    mounted in Suit 89 – should Aventi and OAFL abscond with
                    “his” monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In our view, for all the above reasons, we
                    find that it is more likely that the Amended Clause 4.02(2) reflected the
                    parties’ intention that the US$12m was to be paid to Aventi and OAFL as
                    third party beneficiaries nominated by the Plaintiffs as opposed to agents of
                    the Plaintiffs. The US$12m was never intended to be paid to the
                    Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Clause 4.02(4)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Our interpretation of the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) is buttressed when read with cl 4.02(4) of the first
                    SPA (see [17] above). Read alone, cl 4.02(4) is fairly straightforward. It
                    states that payments made to Aventi and OAFL shall be deemed to be payments made
                    to the Plaintiffs. Why was this necessary, we ask? If the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) is to be interpreted as imposing an obligation on Aventi and
                    OAFL to hold the monies on behalf of the Plaintiffs as their agents,
                    cl 4.02(4) would be redundant as payments to agents of a principal would
                    obviously count as payment to the principal. If a superfluous interpretation of
                    cl 4.02(4) is to be avoided (see <em>Travista Development
                        Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine and others</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R)
                    474 at [20]), the interpretation of the Amended Clause 4.02(2) found by the
                    Judge and advocated by the Respondents cannot be accepted. In our view,
                    cl 4.02(4) confirms – for the benefit of Antig in particular –
                    that <em>notwithstanding</em> a total of US$12m was to be
                    paid to Aventi and OAFL as <em>beneficiaries</em> nominated
                    by the Plaintiffs, those payments shall be deemed as payment to the Plaintiffs
                    of the full US$18m purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subsequent conduct as an interpretative aid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Before we leave the interpretation of the
                    Amended Clause 4.02(2), we note that the Judge arrived at his
                    interpretation of the Amended Clause 4.02(2) partly<sup></sup>in reliance on evidence relating to events that occurred <em>after</em> the parties entered into the first SPA and fourth
                    Supplemental. In this regard, we are unable to accept that the six subsequent
                    events relied upon by the Judge (see the Judgment at [106]–[119]) are
                    unequivocal. First, the probative value of the subsequent events is premised to
                    a large extent on the Judge’s assessment of the credibility (or the lack
                    thereof) of Tjong, Chan and Alwie. As we have clarified, Tjong appears to be no
                    less reliable that Chan or Alwie for that matter. Second, the Judge’s
                    reliance on the Guarantee was misplaced, as we shall elaborate later (see
                    [162]–[181] below). Third and most crucially, there is minimal connection,
                    if any, between the subsequent events relied upon and the elucidation of the
                    parties’ intentions supporting the interpretation that under the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2), Aventi and OAFL were not entitled to keep any payments made
                    to it, <em>ie</em> they were to hold such payments
                    “for and on behalf of” the Plaintiffs. For instance, the Judge was
                    correct in highlighting the irregularity of the two sums of US$1.88m and
                    US$3.49m which were prematurely paid by Antig to Aventi on the written or oral
                    instructions of Chan. The fact that these two sums were paid into a Credit
                    Agricole account without specifying the account holder made the payments even
                    more dubious. However, notwithstanding the oddities surrounding the payments, it
                    is unclear how this particular subsequent event sheds light on the
                    parties’ intentions in relation to the nature of the payments to Aventi
                    and OAFL under the Amended Clause 4.02(2). It does not assist in the
                    illumination of the intentions of Antig and the Plaintiffs as to whether Aventi
                    and OAFL were entitled to keep the payments made to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the Amended Clause 4.02(2) </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In the end, notwithstanding the questionable
                    assertions from Tjong that he did not understand English and the unmistakable
                    insinuation that he had been tricked into signing documents, it must be
                    emphasised that the Respondents elected not to plead the defence of <em>non est factum</em>. It may very well have been the case that
                    Tjong did not understand crucial aspects of the first SPA. However, as long as
                    the Respondents stand by the Amended Clause 4.02(2), which Mr Gabriel
                    affirmed in the course of oral arguments, they are bound by an objective
                    construction of that clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     It is undeniable that the structuring of the
                    transaction is anything but normal and straightforward, as the Judge rightly
                    observed. Many of the arrangements between Tjong and Chan, Alwie and Johanes
                    were said to be premised on “trust” and
                    “relationship”. There is very little documentary and physical
                    evidence, only wavering testimonies from <em>all</em> the
                    parties. At best, it was a shady – or in the Judge’s words –
                    irregular transaction. Any reproachable conduct by Chan, Alwie and/or Johanes
                    may well have been prosecutable under Tjong’s other claims based on fraud,
                    deceit and conspiracy, but Tjong has chosen not to appeal against the
                    Judge’s decision to dismiss those claims. From a contractual perspective,
                    having chosen not to disclaim the first SPA and the fourth Supplemental, Tjong
                    must accept the terms of the agreements for what they appear to mean to an
                    objective person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Our interpretation of the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) disposes of CA 82, namely, the Unjust Enrichment Issue
                    and the Conversion Issue. If the payments to Aventi and OAFL under the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) were intended to be for the benefit of the two entities, it
                    follows that the Respondents have no basis to claim for unjust enrichment and
                    conversion against OAFL. Nevertheless, in deference to the extensive arguments
                    presented by counsel on the issues in CA 82, and given that CA 82
                    raises a number of novel and important questions of law, we shall address the
                    issues in CA 82 in some detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis for CA 82</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Gateway Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     There are two gateway issues which must be
                    resolved before the main issues of unjust enrichment and conversion can be
                    considered: first, whether the Respondents have the <em>locus
                        standi</em> to bring the claims even though Herman discontinued his
                    action halfway; and second, whether the corporate veil of OAFL should be pierced
                    such that liability could be imposed on its controlling mind,
                Alwie.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Respondents’ locus standi</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Mr Murugaiyan contended that the
                    Respondents have no <em>locus standi</em> to continue
                    claims against OAFL for Herman’s 7.3% stake in PT Deefu as Herman had
                    dropped out of Suit 89. The Judge found that Herman’s discontinuation
                    did not prevent Tjong from continuing Suit 89 in respect of the shares held
                    by Herman on trust for Tjong. He relied on a Power of Attorney dated
                    21 June 2010 executed by Herman in Tjong’s favour. The Power of
                    Attorney authorised Tjong to “[f]ile a lawsuit in courts of Jakarta and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Without even considering the Power of
                    Attorney, this contention is a non-starter. Mr Murugaiyan’s reliance
                    on the House of Lords decision in <em>Performing Right Society,
                        Ld v London Theatre of Varieties, Ld</em> [1924] AC 1
                        (“<em>Performing Right</em>”) is
                    misplaced. It was held in <em>Performing Right</em> (at 14)
                    that “when a plaintiff has only an equitable right in the thing demanded,
                    the person having the legal right to demand it must in due course be made a
                    party to the action”. The significance of the nature of the rights upon
                    which the action is founded is well-illustrated in <em>Alliance
                        Entertainment Singapore Pte Ltd v Sim Kay Teck and another</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 869. In that case, the plaintiff claimed to be the
                    “exclusive licensee” in Singapore of the copyright in certain
                    works as a result of some contractual arrangements. It commenced proceedings
                    against the defendants for alleged breach of copyright. However, the court found
                    (at [48]) that the plaintiff was not an “exclusive licensee”
                    within the meaning of s 7 of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) and thus the action under the Copyright Act could not be maintained.
                    Referring to <em>Performing Right</em>, the plaintiff there
                    argued that this defect would be remedied so long as original copyright owners
                    are joined. The court dismissed this argument (at [63]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The decisions in <em>The Charlotte</em> [1908] P 206,
                            <em>Performing Right Society Limited v London Theatre of
                            Varieties</em> [1924] AC 1 <em>...</em> all
                        deal with the owner in equity having to add the legal owner in order to
                        “perfect” the title to sue or some variant of this. This is
                        unremarkable and accepted practice, in that in order to obtain <em>final</em> judgment, the equitable owner must either
                        perfect his title b<em>y taking an assignment from the legal
                            owner or, alternatively, join t</em>he legal owner because of the
                        risk to the defendant that he will be exposed to a second claim by or under
                        the legal owner, in particular, by a <em>bona fide</em>
                        purchaser for value without notice claiming under the legal owner ...
                            <em>This type of case is clearly different from the one
                            before me</em>. <b><em>The plaintiff has not advanced
                            its claim </em></b><b>qua </b><b><em>equitable assignee. The only capacity which it has put forward
                            is as an exclusive licensee pursuant to its contractual
                            arrangements.</em></b> However, if it is not an exclusive licensee
                        within the meaning of the Act, in my judgment, it has no title to sue at all
                        and the joinder of the owners of the copyright does nothing to remedy that.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is incorrect to characterise the present
                    dispute as one solely involving Herman’s proprietary rights in
                    PT Deefu. In so far as CA 82 is concerned, the OAFL Unjust Enrichment
                    Claim and the OAFL Conversion Claim are not premised on the vindication of
                    proprietary rights; they arise out of the Respondents’ contractual rights
                    under the first SPA. There is no dispute or claim founded on the ownership of
                    the PT Deefu shares in Suit 89. The “thing demanded”
                    – to borrow the phrase from <em>Performing Right</em>
                    – is not a proprietary right relating to Herman’s 7.3% stake in
                    PT Deefu.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Furthermore, the OAFL Unjust Enrichment Claim
                    and the OAFL Conversion Claim are not made by the Respondents <em>qua</em> equitable owners of a <em>chose</em> in
                    action which is legally owned by Herman. On the contrary, if anything, the
                    Amended Clause 4.02(2) provides that of the Plaintiffs, only Tjong is
                    entitled to receive any payment. Any action to recover monies which are
                    allegedly owed to Tjong is premised on rights which belong entirely to Tjong,
                    not Herman. This is also not a case where the legal and equitable owners of a
                        <em>chose</em> in action are different such that the
                    equitable owner of the <em>chose</em> in action should join
                    the legal owner if it wishes to enforce the <em>chose</em>
                    in action: see <em>Roberts v Gill &amp; Co and another</em>
                    [2011] 1 AC 240 at [64]. Herman’s discontinuation of the action
                    therefore does not affect the Respondents’ right to prosecute the OAFL
                    Unjust Enrichment and the OAFL Conversion Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Piercing OAFL’s corporate veil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Mr Murugaiyan argued that the Judge erred
                    in piercing OAFL’s corporate veil because first, this was not pleaded by
                    the Respondents, and second, there was no allegation or finding that OAFL was a
                    mere device, sham or façade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Mr Murugaiyan’s first argument may
                    be briefly dealt with. It is indisputably clear from a reading of the Amended
                    Statement of Claim that the Respondents did plead that OAFL’s corporate
                    veil should be pierced <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                        Alwie:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further or in the alternative, based on the aforesaid, the <em>corporate veil of OAFL should be lifted</em> and the
                        Plaintiffs seeks (<em>sic</em>) the recovery of
                        US$550,000 and 42,102,727 MEGL shares ... from Alwie ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further or in the alternative, the Plaintiffs’ claim is for
                        US$550,000, being money payable by OAFL and/or Alwie (<em>by
                            virtue of lifting the corporate veil</em>) to the Plaintiffs as
                        money had and received by OAFL and/or Alwie to the use of the
                        Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As for the second argument that there was no
                    allegation or finding that OAFL was a mere device, sham or façade,
                    Mr Murugaiyan has misconstrued the Judge’s ground for piercing
                    OAFL’s corporate veil. The Judge lifted OAFL’s corporate veil on the
                    ground that Alwie was OAFL’s <em>alter ego</em>, not
                    that OAFL was a mere device, sham or façade (see the Judgment at [70]). The ground
                    of alter ego is distinct from that based on façade or sham, and the key question
                    that must be asked whenever an argument of alter ego is raised is whether the
                    company is carrying on the business of its controller: <em>NEC

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     OAFL was incorporated in the British Virgin
                    Islands on 28 October 2004 by Alwie for the sole purpose of receiving
                    payment under the first SPA, as admitted by Alwie himself under
                    cross-examination. On 19 November 2004, Alwie appointed himself as the sole
                    director and shareholder of OAFL. Alwie also admitted in his affidavit that OAFL
                    was “controlled” by him. Alwie also similarly admitted in the
                    Defence of the fifth and sixth Defendants (Amendment No 2) (“fifth
                    and sixth Defendants’ Amended Defence”) that he is the

<p class="Judg-1">OAFL’s Coutts Bank account which the US$550,000 was paid into
                    was clearly controlled by Alwie. Although OAFL was the named owner of that
                    account, Alwie was the beneficial owner of the account, as Mr Murugaiyan
                    confirmed and as corroborated by Chan, who said that he knew that the monies
                    paid into the Coutts Bank account were for Alwie. Alwie too conceded under
                    cross-examination that he operated the Coutts Bank account as if it was his own
                    personal bank account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Furthermore, Alwie actively procured payments
                    due to OAFL under the first SPA, and the manner in which Alwie procured the
                    payments suggests that Alwie made no distinction between himself and OAFL. On
                    23 November 2004, Alwie, on behalf of OAFL, wrote to Antig via a letter
                    addressed to Chan, requesting Antig to arrange for the US$50,000 payable under
                    the Amended Clause 4.02(2)(a)(ii) of the first SPA to OAFL to be converted
                    into Singapore dollars and deposited via cheque into Alwie’s bank account.
                    The letter was shown to Alwie during cross-examination. Crucially, Alwie
                    admitted that he asked Chan to pay him the US$50,000 even though he was aware
                    that he was not a party to the first SPA and the US$50,000 was in fact supposed

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Later, on 12 June 2006, Alwie, on

                    under the first SPA to be paid to the Coutts Bank account. On 13 June 2006,

                    entitled to recover the OAFL Cash Payment from OAFL (and Alwie, as a consequence
                    of piercing the corporate veil) as money had and received because all the
                    elements of an unjust enrichment claim were established on the facts. The Judge
                    identified the relevant unjust factor as that of a “want of authority to
                    retain money”, citing specifically Goff &amp; Jones, <em>The Law of Unjust Enrichment</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed,
                    2011) (“<em>Goff &amp; Jones (8th Ed)</em>”)
                    at paras 8-01– 8-02 (see the Judgment at [120]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear, based on the plain meaning of
                        Clause 4.02(2), that <b><em>OAFL has no authority to
                            retain the payments made to it under the 1st SPA</em></b> (<em>sic</em>)<b><em>. This constitutes the
                            relevant unjust factor</em></b> required to establish the money had
                        and received claim. As observed in <em>Goff &amp;
                            Jones</em> at paras 8-01 – 8-02, <b><em>the want of authority to retain money constitutes an unjust
                            factor</em></b> where:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[A] defendant, D, obtains an enrichment by immediate transfer from a
                            claimant, C, in <em>circumstances</em> where C did
                            not consent to the enrichment. It is also common for a defendant, D, to
                            obtain an enrichment from a claimant, C, more remotely, as a result of
                            the actions of a third party, X, which were neither authorised nor
                            consented to by C...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>Where X holds assets subject to duties and powers
                                to deal with them for C’s benefit, and acts within his
                                authority, C will have no remedy. But where X acts outside his
                                authority, his “want of authority” will itself
                                constitute a sufficient ground for recovery by C.</em>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In reaching his conclusion that this unjust
                    factor was established on the facts of the case, the Judge concluded that
                    pursuant to the Amended Clause 4.02(2), Aventi and OAFL were not entitled
                    to retain and benefit from payments received by them. Since OAFL had no
                    authority to retain the payments, the unjust factor of “want of
                    authority” was established.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Upholding the contractual allocation of risk</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Given our interpretation of the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) (see [67]–[87] above), the Respondents’ claim in
                    unjust enrichment must necessarily fail. The amount that was payable to Tjong,
                    as provided under the first SPA and supported by the factual matrix of the case,
                    has always been US$6m and not a cent more. By virtue of the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2), Antig was contractually obliged to pay the OAFL Cash
                    Payment to OAFL (and not Tjong). In accordance with the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2), Antig paid the OAFL Cash Payment to OAFL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Simply put, under the first SPA, the
                    Plaintiffs contracted for the OAFL Cash Payment to be made by Antig to OAFL, and
                    this was precisely what they got. It does not lie in the mouth of the
                    Respondents to now say that they are entitled to recover the very same payment
                    that they contracted for Antig to pay to OAFL. Indeed, to allow the Respondents
                    to recover from OAFL the Cash Payment through an action in unjust enrichment
                    would be to undermine the contractual bargain under the first SPA which the
                    Plaintiffs and Antig agreed on. That the law of unjust enrichment should avail a
                    plaintiff <em>no</em> remedy against the defendant where
                    the plaintiff and a third party entered into a contract under which the
                    plaintiff was required to confer a benefit directly on the defendant is
                    supported by a string of judicial decisions. The courts are unwilling to permit
                    a plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim in these cases as to do so would
                    undermine the contract and the contractual allocation of risk between the
                    plaintiff and the third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In the influential House of Lords decision
                    of <em>Pan Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd v Creditcorp Ltd</em>
                    [1994] 1 WLR 161 (“<em>Pan Ocean</em>”),
                    the appellant time-chartered a vessel from Trident Shipping Co Ltd
                    (“Trident”) on terms which provided for advance payments. As part
                    of arrangements for credit facilities from the respondent, Trident assigned
                    receivables due under the charter to the respondent. The appellant paid an
                    advance payment of hire to Trident while the vessel was off-hire. Subsequently,
                    the appellant terminated the charterparty contract between itself and Trident
                    after Trident failed to pay for repair of the vessel. However, Trident's
                    financial position meant that it was not worth suing. Thus, the appellant sued
                    the respondent, seeking to recover from the respondent the advance payment on
                    the ground that it was paid for a consideration that had wholly failed. The
                    House of Lords dismissed the appellant’s appeal, holding that the
                    respondent was under no obligation to repay the advance payment. Lord Goff
                    of Chieveley stated (at 164–166):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All this is important for present purposes, because it means that,
                            <b><em>as between shipowner and charterer, there is a
                            contractual regime which legislates for the recovery of overpaid hire.
                            It follows that, as a general rule, the law of restitution has no part
                            to play in the matter</em></b><em>; the existence of
                            the agreed regime renders the imposition by the law of a remedy in
                            restitution both unnecessary and inappropriate</em>. Of course, if
                        the contract is proved never to have been binding, or if the contract ceases
                        to bind, different considerations may arise, as in the case of frustration
                        (as to which see <em>French Marine v. Compagnie Napolitaine
                            d'Eclairage et de Chauffage par le Gaz</em> [1921] 2 A.C. 494, and
                        now the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943). With such cases as
                        these, we are not here concerned. Here, it is true, the contract was
                        prematurely determined by the acceptance by Pan Ocean of Trident's
                        repudiation of the contract. But, before the date of determination of the
                        contract, Trident's obligation under clause 18 to repay the hire instalment
                        in question had already accrued due; and accordingly that is the relevant
                        obligation, as between Pan Ocean and Trident, for the purposes of the
                        present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows that, in the present circumstances and indeed in most other
                        similar circumstances, there is no basis for the charterer recovering
                        overpaid hire from the shipowner in restitution on the ground of total
                        failure of consideration. It is true that sometimes we find in the cases
                        reference to there having been in such circumstances a failure of
                        consideration (see, e.g., <em>C. A. Stewart &amp; Co. v. Phs.
                            Van Ommeren (London) Ltd</em> [1918] 2 K.B. 560, 563, <em>per</em> Scrutton L.J.). ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is against this background that we have to consider Pan Ocean's claim
                        now made against Creditcorp for repayment of the hire instalment paid to it
                        as assignee of the charter hire. First, <em>although the
                            benefit of the contract debt had been assigned to Creditcorp, with the
                            effect that payment to Creditcorp by Pan Ocean constituted a good
                            discharge of the debt, nevertheless the burden of the contract remained
                            upon Trident. From this it follows that Trident remained contractually
                            bound to repay to Pan Ocean any overpaid hire, notwithstanding that such
                            hire had been paid not to Trident but to Creditcorp as
                            assignee</em>. Mr. Hirst, for Pan Ocean, accepted in argument that
                        this was so; but he nevertheless maintained that Pan Ocean had alternative
                        courses of action open to it— either to proceed against Trident in
                        contract, or to proceed against Creditcorp in restitution. His argument
                        proceeded on the basis that, in ordinary circumstances, a charterer has
                        alternative remedies against the shipowner for the recovery of overpaid
                        hire, either in contract or in restitution; and that here, since the hire
                        had been paid to Creditcorp as assignee, Pan Ocean's remedy in restitution
                        lay against Creditcorp in place of Trident. However, for the reasons I have
                        already given, I am unable to accept this argument. This is because, in my
                        opinion, <em>Pan Ocean never had any remedy against Trident
                            in restitution on the ground of failure of consideration in the present
                            case, its only remedy against Trident lying under the
                            contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am of course well aware that writers on the law of restitution have been
                        exploring the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, a plaintiff
                        may have a claim in restitution when he has conferred a benefit on the
                        defendant in the course of performing an obligation to a third party (see,
                        e.g., <em>Goff and Jones on the Law of
                        Restitution</em>, 4th ed. (1993), pp. 55 et seq., and (for a
                        particular example) <em>Burrows on the Law of
                            Restitution</em>, (1993) pp. 271–272). But, quite apart from
                        the fact that the existence of a remedy in restitution in such circumstances
                        must still be regarded as a matter of debate, <b><em>it is
                            always recognised that serious difficulties arise if the law seeks to
                            expand the law of restitution to redistribute risks for which provision
                            has been made under an applicable contract</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    We agree with Lord Goff’s
                    observations above. There was a valid and subsisting contract between the
                    appellant and Trident, under which Trident had assigned its right to the benefit
                    of payment to the respondent. By suing the respondent instead of Trident for the
                    advance payment, the appellant was effectively seeking to avoid the valid and
                    subsisting contract between itself and Trident, which provided for contractual
                    recourse against Trident in the event of overpaid hire. Lord Goff was
                    rightly concerned that allowing a plaintiff to claim in such a situation would
                    undermine the contract and the contractual allocation of risk between the
                    relevant parties. The appellant should have sued Trident on the contract between
                    them, and not the respondent for restitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The gist of Lord Goff’s
                    observations was adopted by the majority in the important Australian High Court
                    decision of <em>Lumbers and another v W Cook Builders Pty
                        Ltd (in liquidation)</em> (2008) 232 CLR 635 (“<em>Lumbers</em>”). In <em>Lumbers</em>, the appellant owner of land (“the
                    Lumbers”) entered into a contract with a building contracting company
                    (“Sons”) for the construction of a house on the land. Sons then
                    subcontracted much of the work under the contract to the respondent company
                    (“Builders”). Builders sued the Lumbers in unjust enrichment for
                    amounts due to it under the subcontract between Builders and Sons. The court
                    held that Builders had no claim against the Lumbers because there was no
                    contract between them. Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, in their
                    majority judgment, said (at [79], [124]–[126]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The doing of work, or payment of money, for and at the
                        request of another, are archetypal cases in which it may be said that a
                        person receives a “benefit” at the “expense” of
                        another which the recipient “accepts” and which it would be
                        unconscionable for the recipient to retain without payment. And as is well
                        apparent from this Court’s decision in <em>Steele v
                            Tardiani</em> (1946) 72 CLR 386, an essential step in considering
                        a claim in quantum meruit (or money paid) is to ask whether and how that
                        claim fits with any particular contract the parties have made. <em>It is essential to consider how the claim fits with contracts
                            the parties have made because, as Lord Goff of Chieveley rightly
                            warned in Pan Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Creditcorp Ltd [1994] 1 WLR 161 at
                            166, “serious difficulties arise if the law seeks to expand the
                            law of restitution to redistribute risks for which provision has been
                            made under an applicable contract”</em>. In a similar vein,
                        in the Comments upon §29 of the proposed <em>Restatement</em>, (3d), “Restitution and Unjust
                        Enrichment” Tentative Draft No 3, 22 March 2004, the reporter
                        says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘Even if restitution is the claimant’s only recourse, a
                            claim under this Section will be denied where the imposition of a
                            liability in restitution would overturn an existing allocation of risk
                            or limitation of liability previously established by
                            contract.’”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When account is taken of the contractual relationship between the Lumbers
                        and Sons several observations may then be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the Lumbers accepted no benefit at the expense of Builders which it
                        would be unconscionable to retain. The Lumbers made a contract with Sons
                        which either has been fully performed by both parties or has not. <em>Sons made an arrangement or agreement with Builders which again
                            has either been fully performed or it has not. If either the agreement
                            between Sons and the Lumbers or the agreement or arrangement between
                            Sons and Builders has not been fully performed (because all that is owed
                            by one party to the other has not been paid) that is a matter between
                            the parties to the relevant agreement</em>. A failure of
                        performance of either agreement is no reason to conclude that Builders
                        should then have some claim against the Lumbers, parties with whom Builders
                        has no contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Because Builders had no dealings with the Lumbers,
                            Builders has no claim against the Lumbers for the price of any work and
                            labour Builders performed or for any money that Builders may have paid
                            in relation to the construction. Builders has no such claim because it
                            can point to no request by the Lumbers directed to Builders that
                            Builders do any work it did or pay any money it did.
                            </em>
<b><em>Reference to whether the Lumbers
                            “accepted” any work that Builders did or
                            “accepted” the benefit of any money it paid is

          <em>Pan Ocean</em> has
                    also been followed in the leading English Court of Appeal decision of <em>MacDonald Dickens &amp; Macklin (a firm) v Costello and
                        others</em> [2012] QB 244 (“<em>MacDonald</em>”). There, the claimant builder, MacDonald,
                    Dickens &amp; Macklin (“MDM”) entered into a contract with Oakwood
                    Residential Ltd (“Oakwood”), a company owned by the first and
                    second defendants, Mr and Mrs Costello, its shareholders and directors, for
                    the construction of houses on land owned by Mr and Mrs Costello. Mr and
                    Mrs Costello had informed MDM that they were using Oakwood to enter into
                    the contract for tax reasons. MDM had previously done work for Oakwood and was
                    content to proceed in this manner. Subsequently, Oakwood failed to make payments
                    to MDM. At first instance, judgment was given against Oakwood on the outstanding
                    payments. A monetary restitutionary award for unjust enrichment was also made
                    against Mr and Mrs Costello, who then appealed against the decision. The
                    English Court of Appeal allowed the appeal even though it was of the view that
                    Mr and Mrs Costello were enriched at the expense of MDM. Etherton LJ,
                    delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, explained (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am clear, on the other hand, that <em>the unjust
                            enrichment claim against Mr and Mrs Costello must fail because it
                            would undermine the contractual arrangements between the
                            parties</em>, that is to say, the contract between the claimants
                        and Oakwood and the absence of any contract between the claimants and Mr and
                        Mrs Costello. <em>The general rule should be to uphold
                            contractual arrangements by which parties have defined and allocated
                            and, to that extent, restricted their mutual obligations, and, in so
                            doing, have similarly allocated and circumscribed the consequences of
                            non-performance. That general rule reflects a sound legal policy which
                            acknowledges the parties’ autonomy to configure the legal
                            relations between them and provides certainty, and so limits disputes
                            and litigation</em>. The following cases support its application
                        to the present case. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Etherton LJ referred to, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, <em>Brown &amp; Davis Ltd v Galbraith</em>
                    [1972] 1 WLR 997, <em>Pan Ocean</em> and <em>Lumbers</em>, and stated (at [30]–[32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    All those points are fairly made on behalf of the
                            claimants. Nevertheless the policy considerations articulated by
                            Lord Goff in the <em>Pan Ocean</em> case
                            [1994] 1 WLR 161 and by the majority of the High Court of Australia in
                            the <em>Lumbers</em> case [2008] 4 LRC 683, as
                            well as the outcome of all the cases cited above, clearly support
                                <b><em>the general policy of refusing restitutionary
                                relief for unjust enrichment against a defendant who has benefited
                                from the plaintiff’s services rendered pursuant to a contract
                                to which the defendant was not a party</em></b>. For the reasons I
                            have given, that is a sound legal policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    Further, as Mr Darton pointed out, <em>the existence of two remedies, one in restitution and one
                                in contract, is capable of producing anomalous results</em>.
                            Contractual damages are calculated by reference to the contract price
                            and terms. Compensation for unjust enrichment as a result of the
                            plaintiff’s services is calculated by reference to the value of
                            the services (generally at the date of their receipt) which may or may
                            not be the same as the contractual rate. <em>This raises
                                the possibility of compensation in restitution at a higher rate than
                                the contractual rate, so enabling a claimant to improve on a bad
                                bargain, and with consequential implications for contribution by the
                                defaulting contracting party</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    ... It was perfectly clear, then, that <em>the claimants were fully aware, and accepted, that Oakwood
                                was their contracting counter-party and that Mr and
                                Mrs Costello were insisting on that arrangement because of tax
                                reasons which would be put at risk if there were direct contractual
                                relations between themselves and the claimants</em>. There was
                            a perfectly straightforward and standard way in which the claimants
                            could have limited their exposure in the event of default, including
                            insolvency, on the part of Oakwood, namely, by taking guarantees from Mr
                            and Mrs Costello. The claimants did not do so. <em>I
                                can see no basis, on those facts, for saying that in principle the
                                law does or should provide a remedy directly against Mr and
                                Mrs Costello because of Oakwood’s breach of
                                contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Returning to the facts of the present case,
                    Antig performed its obligations entirely in accordance with the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) and the Plaintiffs obtained the performance they contracted
                    for under the first SPA in relation to the OAFL Cash Payment. We agree with
                    Dr Tang’s submission that the Respondents appear to be taking the
                    position that the OAFL Cash Payment was wrongfully paid by Antig to OAFL. If
                    that is indeed the Respondents’ case, the proper recourse would be to sue
                    Antig. Allowing the Plaintiffs to succeed in its claim in unjust enrichment
                    against OAFL here would undermine the contract between Antig and the Plaintiffs.
                    The same reasons that motivated the courts in <em>Pan
                        Ocean</em>, <em>Lumbers</em> and <em>MacDonald</em> to deny the claims in restitution advanced in
                    those cases operate equally here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    For completeness, we do not see OAFL as
                    being unjustly enriched. As Professor Andrew Tettenborn has suggested, where the
                    defendant has <em>lawfully</em> received a benefit from a
                    third party when the benefit was the unencumbered property of the third party,
                    the defendant cannot be considered to be unjustly enriched: Andrew Tettenborn,
                    “Lawful Receipt—A Justifying Factor?” (1997) RLR 1 at 12.
                    The present case is exactly on point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Want of authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    We also respectfully disagree with the
                    Judge’s acceptance of “want of authority” as an unjust
                    factor. As far as we can tell, “want of authority” as an unjust
                    factor is presently a theory advocated solely by the authors of <em>Goff &amp; Jones (8th Ed)</em>. Crucially, it attracts
                    no support from judicial decisions or other leading commentators. In fact,
                    although the authors of <em>Goff &amp; Jones
                        (8th Ed)</em> purport (at paras 8-34–8-44) to derive
                    “want of authority” as an accepted unjust factor from their
                    interpretation of several English cases, including the seminal decision of
                        <em>Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale Ltd</em> [1991]
                    2 AC 548 (“<em>Lipkin Gorman</em>”),
                    they acknowledged subsequently (at para 8-44) that the decisions in these
                    cases were not stated to be based on the recognition of an unjust factor of
                        <em>“</em>want of authority”, but on the
                    basis that the respective plaintiffs <em>had title</em> to
                    the asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The suggestion that “want of
                    authority” is an unjust factor also appears to be a marked departure from
                    the views expressed in previous editions of the same treatise, and incidentally
                    coincides with the change of editorship of the treatise from Lord Goff and
                    Prof Gareth Jones to the current editors. The previous editions in fact
                    took an opposing position to that advocated by the editors of the latest
                    edition. For example, the immediately preceding edition of the same treatise
                    interpreted the claim in <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> as one of
                    “retention of title”: <em>Goff &amp; Jones on The
                        Law of Restitution</em> (Gareth Jones ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    7th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Goff &amp; Jones (7th
                        Ed)</em>”) at ch 2 generally. There was no suggestion of
                    “want of authority” as an unjust factor. The authors of other
                    leading English textbooks have also not recognised this unjust factor: see
                    Andrew Burrows, <em>The Law of Restitution</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 3rd Ed, 2011) (“<em>Burrows</em>”) at p 410; and Graham Virgo, <em>The Principles of the Law of Restitution</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 2nd Ed, 2006) (“<em>Virgo</em>”) at pp 645–646. The leading Australian
                    text on unjust enrichment also rejects the view propounded by <em>Goff &amp; Jones (8th Ed)</em>: see Keith Mason, J W Carter
                    and G J Tolhurst, <em>Mason and Carter’s
                        Restitution Law in Australia</em> (LexisNexis Butterworths,
                    2nd Ed, 2008) (“<em>Mason &amp;
                    Carter</em>”) at para 306.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In our view, the seminal House of Lords
                    decision in <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> does not in fact support
                    the position taken in <em>Goff &amp; Jones
                        (8th Ed)</em>. In that case, Cass, a partner in the plaintiff
                    firm of solicitors, took cash from the plaintiff’s client account and
                    gambled it away at the defendant casino. The court held that the plaintiff was
                    entitled to claim against the defendant for money had and received. It
                    recognised that, as personal restitution was sought from an indirect recipient,
                    it was necessary to show that the money paid by the partner as a third party
                    belonged to the plaintiff. In our view, the court based its decision on the fact
                    that the money received by Cass was the <em>property</em>
                    of the plaintiff solicitors. Lord Goff said (at 572):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The first ground is concerned with the
                            solicitors’
                        </em>
<b><em>title </em></b>
<em>to the
                            money received by Cass (through Chapman) from the bank</em>. It is
                        to be observed that the present action, like the action in <em>Clarke v. Shee and Johnson</em>, is concerned with a
                        common law claim to money, where the money in question has not been paid by
                        the appellant directly to the respondents—as is usually the case where
                        money is, for example, recoverable as having been paid under a mistake of
                        fact, or for a consideration which has failed. On the contrary, here the
                        money had been paid to the respondents by a third party, Cass; and in such a
                        case <em>the appellant has to establish a basis on which he
                            is entitled to the money. This (at least, as a general rule) he does by
                            showing that the money is his legal property</em>, as appears from
                        Lord Mansfield's judgment in <em>Clarke v. Shee and
                            Johnson</em>. If he can do so, he may be entitled to succeed in a
                        claim against the third party for money had and received to his use, though
                        not if the third party has received the money in good faith and for a
                        valuable consideration. The cases in which such a claim has succeeded are, I
                        believe, very rare: see the cases, including <em>Clarke v.
                            Shee and Johnson</em>, collected in <em>Goff and
                            Jones, The Law of Restitution</em>, 3rd ed. (1986), p. 64, note
                        29. This is probably because, at common law, property in money, like other
                        fungibles, is lost as such when it is mixed with other money. Furthermore,
                        it appears that in these cases the action for money had and received is not
                        usually founded upon any wrong by the third party, such as conversion; nor
                        is it said to be a case of waiver of tort. It is founded simply on the fact
                        that, as Lord Mansfield said, the third party cannot in conscience
                        retain the money—or, as we say nowadays, for the third party to retain
                        the money would result in his unjust enrichment at the expense of the owner
                        of the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So, in the present case, <em>the solicitors seek to show
                            that the money in question </em><b><em>was their
                            property at common law</em></b>. But their claim in the present case
                        for money had and received is nevertheless a personal claim; it is not a
                        proprietary claim, <em>advanced on the basis that money
                            remaining in the hands of the respondents is </em><b><em>their property</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, Lord Goff went on to discuss (at 574) how the
                    plaintiff’s right to its monies in the bank was a <em>chose</em> in action which was legal <em>property</em> belonging to the plaintiff that it could trace at
                    common law into the cash drawn by Cass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The same can be said of <em>Nelson and others v Larholt</em> [1948] 1 KB 339
                        (“<em>Nelson</em>”), another case which
                    the editors of <em>Goff &amp; Jones (8th Ed)</em>
                    relied on to argue that the unjust factor of “want of authority”
                    has some judicial support (see <em>Goff &amp; Jones
                        (8th Ed)</em> at para 8-44). In <em>Nelson</em>, Mr Potts, an executor of an estate, fraudulently
                    drew cheques on the estate’s account in favour of the Mr Larholt, the
                    defendant. The beneficiaries brought an action against Mr Larholt to
                    recover the money as money had and received. They succeeded. Denning J (as
                    he then was) stated the following principles (at 342–343):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The relevant legal principles have been much developed in the last
                        thirty-five years. <em>A man's money is property which is
                            protected by law</em>. It may exist in various forms, such as
                        coins, treasury notes, cash at bank, or cheques, or bills of exchange of
                        which he is “the holder” but, whatever its form, it is
                        protected according to one uniform principle. <em>If it is
                            taken from the rightful owner, or, indeed, from the beneficial owner,
                            without his authority, he can recover the amount from any person into
                            whose hands it can be traced</em>, unless and until it reaches one
                        who receives it in good faith and for value and without notice of the want
                        of authority. Even if the one who received it acted in good faith,
                        nevertheless if he had notice—that is, if he knew of the want of
                        authority or is to be taken to have known of it—he must repay.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although “want of authority” was mentioned, it was in
                    the context of the operation of the “<em>bona
                        fide</em> purchaser” defence and not as an unjust factor. Like
                        <em>Lipkin Gorman</em>, Denning J’s decision
                    was based primarily on the fact that the money paid to Mr Larholt was the
                    beneficiaries’ property. Hence, we agree with Dr Tang’s
                    submission that in all of the cases relied on by <em>Goff &amp;
                        Jones (8th Ed)</em> in support of its proposition that
                    “want of authority” constitutes an unjust factor, including
                        <em>Lipkin Gorman</em>, the courts did not in fact
                    justify the restitutionary relief on the basis of a “want of
                    authority” on the part of the defendant to keep the money. Consequently,
                    we do not accept that “want of authority” constitutes an unjust
                    factor for the purposes of a claim for unjust enrichment. The Respondents’
                    claim for unjust enrichment therefore fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Of course, we are cognizant that our
                    conclusion invites consideration of a hitherto unsettled issue <em>viz</em>, whether <em>Lipkin Gorman</em>
                    was in fact a case of a proprietary restitutionary claim or a personal unjust enrichment
                    claim. We should clarify, at this juncture, that although we had emphasised
                    earlier (at [111]–[114]) that the solicitor’s title to the money in
                        <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> was critical to the decision,
                    our comments were in the context of explaining why the case is not good
                    authority for “want of authority” as an unjust factor. In this
                    regard, we refer to <em>Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve
                        (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and
                        another</em> [2013] SGCA 36 where we explained (at [114]) the
                    relevance of the property aspect in the claim for unjust enrichment in <em>Lipkin Gorman</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The more prominent and forceful proponents
                    in this area are Prof Graham Virgo (“Prof Virgo”), who
                    supports the proprietary restitutionary claim analysis, and Prof Andrew
                    Burrows (“Prof Burrows”), who advocates the traditional unjust
                    enrichment basis, though they are by no means the only such advocates: see
                        <em>Virgo</em> at pp 584–585, 645–646;
                        <em>Burrows</em> at pp 432–435; see also
                    Lord Millett writing extra-judicially in “Proprietary
                    Restitution” in <em>Equity in Commercial Law</em>
                    (Simone Degeling and James Edelman eds) (Law Book, 2005) at
                    pp 309–326. This area is contentious partly because the nomenclature
                    used by commentators and courts is not always the same. To Prof Virgo, the
                    essence of a proprietary restitutionary <em>claim</em> is
                    the existence of a continuing – or retention of – proprietary
                    interest in property in the hands of the defendant: <em>Virgo</em> at pp 580–581. The remedy for such a claim can
                    be personal or proprietary: <em>Virgo</em> at
                    pp 575–576. Prof Burrows, on the other hand, appears to take the
                    position that proprietary restitution is a proprietary <em>remedy</em> for a claim for unjust enrichment. In other words, unlike
                    a proprietary restitutionary claim where the basis of the claim is subsisting
                    property rights, Prof Burrow’s conception of proprietary restitution
                    reversing unjust enrichment suggests that property rights can be created to
                    reverse unjust enrichment. As with any claim for unjust enrichment, an unjust
                    factor is still required for the awarding of the proprietary remedy: <em>Burrows</em> at pp 432–433.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    While this debate may be dismissed by many
                    as merely academic discourse, it is not so, as the English High Court decision
                    in <em>Armstrong DLW GmbH v Winnington Networks Ltd</em>
                    [2013] 1 Ch 156 (“<em>Armstrong</em>”)
                    illustrates. The dispute in that case was over the trading of European Union
                    allowances for the emission of carbon dioxide (“EUAs”). An e-mail
                    fraud was perpetrated on Armstrong DLW GmbH (“Armstrong”), the
                    claimant operator of two power plants, by an unknown third party. The result was
                    that a considerable number of EUAs were transferred from Armstrong’s
                    account to Winnington Networks Ltd (“Winnington”), the defendant
                    trader of EUAs. The EUAs were then immediately sold and transferred to a regular
                    counterparty. Armstrong contended that it had a “proprietary restitution
                    claim” to vindicate its persisting legal property in the EUAs, and
                    alternatively, that Winnington had been unjustly enriched.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Stephen Morris QC
                    (“Morris QC”), sitting as a Deputy High Court judge,
                    recognised the distinction between a proprietary restitutionary claim and a
                    claim for restitution for unjust enrichment, though he also qualified that this
                    distinction has not been universally accepted by the leading academic
                    commentators: <em>Armstrong</em> at [62]–[64]. After
                    considering <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> and two other key
                    decisions which came after <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> –
                    the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Trustee of the property of FC
                        Jones &amp; Sons (a firm) v Jones</em> [1997] Ch 159
                        (“<em>F C Jones</em>”) and the
                    House of Lords decision in <em>Foskett v McKeown and
                        others</em> [2001] 1 AC 102 (“<em>Foskett</em>”) – and the views of Prof Virgo in
                        <em>Virgo</em> at pp 645–646, Morris QC
                    concluded (at [75]) that “the <em>Lipkin Gorman</em>
                    case is in substance a case of a ‘proprietary restitutionary claim’
                    <em>and not a claim for restitution for unjust
                        enrichment</em>” [emphasis added]. Morris QC ultimately
                    upheld Armstrong’s proprietary restitutionary claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    We appreciate the force and cogency of
                    Morris QC’s reasoning at [62]–[75] of <em>Armstrong</em>. However, with the greatest respect to him and Prof
                    Virgo, we are not yet prepared to characterise <em>Lipkin
                        Gorman</em> as a clear instance of a proprietary restitutionary claim.
                    First, there is no gainsaying that the plaintiff’s claim in <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> was explicitly recognised by several of
                    the Law Lords as being founded on “unjust enrichment”: at 558
                        <em>per</em> Lord Bridge of Harwich; at 568
                        <em>per</em> Lord Ackner; and at 578 <em>per</em> Lord Goff. In fact, Lord Goff was
                    evidently alive to the distinction between proprietary restitutionary claims and
                    personal claims for unjust enrichment given his observation (at 572) that the
                    plaintiff’s claim “for money had and received is nevertheless a
                    personal claim; it is not a proprietary claim, advanced on the basis that money
                    remaining in the hands of the respondents is their
                property.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Second, we do not think that <em>F C Jones</em> and <em>Foskett</em> necessarily lead one to the conclusion that <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> ought to be read as a case of a
                    proprietary restitutionary claim. <em>F C Jones</em> did not address the express references to
                    unjust enrichment in the various judgments in <em>Lipkin
                        Gorman</em>, while <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> was not
                    even mentioned in any of the judgments in <em>Foskett</em>.
                    This was despite the fact that both Lord Browne-Wilkinson and
                    Lord Millett adverted in <em>Foskett</em> (at 108 and
                    127 respectively) that the vindication of property rights is clearly distinct
                    from the law of unjust enrichment. One would have expected <em>Lipkin Gorman</em> to have garnered more attention in <em>Foskett</em> if it was clearly a proprietary restitutionary
                    claim which has been “incorrectly” characterised as a claim in
                    unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Third, the concept of a proprietary
                    restitutionary claim distinct from unjust enrichment does present some juridical
                    difficulties. Ostensibly, the two causes of action have different requirements
                    and may attract different defences. As Lord Millett stated in <em>Foskett</em> (at 129):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A plaintiff who brings an action in unjust enrichment must show that the
                        defendant has been enriched at the plaintiff's expense, for he cannot have
                        been unjustly enriched if he has not been enriched at all. But the plaintiff
                        is not concerned to show that the defendant is in receipt of property
                        belonging beneficially to the plaintiff or its traceable proceeds. The fact
                        that the beneficial ownership of the property has passed to the defendant
                        provides no defence; indeed, it is usually the very fact which founds the
                        claim. Conversely, a plaintiff who brings an action like the present must
                        show that the defendant is in receipt of property which belongs beneficially
                        to him or its traceable proceeds, but he need not show that the defendant
                        has been enriched by its receipt. He may, for example, have paid full value
                        for the property, but he is still required to disgorge it if he received it
                        with notice of the plaintiff's interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, a claim in unjust enrichment is subject to a change of
                        position defence, which usually operates by reducing or extinguishing the
                        element of enrichment. An action like the present is subject to the bona
                        fide purchaser for value defence, which operates to clear the defendant's
                        title.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Concluding clarifications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Leaving the law unsettled in these
                    circumstances may not be particularly satisfactory. That said, given that there
                    will be potential cascading ramifications on other fields of law, most notably
                    property, equity, trusts and insolvency, it would be prudent to refrain from
                    making a conclusive determination of this issue without the benefit of fuller
                    arguments. Nevertheless, it is apposite to make three further clarifications
                    about the use of terminology in this admittedly confusing and confused sphere of
                    the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    First, caution should be exercised when
                    interpreting older cases, especially those predating <em>Lipkin
                        Gorman</em>, for the simple but important reason that the principle of
                    unjust enrichment is a relatively new creature. It was rejected by
                    Lord Diplock as a general principle as late as 1978 in the House of Lords
                    decision in <em>Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd</em> [1978]
                    AC 95 at 104. Earlier cases were evidently not decided on the basis of unjust
                    enrichment, and it would be dangerous to read those cases as laying down a
                    principle that only came to be established and recognised much
                later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Second, although the Plaintiffs’ claim
                    in Suit 89 against Alwie in respect of the US$550,000 was pleaded as
                        <em>money had and received</em>, that, strictly
                    speaking, is not a cause of action. The action of money had and received was a
                    type of “common” count. Common counts were historical pleading
                    devices that permitted the pleading of claims in <em>general</em> terms with specific details of the debt sought to be
                    recovered left to the law of evidence: <em>Mason &amp;
                        Carter</em> at paras 114–115. We refer to Prof Yeo
                    Tiong Min’s (“Prof Yeo”) helpful explanation in
                    “Restitution, Tracing, and Change of Position” [1994] SJLS 138 at
                    140:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The action for money had and received is no more than a <em>form</em> of action, from a distant time in English legal history
                        when plaintiffs had to take writs out in specific formats. It says nothing
                        more than that the defendant owes the plaintiff a debt [footnote omitted].
                        The <b><em>reason</em></b> for the debt is <b><em>unexplained</em></b>. <b><em>To call the action
                            for money had and received a cause of action is akin to calling an
                            action for damages a cause of action</em></b>. It adds nothing to the
                        analysis. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The use of “common” counts or
                    forms of action has since been abolished, but the nomenclature associated with
                    that system has persisted. That should change, as is the case in Canada where
                    references to most “common” counts have “more or less
                    disappeared from contemporary Canadian professional discourse”:
                    Peter D Maddaugh and John D McCamus, <em>The
                        Law of Restitution</em> vol 1 (Canada Law Book, Looseleaf
                    Edition, 2013) at para 4:300. Plaintiffs should be precise in elucidating
                    the basis for their restitutionary claims. Identifying the precise underlying
                    cause of action for a restitutionary claim has practical consequences in terms
                    of affecting what the plaintiff needs to show in order to establish the claim.
                    We agree with the comment by the editors of <em>Goff &amp; Jones
                        (8th Ed)</em> at para 1.29 that “[t]he old language of
                    ‘money had and received’ … conceals as much as it reveals
                    about the nature of a claim”. In our view, the underlying basis for the
                    action for money had and received is now embraced under the rubric of <em>unjust enrichment</em>: see <em>Westdeutsche
                        Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</em> [1996]
                    1 AC 669 at 710.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Third, building on the work of
                    Prof Peter Birks, Prof Yeo also points out that in the context of
                        <em>unjust enrichment</em>, the word <em>restitution</em> describes a response to an event. The event is the
                    unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff’s expense, and the
                    response is to reverse the enrichment: Yeo Tiong Min, “Tracing and
                    Three-Party Restitution” [1993] SJLS 452 at 453. We agree. There are
                    other restitutionary remedies which are not founded on a claim for unjust
                    enrichment or property, but on a claim in tort or breach of contract or
                    fiduciary duty. Restitution in this latter category of claims is more commonly
                    known as “restitution for wrongs”: <em>Burrows</em> at Part Four; <em>Virgo</em> at
                    Part IV; James Edelman, “Unjust Enrichment, Restitution and
                    Wrongs” (2001) 79 Texas Law Review 1869. Different causes of action
                    may give rise to the same remedy of restitution. The law of restitution is more
                    than just the law of unjust enrichment; the two are not synonymous. Precision in
                    the use of terms would, we think, go some way in ameliorating the uncertainty in
                    this nascent area of the law.</p>

                    court summarised the key elements of an action for conversion (at [45]) in the
                    following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he action lies only if the claimant has possession or a right to
                            <em>immediate possession</em> of the goods and this
                        means that an owner who does not have such a right (say, because of the
                        terms of the bailment) cannot bring an action for conversion. ... Generally,
                        an act of conversion occurs when there is unauthorised dealing with the
                        claimant’s chattel so as to question or deny his title to it ...
                        Inconsistency is the gist of the action, and thus there is no need for the
                        defendant to know that the goods belonged to someone else or for the
                        defendant to have a positive intention to challenge the true owner’s
                        rights ... [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The only element of the test for conversion
                    in dispute in CA 82 is whether the Respondents had an immediate right to
                    possession of the MEGL shares. There is, however, an antecedent question of
                    whether the MEGL shares can even be subject to an action for
                conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether scripless shares can be converted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    It is undisputed that the MEGL shares are
                    scripless. However, the Judge considered that they are scripless only for the
                    purposes of trading. He found that the MEGL shares are represented by physical
                    share certificates issued by MEGL and deposited and registered with the CDP.
                    They are therefore capable of being converted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Mr Murugaiyan argued that scripless
                    shares are intangible property. He referred to the House of Lords decision in
                        <em>OBG Ltd and another v Allan and others</em> [2008]
                    1 AC 1 (“<em>OBG</em>”), where the
                    majority held that intangible property cannot sustain an action for conversion.
                    He also argued that only bearer shares and certificated shares with transfers
                    endorsed in blank are capable of being converted. The MEGL shares are neither.
                    Mr Gabriel agreed that the MEGL shares are scripless and echoed the
                    Judge’s comment that there are physical share certificates which are
                    deposited with the CDP, and these certificates represented the MEGL shares. It
                    is OAFL’s act of taking possession of these certificates that undergirds
                    the action for conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   General rule and the exception of documentary
                intangibles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The general rule is that conversion only
                    protects interest in chattels, or things that can be possessed: <em>OBG</em> at [95]; <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on
                        Torts</em> (Michael Jones &amp; Anthony Dugdale eds) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2010) at para 17-35. In other words, there cannot be
                    conversion of intangibles such as <em>choses</em> in
                    action. There is one recognised exception to the general rule. Documentary
                    intangibles such as cheques, negotiable instruments, guarantees, insurance
                    policies and bonds <em>can</em> be converted, even though
                    their sole value is in their nature as <em>choses</em> in
                    action. In <em>Goode on Commercial Law</em> (LexisNexis,
                    4th Ed, 2009) at p 32, Prof Goode describes documentary
                    intangibles as “rights to money, goods or securities which are locked up
                    in a document to the extent that the document is considered to represent the
                    right, which thus becomes transferable by transfer of the document
                    itself.” This is achieved by treating the chattel, <em>ie</em> the physical instrument, as the subject-matter of the
                    conversion, as evidencing the face value which can be extracted under the
                    instrument: <em>Lloyds Bank, Limited v The Chartered Bank of
                        India, Australia and China</em> [1929] 1 KB 40 at 55–56.
                    Thus, if a physical instrument which value lies in a <em>chose</em> in action is unlawfully dealt with, the person entitled to
                    the physical instrument may recover damages based on the value of the <em>chose</em>: <em>Alsager v Close</em>
                    (1842) 152 ER 600; <em>Midland Bank Ltd v Eastcheap Dried Fruit
                        Co</em> [1961] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 251; <em>Ernest
                        Scragg &amp; Sons v Perseverance Banking and Trust Co</em> [1973]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 101.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    As corporeal, tangible property, there is no
                    doubt that the share certificates can be converted. The question is whether they
                    are worth more than just pieces of paper. In <em>Pacrim
                        Investments Pte Ltd v Tan Mui Keow Claire and another</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 141, Andrew Ang J held (at [18]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[a] share certificate is not a documentary intangible. A pledge of a share
                        certificate does not confer on the pledgee the rights attaching to the
                        shares but only possessory title to the paper on which the share certificate
                        is printed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This may be read to mean that share certificates are not worth
                    anything more than the paper on which they are printed on. While that may be
                    true of, say, registered shares, (see Gerard McCormack, “Security Over
                    Shares – Reform is in the Air” (2003) 3 Insolvency Lawyer 92
                    at p 92), this does not apply to all shares. Indeed, the share certificates
                    in <em>MCC Proceeds Inc v Lehman Brothers International
                        (Europe)</em> [1998] 4 All ER 675, <em>Malkins
                        Nominees Limited v Société Financiéré Mirelis SA and others</em>
                    [2006] EWHC 2132 (Ch), and <em>EG Tan &amp; Co (Pte) v Lim &amp;
                        Tan (Pte) and another</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 1081, the case
                    referred to by the Judge, were all held to be capable of forming the
                    subject-matter of a claim for <em>substantial</em> damages
                    for conversion: see also Mark Hsiao, “Legitimised Interference with
                    Private Properties – Banking Act 2009” (2010) 25(5) JIBLR 227 at
                    232.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In the present case, there are share
                    certificates issued by MEGL over the relevant shares. The complication lies in
                    the way these certificates function under the CDP system which allows trading of
                    scripless shares, a process which invariably decouples the shares from the
                    actual share certificates. Understanding the operation of the CDP system is
                    crucial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Operation of the CDP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The bulk of the operation of the CDP is

                            such shares. In order to trade under the scripless system, investors
                            have to open a securities account with the Central Depository (Pte) Ltd
                            (CDP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the SES, or alternatively, a

                            credited electronically to their respective securities account with CDP

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In short, under the scripless trading system
                    in Singapore, although shares are scripless for the purposes of trading, they
                    are still backed by certificates. For newly listed companies, shares would
                    typically be issued under jumbo certificates. Regulation 11 of the CDS
                    Regulations allows the CDP to require an issuer to issue jumbo certificates in
                    the name of the CDP. In all cases, the share certificates would be registered in
                    the CDP’s name. Notwithstanding this, the account holder to whom the
                    shares are issued would have a book-entry under his account reflecting his title
                    to the shares, and would enjoy the same rights and privileges as a shareholder
                    of the issuer. When the account holder transfers shares electronically, his
                    account and that of the transferee’s would be updated to reflect the
                    change in title to the shares. At any point in time, the account holder who has
                    a book-entry reflecting title to shares of a company would be, for all intents
                    and purposes, entitled to enjoy the rights associated with being a shareholder
                    of that company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    That was precisely what MEGL did. It issued
                    new shares <em>with</em> a new set of share certificates in
                    favour of the CDP, albeit the shares were expressed to be allotted to HSBC
                    (Singapore) Nominees Pte Ltd, OAFL’s nominee, for OAFL’s account.
                    Thus, the CDP was the registered owner of the MEGL shares. However, on the
                    CDP’s register, in accordance with s 130C(<em>b</em>) of the Companies Act, OAFL, through its nominee, was recorded
                    as having title to the MEGL shares. Accordingly, pursuant to s 130D of the
                    Companies Act, OAFL was deemed to be a shareholder of MEGL, and enjoyed the
                    rights associated with being a shareholder of MEGL. In other words, the
                    scripless shares issued to OAFL can be traced to the book-entry in its CDP
                    account which is in turn conditioned on the share certificates issued by MEGL
                    which, though registered in CDP’s name, were expressed to be for
                    OAFL’s account with the CDP. Hence, we agree with the Judge that the MEGL
                    shares, or more accurately, the share certificates which are tied to and sustain
                    the book-entries in the CDP register, are capable of being the subject-matter of
                    a substantive claim for conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Respondents had a right to immediate possession of the
                MEGL shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    It is trite that only a person who has
                    actual possession or the right to immediately possess the goods concerned can
                    sue for conversion. There is no dispute that the Respondents never had actual
                    possession of the MEGL shares. The shares were allotted and issued directly to
                    OAFL’s nominee. The only point of contention is whether the Respondents
                    had a right to immediate possession of the shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The Judge held that the Plaintiffs had a
                    right to immediate possession of the MEGL shares on two separate grounds of
                    bailment and agency. On bailment, the Judge noted that the Plaintiffs pleaded
                    that the MEGL shares “were rightfully due” to them. On that
                    premise, he then characterised OAFL as a bailee and the Plaintiffs as bailors.
                    Because OAFL acted in a manner which was repugnant to the terms of the bailment
                    by selling the MEGL shares, the bailment was terminated and the Plaintiffs
                    acquired the immediate right to possession of the MEGL shares at the time of the
                    sale. On agency, the Judge held that the words “for and on behalf of the
                    [plaintiffs]” sufficed to create an agency relationship between OAFL and
                    the Plaintiffs. Consequently, OAFL had a duty to account to the Plaintiffs
                        <em>qua</em> agent and must hand over the MEGL shares
                    “on demand”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Mr Murugaiyan contended that the
                    Respondents did not have a right to immediate possession as there was neither a
                    bailment relationship nor an agency relationship between the Plaintiffs and
                    OAFL. On bailment, he argued that the Respondents must show that OAFL had
                    voluntarily possessed the MEGL shares which “belonged to” the
                    Respondents. This was not satisfied as the Respondents did not have a beneficial
                    interest in the MEGL shares at any time, as found by the Judge. The Respondents
                    also did not have a contract with OAFL which would place them in the position of
                    a bailor <em>vis-à-vis</em> OAFL. On agency,
                    Mr Murugaiyan submitted that there was no mutual consent between OAFL and
                    the Respondents to create an agency relationship. The first SPA and the fourth
                    Supplemental were entered into between the Plaintiffs and Antig. OAFL was not a
                    party to these agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Mr Gabriel did not advance any argument
                    that the Respondents had a beneficial interest in the MEGL shares. He instead
                    focused on the Respondents’ contractual right to the shares pursuant to
                    the Amended Clause 4.02(2). The nub of the Respondents’ case on
                    bailment is that under the Amended Clause 4.02(2), Antig is the bailor, the
                    Respondents are the owners and head bailors, and OAFL is the bailee. This
                    bailment relationship conferred on the Respondents the right of immediate
                    possession. The Respondents’ position on agency is somewhat unclear.
                    Mr Gabriel appears to have asserted, without more, that OAFL received the
                    OAFL Payments as agents of the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Bailment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    With respect, the Judge put the cart before
                    the horse in respect of this particular issue. He appears to have assumed that
                    there was a bailor-bailee relationship between the Respondents and OAFL, without
                    providing any reasons as to why and how this relationship arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The essence of bailment is possession and
                    the central theme of a standard bailment is the carving out, by the bailor, of a
                    lesser possessory interest than his own: Norman Palmer, <em>Palmer on Bailment</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>Palmer</em>”) at para 1-001.
                    While possession is the salient feature of bailment, the mere fact of possession
                    does not necessarily render the possessor a bailee. First, if the bailee enjoys
                    possession in conjunction with full rights of ownership, there can be no
                    bailment. Second, the possessor must knowingly and willingly assume possession
                    of goods that <em>belong</em> to the bailor: <em>Palmer</em> at para 1-002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The problem which the Respondents face is
                    showing that they had a better possessory right <em>vis-à-vis</em> OAFL. Indeed, the Respondents <em>never</em> had any interests – legal, equitable or possessory
                    – in the MEGL shares. The shares were issued in CDP’s name, and
                    allotted to OAFL’s nominee for OAFL’s account. It is hard to see how
                    the Respondents can assert a better possessory right. The Judge seems to have
                    relied on the Plaintiffs’ pleadings “that Aventi and OAFL had
                    received the MEGL shares which are <em>rightfully due to
                        them</em>” [emphasis added] (see the Judgment at [141]) as a
                    basis for his finding of a bailment relationship. The Judge had emphasised
                    earlier in the course of construing the Amended Clause 4.02(2) that the
                    entire US$18m purchase price was “ ‘due to’ the
                    [P]laintiffs” (see the Judgment at [96]). His view that the entire
                    purchase price was payable to the Plaintiffs may have grounded his subsequent
                    conclusion that the Plaintiffs had a superior possessory interest than OAFL.
                    However, as stated above (see [67]–[87] above), we disagree with the
                    Judge’s interpretation of the Amended Clause 4.02(2). Even if the
                    Judge’s interpretation of the phrase “for and on behalf of”
                    is accepted, it cannot be said that the Respondents had a possessory interest in
                    the MEGL shares. All the Respondents had was a contractual right to have Antig
                    make the OAFL Payments to OAFL. If, for instance, Antig did not make the OAFL
                    Payments to OAFL, a remedy of specific performance would only result in Antig
                    transferring the MEGL shares to OAFL, not to the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The Respondents’ next contention that
                    Antig was the bailor while the Respondents were the owners and head bailors is
                    illogical and can be summarily rejected. The MEGL shares were never owned by the
                    Respondents. Before they were issued, they could not have been owned by anyone,
                    including Antig. Antig’s direct issuance and allotment of the MEGL shares
                    to OAFL did not create a bailment relationship between Antig and OAFL as Antig
                    did not retain any possessory interest in the shares. It makes no sense to
                    construe Antig as a bailor of the MEGL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Last but not least, as far as OAFL was
                    concerned, it was coming into full and exclusive possession of the MEGL shares.
                    Quite apart from the fact that the Respondents never “owned” the
                    MEGL shares, there is no evidence which suggests that OAFL willingly assumed
                    possession of the MEGL shares which it knew “belonged” to the
                    Respondents. Thus, in light of the above, we are satisfied that there was no
                    bailment relationship between OAFL and the Respondents. Without an existing
                    bailment relationship, the Respondents could not have obtained a right of
                    immediate possession by the termination of a bailment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Agency</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The essence of an agency relationship was
                    correctly identified by the Judge (see the Judgment at [145]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person, the
                        principal, manifests assent to another person, the agent, that the agent
                        shall act on the principal’s behalf and be subject to the
                        principal’s control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise
                        consents so to act ... Thus, the two core elements of an agency relationship
                        appear to be <em>(a) consent of both the principal
                            </em><b><em>and </em></b><em>agent</em>; and (b) authority conferred or power granted to the
                        agent to legally bind the principal ... [emphasis added in italics and bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Clearly and self-evidently, the agent itself
                    needs to <em>consent</em> to being the agent. The essence
                    of consent between the principal and agent was captured succinctly by
                    Lord Pearson in <em>Garnac Grain Company Incorporated v H M
                        F Faure &amp; Fairclough Ltd and Others</em> [1968] AC 1130 at
                    1137:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The relationship of principal and agent can only be established <em>by the consent of the principal </em><b><em>and </em></b><em>agent</em>. They will be held
                        to have consented if they have agreed to what amounts in law to such a
                        relationship, even if they do not recognise it themselves and even if they
                        have professed to disclaim it ... . <em>But the consent must
                            have been given </em><b><em>by each of

                            from their words and conduct</em>. Primarily, one looks to what
                        they said and did at the time of the alleged creation of the agency. Earlier
                        words and conduct may afford evidence of a course of dealing in existence at
                        that time and may be taken into account more generally as historical
                        background. <em>Later words and conduct may have some
                            bearing, though likely to be less important</em>. [emphasis added

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Consent by the agent is indisputably
                    required to form an agency relationship. Even the Respondents’ own
                    authority, <em>Leo Vincent Pola &amp; others v Commonwealth Bank
                        of Australia and others</em> [1997] FCA 1476, adopted the same
                    position (at pp 12–13 of the unreported judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In general, no formality is necessary for the appointment of an agent to
                        act on behalf of his principal ... . It is only necessary that the principal

                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    The Judge justified his finding that OAFL
                    had consented to becoming an agent by reference to the phrase “for and on
                    behalf of the [Plaintiffs]” in the Amended Clause 4.02(2). With
                    respect, we are unable to agree. Even if the phrase can be strained to mean
                    consent, the basic fact is that OAFL was not even a party to the relevant
                    agreements. The first SPA and the fourth Supplemental were entered into between
                    the Plaintiffs and Antig. Any agency relationship between OAFL and the
                    Respondents must therefore be found outside of the relevant agreements. The
                    Respondents have not referred to any such evidence of an agency

                        undertakes to return the OAFL Payments to Tjong (“15 June 2006
                        Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_c"></a>(c)     Alwie’s purported admission during cross-examination that the
                        OAFL Payments were payable to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    First, Alwie’s averment in the fifth
                    and sixth Defendants’ Amended Defence is not unequivocal evidence that
                    OAFL had agreed to receive the MEGL shares as an <em>agent</em> of the Respondents. All it shows is that the full purchase
                    price of US$18m was to be paid by Antig to the Plaintiffs partly in cash and
                    partly in shares. This is in fact consistent with the interpretation that OAFL
                    is a third party beneficiary of part of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Second, even if the 15 June 2006 Letter
                    is authentic (which Alwie denies), it again does not support an inference that
                    OAFL had consented to acting as the Respondents’ agent. At the most, Alwie
                    had given an undertaking to return the OAFL Payments. The 15 June 2006
                    Letter provided:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>

                    genuine, the Respondents are certainly entitled to sue Alwie for breach of an
                    undertaking, as they have done against Chan in respect of the Guarantee.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Alwie’s answers must be examined in
                    context. First, the line of questions asked during the cross-examination related
                    to the same paragraph in the fifth and sixth Defendants’ Amended Defence
                    (see [151(a)] above). For the reason given above, the Respondents’
                    construction of that averment is not tenable. Be that as it may, while Alwie
                    appeared to have conceded that the <em>pleadings</em> did
                    not reveal any reason why OAFL was entitled to the OAFL Payments apart from the
                    fact that the first SPA provided for it, it is not evidence that OAFL acted as
                    the Respondents’ agent in receiving the OAFL Payments. There is a missing
                    link. Even if OAFL knew that it was not entitled to keep the OAFL Payments or
                    was obliged to account to the Respondents because it knew that the OAFL Payments
                    rightfully belonged to the Respondents (which OAFL denies anyway), this is
                    insufficient to establish an agency relationship. Something else is required to
                    show that OAFL had <em>agreed</em> to be an agent. Once
                    again, it is to be recalled that the phrase “for and on behalf” in
                    the Amended Clause 4.02(2) has no real legal effect <em>vis-à-vis</em> OAFL, a non-party to the first SPA. OAFL may be liable
                    in trust (which ground was dismissed and not appealed against) or other causes
                    of action, but that is not the basis upon which an agency relationship may be
                    implied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In the end, there is just no evidence that
                    OAFL had consented to receive the MEGL shares as agents for the Respondents.
                    Given that Alwie’s case has consistently been that OAFL was entitled to
                    receive the money as part of the overall scheme (see [73]–[87] above), we
                    are not surprised by the Respondents’ inability to produce evidence of
                    consent by OAFL, or even Alwie, to receive the MEGL shares as the
                    Respondents’ agents. The Respondents therefore do not have a claim in
                    conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis for CA 83</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Guarantee</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Burden and standard of proof for allegations of forgery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    In the course of oral arguments, there was
                    some uncertainty as to which party bore the burden of proving fabrication, and
                    to a larger extent, what the standard of proof required was. It is trite that
                    the legal burden to prove an allegation lies on the party asserting the
                    allegation. The true meaning of the rule is that where a given allegation forms
                    an essential part of a party’s case, the proof of the allegation rests on
                    him: Hodge M Malek, <em>Phipson on Evidence</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2010) at para 6-06. In the context of
                    forgery specifically, this court accepted in <em>Yogambikai
                        Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank and another appeal</em> [1996]
                    2 SLR(R) 774 (“<em>Yogambikai</em>”) at [39] that the burden of proof is on the party
                    alleging forgery of a particular document. In the present case, it is Chan who
                    has alleged that the Guarantee is a fabrication. The legal burden is therefore
                    on him to prove that allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The position on the standard of proof
                    required to establish fraud or forgery appears to be fraught with some
                    uncertainty: see Chen Siyuan, “The Power of the Court to Change an Order
                    for the Division of Matrimonial Asserts: <em>AYM v AYL</em>
                    [2012] SGCA 68”
                    <em>SLW Commentary</em>, Issue 1/Dec 2012 at p 5.
                    In <em>Yogambikai</em>, this court held (at [44]) that the
                    “burden of proof [is] more onerous than the ordinary civil standard where
                    what is alleged is as serious and grave as fraud or forgery”. However, in
                        <em>Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek
                        Benedict and others</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 (“<em>Tang Yoke Kheng</em>”), this court rejected (at [14])
                    that there is a third burden of proof apart from the civil burden of balance of
                    probabilities and the criminal burden of beyond reasonable doubt. It held that
                    even where fraud is alleged in a civil case, the civil standard of proof
                    applies, albeit where the allegation of fraud is serious, the party alleging the
                    fraud has to do more to establish his case. In the light of this uncertainty in
                    previous decisions of this court, it may be helpful to clarify the position on
                    the requisite standard of proof for allegations of fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The approach in <em>Tang Yoke
                        Kheng</em> is to be preferred to <em>Yogambikai</em>, even if the two decisions are not entirely
                    dissimilar. The standard of proof that applies in <em>all</em> civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities. There is
                    no third legal burden of proof that straddles the civil and criminal burdens. In
                    this regard, we draw attention to <em>Chua Kwee Chen and others
                        (as Westlake Eating House) and another v Koh Choon Chin</em> [2006]
                    3 SLR(R) 469, a High Court decision by Phang J (as he then was) in
                    which this issue <em>viz</em>, the standard of proof in
                    cases of fraud, was thoroughly examined. After a comprehensive survey of
                    judicial decisions from Singapore, England and Malaysia – including
                        <em>Tang Yoke Kheng</em> and <em>Yogambikai</em> – Phang J concluded (at [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, the standard of proof in civil proceedings where fraud and/or
                        dishonesty is alleged is the civil standard of proof on a balance of
                        probabilities. However, where such an allegation is made (as in the present
                        proceedings), <em>more</em> evidence is required than
                        would be the situation in an ordinary civil case. Such an inquiry lies,
                        therefore and in the final analysis, in the sphere of practical application
                        (rather than theoretical speculation). [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    We agree with Phang J’s analysis
                    and conclusion. There is little more to add except to quote the following
                    well-known observations of Lord Hoffmann in <em>Secretary of
                        State for the Home Department v Rehman (Consolidated Appeals)</em>
                    [2003] AC 153 where he stated (at [55]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The civil standard of proof <em>always means more likely
                            than not</em>. The only higher degree of probability required by
                        the law is the criminal standard. But, as Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead
                        explained in <em>In re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of
                            Proof)</em> [1996] AC 563, 586, some things are inherently more
                        likely than others. It would need more cogent evidence to satisfy one that
                        the creature seen walking in Regent’s Park was more likely than not to
                        have been a lioness than to be satisfied to the same standard of probability
                        that it was an Alsatian. <em>On this basis, cogent evidence
                            is generally required to satisfy a civil tribunal that a person has been
                            fraudulent or behaved in some other reprehensible manner.
                            </em><b><em>But the question is always whether the
                            tribunal thinks it more probable than not</em></b>. [emphasis added in
                        italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And in <em>In re B (Children) (HL(E))</em> [2009]
                    1 AC 11 where he stated (at [2]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a legal rule requires a fact to be proved (a “fact in
                        issue”), a judge or jury must decide whether or not it happened.
                            <em>There is no room for a finding that it might have
                            happened</em>. The law operates a binary system in which the only
                        values are zero and one. The fact either happened or it did not. If the
                        tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or
                        the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of
                        proof fails to discharge it, a value of zero is returned and the fact is
                        treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of one is
                        returned and the fact is treated as having happened. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    To summarise, the burden lies on the party
                    asserting fraud to prove on the balance of probabilities that the fraud has
                    taken place. Either there is fraud or there is not; there is no room for a
                    finding that it <em>might</em> have happened. Because of
                    the serious implications of fraud, cogent evidence is required before a court
                    will be satisfied that the allegation of fraud is established.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Guarantee is authentic or fabricated</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    With that in mind, we come to the key
                    question relating to the Guarantee Issue <em>viz</em>,
                    whether the Judge erred in rejecting the Superimposition Argument suggested by
                    Chan’s expert, Ms Novotny. Ms Novotny had concluded in
                    Novotny’s first Report that although Chan’s signature in the
                    Guarantee was probably genuine, there was evidence supportive of a proposition
                    that the Guarantee was not a genuine document, <em>ie</em>,
                    that the signature was superimposed with the text separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    The Judge rejected the Superimposition
                    Argument on many grounds. First, he found that the Superimposition Argument was
                    not specifically pleaded. It appears from the Judgment that the Judge had placed
                    considerable reliance on Chan’s testimony during cross-examination where
                    he appeared to have said that his case on the fabrication of the Guarantee was
                    that the signature was not his. Second, the Judge did not find the conclusion in
                    the Novotny’s first Report convincing, in part because Ms Novotny had
                    arrived at her conclusions without the benefit of inspecting the original copy
                    of the Guarantee. Third, the Judge also denied an application by Chan’s
                    counsel at trial to admit Novotny’s second Report. This supplementary
                    report, which Ms Novotny produced after inspecting the original Guarantee,
                    confirmed her findings in Novotny’s first Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    With respect, we disagree with the
                    Judge’s reasons for rejecting the Superimposition Argument. We will

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Superimposition argument not specifically pleaded</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    First, it bears mentioning that Chan had
                    pleaded in his Defence (Amendment No 3) that he “did not execute any
                    purported written guarantee and ... that the purported written guarantee is
                        fabricated”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Judge
                    interpreted “fabrication” as referring to a scenario where the
                    signature was not Chan’s as opposed to the Superimposition Argument. He
                    based this on Mr Gabriel’s cross-examination of Chan. We set out the
                    testimony relied on by the Judge (at [201] of the Judgment) in full:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    A series of questions later led to the
                    excerpt (at [165] above) relied upon by the Judge and the Respondents now to say
                    that the Superimposition Argument was not part of Chan’s case. The
                    transcript makes it clear that Chan had clarified at least twice that <em>at least one facet</em> of his fabrication defence was the
                    Superimposition Argument. The Judge therefore erred in relying on only part of
                    Chan’s testimony in concluding that the Superimposition Argument was not
                    part of Chan’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    We come back to the fundamental purpose of
                    pleadings. Pleadings are important in defining the issues and informing the
                    opponent in advance of the case he has to meet, so that he may take steps to
                    deal with the case, for example, by presenting the relevant law and evidence:
                        <em>Farrell (formerly McLaughlin) v Secretary of State for
                        Defence</em> [1980] 1 WLR 172 at 180; <em>Nirumalan K Pillay and others v A Balakrishnan and others</em> [1996]
                    2 SLR(R) 650. We note that shortly after the Plaintiffs adduced the
                    Guarantee in the proceedings in late June 2011, Chan responded promptly in early
                    July 2011 by way of an affidavit stating that although the Guarantee appears to
                    bear his signature, the authenticity of the signature is questionable. In the
                    same affidavit, he stated that his solicitors had requested to inspect the
                    original but the Plaintiffs had not produced it. Thus, from an early stage, the
                    Plaintiffs were put on notice that Chan disputed the authenticity of the
                    Guarantee, including its contents. The Plaintiffs knew the case he had to meet,
                    and met it head on. Indeed, it did not appear to us from Mr Gabriel’s
                    written and oral submissions at both the trial below and in the appeal that the
                    Respondents were caught out by the Superimposition Argument, or to the extent
                    that they had been, if at all, that they were unable to and did not take steps
                    to deal with the Superimposition Argument. The extensive cross-examination of
                    Ms Novotny and the substantive submissions on the Superimposition Argument
                    both at the trial below and in the appeal suggest to us that
                    Mr Gabriel’s argument on the insufficient particularity of pleadings
                    at this stage is purely technical. We therefore do not accept that the
                    Superimposition Argument cannot be considered because it was not specifically
                    pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Novotny’s first report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In our view, the Judge’s reason for
                    rejecting the conclusion in Novotny’s first Report is problematic. Before

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Ms Novotny found that the signature and
                    the text in the Guarantee were horizontally <em>and</em>
                    vertically misaligned, and that this was evidence of at least two separate
                    rounds of printing. She also found that the text after the signature was in
                    regular print while the documentary text was in bold print, and that such a
                    difference was unconventional. The grammatical mistakes in the wording of the
                    Guarantee are also glaring.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Notwithstanding the explanations given by
                    Ms Novotny, the Judge held that her observations on the misalignments were
                    not reliable because they were premised on a reproduced copy of the Guarantee.
                    It is unclear to us why the mere fact that the report was premised on a copy of
                    the Guarantee is sufficient to negative Ms Novotny’s explanations and
                    conclusions. The Judge was right to note that Ms Novotny admitted in the
                    report that the value of her evidence is “limited by the reproduction
                    nature of the disputed document” (see the Judgment at [202]), but he may
                    have placed undue emphasis on that qualification. That qualifier was part of a
                    longer sentence which, when read in its entirely, suggests that it was an
                    explanation by Ms Novotny for why she was precluded from conducting a
                    microscope examination to “determine with certainty” the finer
                    details of the structure and dynamic qualities of the signature and the nature
                    of the printed text on the original document.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Novotny’s second report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    The Judge’s reason for dismissing the
                    application to admit Novotny’s second Report was that the admission of the
                    report at that late stage in the middle of the trial would prejudice the
                    Plaintiffs as they had already closed their case by that time and would not have
                    time to consult their own experts on the points raised. We disagree. The
                    Plaintiffs’ case did not rest on any expert evidence; indeed they did not
                    present an expert of their own to contest Novotny’s first Report. Further,
                    Ms Novotny had not taken the stand yet at that time. Any questions which the
                    Plaintiffs’ counsel intended to ask her in relation to her first report
                    would have been equally applicable to the supplementary report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    The Respondents also contended that
                    Novotny’s second Report was not affirmed on affidavit as required by
                    O 40A r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“Rules of Court”). Referring to <em>Pacific
                        Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 491 (“<em>Pacific
                    Recreation</em>”), Mr Gabriel argued that Chan’s failure
                    to ensure that Novotny’s second Report complied with O 40A
                    requirements should result in the rejection of the report. First,
                    Mr Gabriel’s interpretation of <em>Pacific
                        Recreation</em> is misconceived. While the requirements in O 40A
                    are important, this court concluded (at [89]) that “[n]on-compliance with
                    these requirements <em>may</em> result in the
                    expert’s opinion being accorded <em>little or no
                        evidentiary weight</em> as well as in adverse cost consequences for
                    the party who engaged that expert” [emphasis added]. Non-compliance, at
                    best, goes to weight and does not automatically render the evidence
                    inadmissible. Second, O 2 r 1(2) makes it clear that the court may
                    make such order dealing with the proceedings generally “as it thinks
                    fit” notwithstanding an instance of non-compliance with the Rules of
                    Court. Lastly, the court also has inherent powers, as recognised under O 92
                    r 4, to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice,
                    notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Rules of Court. Thus, the breach
                    of the Rules of Court <em>per se</em> is not a bar to the
                    admissibility of Novotny’s second Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The Respondents then contended that the
                    issue of the admissibility of the Novotny’s second Report is <em>res judicata</em>. No notice of appeal was filed within the
                    one month time limit period against the Judge’s decision not to admit the
                    evidence. The short answer is that CA 83 is an appeal against the
                    Judge’s decision in Suit 89, including his decision at trial not to
                    admit Novotny’s second Report. In other words, the Court of Appeal now is
                    entitled to hold, as part of CA 83, that the Judge had erred in refusing to
                    admit Novotny’s second Report. It would in fact have been anomalous for
                    Chan to appeal, in the middle of trial, against the Judge’s decision not
                    to admit the evidence. Had he done so, the trial would have had to be stayed
                    pending the appeal. For all practical purposes, that was hardly an option open
                    to Chan. In any event, the court has the power under s 37(4) of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) to receive further
                    evidence in a Court of Appeal hearing on special grounds. The test for whether
                    there are special grounds for admitting further evidence is that established in
                    the famous and oft cited case of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                    [1954] 1 WLR 1489. On the facts, Novotny’s second Report has an
                    important – even decisive – influence on the case, and there is no
                    reason to doubt its credibility. It should therefore be admitted as part of the
                    evidential record for the purposes of these appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The significance of Novotny’s second
                    Report lies in its corroboration of Ms Novotny’s earlier report. Ms
                    Novotny not only confirmed her findings on the misalignment and irregular print,
                    she also strengthened her conclusions from “evidence supportive”
                    of fabrication to “<em>strong</em> evidence in
                    support” [emphasis added] of fabrication. Ms Novotny’s conclusions
                    in her two reports provide sufficient and compelling evidence <em>and</em> analysis to support her conclusion that the signature and
                    text had been superimposed. In contrast, the Respondents did not even call an
                    expert evidence to verify the authenticity of the Guarantee or to refute the
                    Superimposition Argument. In the circumstances, even if we were minded not to
                    admit Novotny’s second Report, Ms Novotny’s conclusions in her first
                    report remain uncontradicted. We would have overturned the Judge’s finding
                    on the Superimposition Argument on this ground alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Other circumstances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Leaving aside the technicalities relating to
                    physical properties of the Guarantee, we are unable to see any commercial logic
                    or reason which could have prompted Chan into signing the Guarantee. While Chan
                    held senior positions in both Antig and MEGL and we agree with Mr Ang that
                    directors do sometimes give personal guarantees in respect of a transaction
                    which their company is involved in, there must have been compelling
                    circumstances for Chan to give the Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In the first place, there is no reason for
                    Chan, an employee of Antig, to give a personal guarantee for a deal which he is
                    not a party to and, as far as the record is concerned, which he does not derive
                    any direct gain from. Second, Antig’s obligations under the Amended
                    Clause 4.02(2) are unambiguous: it is obliged to make total cash and share
                    payments of US$12m to Aventi and OAFL. As long as Antig fulfils its obligations
                    (which it had every reason to), and Aventi and OAFL do not pay the US$12m to
                    Tjong, Chan’s liability under the Guarantee would invariably arise. This
                    is so if the Guarantee is, as the Respondents’ contended, in the nature of
                    an indemnity. There is no indication that Chan is in control of Aventi and OAFL,
                    or has the power to compel them to pay monies received by them from Antig over
                    to Tjong. The directing minds and wills of Aventi and OAFL are Johanes and Alwie
                    respectively. That being the case, there is no discernible reason for Chan to
                    assume full liability of at least US$12m based on the actions or inactions of
                    two entities which he appears not to have any control over.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    We also note that Chan would also be liable
                    under the Guarantee if Antig did not fully pay up the US$6m due to Tjong under
                    the Amended Clause 4.02(2). If Tjong is right, Chan would have opened himself up
                    to the possibility of being <em>solely</em> liable to Tjong
                    for US$18m, despite not deriving any ostensible benefit from the transaction. We
                    find that hard to believe. By all accounts, including Tjong’s, Chan was
                    far more commercially savvy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Last but not least, Tjong’s evidence
                    was that the Guarantee was already signed when Tjong went to Chan’s office
                    to collect the Guarantee. However, that was on the same day that Tjong had
                    purportedly met Chan to ask for a personal guarantee. On Tjong’s own
                    evidence, it was Tjong and not Chan who broached the topic of the Guarantee. If
                    Chan signed the Guarantee <em>before</em> meeting Tjong, it
                    could only have been because he had foreseen in advance that Tjong wanted a
                    personal guarantee, and further, that he would not be able to persuade Tjong to
                    back down on his demand. These facts which we have to accept in order to find
                    for Tjong border on the unbelievable. Considering the surrounding circumstances
                    coupled with the technical analyses of Ms Novotny in the round, we are
                    convinced that the Guarantee was fabricated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Fabrication by whom</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Mr Gabriel argued in this appeal that
                    even if the Superimposition Argument is made out, it does not necessarily follow
                    that the Guarantee was fabricated in the sense of being “falsely”
                    created. He suggested that the Guarantee may have been created by Chan and given
                    to Tjong. We reject this argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    First, there is no gainsaying that, on the
                    face of the Guarantee, the formatting and appearance of the Guarantee purporting
                    to give Tjong US$18m is most unusual. The Respondents’ argument that Chan
                    performed the superimposition himself implies that Tjong had accepted the
                    Guarantee with all its oddities without raising his suspicions to Chan. He
                    neither questioned Chan about the odd appearance and formatting, <em>nor</em> sought legal advice as to the enforceability of the
                    Guarantee. Tjong was an experienced businessman. It is difficult to imagine how
                    he could have accepted such an irregularly written Guarantee, particularly at a
                    time where he admitted that he had started to lose faith in Chan’s
                    credibility. Second, as mentioned earlier (see [65] above), Tjong’s
                    evidence on why he could only produce the Guarantee after the trial dates for
                    Suit 89 were fixed and not earlier stretches the boundaries of credibility.
                    If the Guarantee was genuinely given to him by Chan, Tjong would have tried all
                    ways and means to produce it as early as possible. At the very least, one would
                    have expected him to have referred to it even if he could not retrieve the
                    original. That was not the case. For the reasons above, we are of the opinion
                    that it is more likely than not that Tjong fabricated the Guarantee by
                    superimposing the signature and the text. The Guarantee is therefore not
                    enforceable against Chan.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    At the outset, we pause to observe that the
                    particulars of the fraudulent misrepresentation claim were somewhat deficient.
                    Since Mr Ang has not taken issue with this, a brief mention of this matter
                    will suffice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Order 18 r 12 of the Rules of
                    Court expressly states that any claim of misrepresentation and fraudulent intent
                    must be supported with particular facts. In the case of misrepresentation, the
                    nature and extent of each alleged misrepresentation must be pleaded: <em>Newport (Mon.) Slipway Dry Dock and Engineering Company v
                        Paynter</em> (1886) 34 Ch D 88. Particulars showing, for example,
                    when, where, by whom and to whom the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation was

                    93.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    On the facts, the Plaintiffs’
                    particularisation of Chan’s alleged fraudulent misrepresentation comprised
                    largely of general averments that Chan had told Tjong that he would only receive
                    the Balance Purchase Price if he sold the Remaining Shares for US$2m to MEGL,
                    Antig or Chan’s group: Amended Statement of Claim at
                    paras 38–39. The Plaintiffs’ most extensive pleading can be
                    found in the Amended Statement of Claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">116.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[Chan] was
                            fully aware that there was the balance of the purchase price for the
                            sale of 72% of the shares in PT Deefu due to the Plaintiffs. [Chan]
                            ... represented to [Tjong] that if [Tjong] sold the Remaining Shares to
                            MEGL / Antig or his group, he would ensure that [Tjong] will
                            be paid the full balance of the purchase price of US$18 million for
                            the sale of 72% of the shares in PT Deefu. Induced by and acting in
                            reliance on the representation, [Tjong] entered into the two sale and
                            purchase agreements to sell the Remaining Shares. In fact the
                            representation was false in that:</span></p>

                                shares in PT Deefu; and/or</span></p>

                            act in reliance on it. [Tjong] did rely on the said misrepresentation

<p class="Judg-1">Immediately apparent is the absence of crucial particulars such as
                    when, where and how the Representation was made, and what Tjong’s response
                    was to the Representation. We would just say that had the point had been
                    pressed, the fraudulent misrepresentation claim might have failed at the
                    threshold stage for want of sufficient particularity of pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inducement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    On the merits of the fraudulent
                    misrepresentation claim, even if we are prepared to assume that the
                    Representation was made, and fraudulently so, by Chan, we disagree with the
                    Judge that Tjong was induced by the Representation. We first address the
                    argument by counsel over the requisite level of causality for inducement.
                    Mr Ang contended that in a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, the
                    misrepresentation must be an “effective cause” for the representee
                    to enter into the contract. In other words, but for the misrepresentation, the
                    representee would not have made the contract. Mr Ang relied on the English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Assicurazioni Generali SpA v Arab
                        Insurance Group (B.S.C.)</em> [2002] EWCA Civ 1642 (“<em>Assicurazioni</em>”) as well as <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> vol 1 (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2012) (“<em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em>”) at para 6-038 in support of this
                    submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    We do not accept that Mr Ang’s
                    submission reflects or ought to reflect the law in Singapore. The first problem
                    with his submission of the “but for” test is that inquiring what
                    the representee would or would not have done in the absence of the
                    representation misses the point entirely. The issue is not whether the
                    representee was induced by other factors; that is immaterial. As
                    Lord Millett cautioned in <em>BP Exploration Operating Co
                        Ltd v Chevron Shipping Co</em> [2003] 1 AC 197 (“<em>BP Exploration</em>”) at [104], a representee can
                    usually say why he acted as he did, but any answer he could give on what he
                    would have done if the representation had not been made is inevitably more
                    speculative. Therefore, the correct focus should not be on what would have
                    happened without the misrepresentation but on whether the misrepresentation
                    influenced the representee’s decision to enter into the
                contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Indeed, the law in Singapore has been quite
                    settled on this front. In <em>JEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks Bloom
                        &amp; Co (a firm)</em> [1983] 1 All ER 583 (“<em>JEB Fasteners</em>”), the English Court of Appeal held
                    (at 589):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[A]s long as a misrepresentation plays a real and
                            substantial part</em>, though not by itself a decisive part, in
                        inducing a plaintiff to act, <em>it is a cause of his loss
                            and he relies on it</em>, <b><em>no matter how strong

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    The above passage in <em>JEB
                        Fasteners</em> has been cited with approval by numerous courts in
                    Singapore, including this court in <em>Panatron Pte Ltd and
                        another v Lee Cheow Lee and another</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at
                    [23], and more recently, by Andrew Ang J in <em>Raiffeisen

                    [2007] 1 SLR(R) 196 at [55]–[56]. Simply put, the representation must
                    have a real and substantial effect on the representee’s mind such that it
                    can be said to be <em>an</em> inducing cause which led him
                    to act as he did; it need not be <em>the</em> inducing
                    case: <em>BP Exploration</em> at [105]; <em>Edgington v Fitzmaurice</em> (1885) 29 Ch D 459
                        (“<em>Edgington</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The test propounded in <em>Assicurazioni</em> was rejected by Prof John Cartwright in his
                    treatise, <em>Misrepresentation, Mistake and
                        Non-Disclosure</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2012)

                    in favour of the more traditional position described above (at
                    [186]–[187]). As others have suggested, there is indeed a strong policy
                    reason for adopting a standard which is easier for the representee to meet,
                    particularly in the case of fraudulent misrepresentations: see <em>Cartwright</em> at para 3-55. In <em>Ross
                        River Limited and another v Cambridge City Football Club Limited</em>
                    [2007] EWHC 2115 (Ch), Briggs J (as he then was) held (at [202]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In cases of fraudulent misrepresentation a more rigorous rule is applied,
                        sometimes described as being by way of deterrence: see Chitty (op. cit.) at
                        para 6-034. It is not enough for the representor to show that the
                        representee would, even if the representation had not been made, still have
                        entered the contract. It is sufficient for the representee to show that the
                        misrepresentation “was actively present to his mind” (per
                        Bowen LJ in <em>Edgington v Fitzmaurice</em>
                        (1885) 29 Ch. D 459 at 483).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above represents the well-established position in Singapore law
                    and we see no reason to disturb it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Applying this test for inducement to the
                    present facts, on the assumption that the Representation was made, we are unable
                    to agree with the Judge that the Representation was likely to have been
                        <em>an</em> inducing cause for Tjong to enter into the
                    second and third SPAs. In coming to his conclusion, the Judge took the position
                    that US$2m for the Remaining Shares was way below value, either by reference to
                    the US$18m purchase price of 72% of PT Deefu, or the AUD$12.64m which Jake
                    and Edwin obtained in reselling the Remaining Shares in 2008. The Judge then
                    inferred that Tjong agreed to sell the Remaining Shares below value precisely
                    because he was induced by the Representation which, if it had been carried out,
                    would have enabled him to recoup US$12m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    On the value of the Remaining Shares at the
                    time that they were sold under the second and third SPAs, we agree with
                    Mr Ang that it was incorrect to use either the subsequent resale or the
                    original purchase price as benchmarks. The subsequent resale was part of broader
                    transaction to spin off PT Batubara to MEGL’s subsidiary which would
                    then be listed in Australia via an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The value of
                    the IPO was estimated to be S$40m. In these circumstances, there would naturally
                    be a premium for the Remaining Shares. The US$18m purchase price under the first
                    SPA is also not a good indicator of the value of the Remaining Shares. The price
                    paid by Antig was for majority control of PT Deefu and by extension,
                    PT Batubara. The Remaining Shares, on the other hand, represented minority
                    shareholdings in both these companies. A discount must therefore be factored in.
                    While we can accept that US$2m is nevertheless on the lower end of the spectrum,
                    there is no objective evidence on the value of the Remaining Shares in July 2007
                    when they were sold under the second and third SPAs. The burden is on Tjong to
                    show that the Remaining Shares <em>could</em> have
                    commanded a higher price. Moreover, as Mr Ang rightly pointed out, there is
                    no evidence that Tjong was looking for and would have held out for a higher
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    The facts are simply too bare for us to be
                    satisfied that the alleged Representation induced Tjong to enter into the second
                    and third SPAs. Part of this is – as we have alluded to earlier –
                    due to the lack of particulars with which Tjong has pleaded his fraudulent
                    misrepresentation claim. His case essentially is that his entering into the
                    second and third SPAs is evidence of inducement; <em>res ipsa
                        loquitur</em>. That cannot be. Although the test for inducement only
                    requires the representee to show that the misrepresentation was <em>an</em> (and not <em>the</em>) inducing
                    cause, the representee still bears the burden of proving that the
                    misrepresentation was “actively present to his mind”: <em>Edgington</em> at 483.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Critically, we are none the wiser as to what
                    transpired <em>after</em> the Representation was
                    purportedly made and before the entering of the second and third SPAs.
                    Symptomatic of the defects in his pleadings, Tjong’s case on appeal was
                    shorn of any reference to evidence on the record which might suggest that the
                    Representation was “actively present to his mind”. Stating that
                    the Representation was made and pointing to the fact that the second and third
                    SPAs were entered into does not discharge this burden. It might discharge the
                    burden if it is so blatantly obvious that there could not have been any other
                    reason for Tjong to have entered into the second and third SPAs apart from the
                    Representation. That is not the case here. US$2m is not a decidedly low price
                    considering that the total cost price of PT Batubara was only US$1.2m.
                    Moreover, we note, parenthetically, that during cross-examination, Tjong
                    candidly admitted that if he did not sell the Remaining Shares, Chan might cause
                    more shares to be issued in PT Deefu thereby diluting the value of
                    Tjong’s remaining stake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In these circumstances, we are unable to
                    affirm the Judge’s decision that Tjong was induced by the Representation
                    (even if it was made).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    CA 82 is allowed in part as we rejected
                    Alwie’s appeal against the Judge’s findings on <em>locus standi</em> and piercing of the corporate veil. Similarly,
                    although we are persuaded by Mr Ang’s submissions canvassed in
                    respect of CA 83, the Notice of Appeal for CA 83 contained several
                    more grounds of appeal than were actually argued before us. In these
                    circumstances, we are minded to consider CA 83 as only allowed in part.
                    Accordingly, although Chan and Alwie shall be entitled to the costs below, they
                    are only entitled to 75% of the costs of the appeals. The usual consequential
                    orders are to follow.</p>
