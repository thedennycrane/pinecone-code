Its majority shareholder at all material times was (and continues to be) one Tay Chai Khiang Henry (“Henry”), who was (and continues to be) one of its directors.  The first defendant, Phang Cher Choon (“Phang”), was (and continues to be) a minority shareholder in Corporation.  Phang was also a director of Corporation up until 24 August 2018, when his employment was terminated. The second defendant, Bluestone Healthcare Sdn Bhd (“Healthcare”), is a company incorporated in Malaysia on 16 February 2004 and said to be in the business of dealing in all kinds of medical products.  As at mid-2018 just prior to the filing of the present suit, Phang held 99% of the shares in Healthcare, with the remaining 1% being held by the other director of Healthcare, the third defendant Lim Hooi Loo (“Hooi Loo”).  Hooi Loo was also employed by Corporation in its Malaysian branch office from 7 May 2003 until the latter terminated her employment on 24 August 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In the present suit, Corporation alleged various breaches of fiduciary duties owed by Phang as its director.  <span class="font-italic">Vis-à-vis</span> Hooi Loo, it was alleged that she had breached various terms of her contract of employment with Corporation.  The breaches by Phang and Hooi Loo were said to arise primarily from the incorporation of Healthcare in Malaysia in competition with Corporation and their alleged diversion of business or business opportunities from Corporation to Healthcare.  Phang, Hooi Loo and Healthcare were also alleged to have engaged in a “conspiracy to defraud” Corporation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The trial before me was <span class="font-italic">not</span> bifurcated as to issues of liability and damage.

Henry held 65% of the shares in Corporation while Phang held the remaining 35%.  The company was founded by both men; and Henry testified that they were its only two executive directors.  The company’s operations were split into two divisions – medical equipment and medical consumables.  Henry took charge of medical equipment and Phang took charge of medical consumables.  In November 2005, Henry’s parents (Tay Buan Say and Sg Wang Kim) were also appointed as directors of Corporation, although Henry claims that they were meant to be “non-executive” directors

Henry claimed that selling the machines in Malaysia would have required Corporation to expand its Malaysian operations by setting up a Sendirian Berhad (“Sdn Bhd”, the Malaysian equivalent of a private limited company); and that when Phang showed a lack of interest in doing so, he had “informed [Phang he] would go ahead to sell Sonosite machines in Malaysia” but that Phang had not responded.  Henry then proceeded to set up a Malaysian-registered company called Absolmed Sdn Bhd (“Absolmed”), which dealt with the distributorship of Sonosite until it closed sometime in 2016 or 2017.  It was not disputed that Absolmed was for all intents and purposes Henry’s own company, although he did not hold the shares in his name, nor did he have himself appointed as director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 As will be seen later, Phang denied that he was informed by Henry about his intention to set up Absolmed to sell Sonosite machines in Malaysia

This was despite the fact that Henry cited sales revenue figures for products from several of these other companies: for example, he claimed that Healthcare had “managed to achieve sales of RM17,077.55” for WaterJel R1R2 products from Novatech (citing as his source Healthcare’s Branding Sale Report for the period from January 2018 to July 2018)

In his AEIC, Henry postulated that it was “likely” Healthcare had operated from this office address “from either 2004 or 2007, until on or around 2010/2011”, because Healthcare’s financial statements “made no reference to rentals paid until year 2010”

Henry told Phang that if he wanted to explore the Malaysian market, then he should go ahead and incorporate a Malaysian company to do so, especially since he was a Malaysian.  Phang thought that in view of his Malaysian citizenship and his experience with sales in Malaysia, it would be a good idea for him to do so, in case a business opportunity should present itself

Moreover, at the back of his mind, he thought that if Henry changed his mind in the future, they could just “absorb Healthcare into [Corporation] as one of its subsidiaries or Henry could purchase the shares in Healthcare”

Indeed, according to Phang, it was Henry who had suggested that he give a presentation on Healthcare’s success in selling Dentium products in Malaysia, so as “to motivate [Corporation’s] staff to achieve the same level of success as Healthcare”

Henry had, after all, been aware of his incorporating Healthcare so as to venture into the Malaysian market.  Henry himself had set up Absolmed in 2013 to sell Sonosite machines in Malaysia; Phang’s evidence was that he was not in fact informed about Absolmed and only found out about it in 2015, but he did not enquire further as he viewed Henry’s setting up of Absolmed as being consonant with their common understanding that they could each explore the Malaysian market on their own.

There was, in short, no attempt by her or by Phang to conceal the existence of Healthcare and the business it was carrying on in Malaysia.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Indeed, Hooi Loo’s evidence was that it would not have been possible to conceal the existence of Healthcare and its business in Malaysia, in light of the regular and extensively documented trading activities between Healthcare and Corporation from 2009 to 2018.  Hooi Loo corroborated Phang’s evidence that the two companies had regularly purchased products from each other whenever they were running low on stocks.  The documentation kept of these trades included e-mails, invoices and purchase orders, which made clear the existence of Healthcare as a separate entity in Malaysia and the fact that it sold products which were decidedly not the Kimberly-Clark products handled by the Malaysian branch office

He was accompanied by two other persons, one of whom claimed to be a lawyer, and he told her he was there to serve her a writ of summons before handing her the document.  He told her that her employment had been terminated by Corporation because she had set up Healthcare “illegally” together with Phang.  He also threatened to confiscate her mobile phone and computer, although in the end it was not done as she insisted that these items were her personal property.  At the same time, David kept pressurising her to meet with Henry, emphasising that it was her “last chance”.  Feeling shocked and intimidated, she agreed to meet Henry that afternoon at Subang Airport.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 When Hooi Loo arrived at the airport, she was confronted by Henry in an extremely aggressive manner.

For that reason, the no-profit rule and rule against self-dealing have been described as particular instances of the broader duty of a director not to place himself in a position of conflict (see <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law </span>at para 8.45).  In turn, there is overlap between the no-conflict rule and a director’s duty to act in the best interests of the company, “for when a director makes his interests paramount, invariably he will not be acting in the best interests of his company” (<span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law </span>at para 8.39).   <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Phang’s conduct in setting up and operating Healthcare</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In respect of Corporation’s claim against Phang for breach of his fiduciary duties, the key complaints – as pleaded – were that he had set up Healthcare and caused it to operate a business that competed with Corporation’s business, and that he had used Hooi Loo’s services as a director of Healthcare while she was employed by Corporation.  He was alleged to have put himself in a position of conflict by doing so, and also to have made secret profits from Healthcare’s business.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I did not find Corporation’s allegations to be made out.

Phang, on the other hand, asserted that both men had discussed the possibility of Corporation setting up its own Sdn Bhd in Malaysia, but that Henry had not been keen, and had told Phang to go ahead on his own if he wished.

With Absolmed, Henry was proposing to distribute in Malaysia machines that Corporation itself already distributed in Singapore.  In fact, according to Henry, the Sonosite machines distributed by Corporation in Singapore had enjoyed “consistently good sales performance” – a fact which Phang could hardly have been ignorant of, given Henry’s insistence that Phang was primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of Corporation’s accounts

It was not inconceivable that given the modest sales performance in Malaysia, Henry should have been unenthusiastic about the prospect of venturing jointly into the Malaysian market with Phang as the controlling shareholder.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Phang’s openness about Healthcare post-2004</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Tellingly, the parties’ conduct subsequent to 2004 pointed unequivocally to the existence of an understanding or arrangement between these two shareholders of Corporation to allow Phang to explore the Malaysian market by setting up his own company.  Firstly, it could not be disputed that Phang was completely open about the existence of Healthcare, the nature of its business, and the fact that it was his own company.  For example, according to Phang and Hooi Loo, they had both openly talked about Healthcare’s sales performance on numerous occasions when Henry and assorted Corporation personnel were present.  Although Phang could not recall if he had specifically mentioned Healthcare’s name during the presentation given at Corporation’s tenth anniversary celebration, he was certain that the references to the successful sales of Dentium products would have alerted those present that he was talking about a separate entity from Corporation (which had then just started to distribute Dentium products) and its Malaysian branch office (which did not distribute Dentium products).  According to Phang and Hooi Loo, they would also have spoken freely about Healthcare’s sales performance and experience during the sales meetings held for Corporation staff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In this connection, I noted that Corporation made much of the fact that during the sale of Medisol to RadLink in 2017, Henry had disclosed his interest in Absolmed whereas Phang had not disclosed his interest in Healthcare.  The insinuation which Corporation appeared to be making was that Phang had deceitfully concealed his interest in Healthcare even when faced with disclosure requirements during the Medisol sale process.  I did not think this was an accurate representation of the parties’ conduct.

This could be seen from the statements made by Henry and Phua in the disclosure made of their interests in Absolmed as well as in Corporation and another company named Web-economy Technology Pte Ltd.

The documentary records shown to him during his cross-examination by Phang’s counsel also showed that he had extensive interaction with Healthcare staff over the inter-company trades.  I did not think it likely that he would have been so confused as to think that Healthcare was the same entity as the Malaysian branch office, and/or that Healthcare staff such as Diana and Karen were really Corporation employees.  Furthermore, as at the date of the trial, Walter was still employed by Corporation: he had nothing to gain – and potentially much to lose – by disavowing or qualifying his previous affidavit and by corroborating Phang’s narrative.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Yok Fong’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Corporation’s bookkeeper Yok Fong confirmed Walter’s testimony that Healthcare’s details had been maintained on a computer system used by Corporation (known as the “MYOB system”).

This was evidentially significant because Henry’s version of events was that he and Phang had never discussed – much less agreed on – the latter incorporating his own Sdn Bhd to explore the Malaysian market.  In line with this version of events, Henry claimed that Phang kept him in the dark about the incorporation of Healthcare and/or Phang’s and Hooi Loo’s involvement in Healthcare until Henry made the shocking discovery for himself “on or after 2.2.2018”

If there had been no Agreement as Henry asserted in his defence, it would have been obvious to Phang that the act of incorporating his own Sdn Bhd to explore the Malaysian medical and healthcare market would be seen by Corporation as a hostile act – in fact, an act of competition; and if that were the case, Phang could not have afforded to let anyone in Corporation know about his incorporation of Healthcare or the type of business it was doing.  Put another way, if Phang had really been trying to use Healthcare to divert business away from the Malaysian branch office on the sly, then it made no sense for him to risk anyone in Corporation finding out.  Even if he had not said anything to Henry himself, he could hardly have sworn every Corporation staff to secrecy.  It was easily foreseeable, after all, that the use of the word “Bluestone” in Healthcare’s name and the nature of the products it dealt in would at some point have elicited curiosity about Healthcare from some of the Corporation staff.  Indeed, as seen in Jasmine’s case for example, not only did she question Phang about Healthcare more than once, she also approached Henry about Healthcare, and on one occasion, even “asked Henry to ask Phang about Bluestone Healthcare” in her presence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 This brings me to the issue of Henry’s own conduct.

If there had been no such understanding (or as Phang called it, “the Agreement”), it was unbelievable that Henry would have reacted to information about the existence of a Malaysian company called “<span class="font-italic">Bluestone</span> Healthcare Sdn Bhd” with such bland equanimity – especially when he recognised that it was in the same medical/healthcare business as Corporation and its Malaysian branch office.  I would add that although Phang did not recall having said “you don’t need to know” when Henry brought Healthcare up in Jasmine’s presence, if he had in fact made such an apparently offhand answer, then Henry’s undisputed passivity and inaction following such answer provided further proof of the existence of the Agreement.

</div>.  I found it unbelievable that in reviewing and signing off on these audited accounts, he would have failed to notice the inclusion of “Bluestone Healthcare Sdn Bhd” as a related party.  In cross-examination, Henry’s attempts to deny awareness of the mention of Healthcare in the accounts became so desperate as to amount to obvious lies.

Moreover, despite Henry’s claims about having had nothing to do with consumables in Corporation, it was apparent from the monthly financial statements sent to him that his interest in matters such as trade receivables extended to the consumables division.  Lynnette – who was a consumables sales staff – also gave evidence that in 2013/2014, Henry had spoken to her fortnightly “about late or outstanding payments from customers”, and it was clear to her Henry was “familiar with, or at least aware of, the sales, accounts and customers of the medical consumables division of [Corporation]”

</div>
</div>.  In the circumstances, I found it incredible that despite having received and read these monthly financial statements over the course of at least a decade, Henry should have managed not to notice Healthcare’s name in that entire period.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In my view, the evidence of his own witnesses and documentary records demonstrated that by 2006 at the very least, Henry was fully aware of Healthcare, its business, and Phang’s role in it.  The misleading statement in his amended reply and defence to Phang’s defence and counterclaim that he was “unaware of [Healthcare’s] incorporation and/or its existence and trade until on or around 2.2.2018”, as well as the vague and evasive manner in which he alluded in his AEIC to his knowledge of Healthcare, indicated that he was conscious of the damage that would result to his case from evidence of such knowledge.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Based on his own evidence, Henry took no steps either to investigate or to object to Healthcare’s activities and Phang’s involvement in those activities, until January 2018.  As an aside, I should state that I disbelieved Henry’s claim that he had habitually tried to avoid conflict with Phang because of Phang’s “forceful” personality.  Henry’s own conduct – for example, in ordering the removal of Corporation’s cheque books from Phang’s possession after being angered by the latter’s approval of bonus payments – demonstrated that he was well able to make his objections to Phang’s behavior known.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Given my finding above on the state of his knowledge, Henry’s prolonged inaction formed another important piece of evidence which supported Phang’s assertion about the existence of the Agreement.  In coming to this conclusion, I found it helpful to refer to the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Chin Siew Seng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([112] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).  In that case, the appellant (“Chin”) was a director and minority shareholder of the company Seaspan Agencies.  The respondent (“Quah”) was also a director as well as the majority shareholder.  On 11 October 2005, Chin told Quah that he was resigning as a director of Seaspan Agencies and incorporating a new company to carry on the ship-brokering business which he had been in charge of managing in Seaspan Agencies.  On 13 October 2005, Chin incorporated a new company, which he named Seaspan Singapore and in which he and one Joanne Ho (“Ho”, his fellow director from Seaspan Agencies) were the directors.  However, Chin and Ho remained as directors of Seaspan Agencies. They officially tendered their written resignations as directors of Seaspan Agencies on 9 February 2006.  Seaspan Agencies subsequently sued Chin for (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) breach of his duties as a director of Seaspan Agencies by allegedly diverting to Seaspan Singapore the ship-brokering commissions earned in respect of contracts entered into by Seaspan Agencies or Seaspan Singapore for the period when Chin was a director of Seaspan Agencies.  At first instance, the trial judge rejected Chin’s assertion that Seaspan Singapore was entitled to the commissions on the basis of an express agreement between him and Quah.  On appeal, the CA reversed the trial judge’s finding and held that “the documentary evidence and subsequent conduct of the parties (Quah’s, in particular) … points unequivocally to some kind of arrangement or settlement between the then shareholders of Seaspan Agencies to sever the ship-brokering … businesses sometime in October 2005, freeing Chin to start his own business and permitting Ho to join Chin” (at [26]).  <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, the CA found it significant (at [27]) that “… during the entire four-month period Chin was carrying on business under Seaspan Singapore while still a director of Seaspan Agencies, Quah appears not to have protested about this despite being aware that Chin was conducting business under Seaspan Singapore and that there was no longer any ship-brokering business coming into Seaspan Agencies after 13 October 2005”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The CA also pointed out that the “undisputed subsequent conduct of the parties” – in particular, the distribution of the cash surplus of Seaspan Agencies – was “entirely consistent with the existence of an agreement that the businesses would be split in October 2005 and that Chin was free to pursue his own ship-brokering business” (at [28]).  In the premises, the CA held that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… all the directors and shareholders of Seaspan Agencies knew and consented to Seaspan Singapore’s receipt of ship-brokering commissions for the period between 11 October 2005 and 9 February 2006.  Chin and Ho were not, in the prevailing circumstances, in breach of their duties to Seaspan Agencies with respect to the claim for the diversion of ship-brokering commissions and business opportunities during that period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and another </span>[2020] SGCA 103 (“<span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span>”), the appellant company was a joint venture between the first respondent (“Mr Toh”) and one Keng Yew Huat (“Mr Keng”).  After setting up the appellant company together with Mr Keng, Mr Toh first set up a sole proprietorship called Economics at Tuitiongenius (“ETG”), which he subsequently replaced by incorporating a company called Economics at Tuitiongenius Pte Ltd (“ETGPL”).  Both the appellant and ETGPL were in the business of providing private tuition services.  The appellant sued Mr Toh, alleging that Mr Toh had breached (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) his fiduciary duties as its director in conducting a competing private tuition business through ETG and later ETGPL (“the ETG Entities”).  The trial judge rejected the appellant’s claims and found that there was no breach of any fiduciary duties by Mr Toh because the parties had a subsequent oral agreement (“the Oral Agreement”) that Mr Toh could continue to run his own private tuition business through the ETG Entities  – and to retain the revenue thus generated (at [15]).  On appeal, the CA upheld the trial judge’s findings.  As the CA noted in its judgment (at [60]), the appellant’s case rested on the proposition that Mr Keng had been unaware of the use of the ETG Entities by Mr Toh to run his own private tuition business, but the trial judge had found that Mr Keng in fact knew about the ETG Entities: Mr Toh was transparent about setting them up, and the trial judge further accepted Mr Toh’s evidence that Mr Keng had encouraged him to set up these entities (at [27]).  The CA affirmed these findings, stating (at [60]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Given the agreement between Mr Keng and Mr Toh, who were the promoters of the appellant, as to the basis on which the appellant’s and Mr Toh’s respective businesses would co-exist under the Oral Agreements, there cannot be any question of Mr Toh acting in breach of his fiduciary duties in running his private tuition business through the ETG Entities.  In doing this, he was acting in line with what had been agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I found these two cases to be helpful as they illustrated the operation of the principle that a fiduciary such as a director “cannot act for his own benefit without the <span class="font-italic">informed consent</span> of his principal” [emphasis in original] (at [60] of <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span>).  In <span class="font-italic">Chin Siew Seng</span>, the directors and shareholders of Seaspan Agencies were found to have known and consented to Seaspan Singapore’s receipt of all ship-brokering commissions during the four-month period from October 2005 to February 2006.  In <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span>, Mr Keng and Mr Toh – who were the directors and equal shareholders of the appellant – were found to have made an oral agreement for the latter to continue running his own private tuition business through the ETG Entities.  As the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v </span><span class="font-italic">Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd)</span> [2014] 3 SLR 329 (“<span class="font-italic">Scintronix</span>”, at [52] and [59]), either the “informal assent of all the directors of a company” or the “unanimous, or at the very least majority agreement of the shareholders” [emphasis in original omitted] would suffice to release a director from his obligations to the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Applying these general principles to the present case, I found that as at 2004, Henry and Phang had – as the shareholders and directors of Corporation – agreed to Phang setting up his own company to tap on the Malaysian market.  In the result, Phang was <span class="font-italic">not</span> in breach of his duties to Corporation with respect to the claims for setting up a competing business and for diversion of business or business opportunities to Healthcare. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Phang breached his fiduciary duties to Corporation in having Healthcare take over the distributorship of Halyard feeding tubes in July 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In respect of Corporation’s claims against Phang for diversion of business or business opportunities to Healthcare, I should address separately the allegations concerning the transfer from Corporation to Healthcare of the distributorship rights for Halyard (formerly Kimberly-Clark) feeding tubes, since Henry’s AEIC dealt with these allegations in some detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In my view, the Agreement between Henry and Phang would cover the transfer of the distributorship for Halyard feeding tubes from Corporation to Healthcare.  It must be remembered that the Agreement came about after Phang sought unsuccessfully to persuade Henry that they should join forces to set up a Sdn Bhd in Malaysia so as to exploit the Malaysian market more effectively

</div>.  After Kimberly-Clark (the predecessor to Halyard) decided to terminate Corporation’s distributorship rights to its respiratory products in Malaysia in late 2005, Henry must have been aware that retaining the Malaysian branch office instead of setting up a Sdn Bhd carried the risk of Corporation losing distributorship rights to other product lines.  Nevertheless, for his own reasons, he was unwilling to have Corporation set up a Sdn Bhd in which Phang would be the controlling shareholder.  It was against this backdrop that the Agreement between the two men came about.  As I have also noted, it was interesting that shortly after Phang’s incorporation of Healthcare in 2004, Henry apparently consolidated his control over the Corporation board by getting his parents appointed to the board.  In the premises, I found that the risk of the Malaysian branch office losing other distributorships – and the possibility of these distributorships going to Healthcare – were matters within the contemplation of both men at the time of the Agreement.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In this connection, it was pertinent to note that while Phang agreed that their deteriorating relationship in 2017 meant that he did not talk to Henry about Halyard’s plans to transfer the distributorship, he (Phang) took no steps to conceal the transfer of the Halyard distributorship from Corporation’s personnel.  Even Walter, who was a customer service coordinator and not a sales staff, was aware that by 2017 Healthcare was distributing Halyard’s feeding tubes

</div>.  Again, this lack of concealment on Phang’s part was consistent with his case about the existence of the Agreement and his consequent belief that he had nothing to hide in relation to Healthcare’s business activities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 However, even assuming for the sake of argument that Corporation could establish Phang had placed himself in a position of conflict of interests, Corporation’s case could not stop there.

</div>, Henry in his AEIC appeared to vacillate between quantifying Corporation’s loss of Halyard business in terms of Healthcare’s projected total revenue from Halyard sales “over the next six (6) years” and in terms of the fall in the sales revenue of the Malaysian branch office.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Secondly, there was no coherent explanation provided by Henry or anybody else as to the proposed six-year period for computing Corporation’s losses.

For one, as I have noted, there was no coherent explanation as to why the losses should be computed over a six-year period.  More importantly, Henry relied on gross revenue figures which – as he admitted in cross-examination – did not take into account the cost of sales and other overhead expenses that would have had to be incurred to earn the revenue.  Indeed, as he admitted in cross-examination, this method of computation was “[i]n hindsight … not a fair claim”

In this connection, there appeared to be the suggestion at some points that Henry would never have knowingly consented to Hooi Loo being involved in Healthcare – Phang’s company – when Corporation was paying her salary.  In my view, such a suggestion disregarded the fact that up until the point when their relationship started seriously to deteriorate around 2016 or so, Henry and Phang appeared to have adopted a fairly relaxed attitude of <span class="font-italic">laissez-faire</span> towards each other.  Thus, for example, Henry was able to get his parents appointed to the Corporation board in 2005, without any objections from Phang

Indeed, it was interesting that the appointment of Henry’s parents as Corporation directors – and the control this gave Henry over the board – came about not long after he and Phang had in 2004 agreed to Phang exploring the Malaysian market with his own Sdn Bhd.  As another example, whilst Henry and Phang disagreed over whether Henry had expressly sought Phang’s consent prior to setting up Absolmed, it was clear that both on Henry’s telling and on Phang’s, Henry’s actions in setting up his own corporate vehicle in Malaysia to launch the Sonosite machines met with no resistance from Phang.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In other words, there appeared to have been a degree of informal give-and-take between the two men, at least up until 2016.  I did not find it inconceivable or anomalous, therefore, that Henry could have assented to Hooi Loo’s involvement in Healthcare after becoming aware of it in 2009 at the very latest.  Given that Henry and Phang were the only shareholders of Corporation at the material time, it followed from Henry’s assent that Phang’s conduct in asking Hooi Loo to join Healthcare was validly ratified or authorised by all the shareholders of Corporation.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Phang breached his fiduciary duties to Corporation in making use of its Malaysian office premises</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In its amended statement of claim, although it was pleaded that Healthcare had used the office premises of Corporation’s Malaysian branch office without the latter’s consent

Unfortunately, there appeared to be considerable confusion on Corporation’s part as to the facts it was seeking to establish.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 In his AEIC, Phang had stated that while Healthcare shared “the same office address” as Corporation, there were “2 rooms at the address and the room used by the Branch Office was paid for by [Corporation] while the room used by Healthcare was paid for by Healthcare”

However, the earliest tenancy agreement which Healthcare produced at trial in respect of its own office unit was an agreement dated 18 December 2011 for a tenancy starting on 1 January 2012.  This tenancy related to suite 12 in Weini Business Centre where Corporation also rented a unit.  Based on the documentation produced at trial, Phang agreed that Healthcare must only have started renting its own room in Weini Business Centre from 1 January 2012

In addition, there was documentary evidence available which showed that from 1 April 2010, Healthcare had rented storage premises at another building known as 11/2 Terrace Factory, paying first RM600 a month up until March 2013 and then RM1,100 a month after March 2013

The rental of the storage unit at 11/2 Terrace Factory on 1 April 2010 appeared to have come about after Healthcare took on a series of distributorships involving products such as chemicals and tubings, starting with Coeur CT scan tubings in January 2010 and continuing with the addition of Syntech chemicals in March 2010

</div>. No evidence was adduced as to what other staff (if any) Healthcare employed prior to Karen joining the company and/or when the other staff (if any) joined Healthcare.  I should add that Corporation did not dispute it had access to all the information on Phang’s laptop and mobile phone, which it seized from him on 24 August 2018: as such, I would have expected Corporation to produce clear evidence of Healthcare’s rent-free use of its Malaysian office premises – for example, as storage premises – if it had such evidence.

Even more regrettably, there was nothing in Henry’s AEIC to explain how such loss or damage should be quantified.  Nor was there any testimony adduced from Corporation’s witnesses on how such loss or damage should be quantified.  In his AEIC, Henry made the brief statement that “the expenses incurred by [Healthcare] and [Hooi Loo], in the operations of [Healthcare’s] office premises in Kuala Lumpur <span class="font-italic">from 2004 to 2010/2011 </span>were passed on to [Corporation] to bear, in circumstances, where [Corporation] had no interests in [Healthcare]”

</div>.  On the basis of this one-liner, it would not have been appropriate to quantify the purported loss or damage as being the entire sum of rental paid by Corporation for the said unit between 2007 and 2011, because the Malaysian branch office <span class="font-italic">did</span> occupy and use the said unit throughout that period.  Nor would it have been appropriate to attempt some sort of apportionment of the rental paid by Corporation during the said period: not only was there a total absence of any evidence which might have supported such an exercise, this was not even something suggested by Henry or any of Corporation’s other witnesses.  In short, there was no evidence led by Corporation to prove the quantum of loss or damage resulting to it from Healthcare’s rent-free use of its Malaysian office unit.  Even assuming liability to be established on Phang’s part, Corporation failed to prove the loss or damage purportedly resulting to it (see, in this connection, <span class="font-italic">Griffin Travel</span> ([166] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [418(a)]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Next, it was suggested that Phang arranged for the Malaysian branch office to move to a larger room in the same building on 18 June 2009 even though by then, the branch office had lost the distributorship rights to Kimberly-Clark’s respiratory products: and it was further suggested that he did so in order to enable Healthcare to use this larger room as its “own stock room”

No evidence at all was adduced to demonstrate that the rental paid by Corporation played any part in rental negotiations for Healthcare’s own unit.  Furthermore, from at least 1 January 2012 onwards, Healthcare had started paying RM500 for its own room at the Weini Business Centre, <span class="font-italic">on top of</span> the RM600 (later RM1,100) it was paying for storage premises at 11/2 Terrace Factory.

Phang’s evidence was that he set up Prius as a side project together with Lynnette to test the market in travel-sized hand sanitisers.

There was no evidence adduced by Corporation to show that it sold such creams – or other similar creams.  This was relevant because Henry’s own evidence as to the “ground rules” agreed between him and Phang from the outset was that they were only required to disclose and to offer to each other “business opportunities in the medical and healthcare industry” but that they were otherwise free to pursue independently their own interests in businesses not related to the medical and healthcare industry.  It being Corporation’s case that Phang breached his fiduciary duties by setting up Primuz without disclosing it to the board, Corporation bore the burden of proving that Primuz’s business fell outside of the “ground rules” agreed between Henry and Phang.

In respect of the first two products, all that was established at trial was that Phang’s wife, Susan Chia, had contacted the suppliers to express interest on Primuz’s behalf in distributing these products.  As for the Nanoom AED product, there was an exchange of messages between Phang and Ming Hok about transferring the distributorship rights from Corporation to Primuz.  Importantly, though, Primuz never acquired the distributorship rights for the Alliqua and GloTech products; and the distributorship rights for the Nanoom AED product were never transferred to Primuz.  As such, even assuming for the sake of argument Phang had breached his fiduciary duty to Corporation by setting up Primuz and using it to explore distribution opportunities, no loss or damage was suffered by Corporation as a result.  In cross-examination, Henry was obliged to concede that he had no evidence of any loss suffered by Corporation in relation to these products

That this was the impression <span class="font-italic">intended</span> was apparent from the fact that the reference to the registrations was followed immediately by statements about Primuz competing “in the same market as [Corporation]” – and about how it was “unfair and unacceptable” for Phang to set up Primuz and to divert “suppliers and business” to Primuz whilst still a director of Corporation.  This was disingenuous and misleading, because the HSA documentation (eventually produced by Phang at trial) showed that the registration of the CAIR LGL products was done on 29 January 2019

</div> that a mark-up of 10% to 15% was applied “both ways” in the course of this inter-company trade: just as Healthcare charged such a mark-up to cover freight and other administrative costs when selling products to Corporation, Corporation too would charge a similar mark-up when it sold products to Healthcare.  Walter testified that conversely, in sales by Corporation to other customers, it would apply a much higher mark-up of 50% to 55%.  Water’s evidence in this respect was also not refuted.  In fact, it should be pointed out that in cross-examination, Henry admitted – after much prevarication – that he had “probably” heard from Walter about Corporation charging a mark-up on sales to Healthcare (although he insisted he could not remember whether the mark-up was 15% or not)

This was because Healthcare only acquired the Halyard distributorship in July 2017, whereas the writ in this action was filed on 8 August 2018.  Primuz was incorporated on 9 February 2017

The CA further noted that the six-year time bar would be lifted pursuant to s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in the case of fraud or a fraudulent breach of trust (at [53]).  In <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>, it held that the time bar was lifted pursuant to s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), because there had been fraudulent breaches of trust by the respondent directors who had fallen short of the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people in dealing with the appellant company’s property (at [55]–[57]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Although Phang did not specifically mention s 6(7) in his amended defence (which cited s 6(1)), I did not think this precluded me from considering the applicability of s 6(7), because in its amended reply, Corporation pleaded reliance on s 22 and/or s 29 of the Limitation Act

The CA explained the distinction between Class 1 and Class 2 constructive trustees as follows (at [46] and [47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 … If a person holds property in the position of a trustee (and there is no doubt that a director is regarded as a trustee over the company’s property …) and deals with that property in breach of that trust, he will be a Class 1 constructive trustee; whereas a wrongdoer who fraudulently acquires property over which he had never previously been impressed with any trust obligations, may, by virtue of his fraudulent conduct, be held liable in equity to account as if he were a constructive trustee.  But the latter is not a case of someone who had ever in reality been a trustee of that property; and it is only by virtue of equity’s reach that such a person is regarded as a Class 2 constructive trustee.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 That this is the essence of the distinction can be seen by comparing two English cases.  In <span class="font-italic">J</span><span class="font-italic"> J Harrison </span>… the claimant was a company, of which the defendant was a director.  A property owned by the company was valued at £8m, but in a side letter the valuer said that it may have some development potential that had not been taken into account in the valuation.  The side letter was not disclosed to the company, but the director was aware of it.  A year later, he bought the property from the company without disclosing the side letter.  He subsequently sold it for a profit.  More than six years later, the company sued him for an account of the proceeds of sale of the land.  His limitation defence failed on the ground that he was regarded as a Class 1 constructive trustee.  Whereas, in <span class="font-italic">Gwembe</span><span class="font-italic"> Valley</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>… the defendant shareholder-director of the claimant company owned a majority of the shares in and controlled another company.  The defendant arranged for the other company to loan money to the claimant company without disclosing his interest in the other company to the board of the claimant company.  It was held that, apart from fraud, the claim would have been time-barred because the defendant’s liability to account for the secret profit was not within Class 1. … [T]he difference between <span class="font-italic">J</span><span class="font-italic"> J Harrison</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gwembe</span><span class="font-italic"> Valley</span> was that the property in <span class="font-italic">J</span><span class="font-italic"> J Harrison </span>was trust property that had been acquired by the director from the company at an undervalue; whereas, in <span class="font-italic">Gwembe</span><span class="font-italic"> Valley</span>, the defendant’s liability arose from his failure to disclose the true rate of exchange he had paid, and not because there was any misappropriation of specific property that belonged to the company … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 In <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong, </span>the company in question (“Panweld”) brought an action for breach of fiduciary duties against its director (“Mr Yong”).

The CA held (at [48]) that Mr Yong had trustee-like responsibility for Panweld’s assets; and that when he disposed of Panweld’s assets unlawfully, whether to his wife or to himself through his wife, he was undoubtedly a Class 1 constructive trustee because he had dealt with that property in breach of the trust and confidence that had been placed in him as a director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 In the present case, Henry’s AEIC did not explain why Phang’s conduct made him a Class 1 constructive trustee for the purposes of Corporation’s purported reliance on s 22 of the Limitation Act.  Nor was there any attempt in Corporation’s closing submissions to explain the position.  Leaving aside the claim relating to Healthcare’s acquisition of the Halyard distributorship and the claim relating to Primuz (for which the causes of action would have accrued at the earliest in 2017), I did not see how any of Corporation’s claims against Phang for breach of fiduciary duties could be said to involve the misappropriation of specific assets belonging to it.   I did not find any basis, therefore, for Corporation’s purported reliance on s 22.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 As for s 29, as stated earlier, Corporation did not specify in its pleadings which limb(s) of s 29 it was relying on.  Nevertheless, since it pleaded, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that Phang was “dishonest and/or fraudulent” in breaching his duties as director and that he did not disclose to Henry the existence and operations of Healthcare, I took it to be referring to ss 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).  In its closing submissions, Corporation did not explain the basis for its reliance on s 29: it simply repeated Henry’s allegation that he only found out on 2 February 2018 about “[Healthcare’s] incorporation, [Phang’s] and [Hooi Loo’s] interests in [Healthcare’s] business, breaches of duty, conspiracy to defraud committed by the [three defendants] and dishonest and/or knowing assistance on the part of [Healthcare]”

It was also clear that Henry acquired the above knowledge in his capacity as a director of Corporation: there could hardly be any question that Jasmine had approached him to bring up the matter of Healthcare – and the payment apparently made by Corporation on Healthcare’s behalf – because he was a director of Corporation.  Indeed, on Henry’s own case, he and Phang were the only two “executive” directors

Throughout this period, Phang would reasonably have inferred that Henry – and through him, Corporation – were aware of Healthcare: not only had Henry brought it up with him in 2006 in Jasmine’s presence, the monthly financial statements which Jasmine sent Henry from at least 2008 until 2017 (which were copied to Phang) specifically listed Healthcare under trade receivables and stated Hooi Loo to be its contact person

In the circumstances, I accepted that when Corporation took no steps to object or put an end to his operating Healthcare’s business, Phang would have been induced to believe that Corporation consented to what he was doing; further, that it was on account of this acquiescence that he went on to invest in growing Healthcare’s operations (for example, by increasing its paid-up share capital and hiring staff).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 In short, in relation to Corporation’s claim about Phang setting up Healthcare as a competing business, I was satisfied that Phang was able to make out an alternative defence of acquiescence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 391 of the Companies Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 In the above instances where I was prepared to find that Phang’s conduct amounted to breach of his fiduciary duties to Corporation, I did not find it necessary to consider the issue of possible relief under s 391 of the Companies Act.  This was because in my view, even assuming I had found that Phang was not entitled to relief under s 391 for these instances of breach, Corporation would still fail in its claims against him, firstly, because it was unable to prove the loss or damage purportedly resulting from such breaches; and secondly, because in any event its claims were either time-barred or subject to estoppel by acquiescence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Healthcare committed the tort of passing off </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">vis-à-vis</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Corporation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I address next Corporation’s claims against Healthcare.

However, as both defence counsel took the trouble to deal in some detail with the passing-off claim in their closing submissions, I address below the main issues raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 In the first place, goodwill in a passing-off action is not concerned specifically with the get-up (meaning the mark, brand or logo) used by the trader, but rather, is concerned with the trader’s business as a whole.  Goodwill “describes the state of the trader’s relationship with his or her customers”: per the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span> ([152] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [81].  Citing its own judgment in <span class="font-italic">Singsung</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd (trading as L S Electrical Trading)</span> [2016] 4 SLR 86, the CA reiterated (at [83]) that “the tort of passing off protects the plaintiff’s goodwill in his business and not specifically his right to the exclusive use of a mark, get-up, or logo, as the case may be.  The mark, get-up or logo will feature prominently in the analysis because this will usually be the means by which the tort or misrepresentation is committed; but it is not the ends for which the tort exists” [emphasis in original omitted].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 Bearing in mind the above analysis, Henry’s pre-occupation with trying to show the “goodwill of the ‘Bluestone’ name” – and the alleged association of the said “name” with the business of the Malaysian branch office – was misconceived.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Even if I were prepared to hold that there was sufficient evidence of goodwill in the business of the Malaysian branch office in that there was evidence of the revenue it derived from its business (see [85]–[86] of <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span>), it was clear that Corporation could not overcome the evidential hurdle of proving an actionable misrepresentation and damage related to its goodwill.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 Under the element of misrepresentation, Corporation first had to satisfy the threshold requirement of distinctiveness of its “Bluestone name” or “mark”: namely, whether the Bluestone mark was distinctive of the business of its Malaysian branch office.  In this respect, there was no evidence adduced by Corporation of such distinctiveness.  In fact, all that Henry – and another Corporation witness, Lee Jia Shin – focused on emphasising in their AEICs was that there were some potential customers or suppliers who were “confused” about the difference between Corporation and Healthcare

</div>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 Even assuming for the sake of argument that Corporation could satisfy the threshold requirement of distinctiveness and establish a misrepresentation by Healthcare that had caused confusion between its business and Healthcare’s, such misrepresentation would not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> be actionable under the law of passing off unless it had caused (or was likely to cause) damage to Corporation’s goodwill (per the CA in <span class="font-italic">Amanresorts</span> ([223] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [94]).  As the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">Amanresorts</span> (at [97]–[98]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">97 There are two primary and very well-established means by which goodwill can be damaged, namely, by ‘blurring’ and by ‘tarnishment’.  Blurring occurs when the plaintiff’s get-up, instead of being indicative of only the plaintiff’s goods, services or business, also becomes indicative of the defendant’s goods, services or business.  While customers may still be drawn by the attractive force of the plaintiff’s get-up, they may be drawn to the business, goods or services of the defendant instead of those of the plaintiff.  In other words, the goodwill attached to the plaintiff’s business, goods or services becomes spread out over business, goods or services which are not the plaintiff’s.  This phenomenon occurs only when the business, goods or services of the plaintiff and those of the defendant are in competition with or are at least substitutes for each other.  The damage manifests itself in sales being diverted from the plaintiff to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98 Tarnishment occurs when the business, goods or services of the defendant are of a worse quality than those of the plaintiff or have some other undesirable characteristic.  Customers think that the plaintiff is now the source of such poor quality or undesirable business, goods or services.  The goodwill previously attached to the plaintiff’s business, goods or services loses its attractive quality and may even become a liability, driving away custom rather than attracting it.  Where it is alleged that goodwill has been damaged by tarnishment, there is no need for the plaintiff’s business, goods or services and those of the defendant to be in competition with each other (<span class="font-italic">contra </span>the position where damage to goodwill by blurring is concerned).  The plaintiff and the defendant can be engaged in entirely different fields of business so long as it is shown that the poor quality or undesirability of the defendant’s business, goods or services rebounds on the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 In the present case, regrettably, Corporation did not plead what damage it claimed to have suffered to its goodwill.  Nor did Henry – or any other witness – give evidence identifying and quantifying any alleged damage to Corporation’s goodwill.  While there was an attempt in Henry’s and Lee Jia Shin’s AEICs to assert that some potential customers or suppliers were “confused” about the difference between Corporation and Healthcare, this fell far short of proving that the goodwill attached to the business of the Malaysian branch office had become “spread out” over Healthcare’s business.  There was also no evidence to establish in any event the quantity of sales allegedly diverted from the Malaysian branch office to Healthcare as a result of any alleged “blurring”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 I should add that the manner in which Corporation dealt with Healthcare’s alleged acts of “passing off” raised even more questions about the credibility of its claim.  It will be recalled that one of the main things which Corporation objected to and which it relied on as evidence of the passing off was the alleged results from a Google search on “Bluestone Healthcare Sdn Bhd”: according to Corporation, a party carrying out such a search would be directed to Corporation’s website.  One would have thought, therefore, that by the time of the trial, Corporation would have taken the necessary steps to provide information on its website to alert the public to the fact that it was unrelated to Healthcare and that it had its own branch office in Malaysia.  This was all the more so considering that – according to David – Corporation had made revisions to its website around end-2018 or early 2019

Unfortunately, in this connection, there was considerable confusion as to the precise nature of its claim, because it also pleaded in its amended statement of claim that Healthcare was “liable to account” as a “constructive trustee for such profits as were made by [Healthcare] and/or suffered by [Corporation], on the grounds of knowing assistance<span class="font-italic"> and receipt</span>”

The CA stressed that in this context, dishonesty described and qualified action, not mere passive receipt; and that the threshold of knowledge for dishonest assistance and knowing receipt, though very similar, still remained conceptually distinct (at [43]).

I have already dealt with the allegation of passing off at [223]–[233].  As for the other allegations, in light of my findings on the claims of various breaches made against Phang, it followed that since Phang was not liable for those breaches, Healthcare could not be liable for knowingly assisting any such breaches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 As for a claim in knowing receipt, the elements which have to be established are: a disposal of the plaintiff’s assets in breach of fiduciary duty; the beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as representing the assets of the plaintiff; and knowledge on the part of the defendant that the assets received are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty: <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage</span> at [23].  As counsel for Phang and Healthcare pointed out in closing submissions, the allusion to “knowing receipt” in Corporation’s statement of claim appeared to be based on a misapprehension of the law: the statement of claim said nothing about any assets of Corporation which were traceable to Healthcare as a result of alleged breaches by Phang.  Nor was any evidence adduced of such assets.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 For the above reasons, I found that Corporation failed to prove its claims of “knowing assistance<span class="font-italic"> </span>and receipt” against Healthcare.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Time bar and acquiescence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 Further and in the alternative, Healthcare also pleaded the defence of time bar in relation to the various claims made by Corporation against it

</div>, the claim that Hooi Loo had caused or allowed Healthcare to pass itself off as being “associated with” Corporation could not be sustained.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 I address next the allegations that Hooi Loo had breached her employment contract by joining Healthcare as a director whilst employed by Corporation, by causing Healthcare to compete with Corporation’s business, and by making “secret profits” from Healthcare’s business.  At the outset, it should be made clear that Hooi Loo accepted that there was an implied term in her employment contract that she would serve her employer (Corporation) with good faith and fidelity, and that she would also use reasonable care and skill in the performance of her duties pursuant to the employment contract.  That this implied duty of good faith and fidelity is owed by an employee to an employer is trite law: per the CA in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 at [193].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 As counsel for Hooi Loo pointed out, however, there is a distinction between these duties of good faith and fiduciary duties.  The CA made this point in <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart</span> [2012] 4 SLR 308 (“<span class="font-italic">Smile Inc</span>” at [52], citing, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following passages from the English High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Nottingham University v </span><span class="font-italic">Fishel </span>[2000] IRLR 471):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90 [T]he essence of the employment relationship is not typically fiduciary at all.  Its purpose is not to place the employee in a position where he is obliged to pursue his employer’s interests at the expense of his own.  The relationship is a contractual one and the powers imposed on the employee are conferred by the employer himself.  The employee’s freedom of action is regulated by the contract, the scope of his powers is determined by the terms (express or implied) of the contract, and as a consequence the employer can exercise (or at least he can place himself in a position where he has the opportunity to exercise) considerable control over the employee’s decision-making powers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91 This is not to say that fiduciary duties cannot arise out of the employment relationship itself.  But they arise not as a result of the mere fact that there is an employment relationship.  Rather they result from the fact that within a particular contractual relationship there are specific contractual obligations which the employee has undertaken which have placed him in a situation where equity imposes these rigorous duties in addition to the contractual obligations.  Where this occurs, the scope of the fiduciary obligations both arises out of, and is circumscribed by, the contractual terms; it is circumscribed because equity cannot alter the terms of the contract validly undertaken. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">97 [I]n determining whether a fiduciary relationship arises in the context of an employment relationship, it is necessary to identify with care the particular duties undertaken by the employee, and to ask whether in all the circumstances he has placed himself in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer.  It is only once those duties have been identified that it is possible to determine whether any fiduciary duty has been breached …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 In <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc</span>, the court found that the respondent employee was not in a position where he owed the appellant company fiduciary duties.  He was merely an associate dental surgeon who had not been entrusted with the authority to make any management decisions for the appellant.  Neither was he permitted to make corporate decisions binding the appellant: on the contrary, under the terms of his employment contract with the appellant, the respondent was obliged to work at any of the practices operated by the appellant at the instructions of its directors; and the respondent also undertook that he would be responsible and take instructions from the directors and carry out duties as might be assigned to him.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 In the present case, while Corporation had pleaded breach of employment contract by Hooi Loo, it had also couched its claim in terms normally used to describe fiduciary duties: it referred to Hooi Loo placing herself in “a position of conflict of interests, vis-à-vis [Corporation]” and failing “to manage and deal with [Corporation’s] property, assets and resources, in a trustee like manner”

</div>.  In so far as Corporation was seeking to attribute such fiduciary duties to Hooi Loo, I agreed with her counsel that there was simply no evidence to support its doing so.  It could not be disputed that as an employee of Corporation, Hooi Loo was never entrusted with the authority to make any management decisions for Corporation; nor was she permitted to make corporate decisions binding Corporation.  On the contrary, the express terms of her employment contract made it clear that her role in Corporation was a non-managerial one in which she had no authority to make any management or corporate decisions which would bind the company.  Thus, for example, clause 1.2 of her employment contract stated that she would “be reporting to the Sales Manager with duties and responsibilities assigned by him or her”.  Clause 2.3 and clause 5.2 of the contract stated that her incentive plan and leave would be subject to the discretion or approval of the Sales Manager.  Clause 8.1 stipulated that her employment would be “subject to prevailing policies and practices adopted by the company”, that there would be “policy changes from time to time”, and that she agreed to accept these changes

Based on the evidence adduced, therefore, I found that whilst Hooi Loo was subject to an implied duty of good faith and fidelity, she did not owe Corporation any fiduciary duties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 Hooi Loo accepted that this implied duty of good faith and fidelity would prohibit an employee from competing against the employer in the course of employment

In my view, this question had to be determined within the context of my findings about the circumstances in which Healthcare was set up and in which it went about its business.  To recap, I found that Henry and Phang had come to an agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “the Agreement”) that the latter would be free to set up his own Sdn Bhd to explore the Malaysian market.  I found that given the Agreement between these two shareholders of Corporation, Phang could not be said to have breached his fiduciary duties to Corporation in incorporating Healthcare and in using it as his corporate vehicle for tapping on business opportunities in the Malaysian market.  To put it another way, I did not think the incorporation of Healthcare and the operation of its business constituted competitive activity by Phang in breach of his duty to act in Corporation’s best interests.  Seen in this context, I did not think that Hooi Loo’s subsequent involvement in Healthcare should fairly be described as “actual competitive activity”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Time bar and acquiescence in relation to the claims against Hooi Loo </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 However, even if I were wrong to come to this conclusion, Hooi Loo has pleaded in the alternative the defence of time bar

In relation to Phang, whilst it was pleaded that he had access to confidential information because of his position as a director of Corporation, it was not disputed that he did not have any written contract of employment with Corporation: there was nothing in writing that expressly provided for the existence and scope of his alleged confidentiality obligations to Corporation.  The amended statement of claim said nothing about the basis on which a duty of confidence might be said to arise on Phang’s part: in fact, the words “duty of confidence” were not used at all in connection with Phang.

</div>.  Further, in relation to both Phang and Hooi Loo, the particulars pleaded of their various breaches did not include particulars of any breach of the duty of confidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 Given the state of Corporation’s pleadings, there was no basis for any finding of breach of confidence on either Phang’s or Hooi Loo’s part.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Observations on Corporation’s pleadings, claims for relief and handling of evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 Before I turn to Phang’s counterclaim, I find it necessary to put on record the following observations about Corporation’s pleadings, its claims for relief, and the manner in which it purported to put forward evidence in support of its case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 Firstly, as I noted earlier in these written grounds, the manner in which Corporation pleaded its case in the statement of claim was often confusing.  I found it regrettable that Corporation apparently decided to take a “scattershot” approach by alleging as many breaches against the three defendants as it could think of, but often without bothering to plead the elements of each purported cause of action or the material facts relied on in support thereof.  In some instances, it appeared to use the words “and/or” as some sort of umbrella term for covering any gaps in its pleadings, even when the use of these words made nonsense of its very case.  I refer, for example, to the claims it brought against Healthcare for allegedly acting in “<span class="font-italic">dishonest and/or knowing assistance</span>” [emphasis added] in relation to Phang’s alleged breaches of duties

</div>
</div> [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Secondly, some of the claims for relief pleaded by Corporation appeared to me to be wholly misconceived.  On the one hand, it sought to claim from the defendants an account of secret profits, including any directors’ fees paid by Healthcare to Phang and Hooi Loo.  In other words, it sought relief based on the gain allegedly achieved by the defendants.  On the other hand, it sought orders for the payment by the defendants of various sums said to represent losses caused to it by the operation of Healthcare’s business and in particular the diversion of the Halyard distributorship.  It also sought orders for damages in respect of Phang’s and Hooi Loo’s alleged breaches of duties.  These orders would constitute a loss-based measure of relief.  The law is clear that a plaintiff cannot claim both gain-based and loss-based relief arising from the same alleged wrong.  Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing and others</span> [2013] 3 SLR 631, where the plaintiff (“QAM”) had sought various relief against the defendants including injunctions, damages and account of profits, the High Court held (at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Damages are, of course, relief assessed based on the loss suffered by QAM.  An account of profits is relief based on the gain achieved by one or more of the defendants.  It is clear that QAM could not pursue <span class="font-italic">both</span> a loss-based measure of relief <span class="font-italic">and</span> a gain-based measure of relief arising from the same wrongful conduct. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 It should also be noted that in praying for damages from both Phang and Hooi Loo, Corporation asserted that these damages should be assessed with reference to the salaries it had paid the two defendants over the years (from 2005 to 24 August 2018 in Phang’s case, and from 2007 to 24 August 2018 in Hooi Loo’s case).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 of Corporation’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  In my view, such a claim was clearly wrong in principle.  In <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 592 (“<span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span>”), which also involved a company (“Beyonics”) suing its former director (“Goh”) for breaches of his fiduciary duties.  <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, Beyonics sought to recover the post-resignation salary of $45,900 paid to Goh, on the basis that it was paid in ignorance of his various breaches of duty which he should have disclosed.  At first instance, the trial judge allowed this claim and ordered that the salary payment be repaid to Beyonics.  On appeal, the CA disagreed with the trial judge.  Noting that she had relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">John Whi</span><span class="font-italic">le Springs (S) Pte Ltd v Goh Sai Chuah Justin</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 596 (“<span class="font-italic">John Whi</span><span class="font-italic">le Springs</span>”), the CA held that this reliance was in error (at [87]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]e do not agree that <span class="font-italic">John Whi</span><span class="font-italic">le Springs</span> supported the Judge’s findings on this issue.  In <span class="font-italic">John Whi</span><span class="font-italic">le Springs</span>, Choo Han Teck J allowed the plaintiffs to reclaim bonus payments paid to their ex-employee who had breached his fiduciary duty on the basis that ‘[n]o reasonable employer would have offered a bonus to a cheating employee, or one who was in breach of his fiduciary duty as was the case here’.  However, the present case can be distinguished on the facts.  Unlike a bonus that is ‘generally a payment fashioned as a reward as well as an incentive’ (<span class="font-italic">John Whi</span><span class="font-italic">le Springs</span> at [7]), salaries paid after resignation are generally contractually due to the employee.  In such situations, payments of salary after resignation are not gestures of goodwill, but would be the employee’s contractual entitlement.  In <span class="font-italic">Schonk</span><span class="font-italic"> Antonius Martinus Mattheus v Enholco Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 2 SLR 881 (“<span class="font-italic">Schonk</span>”), this court held that an employer may not use an employee’s breach of fiduciary duties to justify withholding payment of salary that that employee is entitled to.  Instead, the employer would only be entitled to make a deduction from the employee’s salary in respect of such losses as the employer can prove that it has suffered by reason of the employee’s breach (<span class="font-italic">Schonk</span> at [15]).  The employee in breach in <span class="font-italic">Schonk</span> was held to have been entitled as a matter of law to his salary for so long as he was working and, in the particular circumstances of that case, regarded himself as an employee. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 In light of the CA’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span>, Corporation was not entitled to claw back from Phang and Hooi Loo their past salaries.  In this connection, I did consider whether this was a case where Corporation believed itself to be entitled to claim repayment of an amount equivalent to the deduction it was “entitled to make” from their past salaries “in respect of such losses as [it could] prove that it ha[d] suffered by reason of [their] breach[es]”.  However, even assuming this was an acceptable justification, the manner in which Corporation purported to “prove” the losses suffered by reason of the breaches was without any principled basis.  In Phang’s case, it was argued that he should pay damages equivalent to 80.31% of his past salary payments because an analysis of his WhatsApp conversations with Healthcare employees showed that he spent 80.31% of his time on Healthcare’s business.  In Hooi Loo’s case, on the other hand, it was argued that since Healthcare’s gross revenue over the years accounted for only 84.86% of the combined gross revenue of the Malaysian branch office and Healthcare in the same period, this meant that she must have spent 84.86% of her time working on “earning revenue” for Healthcare, which in turn must oblige her to repay Corporation 84.86% of her past salaries.  Neither approach appeared to me to be sensible or backed by any coherent logic.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 In addition, Corporation’s attempt to claim damages assessed in terms of Phang’s and Hooi Loo’s past salaries struck me as being disingenuous in light of the previous striking out of its original claim for claw-back of Phang’s salary.  In striking out the claim for claw-back of Phang’s salary, the assistant registrar (“AR”) had made it clear that an employee would be entitled to his salary unless statute provided otherwise or unless there had been a total failure of consideration (the latter not having been pleaded by Corporation).  Corporation did not appeal the AR’s order.  In nonetheless seeking damages assessed in terms of past salary payments, Corporation appeared to me to be trying to obtain via a backdoor approach the very thing the AR had held it could not have.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 In respect of Corporation’s claim for claw-back of Phang’s and Hooi Loo’s past bonus payments, as I have found against it on its claims of breaches of duties, it was not entitled to get these claw-backs; and no more need be said here about this claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 Thirdly, I found the manner in which Corporation presented its evidence frankly disquieting.  To begin with, there were odd and unexplained gaps in the documentary records it put forward.  For example, it disclosed its own audited financial statements for the years 2012 to 2018 – but not for the years preceding 2012.  There did not seem to be any cogent reason why the financial statements for the years preceding 2012 could not be produced, especially since it had made a point of exhibiting Healthcare’s audited accounts for the years 2004 to 2016

I have alluded earlier to several instances of the seemingly cavalier attitude adopted by Corporation in presenting evidence in support of its case.  I will only mention two instances here.  One example was the misleading statement Henry made in his AEIC about Primuz’s registration of two CAIR LGL products with the HSA in Singapore

The copy of the slides which was exhibited in Henry’s AEIC appeared to be a complete slide presentation: the impression given was that this was a presentation which had been shown or conveyed to Halyard.  However, in cross-examination, it transpired that the copy of the slides exhibited by Henry actually had several pages omitted from it – and the pages which were omitted included blank pages and a blank table.  Had these missing blank pages and blank table been included in Henry’s exhibit, it would have become obvious that these were draft slides which had yet to be completed (and which were ultimately never presented to Halyard).  There was simply no reason for this selective presentation of evidence – unless it was to mislead the court and to make Phang look bad.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Phang’s counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 I come finally to Phang’s counterclaim.

He contended that given his responsibilities as a director and his years of experience, a reasonable notice period would have been 12 months.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 Corporation’s response to this counterclaim, as pleaded in its amended reply, was that it was entitled to terminate Phang’s employment summarily because of his “dishonest and/or fraudulent and/or negligent design in breach of his duties as a director and agent of [Corporation] and/or in breach of trust”

The length of notice depends on the circumstances of the case.”  <span class="font-italic">Richardson</span> was followed by our CA in <span class="font-italic">Teh</span><span class="font-italic"> Guek Ngor Engelin née Tan and others v Chia Ee Lin Evelyn and another</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 22 (“<span class="font-italic">Teh</span><span class="font-italic"> Engelin</span>”, at [20]).  The CA in <span class="font-italic">Teh</span><span class="font-italic"> Engelin</span> held (at [21]) that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… What is relevant for the purpose of determining the reasonable length of the period of notice of termination … depends on the individual facts of the case, and the courts would generally incline towards the period agreed by the parties, or, in the absence of agreement, a reasonable but determinate period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 In <span class="font-italic">Teh</span><span class="font-italic"> Engelin</span>, the respondent (“Chia”) had worked at the law firm for some seven years prior to the termination of her consultancy by the appellant and the other partners of the firm.  It was pointed out by the CA that she was described as a “rainmaker” and that “the amount of profits the firm derived from the work [she] brought in … was substantial” (at [21]–[22]).  The CA upheld the trial judge’s decision that the period of reasonable notice applicable in this case would be the time required for Chia to complete and bill all the files on which she would have been entitled to a profit share.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 In the present case, it was not disputed that there was no written contract of employment between Corporation and Phang.  There was no evidence of any agreement between them as to the terms of any termination of employment or of any agreement as to the notice period required for termination.  In the premises, I accepted Phang’s contention that he was entitled to a reasonable period of notice.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 As to what the length of this period of notice should be, I noted that Phang was a co-founder of Corporation, along with Henry; and that he had been working for Corporation for nearly two decades at the time his employment was terminated on 24 August 2018.  I was of the view that the 12-month notice period he argued for was excessive, but I did agree that given the circumstances of this case (including his length of service with Corporation, his seniority, and his age), a notice period of a mere one to two months would not have been reasonable.  On balance, I concluded that a reasonable notice period would be six months.  I therefore allowed his counterclaim to the extent that he was to be paid the sum of $96,120 (being his salary and employer’s CPF contribution for a reasonable notice period of six months), with interest to run thereon at 5.33% from the date of the writ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 Having dismissed Corporation’s claims and having allowed Phang’s counterclaim, I ordered that it pay each of the three defendants costs.  As parties were unable to agree on quantum of costs, they sent in written skeletal submissions. After receiving their submissions, I fixed Phang’s and Healthcare’s costs at a total of $320,000 plus disbursements of $49,619.89.  The disbursements allowed included the expenses incurred in relation to the Malaysian law expert (“Ms Ooi”): I found it reasonable to allow this item of disbursement because it was not until trial that it transpired Ms Ooi’s testimony would not be required.   As for Hooi Loo’s costs, I fixed them at a total of $220,000 plus disbursements of $49,876.11.  In fixing costs in these amounts, I took into account <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the number of days taken for the trial (11 days) and the large number of issues raised by Corporation which were unmeritorious but which still required defence counsel to expend time and effort to address.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Martin Francis Decruz and Alexander Loh (Shenton Law Practice LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gan Theng Chong and Kelley Wong Kar Ee (Lee &amp; Lee) for the first and second defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sharon Chong Chin Yee, Nandhu, Nadene Law Qin Ning and Renee Sim (RHTLaw Asia LLP) for the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
