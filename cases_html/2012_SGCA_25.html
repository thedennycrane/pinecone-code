        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Quek Hock Lye
                    (“Quek”), a 48-year-old male Singapore citizen, was convicted by
                    the judge (“the Judge”) in the High Court of possession of not
                    less than 62.14 g of diamorphine (“the seized drugs”), a
                    controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of
                    Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) in furtherance of a
                    criminal conspiracy with one Winai Phutthaphan (“Winai”), a 25
                    year-old male Thai national, to traffic the seized drugs, an offence under s
                    5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Act. Quek was sentenced to the mandatory death
                    penalty under s 120B of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the
                    PC”) read with s 33 of the Act (see <em>Public Prosecutor
                        v Phuthita </em><em>Somchit and another</em>
                    [2011] 3 SLR 719).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This is Quek’s appeal against his
                    conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Original and amended charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The charge on which Quek was convicted pertained
                    to his participation in a criminal conspiracy with Winai to traffic in not less
                    than 62.14 g of diamorphine (“the amended charge”). However, it
                    should be noted that at the commencement of the trial at the High Court, Quek
                    was in fact jointly charged with one Phuthita Somchit (“Somchit”),
                    a 37-year-old female Thai national who, in addition to Winai, was identified as
                    a party to the criminal conspiracy to traffic the seized drugs (“the
                    original charge”). The amended charge preferred against Quek by the Judge
                    was distinct from the original charge in only two respects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     Somchit was no longer a named
                        co-conspirator; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Quek, rather than Somchit, was stated to have been in possession of
                        the seized drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At this juncture, we should point out that Winai
                    was a named party to the criminal conspiracy alleged in the original charge
                    preferred against Quek and Somchit as well as in the amended charge forming the
                    subject matter of this appeal. However, prior to the commencement of
                    Quek’s trial before the Judge, Winai pleaded guilty to a wholly separate
                    charge of possession of not less than 14.99 g of diamorphine in furtherance of a
                    criminal conspiracy with Somchit and Quek to traffic in the stated quantity of
                    the drugs (“Winai’s charge”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Winai’s testimony was used by the
                    Prosecution in the trial against Quek and Somchit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       By way of background, we ought to state that
                    Somchit was distantly related to Winai and was also Quek’s girlfriend. As
                    per the original charge, Quek and Somchit were jointly tried in a 17 day hearing
                    before the Judge. Although Quek claimed trial, he elected to remain silent when
                    called upon to enter his defence. On the 17<sup>th</sup> day of
                    trial, having conducted a thorough assessment of the evidence adduced before the
                    court, the Judge made a number of findings which resulted in the charges
                    preferred against Quek and Somchit being amended. In particular, the Judge made
                    the following findings of fact and law:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     From her demeanour in the witness box
                        and the consistency of her evidence, Somchit was a witness of
                            truth.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Somchit did not have actual knowledge
                        and was not wilfully blind as to the <em>nature</em> of
                        the drug.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                        Somchit had proved on a balance of probabilities that she did not know the
                        nature of the drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Somchit had rebutted the presumption of knowledge raised by s 18(2)
                        of the Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Accordingly, the Judge acquitted Somchit of the
                    original charge. However, exercising his power under s 175(2) of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”),
                    the Judge amended the charge against Somchit and convicted her of attempting to
                    traffic in a controlled drug under Class C of the First Schedule of the Act
                    (“the separate charge”). On 2 September 2010, Somchit was
                    sentenced to 9 years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Having convicted and sentenced Somchit under the
                    separate charge, the Judge further exercised his powers under s 163(1) of
                    the CPC, and preferred the amended charge against Quek (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). The following exchange took place when
                    the amended charge was read out to Quek:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Notwithstanding the Judge’s reluctance to
                    accept Quek’s plea of guilt, upon being called to enter his defence, Quek
                    chose not to call any witnesses or tender any documents in his defence to the
                    amended charge. In the result, the Judge convicted Quek of the amended charge,
                    after he was satisfied, having assessed the evidence already adduced, that the
                    evidence overwhelmingly supported it. As noted above (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>), the elements of the amended charge were
                    identical to the original charge with the exception of the removal of any
                    reference to Somchit in relation to the alleged criminal conspiracy as well as
                    the amendment to state that Quek, instead of Somchit, was in possession of the
                    seized drugs. As will be shown later, these changes did not affect the
                    sufficiency of the weight of the evidence adduced in support of the amended
                    charge (below at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>-<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>; <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>-<a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Material facts in support of the amended charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The facts supporting both the original and
                    amended charges can be found in the statement of agreed facts
                    (“SAF”) which was signed by Quek and tendered before the Judge
                    pursuant to s 376(1) of the CPC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    In accordance with s 376(3) of the CPC, the SAF could be treated as an
                    admission of facts for the purposes of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The following facts were undisputed before the
                    Judge as well as before this Court. At the material time, Quek, Winai and
                    Somchit resided at Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View #01-02, Aquarius by the
                    Park, Singapore (“the Aquarius apartment”). Quek had, using his
                    forged driving licence, entered into a lease agreement dated 6 September
                    2008 with the owner of the Aquarius apartment to rent it. On 3 October
                    2008, Quek was arrested by a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau
                    (“CNB”) and was led to the Aquarius apartment where he was
                    searched. Amongst other things, the following were recovered from his
                    person:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     One bunch of four keys attached to a
                        key tag with the words “21 Aquarius #01-02” written on it;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Cash
                        amounting to a total of S$ 5948.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The CNB officers thereafter conducted a search
                    of the Aquarius apartment and seized 124 packets of granular substances which
                    were later established to contain not less than 62.14 g of diamorphine. Drug
                    paraphernalia was also found in the apartment which formed the objective
                    evidence before the Judge to show that the drugs in the apartment were intended
                    for repacking for sale rather than for personal consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Quek made a contemporaneous statement on
                    3 October 2008 and a cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the CPC on
                    4 October 2008. Later, five long statements were recorded from him under s
                    121 of the CPC on 7, 8 and 9 October 2008 and 22 January 2009
                    (hereinafter all 7 statements taken by the police will be referred to as
                    “statements”). In his statements, Quek unequivocally admitted to
                    having possession of the seized drugs, the intent to traffic in them as well as
                    the requisite knowledge of their specific nature. At the trial, Quek’s
                    statements were admitted into evidence without any challenge being made by him
                    as to their voluntariness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Before us, Quek also did not
                    dispute any of the above-mentioned facts or the Judge’s findings in
                    relation to his possession of the seized drugs, his knowledge of their specific

                    corroborated the evidence against Quek when she testified that it was Quek who
                    procured the seized drugs and had directed her to repack them for sale to
                        customers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, Winai had also testified
                    that Quek had instructed him to deliver the seized “white

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First ground of appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Two separate grounds of appeal are raised by
                    Quek before this Court. First, in the petition of appeal filed by Quek’s
                    counsel (“Counsel”), he contended that the Judge had erred in law
                    in proceeding to hear the charge against Quek after he had pleaded guilty to the
                    amended charge. Quek’s specific complaint was that the Judge had failed to
                    follow the procedural safeguards set out in ss 139 and 187 of the CPC in
                    relation to the recording of his plea of guilt (“the plea of guilt
                        ground”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Pursuant to s 187 of the CPC, where the
                    accused wishes to plead guilty his plea of guilt <em>shall</em> be recorded prior to his formal conviction of the charge.
                    Counsel, while noting that the Judge’s failure to refer to Quek’s
                    plea of guilt in his grounds of decision (“GD”) was a
                    “technical” breach of s 187 of the CPC, went on to argue that
                    this omission by the Judge cast doubt on whether the accused had received a fair
                    trial in so far as the amended charge was concerned. Further, Counsel
                    characterised the Judge’s mind when hearing the amended charge, after Quek
                    had entered his plea of guilt, as being “tainted by a reasonable
                    suspicion of bias”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> With respect, we do
                    not understand the sense in this argument. First, while the Judge rejected
                    Quek’s plea of guilt, he proceeded to assess the evidence already adduced
                    against Quek on the amended charge and having determined that such evidence had
                    established a <em>prima facie</em> case against him on the
                    amended charge, called on Quek to enter his defence by calling such witnesses as
                    he might wish to do. In these circumstances, we do not see how it could be
                    validly argued that he did not receive a fair trial on the amended charge.
                    Secondly, there is no requirement at law that a judge should refer to the
                    accused’s plea of guilt in his GD. Having said that, the notes of evidence
                    of the trial had clearly captured Quek’s plea and the Judge’s
                    rejection of the same. Thirdly, the Judge did not act on his plea of guilt.
                    Instead, he called on Quek to call such witnesses as he might wish in his
                    defence. This may explain why the Judge at [50] of his GD stated, though not
                    entirely accurately, that Quek “claimed trial”. However, we do not
                    see how this discrepancy is in any way material or sufficient to amount to bias,
                    either apparent or actual. It was only after Quek decided not to call any
                    witnesses that the Judge, having assessed the evidence adduced, convicted Quek
                    of the amended charge. Counsel’s interpretation of the obligations imposed
                    by ss. 139 and 187 of the CPC failed to have regard to what had in fact
                    transpired, <em>i.e.</em> the guilty plea was rejected by
                    the Judge. While we can see some basis for this argument to be advanced in a
                    case where a judge had acted on the guilty plea (but on which we do not offer a
                    concluded view), it can have no place where the plea is <em>not</em> accepted. While we recognise that the Judge could have, in
                    his GD, made reference to the guilty plea which he had rejected, non reference
                    could hardly have given rise to any impropriety or injustice. What the Judge did
                    was to proceed as if the plea had never been uttered, a course which he was
                    entitled to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In this regard, it is also important to note
                    that the <em>guiding purpose</em> of the requirements in
                    ss. 139 and 187 of the CPC is the avoidance of any prejudice to the
                    accused. It is for this reason that the court is required to comply with a
                    number of safeguards when recording any plea of guilt (see <em>Rajeevan </em><em>Edakalavan v Public
                        Prosecution</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 10 at [24] and [25]). Counsel did not and, in our view, could not argue that
                    Quek had suffered any prejudice by the Judge’s decision to reject his plea
                    and to offer him the opportunity of calling for any additional evidence in
                    defence to the amended charge. In our opinion, the Judge had followed the spirit
                    and purpose of the two highlighted sections of the CPC. To our mind, the
                    approach which the Judge took, following his rejection of the guilty plea, was
                    clearly prompted by his desire to ensure that Quek received a fair trial.
                    Accordingly, the first ground of appeal is dismissed as being wholly without
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second ground of appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At the first hearing of this appeal on 18
                    August 2011, in response to queries from the Bench, Counsel also made arguments
                    which raised questions as to the propriety of the amended charge on which Quek
                    was convicted. That was in the light of the fact that Winai’s charge, on
                    which he had been convicted on, related to “not less than 14.99 grams of
                    diamorphine” whereas the amended charge against Quek related to
                    “not less than 62.14 grams of diamorphine”. Counsel also made
                    further arguments with respect to certain attendant constitutional issues
                    touching on the principles of equal treatment and protection under the law as
                    well as the exercise of judicial power. As a result, this Court directed that
                    further written submissions on those issues be made by the parties. We will
                    first examine the constitutional issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Article 12(1) argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Counsel argued that the Public
                    Prosecutor’s actions in charging Winai with possession of not less than
                    14.99 g of diamorphine while charging Quek with the total seized quantity of not
                    less than 62.14 g of diamorphine are in breach of Article 12(1) of the
                    Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Constitution”) as both Winai and Quek essentially fell within the same
                    class of accused persons and shared the same legal guilt, relying here on Lord
                    Diplock’s speech in the Privy Council decision of <em>Ong
                        Ah Chuan and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1979-1980] SLR(R) 710 (“<em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em>”) at [35],
                        [36] and [39]. Counsel also sought to distinguish the
                    line of cases following <em>Teh Cheng Poh v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1979] 1 MLJ 50 (“<em>Teh Cheng Poh</em>”) on the basis that unique to the present
                    case was the fact that (a) both Winai and Quek were charged for trafficking in
                    diamorphine and (b) both were in possession of the same amount of diamorphine.
                    Furthermore, Counsel also took the position that the Court of Criminal Appeal
                    was wrong in <em>Thiruselvam </em><em>s/o
                        Nagaratnam v Public Prosecutor</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 362
                        (“<em>Thiruselvam</em>”) as it failed to
                    consider the definition of “class” as elucidated by Lord Diplock
                    in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Counsel also argued that Winai and Quek fell
                    within the same legal class for the following reasons:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    First, [their offences arose] from the same factual
                            matrix;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    Second, [the offences relate] to the exact same
                            amount of drugs trafficked; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    Third, [the offences arose] from effectively the
                            same act/wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The argument seemed to flow from the premise that as an
                    individual’s personal circumstance and moral blameworthiness were not
                    relevant for determining whether two or more individuals who had committed the
                    same act fell within the same class, <em>Thiruselvam</em>
                    should not be followed. In the alternative, Counsel argued that <em>Thiruselvam</em> should be distinguished from the present
                    case because Winai and Quek were charged for “essentially the same crime,
                    a conspiracy to traffic in diamorphine”. In contrast, in <em>Thiruselvam</em>, one accused was charged for trafficking and
                    another for abetment. In essence, Counsel’s point was that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The act of prosecutorial discretion in formulating the artificial charge
                        so as to discriminate against offenders of the same class violates Article
                        12 of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Analysis of Article 12</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Art 12(1) of the Constitution states as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.—(1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the
                        equal protection of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The issue in the present case is whether Art
                    12(1) of the Constitution was violated by the Public Prosecutor’s exercise
                    of prosecutorial discretion in preferring different charges against Quek and
                    Winai, parties to the same criminal conspiracy. In this regard we must refer to
                    the recent decision of this Court in <em>Ramalingam
                        </em><em>Ravinthran v Attorney-General</em>
                    [2012] SGCA 2 (“<em>Ramalingam v AG</em>”),
                    which has shed further light on this issue. To better understand the decision in
                        <em>Ramalingam v AG</em>, it is necessary for us to
                    first set out the argument made by the applicant there. Similar to the present
                    case, there the applicant argued that Art 12(1) of the Constitution was violated
                    when the Attorney-General, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, charged the
                    applicant (<em>i.e.</em> in a similar position to Quek)
                    with a capital charge while the other member of the same criminal enterprise,
                    one Sundar Arujunan (“Sundar”), was charged with a non-capital
                    charge. In fact, similar to Winai’s treatment in the present case, Sundar
                    was charged with trafficking in a reduced quantity of the controlled drugs
                    found, just below the threshold at which it would attract the mandatory death
                    penalty on conviction. In the present case, while Quek was charged with
                    trafficking in all 62.14 g of the seized drugs, Winai was charged only with
                        <em>not less</em> than 14.99 g despite being part of
                    the same criminal enterprise and underlying agreement. Thus, the position of
                    Quek is identical to that of the applicant in <em>Ramalingam v
                        AG</em> and Quek has also essentially raised the same constitutional
                    argument as that was raised by the applicant in <em>Ramalingam v
                        AG, i.e.</em> whether the exercise of prosecutorial discretion which
                    resulted in differential treatment of two offenders involved in the same
                    criminal enterprise constituted a breach of Art 12(1) of the
                    Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Ramalingam v
                        AG</em>, this Court had discussed many of the cases relied on by
                    Quek’s Counsel in this appeal. First, the Privy Council decision in
                        <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> was held to be irrelevant to the
                    question of constitutionality of the Attorney-General’s exercise of
                    prosecutorial discretion as <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> dealt
                    with a different question, <em>i.e.</em>, the application
                    of Art 12(1) of the Constitution to legislation (see <em>Ramalingam v AG</em> at [19]-[20] and [40]). The excerpts from <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> which Counsel relied upon were in fact made in the
                    context of criminal statutes providing for the mandatory death penalty. In
                        <em>Ramalingam v AG</em> this Court pointed out that
                    the test to be applied to the principle of equality before the law was not the
                    same when it was being applied in relation to the exercise of prosecutorial
                    discretion. The distinction has to be drawn because in addition to the legal
                    guilt of the offender, the Public Prosecutor is obliged to consider a wide range
                    of factors (see <em>Ramalingam v AG</em> at [63]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the] moral blameworthiness, the gravity of the harm caused to the public
                        welfare by his criminal activity, and a myriad of other factors, including
                        whether there is sufficient evidence against a particular offender, whether
                        the offender is willing to co-operate with the law enforcement authorities
                        in providing intelligence, whether one offender is willing to testify
                        against his co-offenders, and so on – up to and including the
                        possibility of showing some degree of compassion in certain cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, the appellant’s dogged reliance on <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> as a basis for contending that the exercise
                    of the Public Prosecutor’s discretion should be restricted to the sole
                    question of the legal guilt of an offender is both ill founded and patently
                    incorrect. <em>Teh Cheng Poh</em> and the subsequent line
                    of cases, including <em>Thiruselvam</em>, were extensively
                    discussed in <em>Ramalingam v AG</em> (see [40] of <em>Ramalingam v
                        AG</em>). This Court in <em>Ramalingam v AG</em>
                    noted that the circumstances in <em>Thiruselvam</em> were
                    different from those in <em>Teh Cheng Poh</em> in the sense
                    that the latter case did not concern the treatment of two offenders but that of
                    a single offender. Further, in <em>Teh Cheng Poh</em>, the
                    Public Prosecutor, in exercise of his prosecutorial discretion chose to bring a
                    charge against the applicant which attracted capital punishment instead of under
                    a different law where the punishment would have been less severe.
                    Notwithstanding the identified factual differences between <em>Thiruselvam</em> and <em>Teh Cheng Poh</em>,
                    this Court in <em>Ramalingam v AG</em> nevertheless held
                    that Art 12(1) of the Constitution was not infringed if there were grounds
                    for the Public Prosecutor to bring different charges of unequal gravity against
                    two or more offenders in the same criminal enterprise. This Court did not think
                    that the fact that in <em>Thiruselvam</em> the co-offenders
                    were charged with different offences, one for abetting and the other for
                    trafficking, constituted a material circumstance to distinguish <em>Ramalingam v AG</em> from <em>Thiruselvam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The fact situation in the present case is
                    similar to that in <em>Ramalingam v AG</em>, where both the
                    accused persons in question were charged with identical offences of drug
                    trafficking, save for the quantity of drugs involved, resulting in significantly
                    different consequences as far as the punishment which could be imposed was
                    concerned. However, the divergent consequences faced by accused persons in the
                    same criminal enterprise from the prescribed punishments (whether mandatory or
                    not), flowing from their respective charges by the Public Prosecutor, are not
                        <em>per se</em> sufficient to found a successful Art
                    12(1) challenge. To the contrary, this divergence in sentence experienced by
                    accused persons is but a consequence of the broader constitutionally vested
                    discretion in the Public Prosecutor in preferring charges against accused
                    persons. Accordingly, applying the principles as elucidated in <em>Ramalingam v AG</em>, Quek’s Art 12(1) challenge fails
                    as the issue is <em>not</em> whether the Public Prosecutor
                        <em>can</em> exercise his discretion to prefer a lower
                    quantum of the same seized drugs between co-offenders but rather whether this
                    decision was made for legitimate reasons which, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, include the considerations outlined above. It is the latter
                    part of this analysis, <em>i.e.</em> an accused’s
                    complaint of illegitimate reasons operative on the mind of the Public Prosecutor
                    in exercise of his discretion which gives rise to the metaphorical key capable
                    of unlocking a successful Art 12(1) challenge of this nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At this juncture we would highlight the fact
                    that unlike in <em>Ramalingam v AG</em>, Counsel did not
                    make any arguments concerning the relative culpability of Winai and Quek which
                    could have enabled this Court to review the Public Prosecutor’s decision
                    to treat Quek differently from Winai. In this regard, the following passage in
                        <em>Ramalingam v AG</em> is of particular assistance,
                    at [70]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the Applicant must specifically produce <em>prima
                            facie</em> evidence of bias or the taking into account of
                        irrelevant considerations by the Attorney-General in differentiating,
                        pursuant to his prosecutorial discretion, between the charges against the
                        Applicant and the charges against Sundar. In this regard, the mere
                        differentiation of charges between co-offenders, even between those of equal
                        guilt, is not, <em>per se</em>, sufficient to
                        constitute prima facie evidence of bias or the taking into account of
                        irrelevant considerations that breaches Art 12(1). Differentiation between
                        offenders of equal guilt can be legitimately undertaken for many reasons and
                        based on the consideration of many factors ... It is for the offender who
                        complains of a breach of Art 12(1) to prove that there are no valid grounds
                        for such differentiation. In the absence of proof by the offender, the court
                        should not presume that there are no valid grounds in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As such, we find that Quek has not discharged his burden of
                    establishing a <em>prima facie</em> case that the Public
                    Prosecutor has infringed Art 12(1) of the Constitution in charging him with a
                    capital charge while sparing Winai of the same. In any event, we find that on
                    the evidence, Quek was really the brain behind the criminal enterprise and thus
                    the main culprit. In addition, Winai’s willingness to testify against Quek
                    and Somchit was a relevant consideration which could have operated on the mind
                    of the Public Prosecutor in preferring separate charges against Quek and Winai.
                    Accordingly, the Art 12(1) argument is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Article 93 argument </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We turn now to the second constitutional issue
                    and the argument here is that the “selection of punishment for members of
                    a class of offenders is for the Judiciary by virtue of Article 93 of the
                        Constitution”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Counsel’s point is that the
                    Public Prosecutor’s actions in formulating a drug trafficking charge
                    against Winai, which was <em>just under</em> the amount
                    necessary to trigger the mandatory death penalty, contravenes the doctrine of
                    separation of powers and breaches Article 93 of the constitution as it
                        “[<em>usurps</em>] <em>the
                        judicial function of sentencing</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    Borrowing the language of <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>, Counsel
                    took the position that so long as the two accused persons were of the same legal
                    guilt, the “manipulation” of the quantum of seized drugs in their
                    respective charges infringed Art 93 of the Constitution. Counsel averred that
                    the manner in which the Public Prosecutor acted in relation to Winai and Quek
                    amounted to reserving to itself the ability to determine who should face the
                    death penalty and who need not, even though both Quek and Winai were
                    “charged for the same offence”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Counsel seemed to be suggesting
                    that the decision to charge one offender with a non-capital charge and another
                    with a capital charge fell within the jurisdiction of the court and that the
                    Public Prosecutor would be acting unconstitutionally by virtue of Art 93 of the
                    Constitution if it were to be permitted to “manipulate” the
                    quantum of seized drugs resulting in a non-capital charge being preferred
                    against a co-offender. Counsel also argued that this objection would not arise
                    so long as both co-offenders were charged with separate offences such as
                    trafficking and abetment, as in <em>Thiruselvam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Analysis of the Article 93 argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We would first observe that Counsel’s
                    complaint against the Public Prosecutor’s exercise of his discretion which
                    could result in two offenders in the same criminal enterprise being liable for
                    different sentences could also arise in other situations (<em>i.e.</em> non drug-related) where mandatory penalties are involved.
                    For example the same objection could be taken when the Public Prosecutor decides
                    to charge A with murder and B with culpable homicide where both A and B were
                    part of the same criminal enterprise. If the charge was proven beyond a
                    reasonable doubt, the court would be compelled to sentence A to the mandatory
                    death penalty whereas B would only be liable for life imprisonment. Another
                    instance would be where two persons were acting in concert to damage property.
                    One could be charged for mischief and the other for vandalism, the latter of
                    which would attract mandatory caning as the prescribed punishment. Thus, if
                    Counsel’s submission is valid and ought to be accepted, it would have
                    implications in relation to all offences which carry mandatory penalties and not
                    just offences which attract the mandatory death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Counsel’s argument characterising the
                    Public Prosecutor’s exercise of his discretion in relation to Quek and
                    Winai as unconstitutional disregards the fact that Art 35(8) of the Constitution
                    confers upon the Attorney-General, as the Public Prosecutor, a constitutional
                    power to exercise his discretion in individual cases, which must necessarily
                    impact the sentencing range available to the court in relation to the particular
                    charge preferred. In a mandatory penalty scenario, this impact is further
                    heightened as the court, in sentencing, is not in a position to take into
                    account the mitigating circumstances. However, the question of usurpation of
                    judicial power does not arise. It is not the function of the court to prefer
                    charges against an accused brought before it. The court exercises its judicial
                    power in relation to the charge or charges brought by the Public Prosecutor
                    against an accused person. The court may only exercise its power to amend the
                    charge in the light of the evidence adduced before it. The powers and
                    jurisdiction of the courts as set out in Art 93 of the Constitution are distinct
                    and separate from the powers of the Public Prosecutor under Art 35(8) of the
                    Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the scheme envisioned under the
                    Constitution, the judiciary does not possess the power or jurisdiction to
                    formulate or prefer charges against accused persons; that is the constitutional
                    provenance of the Attorney-General. As rightly pointed out by the Prosecution,
                    only when the charge is preferred against the accused can the court exercise its
                    judicial power over the proceedings. The limitation of the sentencing range or
                    sentence (in a mandatory penalty scenario) available to the court is a necessary
                    consequence following the charge preferred. While the court has the power to
                    review the considerations taken into account by the Public Prosecutor in
                    preferring the charge, to decide whether or not the evidence adduced by the
                    Public Prosecutor proves the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and to amend the
                    charge in light of the evidence before it, it is not for the court to determine
                    what charge should be preferred against an accused person irrespective of
                    whether the charge would invoke a mandatory penalty. This principle applies
                    equally to the situation where multiple parties are involved in a criminal
                    enterprise. It is the very essence of prosecutorial discretion that due weight
                    is given to all relevant circumstances or considerations prior to the
                    formulation of a charge. Arts 93 and 35(8) of the Constitution should be
                    construed harmoniously, with neither being subordinate to the other.
                    Counsel’s submission would mean that Art 93 of the Constitution overrides
                    Art 35(8) of the Constitution. His characterisation of the Public
                    Prosecutor’s exercise of his discretion as “manipulation”
                    would appear to stem from his misconception of Art 12(1) of the Constitution
                    wherein the Public Prosecutor is limited to preferring charges solely on the
                    basis of legal guilt. This submission has been shown to be incorrect (see
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>-<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For completeness, we will briefly comment on
                    the Privy Council decision in <em>Mohammed Muktar Ali &amp; Anor
                        v The Queen</em> [1992] 2 AC 93 (“<em>Muktar
                        Ali</em>”) which is relied upon by Counsel. In <em>Muktar Ali</em>, the court was concerned with the question of
                    whether a provision in the Mauritius Dangerous Drugs Act 1986 which conferred on
                    the Director of Public Prosecutions the discretion to determine the court which
                    a drug importer should be tried, infringed the principle of separation of
                    powers. There, if the court selected by the Director of Public Prosecutions was
                    the Supreme Court and if the offender was found to be guilty of drug trafficking
                    he would be sentenced to death. Contrarily, if he was tried in an Intermediate
                    or District Court, the offender would be sentenced to a fine and a term of penal
                    servitude. The Privy Council found that since the discretion to select the court
                    enabled the Director of Public Prosecutions to, in effect, select the penalty to
                    be imposed, the relevant provision of the Mauritius Dangerous Drugs Act 1986 was
                    unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Similar to the discussion in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>, it would be noted that <em>Muktar Ali</em> concerned an ordinary legislative provision rather
                    than the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, a power conferred and governed by
                    the Constitution itself, which is the issue in the present appeal. In fact, as
                    pointed out by the Prosecution, Lord Keith of Kinkel expressly stated at pp
                    103-104 of <em>Muktar Ali</em> that the case was concerned
                    with the particular legislative provision’s impact on the court before
                    which a person was tried. His Lordship clearly articulated at p 104 of <em>Muktar Ali</em> that“[i]n general, there is no
                    objection of a constitutional or other nature to a prosecuting authority having
                    discretion of that nature”. In fact, the Privy Council expressly stated
                    that the prosecuting authority’s discretion to prefer a more serious
                    charge rather than a less serious one against an accused would not give rise to
                    any constitutional objection. Counsel’s reliance on this case was
                    accordingly misplaced. In the present case, it is the Prosecutor’s
                    discretion which Counsel seeks to challenge, a discretion conferred under the
                    Constitution. The situation here is completely different from that in <em>Muktar Ali</em>. The Public Prosecutor’s decision to
                    prefer separate charges on members of the same criminal enterprise does not
                    interfere with the court’s judicial power. Accordingly, Quek’s
                    second ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The use of criminal conspiracy in Quek’s amended
                charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Having disposed of the two constitutional
                    issues, what remains to be addressed is the issue of the propriety of the
                    amended charge on which Quek was convicted. This issue may, in turn, involve the
                    consideration of the following two sub-issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether Quek and Winai could be said
                        to be parties to the same criminal conspiracy to traffic diamorphine despite
                        being separately charged for different quantities of the same parcel of
                        seized drugs found in their possession; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     If not, whether this Court should exercise its
                        discretion to amend the charge on which Quek was convicted and to offer him
                        an opportunity to plead thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As a starting point it bears noting that, like
                    abetment and attempt, criminal conspiracy is defined as an incomplete or
                    inchoate crime in ss 120A and 120B of the PC as follows:</p>

                            be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such
                        offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is trite law that a charge of criminal
                    conspiracy requires <em>two or more persons</em> in
                    agreement to do or cause to be done an illegal act (or an act, which is not
                    illegal, by illegal means) which in the present case is the trafficking of 62.14
                    g of diamorphine. As such, a finding of the existence of a co-conspirator, in
                    the present case Winai, is necessary in order for this Court to uphold
                    Quek’s conviction under the amended charge. In this regard, two questions
                    arise:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the evidence before this
                        Court supports a finding that there was an underlying agreement between
                        Winai and Quek to traffic the seized drugs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so, notwithstanding the Court’s
                        satisfaction with the evidence in relation to the underlying agreement,
                        whether the difference in the precise quantity of the seized drugs in Quek
                        and Winai’s respective charges <em>per se</em>,
                        undermines a positive finding of criminal conspiracy?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The existence of an underlying agreement between Quek and Winai to
                traffic the seized drugs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The critical question is whether there was
                    indeed an agreement between Winai and Quek to traffic in 62.14 g of the
                    diamorphine found. On this question, the statement of facts to which Winai
                    pleaded guilty to under the separate charge brought against him (<em>i.e</em>. Winai’s charge above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>), for a lesser quantum of not less than 14.99 g
                    of the seized drugs, states as follows (“Winai’s
                        SOF”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At all material times, Quek, Somchit and Winai had agreed to perform
                        specific tasks in the process of procuring, packaging and delivering
                        diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking. Pursuant to this agreement,
                        Somchit was in possession of 62.14 grams of diamorphine at the unit of 3
                        October 2008 for the purpose of trafficking, which is an offence under
                        Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Winai’s SOF also details the various
                    packets of controlled substance found and the HSA analysis of the seized drugs
                    which established that a total of 62.14 g of diamorphine was found at the
                    Aquarius apartment. By admitting to the SOF, and by pleading guilty to the
                    separate charge brought against him, Winai admitted to having the knowledge and
                    the intention to traffic in the total quantum of the seized drugs. The evidence
                    adduced at the trial against Quek also amply demonstrated that such an
                    underlying agreement existed between Quek and Winai. It also bears noting that
                    at his appeal, Counsel did not canvas the argument that there was any deficiency
                    in the evidence supporting the existence of an agreement between Winai and Quek
                    to traffic in the total quantity of the seized drugs. Indeed, we do not see how
                    he could as the evidence overwhelmingly shows that Quek and Winai had agreed to
                    traffic in the total quantity of the seized drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The issue of congruity arising from Quek and Winai’s respective
                charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the present facts, the incongruity in the
                    charges faced by Quek and Winai does not impact their underlying agreement to
                    traffic in the 62.14 g of diamorphine. This is for the simple reason that
                    Winai’s charge specifying a lower quantum of diamorphine merely reflects
                    the Public Prosecutor’s discretion to prefer a less serious charge, and we
                    do not see how that could have any impact on or affect the primary factual
                    question, namely, the existence of an agreement between Quek and Winai to
                    traffic in the full 62.14 g of diamorphine. As noted above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>-<a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>,
                    substantial evidence was adduced before this Court in satisfaction of this
                    crucial question. In this regard, the following statement in Stanley Yeo, Neil
                    Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, <em>Criminal Law in Malaysia and
                        Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2012)
                    at p 918, discussing the burden of proof on the Public Prosecutor setting out to
                    establish criminal conspiracy, is germane:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[34.54] … It is also sufficient for the prosecution to prove that
                        there are two or more persons guilty of conspiracy even though the other
                        person involved <em>may still be at large, dead, unknown, or
                            for some reason acquitted on a technical ground</em>. However, a
                        conviction for criminal conspiracy is improper if it is inconsistent with
                        the acquittal of the other alleged co-conspirator such as absence of proof
                        of an agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Pradumna
                        </em><em>Shriniwas </em><em>Auradkar v State of Maharashtra</em> 1981 Cri. L. J. 1873, the
                    applicant, A, argued that he could not be convicted of criminal conspiracy as
                    his only co-conspirator, B, was acquitted of the same offence. In dismissing the
                    appeal, similar to the present case, the court held at [11] that the conspiracy had been clearly
                    established on the facts and as the acquittal of B was on a purely technical
                    ground, the appellant could not be exonerated in the circumstances. The court
                    also held that to prove criminal conspiracy, it was unnecessary that the
                    co-conspirator be tried and/ or convicted. Crucially, as no authority had been
                    presented to suggest that A should be acquitted <em>ipso
                        facto</em>, following from B’s acquittal, his conviction could
                    not be challenged. As such, the acquittal of B <em>per
                        se</em> did not affect A’s conviction under the criminal
                    conspiracy charge. One must however note that it is the <em>reason</em> supporting the acquittal of a co-accused that the court
                    must pay attention to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the House of Lords decision in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Shannon</em> [1975] AC 717,
                    a similar issue was canvassed wherein the conviction of the accused person was
                    challenged on the basis that his co-conspirator had been acquitted. The
                    appellant argued that at least two persons must be proved to be guilty of the
                    same criminal conspiracy before anyone could be convicted of the same. The
                    argument that “if A and B alone were indicted together and ‘tried
                    together’ for conspiracy ... that ‘both must be convicted or both
                    must be acquitted’” was considered by their Lordships at 722. The
                    court opined as follows at 745 and 754:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So the question arises whether if A and B (but no others) are charged with
                        conspiracy and if A, with full intention, pleads guilty and if B pleads not
                        guilty and if B’s trial is postponed, but, taking place at some
                        subsequent time, results in his acquittal, the law requires the conviction
                        of A (on his own confession) must be set aside. If it must, the law will be
                        producing a strange result. No one could know better than A whether he did
                        or did not agree with B to do something wrongful and if, fully understanding
                        what he was doing, and having skilled advice to guide or assist him, he
                        acknowledged by way of confession to the court that he had so agreed, the
                        law might seem to be artificial and contrariwise which required that because
                        the charge against B failed A must be held to be not guilty when he himself
                        knew and had admitted that he was guilty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]here there is a charge of conspiracy against A and B (the
                        charge not alleging any conspiracy with anyone else) and where A is first
                        separately tried and pleads or is found guilty and where B is later
                        separately tried and acquitted, <em>such acquittal does not
                            of itself warrant setting aside the conviction of A</em>
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Thus the point is that where sufficient
                    evidence can be adduced to prove the underlying agreement between the
                    co-conspirators beyond a reasonable doubt, the outcome <em>per
                        se</em> of the proceedings of a co-conspirator, or the death or
                    disappearance of the co-conspirator is not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> a reason to set aside the conviction or amend the charge
                    preferred against the other co-conspirator. In the present case, the Public
                    Prosecutor’s decision to prefer charges against Quek and Winai involving
                    different quantities of the seized drugs does not undermine the fact that there
                    was a conspiracy between them to traffic in the total seized quantity. The
                    situation that results is in fact not dissimilar from the situation where a
                    co-conspirator has either been acquitted or has disappeared. It bears
                    emphasising that the evidence adduced establishing the underlying agreement
                    between the respective co-conspirators remains undisturbed. Indeed, in contrast
                    to a situation involving the acquittal of a co-conspirator, both Quek and Winai
                    were in fact convicted in the present case; the difference in punishments
                    arising solely from the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, a discretion
                    accorded to the Public Prosecutor under the Constitution. Furthermore, we also
                    think that Winai’s separate charge for possession of <em>not less</em> than 14.99 g of diamorphine in furtherance of a
                    criminal conspiracy with Somchit and Quek to traffic in the stated quantity of
                    the seized drugs, is not, on a plain reading, incongruous with the amended
                    charge on which Quek was convicted as “not less than 14.99 g”
                    could include 62.14 g. We would reiterate that in Winai’s SOF upon which
                    he was convicted on the reduced quantity, the <em>full
                        weight</em> of the seized drugs discovered was clearly
                stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Since this Court is not confronted with the
                    slightly different scenario whereby Winai lacked the requisite knowledge of the
                    full quantity of the seized drugs forming the basis of the criminal conspiracy
                    alleged, whether the answer to the question of congruity in that scenario might
                    be different is a question on which there is no necessity for us to offer a
                    concluded view. There is however authority for the proposition that it is not
                    necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every detail of the
                    conspiracy as long as they are co-participators in the main object of the
                    conspiracy – see <em>Yash Pal Mittal v State of
                        Punjab</em> (1977) 4 SCC 540 at [9] and <em>Nomura Taiji </em><em>and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 259 at
                    [110]. The question which must follow and remains unanswered is (a) whether
                    knowledge of the precise <em>quantity</em> of the
                    controlled drugs specified in the charges preferred against co-conspirators can
                    be characterised as a mere <em>detail</em> as outlined by
                    the case law cited above or (b) whether it should more rightly be viewed as an
                    integral <em>element of the underlying agreement</em> as
                    part of the main object of the criminal conspiracy. While on the first
                    proposition, (a), the quantity <em>per se</em> is not a
                    factor which each co-conspirator need be alive to, on the second proposition,
                    (b), the Public Prosecutor’s ability to establish the individual’s
                    actual knowledge of the specific quantity of the controlled drugs in the
                    preferred charge will directly impact the fundamental enquiry before the court
                    as to whether criminal conspiracy has been made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the present facts, in light of this
                    Court’s finding on the knowledge of Quek and Winai of the total quantity
                    of the seized drugs, these questions did not arise. In passing, we would venture
                    to think that there is much to be said in favour of the first proposition. This
                    is perhaps best illustrated by an example. Say A and B agreed to bring 14 g of
                    diamorphine into Singapore. Unknown to B, and motivated by greed, A changed his
                    mind and brought in double the quantity. It would be curious to say that in
                    those circumstances, just because of the change in quantum of drug brought in,
                    that there was no conspiracy by them to bring in the drug illegally. Quite
                    clearly, there was a conspiracy by A and B to commit an illegal act (<em>i.e.</em> to import 14 g of the drug) although B cannot be
                    said to have conspired with A to import the larger quantity of the drug. On the
                    other hand, if A and B had agreed to import the drug illegally without
                    discussion as to the quantity, both could be charged with conspiracy to import
                    the quantity of the drug actually brought in by either of them. Ultimately, what
                    conspiracy charge(s) could be brought against co-conspirators must be dictated
                    by the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Accordingly, we hold that there is nothing
                    irregular in Quek being convicted on the amended charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     For the reasons stated above, Quek’s
                    appeal is dismissed.</p>
