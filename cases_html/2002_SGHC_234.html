<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        These actions arise out of the breakdown of the

marriage between Michael David Selby ("Selby"), the Plaintiff in Suit

No.1349/2001 and beneficial owner of the three Plaintiffs in Suit No.1200/2001, and

Bettina Chew Lai Yoke ("Chew"), the Defendant in both Suits. They were married

in October 1989; it was his second marriage and her first. They have a daughter aged 11

and a son aged 6. Selby has two daughters from his first marriage, aged 20 and 18. The

matrimonial home at the material time was at 6 Coronation Road West.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        Like most marriages, it began on a promising

note. Selby is a Jew and Chew converted to Judaism in order that their children would

become Jews. And within a few years the children came. Over the duration of the marriage

the family accumulated enough assets to keep them comfortable for the rest of their lives.

However from 1999, Selby and Chew were feeling the strain of their marriage. Matters came

to a head late in the evening of 14 May 2001 and they agreed to divorce. Thereafter events

moved at a remarkable pace. On 15 May both of them consulted their solicitors and from

then on they were acting with the benefit of legal advice. Selby instructed M/s David

Chong and Co ("DCC") and Chew instructed M/s Harry Elias and Partners

("HEP"). Through their solicitors, Selby and Chew negotiated and executed a

"Deed of Separation and Financial Arrangement in Contemplation of Divorce"

("the Deed") dated 24 May 2001. This is a settlement of all issues as regards

matrimonial property and custody of the children. They filed for divorce in Divorce

Petition No.601787 of 2001 and a Decree Nisi was granted on 15 June 2001. It was made

absolute on 23 October 2001. The Deed was approved by the Court at the hearing of the

Decree Nisi and was incorporated in the resulting Order of Court.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        The annexure referred to in paragraph 17(J)

(hereafter "the Annexure") contains a wide-ranging list of items such as wine,

guitars, art objects, documents and personal belongings. Selby made arrangements for his

belongings to be transported from the matrimonial home to Bangkok, where his business

activities had taken him at the time. He engaged movers for the task and on 25 May 2001,

one of them went to the matrimonial home to survey the items to be moved. On three days,

from 2 to 4 July, the movers attended at the matrimonial home to pack and cart away

Selby’s belongings. However Selby claimed that upon unpacking the boxes in Bangkok

certain items were missing. He also claimed that some items belonging to him were already

missing before the movers completed their task. In Suit No 1349 of 2001, Selby claims the

following from Chew:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) 1952 Gibson J50 Guitar;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) Telescope;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) 2 Macaws;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv) 3 Sapphires gemstones;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(v) 2 Khmer sculptures;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(vi) Han Dynasty Bronze Horse and

    Cart;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(vii) 5 pre-Han Dynasty Bronze

    Bells;</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(viii) All invoices, documents

    and photographs taken on the art objects and sculptures belonging to the Plaintiff. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        There are two further claims in that action.

The first is for reimbursement of the sum of $19,028.11 that Chew incurred on her

supplementary American Express ("Amex") charge card and which Selby had paid.

The expenses were incurred over the period 24 May to 15 June 2001, in respect of which

Selby had paid to Chew an interim maintenance of $38,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The second is for an account of the bottles of

wine retained by Chew from Selby’s wine collection. They had agreed to share the wine

collection in the ratio of 3 to 1. Although he received more or less the correct number of

bottles, Selby claimed that the wines retained by Chew were of a far higher quality than

the ones he obtained and therefore the distribution was not in accordance with their

agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        In Suit No 1200 of 2001, the three Plaintiffs

are BVI companies ("the Companies") owned and controlled by Selby. Their claim

against Chew is for the return of what they describe as their "company kits",

viz. the company seal, the certificate of incorporation and original Memorandum and

Articles of Association and the company records. In addition the three companies claim

from Chew all banking and financial documents and files of correspondence. Selby claimed

that these items were in the matrimonial home and that Chew had kept them from him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        I should highlight at the outset an important

aspect of this case to put the matter in its proper perspective. The principal asset in

the Deed is a sum of slightly over US$60 million in cash, securities and other investment

instruments sitting in two bank accounts of two of the Companies. The Deed provides that

Selby and Chew should divide this equally, which means that they would get slightly over

US$30 million each. In addition there was a division of various other assets. Hence the

matrimonial home, which sits on 25,000 square feet of land along Coronation Road West, and

a flat in London went to Chew. Selby got a condominium in Bangkok as well as control and

all shares of a number of private companies. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        The present dispute does not concern these

"big-ticket" items, but comparatively minor items, although some of them are

allegedly of considerable sentimental value. According to the Statement of Claim in Suit

No 1349/2001, the total value of the items claimed there is US$422,500. Although this is a

large sum by normal standards, it is dwarfed by the value of the matrimonial assets that

Selby and Chew have divided up among themselves. Chew claims that Selby initiated these

actions to harass her because of bitterness on his part, and the supposition that she had

obtained a good deal in the division of assets. Selby on the other hand claims that Chew

was an embittered woman who, in her rage and fury, had gone out of the way to deny Selby

certain items that were of great sentimental value to him, as well as to inconvenience

him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        In the wake of these allegations, it is not

surprising that the evidence of the protagonists were at polar extremes in important

areas. And that a substantial portion of the trial was devoted to issues of credibility.

In the course of the trial, I have had the opportunity not only to listen to the two

protagonists and evaluate the consistency of their answers, but also to observe their

demeanour in the witness box. At the end of it, I came to the conclusion that neither of

them had been completely frank and truthful in their evidence. This is hardly surprising

as many people who are caught up in such a situation would be moved to massage the truth

to embellish their case. Having said that, I would add that I am driven to conclude that

Chew’s evidence has been most unreliable. Counsel for the Plaintiffs has set out a

long list of contradictions in her evidence. I do not intend to go into it in detail. I

shall be content to state that, although I do not agree with every item in that list,

there is a sufficient number of clear contradictions in her evidence as would lead me to

the conclusion that it is not safe to believe her evidence on the substantial issues of

fact.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        Nevertheless, and particularly in view of my

finding that Selby has also been prone to exaggeration in some areas, it is not sufficient

for me to simply say, as his counsel urges me to do, that therefore he has been telling

the truth in all the matters and she has not. It is necessary for the Plaintiffs to

overcome the burden of proof that rests on them as claimants. Where the evidence hinges on

the words of the parties, I have preferred Selby’s to Chew’s in view of the

finding that I have made in respect of their relative credibility. However in respect of

any item claimed it is possible for both parties to be correct in that neither has that

item and it is simply lost due to the act of a third party. If there is evidence that the

loss could be due to this possibility, it would be incumbent upon Selby to produce

evidence to discount it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        I turn now to examine the specific items

claimed. It would be convenient to group them into five categories as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) admitted items;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) items not specifically

    listed in the Annexure;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) the Amex card charges;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv) the wine; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(v) the company kits.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i)    Admitted

items</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        The items in this category are the (a) Gibson

Guitar; (b) two Khmer Statues; and (c) invoices, documents and photographs of the art

objects and sculptures ("the Art Documents"). Chew does not dispute Selby’s

right to these items; her position is simply that she does not have them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        The Gibson Guitar and two Khmer Statues were

supposed to have been moved by Helu-Trans, the movers engaged by Selby, from 2 to 4 July

2001. The evidence shows that there was general pandemonium at the matrimonial home during

that period. But it was also compounded by the strained relationship between the parties.

There is also evidence that Chew made matters difficult for the movers by not permitting

them to photograph the art objects beforehand. However there is evidence that one of the

two Khmer Statues, a stone Ganesh, was packed by the movers and shipped to Bangkok.

Selby’s collection of more than 30 guitars was also mostly moved out that day. And

there is evidence that prior to 2 July Selby had taken away one or more guitars. On the

basis of all the evidence before me I am not satisfied that Selby has discharged the

burden of proving that Chew has converted the Gibson Guitar and the two Khmer Statues.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        The Art Documents are invoices, receipts,

photographs, a catalogue book, written appraisals and test certificates relating to those

art objects and sculptures that Selby would be entitled to under the Annexure. Selby said

that a folio file that contained the Art Documents was kept in the Matrimonial Home. He

said that from 14 May 2001 he had no idea where the file was as Chew had removed all their

files or locked them up. Selby explained that the records were necessary for insurance

purposes and to provide him with a complete record of every art piece in his collection. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        On 22 June 2001, nine days before the movers

went in, Selby’s solicitors, DCC, wrote to HEP to ask for the Art Documents. HEP

replied on 25 June to say that they would be made available for Selby’s collection.

Then in a letter from DCC to HEP dated 3 July 2001, the second day of the moving

operation, the following statements are made:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In your fax of 25 June 2001

    … you said that the said documents could be collected at your office. When we went to

    your office on 29 June 2001, we were told that the documents were not at your office but

    that the same would be handed over to our clients personally when he went over to your

    clients’ premises to supervise the movers on 2 July 2001. Our client went down at the

    said premises yesterday but the said documents were not handed to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The said documents are important

    to our client in that the same would enable him to verify every piece of art sculpture (as

    the said documents would include the relevant certificates and photographs) that are now

    being packed and moved.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We hereby demand the immediate

    surrender of the said documents to us as solicitors within the next twenty-four (24)

    hours.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We need not tell you that the

    said art sculptures are extremely valuable and rare. Our client will hold your client

    wholly liable for any loss and damage suffered by him by the delay or your client’s

    refusal to surrender the same immediately.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        On 3 July 2001 Chew handed to one of the movers

a bundle of documents comprising some 20 pages. Selby confirmed that this was a part of

the Art Documents but claimed that there were many more documents. He said that the

documents handed over did not include a single photograph of the Khmer sculptures which

formed a large part of his collection.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        On 6 July 2001 DCC wrote to HEP to state that

the documents handed over were incomplete and demanded the complete set to be handed over

by Chew. HEP replied on 10 July to say that there were no pictures or invoices of the

Khmer sculptures. On 12 July DCC replied to reiterate their position that Chew was in

possession of the remaining documents.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        Chew gave evidence that she did not have the

Art Documents. She said that as far as she was aware, Selby had removed all his personal

belongings including his documents and files from the matrimonial home. She recalled that

Selby had returned to the matrimonial home on one occasion on 29 May 2001 specifically to

collect his files and other documents. However in the next breath, she said that she had

handed over a file containing some documents and photographs to the movers. Selby pointed

out that if Chew could produce part of the Art Documents, it confirmed that she had the

complete set of documents in her possession.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        On a consideration of the evidence in its

entirety, I find that Chew had retained the Art Documents.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii)    Items not

in Annexure</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        The items in this category are the (a) Han

Dynasty Bronze Horse and Cart and five Pre-Han Dynasty Bronze Bells (collectively,

"the Bronzes"); (b) telescope; (c) Hyacinth Macaw; and (d) three Sapphire

gemstones ("the Gemstones").</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        Selby claimed that the Bronzes were purchased

by him personally and were at all times kept in the matrimonial home. Chew’s version

is rather inconsistent. DCC first demanded for the Bronzes in their letter to HEP of 19

July 2001. HEP’s reply of 20 July asserts that they were not specified in the

Annexure nor were they "personal assets" within item 55 of the Annexure which

covers <i>"clothes, shoes, socks, cufflinks, toiletries, watches, computers …,

novels (fiction)"</i>. HEP said that they would take instruction from Chew as to

whether she was prepared to let Selby have them. Those instructions were eventually taken

and HEP wrote on 17 August to inform DCC that Chew was not prepared to do so. There

matters remained until the suits were filed. It was then that Chew revealed in her Defence

that the Bronzes were the assets of Sablowsky and Tang, a partnership dealing in antiques

owned by Chew and one Tang Kok Foo.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        I would have gone into the details of

Chew’s evidence in relation to the ownership of the Bronzes had it been necessary to

do so. It is not for the reason set out in the following paragraph, but I cannot leave

this aspect without commenting that I am not satisfied with the inconsistency of the

evidence given by her. If the Bronzes were not matrimonial assets but owned by Sablowsky

and Tang, it is puzzling that she did not mention it at the outset. This parsimonious

attitude towards revelation of the true picture has been displayed at other times as well

and is one of the factors that led me to conclude that her evidence is unreliable.

Selby’s counsel had also pointed out that Sablowsky and Tang’s accounts did not

count the Bronzes among their inventory, although Chew gave an explanation which I need

not go into.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        The claim for the Bronzes can easily be settled

because of the simple fact that they were not included in the Annexure. On Selby’s

case, they were purchased during the marriage and kept in the matrimonial home. The

Annexure gives a rather detailed list of what art objects he was entitled to under the

Deed. Therefore it was clearly within the contemplation of the agreement embodied in the

Deed that the Bronzes would not go to him. In the premises, I find that Selby is not

entitled to the Bronzes.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        Chew’s counsel submitted that the

remaining items, viz. the (b) telescope; (c) Hyacinth Macaw; and (d) three gem stones

should also be determined in like manner. As they were not listed in the Annexure, Selby

is not entitled to them. The issue turns on the construction of paragraph 17(J) of the

Deed which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Husband agrees to only remove

    all his personal belongings, such art collection and moveable property <u>as described in

    the annexure</u> hereto by 31 July 2001.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The issue is whether the words

"as described in the annexure" qualifies "personal belongings". In my

view the word "such" before "art collection and moveable property"

delinks "personal belongings" from "as described in the annexure".

This would mean that Selby is entitled to remove all of his personal belongings (not

otherwise excepted by the remaining terms of the Deed, such as objects of art) from the

matrimonial home by 31 July 2001. It would also mean that he would not be entitled to any

personal belonging not removed by that date, save those that he was prevented from

removing by Chew. I turn to examine whether the three remaining items are Selby's personal

belongings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        In respect of the telescope, Selby said that he

had purchased it for himself from the Singapore Science Centre. Selby had initially

wrongly described the telescope but I find that it was a genuine error given the torrent

of events in that period. Chew claimed that Selby had purchased it for use of the family

and that their children had made use of it. Selby pointed out that apart from the fact

that it is a large and heavy instrument, it is also a sophisticated telescope with a motor

that compensated for the rotation of the earth to keep the telescope pointed at fixed

position in the sky. He pointed out that at the time of its purchase, the children were

aged five and two years and would not have been able to operate nor appreciate this type

of telescope. I accept Selby's evidence and find that the telescope is part of his

personal belongings. As he had demanded it on 5 July 2001 and Chew had refused to return

it to him, I find that Selby is entitled to possession of the telescope.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        I turn to the Macaw. The original claim was for

two Macaws but in the course of the trial, at my suggestion Chew agreed to return one of

them, a Military Macaw, without prejudice to her position. Selby accepted it, also without

prejudice to his position. The claim therefore becomes that of the remaining Macaw, a

Hyacinth. Selby had given evidence that he had purchased them from a bird shop in the

United States and had imported them to Singapore. They were juvenile birds at the time and

he had raised and trained them. Chew claimed that she had bought the birds from a bird

shop in Singapore and that they were family pets. As they were not covered by the

Annexure, Selby was not entitled to them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        I should point out that this is another

instance of Chew’s inconsistent positions. On 2 July 2001, when he went to the

matrimonial home to direct the movers, Selby discovered the Macaws missing from their

cages. On 5 July 2001 DCC wrote to HEP to inquire as to their whereabouts in the following

manner:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 2 macaws were missing from

    their cages and our client demands to know what your client did to the birds. We are

    instructed that the value of the 2 macaws is about US$20,000 and one of which is extremely

    rare. Our client’s rights in this regard are also reserved.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In their reply, HEP said as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please note that the macaws and

    the other birds, dogs and hamsters are all family pets and are not in the list and neither

    are they your client’s personal belongings. For your client’s information, the

    birds do not cost USD20,000 each. This could be the reason your client did not include the

    birds in the [Annexure] in the first place.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By letter dated 9 July 2001 DCC

repeated the request to know what Chew had done to the Macaws but the reply from HEP on 10

July evaded the question by repeating that they were matrimonial assets not in the list

and therefore there was no need to reply to the query. The request was repeated on 12 July

with DCC asking specifically what Chew had done to the birds. There was no further

response from HEP on this issue.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        In her affidavit evidence in chief, Chew had

said as follows at paragraphs 29 and 30:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29. The 2 Macaws are the pets of

    the family. They have been with the family for about 6 to 7 years now. They did not belong

    to the Plaintiff. As such, the Plaintiff is not entitled to the 2 Macaws. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30. The 2 Macaws were not listed

    in the [Annexure] and were not removed from the matrimonial home by the Plaintiff.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In those paragraphs, Chew states

her position that the Macaws are family pets and have been for the past six or seven

years. The clear implication is that she still has the birds and intend to retain them and

therefore Selby ought not to have them. In the course of the trial, her counsel revealed

that she had given the birds away to a friend. Chew sought to correct her affidavit by

changing the tense of paragraph 29, but this was only done after the revelation that the

Macaws had been given away. In cross-examination, she admitted that the Macaws were given

away sometime between 15 June 2001, when the Decree Nisi was granted, and 2 July. It

turned out that the friend she had given the birds to, Chua Ka Soon, was also a pet shop

owner who sold birds. She had managed to get back the Military Macaw from Chua but was

unable to do so in respect of the Hyacinth Macaw.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        On the evidence before me I have no hesitation

in holding that the Hyacinth Macaw is part of Selby’s personal belongings to which he

is entitled and that Chew had converted it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        In respect of the Gemstones, DCC first asserted

Selby’s claim to them by letter dated 22 June 2001. That letter stated as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We are instructed that the

    following gem stones were kept in a safe in your client’s premises:-</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">a) A 4-carat Cabachon Sapphire

    which was purchased in 1980. The gem stone was set in a men’s ring. Approximate value

    is about US$20,000.00;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">b) A 4-carat Sri Lanka Sapphire

    which our client received as a gift in 1985. This too was set in a men’s ring and is

    approximately valued at US$45,000.00; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">c) A Kashmiri Cabachon Sapphire

    (comes with a Gueblin Certificate) which our client bought in 1986. Approximate value

    US$30,000.00.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Your client will no doubt make

    the above items available for our client’s collection.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32

        HEP replied on 25 June to say that the

Gemstones belonged to Chew because Selby had given them to her during the marriage as he

did not want them. On 5 July 2001 Chew asserted, through a letter from HEP, that the

Kashmiri Sapphire was purchased after their marriage. This position was reaffirmed in

HEP’s letter of 10 July in which it was claimed that the Gemstones were <i>"matrimonial

assets purchased during the marriage"</i>. However in her affidavit evidence in

chief, Chew said that the Kashmiri Sapphire was given to her by Selby as a wedding gift.

Additionally this assertion does not accord with the fact that it is an unset stone, a

rather odd wedding gift to give. It should be noted that there were other jewellery that

Selby had given to Chew as wedding gifts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33

        As for the other two sapphires, Chew denied

that they were men’s settings in her affidavit evidence in chief and asserted that

they were originally set in ladies’ rings. Yet in a letter from HEP dated 5 July

2001, she had asserted that they were "re-set" as lady’s rings. Paragraph 8

of that letter states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Gem stones (2 blue sapphires)

    given to our client in the early days of the marriage were re-set for our clients as

    lady’s rings. Your client is fully aware of this fact.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34

        To support her case, Chew produced two invoices

from Gee Wee Jewellery in respect of the setting of the rings, which are dated 8 September

1994 and 17 February 1996. It was pointed out to her in cross-examination that the

invoices were inherently suspicious because they use the 6 digit postal code which were

only introduced after the invoice dates. In re-examination Chew explained that she had

asked Gee Wee Jewellery in early 2002 for copies of her receipts and those were what they

had given her. She had, of course omitted to disclose this fact in her evidence up to that

point and only chose to do so after the discrepancy about the postal code was pointed out.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        From totality of the evidence, I believe

Selby’s case concerning the Gemstones, that they had been purchased by him before the

marriage and that they remained his personal belongings.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii)    Amex Card</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        In paragraph 19 of the Deed, Chew agreed that

Selby could terminate all her credit cards and charge cards that are supplementary to his

cards upon approval of the Deed by the Court. It provides as follows: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Husband shall terminate all

    supplementary credit or charge cards taken out by him for the benefit of the Wife upon the

    approval of this Deed by the Court.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">However the Deed is silent on the

extent to which Chew was entitled to use her supplementary cards during this period.

Indeed on 16 May 2001, while the terms of the Deed were being negotiated, Selby instructed

Amex to terminate Chew’s supplementary card. However on 17 May he reinstated it. It

should be recalled that the Deed was signed shortly thereafter, and dated 24 May 2001. It

falls to be considered as to what is the agreement between the parties as to this

provision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37

        As it would be patently absurd to suggest that

they had agreed that Chew could expend any amount she wished, it is a necessary

implication of paragraph 19 of the Deed that the card may only be used for the family and

her ordinary personal expenses until reasonable provision could be made in relation to her

maintenance. On 24 May 2001, Selby paid to Chew a sum of $38,000 pursuant to an agreement

reached on 23 May, as an interim arrangement until the Court’s approval of the Deed.

Although this agreement was reached in consideration of Chew consenting to release a

certain sum of money residing in the bank account of a company called Adavale Management

Limited, it is clear in the context that it is related to interim maintenance rather than

some sort of ransom for the release of those funds as Chew’s counsel appears to

suggest.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        I therefore hold that it was an implied term of

the agreement to pay interim maintenance that Chew would reimburse Selby in respect of the

expenses incurred on her supplementary Amex card after 24 May 2001. Accordingly she is

liable to reimburse Selby for the sum of $19,028.11 incurred by her between 24 May and 15

June 2001.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv)    Wine</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39

        Selby claimed that Chew directed the movers to

take all the wine that were stored in the guest bungalow. He said that those were the

cheaper wine as he had kept the bottles meant for long-term storage at that location.

Selby said that the more expensive wine were kept in the main house. Chew had no interest

in wine and it was Selby who purchased and built up the wine collection. On my view of the

relative credibility of the protagonists, and taking into consideration Selby’s

evidence that there is a considerable variation in the value of the wine in his

collection, I find that the agreement was for division in the ratio of 3 to 1 by value

rather than random bottles. Therefore there should be an account rendered by Chew on the

bottles of wine retained by her.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40

        For completeness I make the following

subsidiary findings of fact. I find that Selby did receive 614 bottles. I find also that

the wine that he consumed with his friends during the latter half of May and early June

2001 were white wine that came from the fridge in the kitchen and not from the wine

collection.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(<b>v)    Company

Kits</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41

        Selby had purchased the Companies as shelf

companies for the purpose of holding the substantial assets he had acquired over the

years. Chew was the sole director of the Companies at all material times. Selby gave

evidence that they used the matrimonial home as the mailing address of the Companies and

all correspondence to the Companies, including the bank statements, were sent there. He

said that these documents, together with all other company records, namely, registers,

articles of association and memorandum and company seals were kept in the study room in

the main house in Chew’s sole custody. He claimed that Chew kept them in a locked

desk drawer to which only she had the key.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42

        Chew denied that she has the company kits. She

claimed that Selby must have removed them from the matrimonial home as he had access to

the home and the documents at the material time and was in fact moving out many of his

documents well before the movers came in early July 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43

        Selby deposed to a number of factors which

indicate that Chew had the documents she now disclaims. Some of the more significant ones

are as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) At the time of the

    negotiations of the terms of the Deed, between 16 and 24 May 2001, Chew was able to

    produce the bank statements of Whitham Enterprises Ltd and Silver Falcon Ltd for

    Selby’s inspection. This is embodied in paragraph 17(D) of the Deed which reads: <i>"The

    latest bank statement of April 2001 which has been inspected by both parties shall be

    accepted as conclusive evidence of the amount in Accounts no. 685371 and 685370

    …"</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) Chew filed an affidavit on

    18 September 2001 in connection with the divorce petition in which she exhibited copies of

    the United States tax returns from 1995 to 1998 of Hillfield International Ltd, the first

    Plaintiff in Suit No 1200 of 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) Immediately prior to the

    transfer of Chew’s share of the US$60 million under paragraph 17(C) of the Deed, DCC

    wrote to the HEP on 15 June 2001 to request for the up-dated bank statement. At that time,

    the Defendant had obtained or would soon obtain up-dated bank statements that would show

    the amount of interest earned since 24 May, which was expected to be a fairly substantial

    sum. Chew however did not furnish the bank statements. HEP wrote to DCC on 18 and 19 June

    2001 giving a precise breakdown of interest and the monies and other deposits in the

    accounts, showing that Chew had in her possession, the bank statements of the Companies. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44

        Counsel for Selby also highlighted several

additional factors pointing to Chew having possession of the company kits:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) Chew was able to produce in

    her September 2001 affirmation various documents relating to the transfer of monies from

    Whitham to pay for renovations at the Bangkok condominium;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) There were many transfers of

    monies from the Companies’ accounts to Chew’s own account and this indicates

    that she had a motive in withholding the companies’ documents.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) On 26 April 2001, Chew

    instructed Citibank to retain all statements in respect of the Companies’ accounts so

    that they would not be sent to the matrimonial home as would ordinarily have been done.

    She gave this rather doubtful reason for making that instruction:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After I---I signed the

    Hold-All-Mail Agreement because at that time, I had received three phone calls from Thai

    women to my house, disturbing my children’s life, disturbing my life. By that time,

    my husband was always in Bangkok on the weekend. And after the calls that came to the

    house, after I questioned and asked for the local mobile phone, after he switched to a

    Thai local phone so that Pauline Han would not be able to give me phone bills. After all

    that, I put in the Hold-Mail on the 26th April of 2001. I removed the power of attorney on

    the day that he walked out and I believe that would be May 10th.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45

        I am satisfied on a consideration of all the

evidence before me that Chew had converted the company kits.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Orders</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46

        Following from the findings made above, I make

the following orders:</font></p>

    exceed 25% of the value of the entire wine collection, she shall deliver up wine in excess

    of this value or, at her option, pay a sum equivalent to such excess value. The valuation

    shall be made by a valuer to be agreed between the parties, failing which there shall be

    an inquiry before the Registrar.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(5) There shall be judgment for

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47

        In crafting the above orders, I have

endeavoured to minimise future clashes in court as this will be detrimental to the

children of the protagonists. On the question of costs, I am of the view that the primary

consideration should be the children in view of the fact that both Selby and Chew have

enough money to take their quarrels to the courts for a long time to come. This will

aggravate the emotional harm already inflicted upon their children and I have no wish to

see that happen, nor pander to any inclination on the part of either of them to resort to

the legal process unnecessarily. Accordingly the most appropriate order for costs to make

in this case would be to order that all parties in these consolidated actions bear their

own costs.</font></p>
