        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The main issue in this action was whether the
                    defendant, by its letter of 11 February 2009 to the plaintiff, repudiated
                    its contracts with the plaintiff. I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and
                    allowed the defendant’s counter-claim for wrongful
                termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is Trust Development Pte Ltd
                    (“Trust”). Lau Wee Leng (“Lau”) and Voon Wui Leong
                    (“Voon”) are directors of Trust. The defendant is Orientus Country
                    Club &amp; Resorts Pte Ltd (“Orientus”), who was the tenant of
                    No 1021 Mornington Crescent Seletar East Camp where a recreational
                    clubhouse and resort was erected. The clubhouse and resort comprised of
                    pre-existing overnight resort room facilities (the “Old Resort
                    Rooms”) and 25 overnight resort room facilities constructed by Orientus
                    around the second half of 2007 (the “New Resort Rooms”). Jay Wong
                    (“Wong”) is the Chairman of Orientus. On 29 June 2007, the
                    parties agreed that Trust would pay Orientus $360,000 (of which Trust has paid
                    $330,000) for the exclusive rights to manage the New Resort Rooms from
                    1 August 2007 to 30 June 2011. In addition, Trust agreed to pay
                    Orientus $14,000 monthly for room services such as breakfast, room cleaning,
                    laundry services, as well as additional utility charges. On 18 April 2008,
                    the monthly payment was varied by a separate agreement to $16,000 with effect
                    from 1 April 2008. The $16,000 covered both room services and utility
                    charges. The two agreements will be collectively referred to as “the
                    management agreements”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 21 April 2008, the parties agreed that
                    in consideration of Trust paying to Orientus $30,000, Orientus agreed to reserve
                    not less than 20 Old Resort Rooms per night for Trust’s exclusive use (the
                    “first booking agreement”). Pursuant to this agreement, Trust
                    would pay $60 for the use of each old Resort Room per night. The $60 charge
                    included the provision of breakfast for two persons and was to be deducted from
                    the $30,000 paid. On 12 August 2008, the parties further agreed that in
                    consideration of Trust paying to Orientus $12,000, Orientus agreed to reserve
                    not less than 20 Old Resort Rooms per night for Trust’s exclusive use (the
                    “second booking agreement”). Pursuant to the agreement, Trust
                    would pay $60 (except for bookings made for the period 3 to 9 September
                    2008) for the use of each Resort Room per night. Unlike the first booking
                    agreement, the $60 charge here did not cover breakfast. The $60 charges were to
                    be deducted from the $12,000 upon full utilization of the $30,000 previously
                    paid under the first booking agreement. In the second booking agreement, Trust
                    also agreed to extend a loan of $30,000 to Orientus (“the friendly
                    loan”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Around 6 January 2009, Trust paid a sum of
                    $5,500 to Orientus. Around 7 January 2009, Repos Holiday, a subsidiary of
                    Trust, issued a cheque for $5,500 to Orientus. Around 15 January 2009,
                    Repos Holiday issued another cheque for $5,500 to Orientus. On 5 February
                    2009, there was a payment of $2,732 from Trust to Orientus. Trust issued a
                    payment voucher to Orientus, and this was acknowledged by Orientus. The payment
                    voucher stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">On 19 February 2009, Trust regarded this as a repudiation of
                    contract and wrote to Orientus informing them of Trust’s acceptance of
                    Orientus’ purported repudiation of the management and booking agreements.
                    Following this, Trust brought this action against Orientus for wrongful
                    repudiation of the management and booking agreements. Orientus denied the claim
                    and counter-claimed for damages caused by Trust’s breach of
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Orientus claimed that its letter dated
                    11 February 2009 was intended to reflect two oral agreements made by the
                    parties to vary the management agreements, and not to repudiate the contracts.
                    Orientus alleged that the first oral agreement was made sometime in December
                    2008, when Voon, Lau and Wong had agreed on behalf of the parties to reduce the
                    monthly payment payable to Orientus under the management agreements to $5,500
                    with effect from 1 January 2009. Under this new agreement, the monthly
                    payment would cover the provision of utilities to the New Resort Rooms and usage
                    of the swimming pool but not room services. Trust therefore paid Orientus $5,500
                    on three occasions (around 6, 7 and 15 January 2009), representing two
                    months deposit and 1 month advance for January 2009. Wong claimed that he
                    hand-delivered an undated letter to Voon to confirm this arrangement (Trust
                    however, denied receipt of this letter). As for the second oral agreement,
                    Orientus alleged that this was made around end January 2009 when Voon requested
                    that the monthly payment be reduced to $5,000. Therefore, around 5 February
                    2009, Trust paid Orientus $2,732 i.e. $5,000 for February 2009 less breakfast
                    charges (which Trust had previously paid for on Orientus’ behalf in
                    October 2008) and other charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Trust agreed that there was an oral agreement to
                    reduce the monthly payment under the management agreements from $16,000 to
                    $5,500, but claimed that this was a temporary agreement made pursuant to
                    Orientus’ request and not intended to vary the management agreements
                    permanently. As part of this temporary arrangement, Trust paid $5,500 Orientus
                    around 6 January 2009. Trust denied the subsequent two payments of $5,500
                    (around 7 and 15 January 2009) were intended to be two months’
                    deposit. Instead, it claimed that the two payments were a personal loan from Lau
                    to Orientus, and Lau and Orientus agreed that Orientus would repay the loan by
                    monthly instalments of $500, which would be subtracted directly from the $5,500
                    monthly payment made by Trust, and paid directly to Lau. Trust also denied that
                    there was a second oral agreement. According to Trust, the February payment
                    comprised of $5,500 (monthly fee), less $500 (repayment of the loan) and less
                    breakfast and other charges. Hence, there was no intention to vary the
                    management or booking agreements, and therefore, by the 11 February 2009
                    letter, Orientus repudiated the contracts wrongfully.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I found that in the 11 February 2009
                    letter, Orientus was referring to the management and not booking agreements.
                    Orientus stated that it would “not be managing your rooms or providing
                    any services to [Trust’s] guests staying in your rooms.” By
                    “your rooms”, I was of the opinion that Orientus was referring to
                    the New, and not Old Resort Rooms. This was because, firstly, Trust had
                    ‘sole and exclusive right to manage’ and ‘quiet and
                    uninterrupted use’ of the New Resort Rooms but had to book the Old Resort
                    Rooms. Thus, while it was logical to view the New Resort Rooms as Trust’s
                    rooms, the same cannot be said of the Old Resort Rooms. Secondly, as argued by
                    Orientus, the provision for Trust to pay $5,000 for utilities was illogical in
                    the context of the Old Resort Rooms since payment was made on a per room basis.
                    Thirdly, although Trust argued that Orientus could not be referring to the New
                    Resort Rooms in clause (b) of the letter because Orientus never
                    ‘managed’ the rooms to begin with (as Trust had the sole and
                    exclusive right to manage those rooms), in my view, clause (b) was intended to
                    clarify that Orientus would not be providing any services for the
                rooms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I also found that there was a permanent
                    agreement to vary the monthly payment from $16,000 to $5,500. In doing so, I
                    accepted Wong’s evidence that there was an undated letter from Orientus to
                    Trust reflecting this arrangement. I am of the view that Wong was the more
                    credible witness compared to Trust’s witnesses. Although Lau denied
                    receiving this letter, I noted that this was not the first undated letter that
                    Trust has received and that Orientus also did not require Trust to acknowledge
                    receipt of previous letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I also accepted Orientus’ evidence that
                    the two payments around 7 and 15 January were not a personal loan from Lau,
                    but two months deposit made by Trust to Orientus. Trust relied on the fact that
                    whereas the 6 January payment which was paid out of Trust’s account,
                    the 7 and 15 January payments were paid out of Repos Holiday’s bank
                    account as evidence that the payment was not made by Trust, but a personal loan
                    from Lau. However, firstly, I noted that that Repos Holidays is owned entirely
                    by Trust Development, and Voon and Lau were the only two directors of the
                    company. When asked by counsel for Orientus why the cheques were issued by
                    Repos, Lau changed his story and said that it was a loan by Repos which he
                    personally guaranteed, and that if it was a personal loan from him, he would use
                    his own personal cheque. This suggested that he knew the difference between
                    being a lender and a guarantor, and yet despite this, he started off asserting
                    that the $11,000 was a personal loan from him to Orientus. Secondly, the two
                    payments were each for $5,500, which coincidentally, was the monthly payment
                    amount as agreed by the parties. Thirdly, there was no record of the loan or
                    guarantor arrangement (unlike the friendly loan). That said however, I was also
                    mindful that there was also no evidence that the two payments were made as a
                    deposit, nor an explanation why such a deposit was required. Fourthly, Orientus
                    issued an official receipt dated 15 January 2009 stating that $5,500 had
                    been received from Trust Development, which supports Orientus’ claim that
                    the 15 January payment was made from Trust to Orientus, and not a loan from
                    Lau. Although Lau claimed that he had not seen this receipt before, I accepted
                    Orientus’ evidence and noted that Orientus did not require Trust to
                    acknowledge previous receipts which it sent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The difficulty in this case lay with the lack
                    of conclusive documentation, either of the alleged loan agreement, the deposit,
                    or the variation in contract terms. In light of my earlier findings, I found
                    Orientus’ version of events more credible and accepted that there was a
                    subsequent agreement to lower the monthly payment from $5,500 to $5,000. A
                    difficulty to Orientus’ claim was the existence of the payment voucher
                    from Trust to Orientus dated 5 February 2009 which stated that Trust paid
                    $5,500 to Orientus, less $500 for an “advance” and less other
                    charges. Orientus argued that very little weight should be placed on the payment
                    voucher because it was normal for the recipient of a cheque to check only that
                    the amount paid to him was correct, and he would not be concerned about the
                    description on the payment voucher. Trust argued that the payment voucher was
                    evidence of the loan arrangement between Lau and Orientus, and therefore, there
                    was no subsequent agreement to lower the monthly payment to $5,000. Although I
                    found it odd that somebody would acknowledge receipt of payment without checking
                    the contents of the payment slip, for the reasons already stated above, I also
                    found Trust’s explanation <em>ie</em> that there was
                    a loan arrangement between Lau and Orientus doubtful. I noted that there was no
                    evidence of the $500 being paid to Repos as repayment of the alleged loan.
                    Furthermore, I was of the opinion that the word “advance”, did not
                    unequivocally suggest a loan arrangement because it could also suggest that
                    Orientus was entitled to the money but paid ahead of the due date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In coming to my decision, I found it doubtful
                    that Orientus would write the 11 February 2009 letter if there was indeed
                    only a temporary arrangement to vary the monthly payment. Although Voon stated
                    that he asked Orientus how long the temporary arrangement would last, it was not
                    part of his evidence that Trust was pushing Orientus to resume the original
                    agreement, neither was it part of Trust’s version of events that the
                    parties agreed to reduce the monthly payment to $5,000 temporarily. In the
                    circumstances, Orientus could have continued with the $5,500 monthly payment
                    arrangement indefinitely, and it was not in its interest to voluntarily reduce
                    the monthly payment from $5,500 to $5,000, without obtaining any benefit. Thus,
                    I did not believe that Orientus would unilaterally breach the contract through
                    the 11 February 2009 letter. I therefore dismissed Trust’s claim and
                    found that Orientus did not, by the letter dated 11 February 2009, intend
                    to repudiate the earlier contracts. Accordingly, I allowed Orientus’
                    counter-claim. Costs to be adjourned for hearing before me.</p>
