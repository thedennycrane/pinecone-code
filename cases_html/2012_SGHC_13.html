<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The defendant is the lessee and the vendor of
                    adjoining Housing Development Board (“HDB”) shop houses known as
                    91/A, 93/A, and 95/A Owen Road Singapore 218903 (the “Property”).
                    The plaintiff is the purchaser of the Property. This originating summons was
                    brought by the plaintiff to enforce the sale of the Property in response to the
                    defendant’s purported rescission of the sale agreement in reliance on a
                    clause in the Option to Purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the hearing of this
                    application, I declared that the defendant’s notice of rescission was
                    invalid and that the sale agreement subsisted. Accordingly, I made an order for
                    specific performance of the said agreement. The plaintiff was also awarded its
                    costs for this application. The defendant has appealed against my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant was the lessee of the HDB and the
                    vendor of the Property while the plaintiff was the purchaser of the Property,
                    which was used as a coffee shop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The reversion of the lease of the Property was
                    previously held by the Singapore Improvement Trust. It is now vested in the
                    HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The lease of the Property has been varied and
                    supplemented by Deeds of Variation. Clause 1(v) of the lease was replaced by
                    Clause 1 of a Deed of Variation, which provided as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The defendant granted an Option to Purchase in

                    Fairlady Jewellers Private Limited (“Fairlady”) and/or its

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Fairlady was a shareholder of the plaintiff,

                    Purchase, in response to the plaintiff’s proposed amendments to the same.
                    In particular, the defendant proposed the addition of two clauses
                    (“clauses 17 and 18”) to the Conditions of Sale found in the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff exercised the Option to Purchase
                    on 11 April 2011 by paying the balance of the deposit of 9% of the purchase
                    price and delivering the duly signed acceptance copy to the defendant. Although
                    the plaintiff had earlier taken the position that clauses 17 and 18 were not
                    incorporated into the Option to Purchase, before me, the parties agreed that the
                    said clauses were part of the Option to Purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The HDB wrote to the defendant on 14 June
                    2011 stating that it had no objection to the assignment of the lease by the
                    defendant to Fairlady subject to the payment of an assignment fee of $128,935
                    (inclusive of 7% GST) to the HDB, clearance of use of the premises by the
                    relevant authorities and the submission of a stamped copy of the transfer
                    instrument for HDB’s records.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The defendant replied to the
                    HDB on 15 June 2011 clarifying that the lease was to be assigned to the
                    plaintiff and not to Fairlady.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In further correspondence in June 2011, the
                    defendant informed the HDB that it was “surprised by the amount of
                    assignment fee of $128,935 (inclusive of GST) levied” and asked the HDB
                    to elaborate on the breakdown of the amount. HDB replied that “the
                    assignment fee imposed is according to HDB’s prevailing policy for
                    assignments of leases” and explained that the assignment fee “is
                    based on 10% of the proposed sale price of $3,330,000 less the total original
                    purchase price of $600,000 and $1,525,000 of the three properties”. The
                    defendant replied stating that it was “surprised that the assignment fee
                    levied by HDB was a hefty 10%” and objected “strongly” to
                    the imposition of the assignment fee. HDB replied to explain that “the
                    leases for the properties allow the lessor to impose an assignment fee
                    equivalent to 10% of the market value of the land and buildings at the time of
                    application”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Thereafter on 1 July 2011, the defendant
                    wrote to the plaintiff to defer completion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Following this was the
                    defendant’s letter of 15 July 2011 to the plaintiff stating that it
                    was “unable or unwilling because of difficulty or expense to comply with
                    the payment of the assignment fee of $128,935 imposed by HDB for the sale of the
                    Property” and that it wished to exercise its rights under clause 18 to
                    rescind the Option to Purchase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The defendant’s intention
                    to rescind on this ground was reiterated in another letter dated 19 July
                    2011 to the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff, in its letter dated
                    21 July 2011, rejected the defendant’s purported rescission of the
                    Option to Purchase. The rejection was reiterated by the plaintiff in another
                    letter dated 1 August 2011. With a view to completion, the plaintiff
                    thereafter proceeded to forward a draft transfer document, among other things,
                    in a letter dated 10 August 2011 to the defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In a letter dated 16 August 2011, the
                    defendant refused to proceed to completion and repeated that the Option to
                    Purchase had been duly rescinded in accordance with clause 18. The next day, the
                    plaintiff wrote to dispute the defendant’s right to rescind the agreement
                    and insisted that the parties proceed to complete the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The substance of the plaintiff’s
                    arguments was that upon construing clauses 17 and 18 and considering the conduct
                    of the defendant and the circumstances, the defendant was not entitled to
                    rescind the sale and that it was acting unreasonably in doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff argued that the assignment fee
                    was payable by the defendant as it fell within clause 17(v). Moreover, as lessee
                    of the Property, the defendant would have been privy to the terms of the lease
                    which expressly provided for such fee to be payable and the defendant could not
                    therefore argue that it was unaware of such a condition. Clause 18 could not be
                    interpreted to cover the assignment fee imposed as it was something already
                    known to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff further argued that the
                    assignment fee was not hefty and there was no evidence to show the
                    defendant’s inability to pay the fee. It argued that the sale price of
                    $3,330,000 would be sufficient to pay the fee and that the defendant would have
                    taken the assignment fee into consideration in its calculation of the sale
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff also submitted that the
                    assignment fee was not an unreasonable expense entitling the defendant to
                    rescind the agreement because such expense was not one newly imposed by the HDB
                    nor was it arbitrarily derived. It was something already known to the defendant.
                    The plaintiff also referred to the HDB’s website on industrial properties
                    where it was stated under “Assigning Your Premises”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fees</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For leases on premium scheme, an assignment fee would be payable by the
                        existing lessee (Assignor) which is computed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10% (Sale price – last purchase price).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Additionally, the plaintiff argued that there
                    had to be objective circumstances causing the difficulty, delay or expense
                    resulting in the defendant’s inability or unwillingness to comply with
                    HDB’s conditions. It argued that the defendant could not unilaterally
                    rescind the agreement pursuant to clause 18 merely because it was taken by
                    surprise by the assignment fee and did not factor this into the sale price. It
                    based this argument on <em>Chay </em><em>Chong </em><em>Hwa v Seah Mary</em>
                    [1983-1984] SLR(R) 505 (“<em>Chay
                        </em><em>Chong </em><em>Hwa”</em>) and <em>Peh </em><em>Kwee Yong v Sinar Co (Pte) Ltd</em>
                    [1987] SLR(R) 405 (“<em>Peh </em><em>Kwee Yong</em>”) where the court noted that rescission
                    could not be simply contingent on the defendant’s subjective
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Accordingly, the plaintiff sought the
                    following declarations and orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the notice given by letters
                        dated 15 and 19 July 2011 from the defendant purporting to rescind the
                        sale contract of the Property in accordance with clause 18 on the ground
                        that the defendant is unable or unwilling because of difficulty or expense
                        to pay the HDB the assignment fee $128,935, be declared
                    invalid;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the
                        sale agreement be declared as still subsisting and binding on the
                        parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     That
                        the defendant pay the assignment fee of $128,935 to the HDB and late
                        completion interest to the plaintiff, with such interest deducted from the
                        proceeds of sale;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     That the defendant specifically perform the Option to Purchase within
                        21 days of the court order;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a>(e)     That costs be fixed or taxed and to be paid by the
                        defendant to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In response, the defendant sought to dismiss
                    the plaintiff’s application by arguing that it was entitled, on the basis
                    of clause 18, to exercise its right to rescind the sale agreement. It made the
                    following arguments in support of its case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Firstly, it argued that not only was it
                    unaware that HDB’s consent for the sale was required, it was also unaware
                    that HDB would impose payment of an assignment fee as a condition precedent to
                    HDB’s consent. It submitted that the provisions for the assignment fee
                    were found only in the “obscure” and “dated” Deeds
                    of Variation of lease made between HDB and the previous lessees in the early
                    1980s which the defendant did not have in its possession. The defendant
                    therefore could not be deemed to have the requisite knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Secondly, the defendant argued that in any
                    case, the “hefty” assignment fee imposed by HDB amounting to
                    almost 4% of the sale price provided grounds for rescission of the sale in
                    accordance with clauses 17 and 18 as it was “unable or unwilling”
                    to pay the assignment fee because of “difficulty or expense”.
                    Indeed, it argued, it was precisely to provide for such an eventuality that
                    clause 18 was added into the Option to Purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Thirdly, the defendant argued that in
                    interpreting the clauses, its obligations under clause 17(v)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> must be read subject to and be qualified
                    by clause 18 or clause 18 would be superfluous. The defendant relied on the
                    canons of construction calling for all parts of a contract to be given effect to
                    and that where a latter clause qualifies an earlier clause in the contract, both
                    should be read together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Therefore, the defendant submitted that since
                    clause 18 did not require reasons to be given for the defendant’s
                    inability or unwillingness to comply with HDB’s condition of the payment
                    of the assignment fee, the defendant was entitled to deliver a written notice in
                    accordance with that clause to rescind the sale agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It was not disputed by both parties that
                    clauses 17 and 18 of the Option to Purchase ought to be read together. However
                    they could not agree on what the outcome ought to be upon such construction. The
                    main contention was whether clause 18 entitled the defendant to rescind the sale
                    agreement despite its assumption of the obligation in Clause 17(v) that the
                    vendor “shall perform all the conditions imposed by HDB to be performed
                    by the Vendor as conditions precedent for the approval and shall bear all costs
                    whatsoever imposed by HDB or otherwise for the said approval and for the
                    performance of the said conditions imposed by HDB, if any”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Clause 17 of the Option to Purchase (see
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) sets out clearly the
                    respective obligations of the defendant/vendor and the plaintiff/purchaser in
                    obtaining HDB’s approval for the sale and purchase of the Property under
                    the lease. In particular, clause 17(v) sets out the defendant’s obligation
                    to perform all conditions set by HDB in order to obtain its approval for the
                    sale of the Property under the lease and to bear all costs in relation to the
                    performance of these conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     One of these conditions was the payment of an
                    assignment fee of $128,935 (inclusive of 7% GST) to the HDB (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>). A perusal of the lease documents would have
                    revealed this. Clause 1 of the Deeds of Variation varying the terms of the lease
                    clearly provided for the payment of a fee amounting to 10% of the market value
                    of the land which was the subject of the sale and the costs of buildings erected
                    on the land (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>). It was clear therefore
                    that both the liability for the assignment fee and the method of quantification
                    of the fee had been expressly set out. As the lessee of the Property, the
                    defendant must be taken to have read the lease and to be aware of the express
                    terms found in the lease documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The defendant could not argue that it was
                    unaware of the terms in the lease documents simply because the Deeds of
                    Variation were dated and obscure documents that were not in the
                    defendant’s possession. It ought to have asked for them when it bought
                    over the Property. Alternatively, if it had lost the documents, that was
                    something that should have been put right by itself before it decided to sell
                    the Property. The Deeds of Variation could have been easily obtained from the
                    Singapore Land Authority.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    As lessee of the Property and now the vendor of it, the defendant must be deemed
                    to know the contents of those documents. Further, the defendant had the benefit
                    of legal advice throughout the sale transaction. Also, as rightly pointed out by
                    the plaintiff,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> the HDB’s website
                    (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above), which is readily
                    accessible, sets out a lessee’s liability to pay an assignment fee to the
                    HDB as a condition for assigning a lease together with HDB’s formula for
                    computing the said fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the circumstances here, clause 18 of the
                    Option to Purchase could not be read as qualifying the express requirement in
                    clause 17(v) regarding the payment of the assignment fee where the liability to
                    pay such and the method of ascertaining the amount to pay were spelt out. Clause
                    17(v) must, on the facts here, be confined to such conditions or such amounts of
                    fee that were unknown to the defendant at the time it gave the Option to
                    Purchase. It seems contrary to commercial logic that a party who knows or is
                    deemed to know his liability to pay a fee and the amount thereof could in the
                    same breath claim that the liability and the amount are too onerous such that it
                    could then back out of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Additionally, I found the authorities cited by
                    the plaintiff to be of assistance regarding the court’s approach to
                    clauses similar in substance to clause 18. This was set out by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Peh Kwee Yong</em> (at [25]), where L P Thean J (as he then
                    was) stated that even if a contractual term or condition confers on a party an
                    entitlement to rescind the contract, the court will still carefully examine the
                    conduct of that party to determine whether he is entitled to exercise the right
                    of rescission given the circumstances of the case. In the preceding Court of
                    Appeal case of <em>Chay Chong Haw</em> cited in <em>Peh Kwee Yong</em>, the court held that such a clause did not
                    confer on the vendor a “wide and unfettered” right to rescind the
                    contract as such a clause was of a “very drastic nature”. In
                    particular, where the vendor was guilty of ‘recklessness’ in
                    entering into the contract or if his unwillingness to comply with conditions was
                    “unreasonable” he would not be entitled to rescind the contract.
                    As said by the court, a vendor “cannot in reliance on such condition
                    arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably rescind the
                contract”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the present case, Clause 18 clearly
                    contemplates an objective standard for determining whether the impediment
                    claimed by the defendant is valid. This can be seen from the words
                    “[w]here the Vendor is unable or unwilling, because of difficulty, delay
                    or expense <em>or for other reasonable cause</em> to comply
                    with any term of HDB to be performed by the Vendor for the sale of the
                    Property…”. The words “difficulty, delay or expense”
                    read in the context of “<em>or for other reasonable
                        cause</em>” mean that they too should be reasonable from an
                    objective point of view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It appeared that the purported rescission by
                    the defendant of the sale agreement was essentially prompted by it being caught
                    by surprise by the $128,935 assignment fee it had to pay the HDB for the
                    transaction, rather than any real difficulty or significant expense it would
                    have encountered in paying the fee. Additionally, as discussed in <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above, the defendant’s conduct in
                    entering the agreement without ascertaining for itself the terms of the HDB
                    lease amounted to sheer recklessness. Its unwillingness to comply with the
                    payment of the assignment fee could not be said on the facts here to be
                    reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In any case, the quantum of the assignment fee
                    that the HDB imposed on the defendant, namely $128,935, appeared to be
                    considerably lower than what could have been imposed under the Deed of
                    Variation. The HDB calculated the assignment fee as 10% of the sale price of the
                    Property of $3,330,000 less the total original purchase prices of $600,000 and
                    $1,525,000, inclusive of 7% GST, to arrive at $128,935.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In doing so, the HDB appeared to have used
                    the formula stated in its website (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                    above), <em>i.e.</em> 10% (Sale price – last purchase
                    price). Under the formula stipulated in the Deed of Variation (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), the HDB could have imposed a fee of 10%
                    of the current market value of $3,330,000 (which is the agreed sale price
                    between the parties), amounting to $333,000. With 7% GST, the total amount would
                    be $356,310. The defendant was therefore effectively given a discount of more
                    than $227,000 by the HDB in the assignment fee payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Therefore, considering all the circumstances
                    of the case, I was of the view that the defendant lessee was not entitled to
                    rely on clause 18 to rescind the sale agreement. Consequently I declared invalid
                    the notice given in the defendant’s letters dated
                        15<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> July
                    2011 that it was unable or unwilling because of difficulty or expense to comply
                    with the payment of the assignment fee imposed by the HDB for the sale of the
                    Property and further declared that the sale agreement still subsisted and bound
                    the parties. I further ordered the defendant to pay the assignment fee of
                    $128,935 imposed by the HDB and to specifically perform the Option to Purchase
                    within 30 days of my order (instead of the 21 days prayed for) or such extended
                    period as may be agreed between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On the issue of costs, the plaintiff’s
                    counsel informed me that an Offer to Settle on the terms of this originating
                    summons with late completion interest and costs waived was served on the
                    defendant’s counsel on 31 Oct 2011, some three weeks before the hearing.
                    The plaintiff’s counsel suggested that costs be fixed at $6,000 plus
                    reasonable disbursements. The defendant’s counsel was content to leave the
                    question of costs to the court. I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff
                    costs fixed at $6,000 plus reasonable disbursements (subsequently agreed at
                    $1,724.80).</p>
