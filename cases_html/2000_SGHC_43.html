<p align="justify">2 The 6<sup>th</sup> Charge originally alleged that he had

"voluntarily caused hurt" but that was amended at the close of the case for the

Defence to "voluntarily caused wrongful restraint".</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE PROSECUTION’S CASE</p></u>
<p align="justify">3 The Complainant is 26 years old and single. She resides in the public

housing estate of Toa Payoh with her parents and two sisters. The Complainant had formal

education up to Primary 6 level. She was able to speak in simple English but was more

fluent in Mandarin. </p>
<p align="justify">4 After completing her primary school education, she did not look for

employment until some three years later. She then worked in various factories until about

six years ago when she stopped working altogether as she could not cope with her work. She

has been unemployed since that time.</p>
<p align="justify">5 A psychological assessment of her intellect conducted by Dr Helen

Chen of Woodbridge Hospital in June 1999 revealed that "she was functioning in the

borderline range of intelligence". The doctor also opined that "her

understanding of sexual intercourse and contact is fairly adequate, and she is fully

competent to give consent to sexual intercourse".</p>
<p align="justify">6 On 3 June 1999, the Complainant was watching television in her Toa

Payoh flat. At around 9 pm, she felt hungry and decided to go to Kopitiam (a food centre)

at the Meridien Hotel in Orchard Road as many of the food stalls in her neighbourhood were

already closed. She travelled by the Mass Rapid Transit to the Somerset Station and then

walked to the Meridien Hotel.</p>
<p align="justify">7 She spent about one and a quarter hours at the food centre. After

having her meal, she had only some coins left. Although it was around midnight by then,

she decided to walk all the way home to Toa Payoh. She had done this more than ten times

previously and thought it was alright for her to do so again that night. The long trek

home finally brought her to the bus interchange at Block 190 Toa Payoh Central.</p>
<p align="justify">8 It was about 2 am on 4 June 1999 by then. Feeling thirsty after the

long walk from Orchard Road, the Complainant went into the 7-Eleven shop at Block 190 to

purchase a packet of drink with the coins that she had. She then went out of the shop.</p>
<p align="justify">9 When she was outside the shop, the Accused (who was unknown to her

then) asked her in English why she was rushing out and whether she had paid for the drink.

She replied that she had. He then flashed a pink card at her. The card had the words

"Tanglin Police" on it. The Accused told her he worked in a police station and

that he suspected that she had stolen things from the 7-Eleven shop. He then pulled her by

the arm as he walked away from the shop. She tried to push his hand away but he only held

her arm more tightly. She followed the Accused as she was afraid of being harmed by him.</p>
<p align="justify">10 The Accused brought her to Block 183, which was adjacent to Block

190, and they went up to a staircase landing on the third floor where the Accused told her

to sit down on the stairs. He then began to smoke a cigarette and to drink a can of beer.

He questioned her on whether she had consumed drugs. When she said she had not, the

Accused put his hand into the pockets of her Bermuda shorts to search. He then pulled her

arm and asked her to lie down on the landing. She was afraid of being harmed by him and

therefore did as instructed.</p>
<p align="justify">11 The Accused proceeded to remove all the clothing of the Complainant,

warning her not to shout or else suffer a beating. He then stripped off his clothes and

lay on top of her, fondling her breasts, her vagina, sucking her nipples and kissing her

neck. He then inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt a sharp pain and wanted to cry

but did not dare do so for fear that he would assault her.</p>
<p align="justify">12 After gratifying himself, he told her to dress up and to go up the

stairs to the highest floor and remain there. She complied. He did not follow her up.</p>
<p align="justify">13 After remaining at the fourth floor for some 45 minutes, the

Complainant decided to leave for home. She went down the stairs and walked towards Lorong

7 Toa Payoh.</p>
<p align="justify">14 As she was walking along Lorong 7 near the market, the Accused saw

her and shouted at her. She was afraid to see him after the first encounter. Although

there were some other male Indians at the market, she did not call for help as they had

been talking to the Accused and appeared to be his friends. He walked towards her and

pulled her by the arm again, mumbling something which she did not comprehend. He brought

her to Block 17A which housed a bank and where there was a spiral staircase, pushing her

into the corner where the underside of the spiral staircase met the ground. She therefore

had to sit on the floor. </p>
<p align="justify">15 The Accused lit a cigarette and smoked. After that, he stripped the

Complainant who did not dare to resist as he was staring at her fiercely. He then took off

his clothes and sat down beside her. He lowered her body to the floor, went on top of her

and began to fondle her body. He tried to kiss her on the mouth but she refused to open

it. He then used his hand to try to force her mouth open and tried to kiss her. He stopped

after a while and inserted his penis into her vagina for the second time, pushing

forcefully and causing her immense pain. She tried to push him away with both her hands

but he held them to the floor. </p>
<p align="justify">16 The Accused then stopped and pulled the Complainant’s left hand

to hold his penis and her right hand to hug him. They lay like that for about half an

hour, with him holding on to her right hand. When she saw that he was asleep, she tried to

release her numb left hand from his penis but the movement roused the Accused. He started

to kiss and fondle her body again.</p>
<p align="justify">17 He then caused her to sit up and spread her legs apart and he sat

facing her with his legs resting on her thighs. He held his penis with one hand and used

the other to push her head forcefully towards his penis. She refused to open her mouth but

he used his hand to force her to open it. He then inserted his penis into her mouth and

pushed her head up and down with such force that she could hardly breathe.</p>
<p align="justify">18 After ten minutes or so of fellatio, the Accused released the

Complainant who was panting by then. Before she could catch her breath, he forced her head

down to his penis again. This time, she kept her mouth shut but he continued to rub his

penis against her mouth. </p>
<p align="justify">19 After that, he stopped and caressed her vagina. He then told her to

get dressed. While she was putting on her clothes, he asked her whether she wanted some

coffee. When she said she would like some, he told her to wait there for him while he went

to bring the coffee.</p>
<p align="justify">20 When the Complainant saw the Accused was a distance away, she fled

in a panic, afraid that he might turn around at anytime. She ran towards Block 17 until

she reached Lorong 6 where she managed to flag a taxi which brought her to her home in

Lorong 8. As she did not have money to pay the fare, she told the taxi driver to wait

while she went up to her flat to get some money. In her flat, she took $5 from the altar

table and then went back down to pay the fare. </p>
<p align="justify">21 After doing that, she went up to her flat and lay on the sofa in the

living room. Her father woke up and asked her why she had returned home so late. She did

not reply and wanted to cry. Her father noticed that her face was pale, her hair was

messy, her arms, her face and her t-shirt were dirty and enquired further. She then

revealed to him that she had been raped by an unknown Indian while walking home. Her

father then went to wake her mother up and together they proceeded to Kim Keat

Neighbourhood Police Post to lodge a report. It was past 5 am then. </p>
<p align="justify">22 At the NPP, Sgt Lim Chee Peng interviewed the Complainant’s

father and was informed by him that the Complainant had been raped by an unknown male

Indian on two occasions, the first having taken place at about 2 am at the staircase

landing of Block 190 near the 7-Eleven shop and the second at Block 17A. When I asked the

Complainant’s father why he had told the police officer that the first rape was at

Block 190, he denied that he had mentioned the block number. He testified that he was not

very familiar with the block numbers although he lived in Toa Payoh and had merely told

the police officer that the Complainant was dragged to a place somewhere in Toa Payoh

Central. </p>
<p align="justify">23 The Complainant and her parents were referred thereafter to Tanglin

Police Division HQ.</p>
<p align="justify">24 At 9.10 am on 4 June 1999, the Complainant was examined by Dr

Kenneth Edward Lee at KK Women’s &amp; Children’s Hospital. In his report, he

said:</p>
<blockquote>
<font size="2"><p align="justify"></p></font>"Her history was vague. 

  <p align="justify">She was allegedly taken to a block of flats by an Indian male and was

  forced to perform oral sex on him. There was also penile-vaginal penetration and anal sex.

  She was unsure if there was ejaculation.</p>
<p align="justify">She was then released and left alone. However, she encountered the same

  man on her way home and was forced to have sex with him again. She was uncertain if there

  was ejaculation.</p>
<p align="justify">Physical examination was as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">She was anxious, slightly distressed and appeared dazed. She was in a

  blue t-shirt and shorts with unkempt hair. There was no evidence of alcohol or drug

  usage".</p>
</blockquote></font>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The doctor also found a superficial abrasion on the left corner on the

left corner of her mouth and dirt marks on the soles of her feet, her back and her thighs.

There was a fresh tear of the hymen with slight bleeding. There were no bruises. </p>
<p align="justify">25 Asked in cross-examination by the Accused whether he had beaten her

up at any time, the Complainant replied that he did. She did not think it was necessary to

mention this in her statement. Later, she explained that he had asked her to shut up,

beating her face once lightly as a threat, during the second incident of rape. She

affirmed that he had not asked for her consent to engage in sex with her and that she had

not given such consent at any time.</p>
<p align="justify">26 Asked by the Accused how he could have pulled her along outside the

7-Eleven shop when there were residents around, the Complainant replied that it was

already past midnight then and nobody was around. Similarly the residents living in the

flats overlooking that area did not see this happening as they must have gone to bed since

their flats were dark. She did not scream as she was very afraid of the Accused who was

holding on to her arm tightly.</p>
<p align="justify">27 Before the second incident at Block 17A, when they were along Lorong

7, she also did not scream for help as she was fearful. This was despite the fact that the

Accused was about ten steps away from her when she saw him and inspite of the fact that

that was an open space. </p>
<p align="justify">28 SSG Png Chen Chen was the Investigating Officer in charge of this

case. At about 4.30 pm on 4 June 1999, she went with two other police officers and the

Complainant to the scenes at Block 183 and Block 17A. Nothing was found at the staircase

landing on the third floor of Block 183. At Block 17A, beneath the spiral staircase, they

found a torn-off piece of newspaper, some strands of hair and a cigarette butt. There were

blood stains on the floor and blood swabs were taken.</p>
<p align="justify">29 The Complainant’s outer and inner clothing were seized by the

Investigating Officer as exhibits. </p>
<p align="justify">30 The circumstances leading to the arrest of the Accused were as

follows. From the lead given by the Complainant that she had seen a pink card with the

words "Tanglin Police Station" flashed by the Accused, the Investigating Officer

believed the card was a Urine Test Reporting Card issued by the Central Narcotics Bureau

("CNB"). She sought the assistance of CNB (Tanglin) to provide information on

male Indian supervisees, giving them the description of the suspect. When the photographs

of the said supervisees were ready, the Complainant was asked to go and view them. She

picked out one of the photographs.</p>
<p align="justify">31 From the particulars of that suspect provided by the CNB (Tanglin),

the Investigating Officer led a team of police officers to the Accused’s address on 1

September 1999. When they arrived at the carpark of the Accused’s block of flats at

Block 17, Lorong 7 Toa Payoh, they saw him seated nearby. They checked the Accused and

seized the pink CNB supervision card from his person. They then placed him under arrest

and brought him up to his flat where five items of his clothing were seized.</p>
<p align="justify">32 They brought the Accused to CNB (Tanglin) and then to Criminal

Investigation Department. Later that day, the same team escorted the Accused to view the

scenes at Block 183 and Block 17A.</p>
<p align="justify">33 On 2 September 1999, the Investigating Officer charged the Accused

with the First Charge and proceeded to record a statement from him pursuant to Section

122(6) Criminal Procedure Code after having administered the Notice of Warning provided in

that section. The Accused, speaking in English, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<font size="2"><p align="justify"></p></font>"I have nothing to say for I am not guilty.

  I wish to explain everything to your majesty."

  </blockquote></font>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">34 On 6 September 1999, the Accused was brought to the Department of

Scientific Services where a blood sample was taken from him for the purpose of DNA

testing.</p>
<p align="justify">35 On 7 September 1999, the Investigating Officer charged the Accused

with the other six Charges and proceeded to record his statements in respect of each of

the Charges. In each case, the Accused responded with words to the effect that he wished

to explain everything in Court and to prove his innocence when he would be having legal

counsel. At the trial, the Accused agreed that all the seven statements taken from him had

been made by him voluntarily.</p>
<p align="justify">36 On 9 September 1999, the Accused was sent to Changi Prison Hospital

for a Potency Test. Dr Leow Kee Fong examined him and reported that there was no

indication of impotence and that the results of investigation for sexually transmitted

diseases were negative.</p>
<p align="justify">37 That afternoon, the Accused was brought to Jurong Police Division HQ

for an Identification Parade to be held. The Complainant managed to identify the Accused

out of a total of nine persons participating in the parade.</p>
<p align="justify">38 The report from Mrs Tan Wai Fun, Scientific Officer at the

Department of Scientific Services showed that the saliva found on the cigarette butt

located at Block 17A was in all probability the Accused’s. The semen stains on the

Complainant’s shorts and panties and the semen found in the vaginal and anal swabs

taken from the Complainant were likewise all found to have come from the Accused. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE</p></u>
<p align="justify">39 When the Accused was called upon to make his defence to the seven

Charges, he elected to testify as a witness. He called no one else in his defence. He was

educated up to Primary 6 in the English stream. Before his arrest, he worked as a labourer

in the Maritime &amp; Port Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">40 On 3 June 1999 before midnight, the Accused returned to Toa Payoh

after visiting a friend in Bishan. He went to the 7-Eleven shop at Block 190 Toa Payoh to

buy a can of beer. He then sat outside the shop. There were a few men in the vicinity.</p>
<p align="justify">41 About half an hour later, he saw the Complainant walking out of the

shop and walking away from where he was. He decided to walk home and happened to be going

along the same way as the Complainant. </p>
<p align="justify">42 When the Accused caught up with the Complainant, he spoke in a

friendly manner to her. She appeared shocked and started to edge closer to the wall. He

asked her why she was afraid of him but she merely mumbled something. He asked her whether

she was going home but again she said something unintelligible and looked afraid. The

Accused then asked her why she was afraid and whether she had stolen the packet of drink

from the shop. The Complainant appeared more shocked and edged all the way next to the

wall.</p>
<p align="justify">43 Not knowing what she was afraid of, with the can of beer and a

cigarette in one hand, the Accused took out his CNB supervision card and told her that he

was "no police" and gave her the card to read. He took the card back after she

had read it.</p>
<p align="justify">44 They kept walking. The Complainant smiled after he asked her whether

she was going home. He could not have forced her or pulled her along as there were people

in the vicinity.</p>
<p align="justify">45 When they reached a staircase at Block 183, the Accused asked the

Complainant to go up the staircase and she went up with him voluntarily. They sat at the

landing on the second floor where he asked her whether she wanted to drink or to eat

anything. She said, "No". He also asked her whether she wanted to smoke but

again she said, "No". He then asked her whether she had money but she kept

quiet. He repeated the question but she maintained her silence.</p>
<p align="justify">46 The Accused then placed his hands inside both pockets of the

Complainant’s Bermuda shorts to see whether there was money in any of them. She did

not resist or do anything. As they were right outside two flats, if she had made any

sound, the residents therein would certainly have heard her.</p>
<p align="justify">47 He then asked her to go up another floor with him. When they had

done so, he put his arm around her and caressed her. She still did not resist. He then

asked her to lie down. They removed their clothes and had sexual intercourse there.</p>
<p align="justify">48 When they were done, he told her to dress up and asked her whether

she wanted a drink. She merely kept quiet and stood at the landing. He then told her that

he was going home and when there was still no response from her, he left. </p>
<p align="justify">49 He went to the market at Block 18 and had a drink with a friend

there. There were some men at the stall. After about 45 minutes, he decided to walk back

to his flat which was in a block next to the market. That was when he saw the Complainant

again. She was about ten steps ahead of him when she turned around and saw him. It was an

open area at the roadside.</p>
<p align="justify">50 The Accused walked up to her and asked her what she was doing there.

She stood there without responding. After getting no reply when he asked her whether she

was going home, he told her, "Come" and she followed him to Block 17A.</p>
<p align="justify">51 They had sexual intercourse again below the spiral staircase. She

did not refuse him or do anything at all. He did not threaten her. It was nearly morning

by then. If people passed by that spot, they would have seen both of them. Similarly, if

she had screamed, people would have heard her. </p>
<p align="justify">52 They remained there until nearly 6 am when he asked her to dress up

and asked her whether she wanted breakfast. She said she wanted to have coffee. He went

out from that place to buy coffee but when he returned, she was no longer there. When he

could not find her, he went home.</p>
<p align="justify">53 Asked in cross-examination why he had stopped the Complainant

outside the 7-Eleven shop, the Accused replied that sometimes he would approach women to

make friends. He showed her the CNB supervision card because a drug supervisee could not

be a policeman or some person of authority. He put his hands into her pockets to check

whether she had money as she could be shy and did not want to ask him for money. In doing

so, he did touch her thighs. </p>
<p align="justify">54 At the staircase landing of Block 183, the Accused removed the

Complainant’s upper clothes. He then asked her to take off her Bermuda shorts and she

did so. He then stripped himself and removed the Complainant’s panties after which

they had sex. Throughout the whole episode, the Complainant remained quiet. He did not ask

her whether she wanted to have sex. He deduced from her compliant conduct when he asked

her to go up the stairs and from her silence and lack of resistance that she was agreeable

to the sexual encounter. He did not have to offer her any money or otherwise persuade her

to agree. He was not really surprised by all this as he had gone "to the

fullest" with some women on the first date.</p>
<p align="justify">55 On both occasions, the Complainant followed him when he asked her

to. He did not pull her arms or otherwise coerce her to follow him. He could not have

dared to do that as they were in open spaces and on a road. There was also a night market

there and people knew him as he had been living in Toa Payoh for 30 years. Asked whether

there was anybody around at that time, i.e. past 2 am, the Accused said a man rode by on a

bicycle.</p>
<p align="justify">56 The Accused then elaborated on the events below the spiral staircase

at Block 17A. When they arrived at that spot, they sat down on the floor and he smoked a

cigarette. After that, he asked her to remove her clothes and she did so. He then took off

his clothes and asked her to lie down and spread her legs apart. They then had sexual

intercourse. There was no reaction from the Complainant. She did not try to push him away.

He did not kiss her on the mouth because he had a cut on his upper lip. </p>
<p align="justify">57 He did not say much to her. He did ask her where she lived and she

merely said "234". She either mumbled or did not respond to his queries about

why she was not back home and whether she had any problem.</p>
<p align="justify">58 After they had sexual intercourse, they rested. He did not place her

left hand to hold his penis. Instead, he placed her left hand on top of his stomach. He

then fell asleep.</p>
<p align="justify">59 When he awoke, he tried to move her head towards his penis but she

resisted. When he tried a second time, she resisted again. His penis touched her mouth for

a few seconds, but she refused to open it. He gave up after that. He did not force her

head towards his penis and neither did he insert it into her mouth. He did not slap her

face. He guessed that the Complainant did not like fellatio. She did not say anything when

he tried asking her to perform fellatio but she did look rather angry. </p>
<p align="justify">60 Asked why he chose not to explain all this in his statements when

invited by the Investigating Officer to do so, the Accused said he thought it would be

better to give his statement to his lawyer.</p>
<p align="justify">61 In response to the Court’s questions, the Accused said he

thought of becoming friends with the Complainant but did not ask for her name nor

introduce himself.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</p></u>
<p align="justify">62 The Complainant was visibly slow mentally but could respond calmly

and clearly to questions in Court. She spoke slowly but certainly not in a manner which

suggested that she was concocting a story. </p>
<p align="justify">63 I found her account coherent and truthful even if her habit of

travelling to town for meals and walking the many kilometres home would seem somewhat

bizarre to a person of average intellect and means. However, the evidence showed clearly

that she was, unfortunately, not a normal person.</p>
<p align="justify">64 Two seemingly unsatisfactory aspects of her testimony must be

addressed – her affirmative response to the Accused’s question whether he had

beaten her up and her account to Dr Kenneth Edward Lee that there was anal sex. In her

statements, she had made no mention of any beating. She explained that the slap during the

second encounter with the Accused was a light one, interpreted by her to be a warning to

her to keep quiet and that she did not think it was necessary to state it. I believed her.

The slap was mentioned by her only because of a direct question by the Accused. She had

not sought to exaggerate the force or the number of times. I did not think it affected her

credibility in any way.</p>
<p align="justify">65 I presumed there was no anal penetration as no evidence was adduced

from the Complainant about this. When she was seen by Dr Lee on 4 June 1999 at 9.10 am,

she had no, or very little sleep after the eventful early hours of the morning. The doctor

noted that "her history was vague" and that she was anxious, slightly distressed

and appeared dazed. Bearing in mind all the above and the fact that she is of "the

borderline range of intelligence", she could have easily made a mistake or

miscommunicated to the doctor that there was anal penetration as well. No doubt there was

a discrepancy but it did not materially affect her testimony when viewed in its totality. </p>
<p align="justify">66 Whether the Complainant’s father or the Complainant had told

the police that the first incident was at Block 190 (instead of Block 183) or whether the

police officer at the NPP had made an error was irrelevant in the light of the

Accused’s admission that such an incident did take place and that the venue was at a

staircase landing in Block 183. In any event, Block 190 did feature prominently as that

was where the 7-Eleven shop was located.</p>
<p align="justify">67 The Complainant’s father’s evidence supported the

Complainant’s testimony that the sexual encounters were entirely against her will.

She returned home looking pale, dishevelled and dirty. That certainly did not sound like

someone who had had consensual sex, who would certainly have taken a few minutes to at

least tidy up. Further, it would be very strange indeed for the Complainant to decide to

take a taxi when she was so close to home after having walked all the way back from

Orchard Road, and then from Block 183. Clearly she did not have the money for the fare.

Why did the Accused, so concerned about whether she needed money but was too shy to ask,

not give her even a couple of dollars after rummaging in her pockets?</p>
<p align="justify">68 On the other hand, the Accused’s version of events

over-stretched the bounds of credibility. It was unbelievable that a girl who was so

shocked and afraid of someone coming up to her to strike a conversation that she had to

sidle towards a wall would go up to a staircase landing with the same stranger, allow him

to grope about in her shorts pockets and to fondle her, remove her clothes when asked to

and then "go the fullest" (to borrow the Accused’s words). This was even

more unbelievable when she was merely muttering unintelligibly or keeping silent most of

the time. It was also incredible that the Accused’s "introduction" of

himself to a female stranger was to prove that he was a drug supervisee. The scenario

fitted so much more logically with the Complainant’s version.</p>
<p align="justify">69 After having such intimacy with the Complainant, it would be highly

unusual for the Accused to walk away without even asking for her name or her contact

number. Her evidence that she was told to go up to the highest floor and that she remained

there for about 45 minutes coincided with the period that the Accused said he was drinking

with his friend at the market. </p>
<p align="justify">70 The same comments applied to the second encounter.</p>
<p align="justify">71 It was true that everything happened in a densely populated housing

estate and that help would probably have come if the Complainant had only screamed and

tried to fight off the Accused. It was, however, the small hours of the morning. People

were already in bed and not looking out their windows nor going about their daily

activities. More importantly, the Accused, who appeared to me to be quite clever despite

his lack of formal education, would have noticed, within a very short span of time, that

the Complainant was a simpleton of sorts and could be easily bullied and cowed into

submission. That was why he dared to accost and pull her by her arm even in an open space,

to reach into her pockets to molest her in front of flats and to calmly finish his beer

and cigarette before violating the most intimate part of the Complainant’s body.</p>
<p align="justify">72 Why did she not seek help from the people in the flats at Block 183

after the first encounter? Why did she not take a taxi home like she did after the second

encounter? These rhetorical questions were raised by the Accused in his closing

submissions. The answer was, simply, the slow intellect of the Complainant. Quite

obviously, she did not behave as average adults her age would do. After the second

unfortunate encounter, surely even a dullard like her could sense the importance of

getting home quickly and out of danger. Her initial reactions might not have been normal

but I found them entirely understandable in the circumstances of her case.</p>
<p align="justify">73 What was most telling about the Accused’s unbelievable

testimony was the fact that he had chosen not to even whisper the defence of consent when

invited to state his response to the Charges on 2 September 1999 and on 7 September 1999,

although he maintained his innocence. Why would a man who had had consensual sex with a

girl but who had been accused of rape and molest not want to disclose this complete

defence to regain his freedom? The Accused could offer only the feeble reason that he

preferred to say all this to his lawyer. I could see no logic at all in this. I therefore

drew adverse inferences against his failure to state this defence in any of his

statements.</p>
<p align="justify">74 On the totality of the evidence, I had no doubt whatsoever that the

Complainant’s version was the truth. The Prosecution had proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused on each of the seven Charges. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u>
<p align="justify">SENTENCE</p></u>
<p align="justify">75 The Accused was convicted under Section 380 Penal Code in 1978 and

more recently, under Section 8(a) Misuse of Drugs Act for possession of drug in September

1997. He was sentenced to undergo reformative training the first time and imprisonment of

18 months for the second conviction.</p>
<p align="justify">76 The Prosecution sought a deterrent sentence on the grounds that the

Accused had taken advantage of a mentally slow victim, had committed repeated rape with

threats and had subjected the victim to sexual indignities and perversions, that the

victim had been adversely affected in that she was no longer as cheerful as before and was

now afraid to go out by herself. I was also told that there was a general upward trend in

the number of rapes reported over the last four years. Various sentencing precedents were

also cited for my guidance.</p>
<p align="justify">77 Before sentencing the Accused, I made the following remarks at the

close of the trial:</p>
<blockquote>
<font size="2"><p align="justify"></p></font>"1 Clearly, the Accused has committed

  dastardly acts against an innocent girl whose fear and mental capabilities did not allow

  her to fight back or to scream for assistance. On that fateful morning, violating her body

  at the staircase landing was no satiation for him. He accosted the unfortunate victim a

  second time when she was making her way home after having suffered the indignity of being

  raped in the housing estate in which she lived. Obviously, he dared to do this as he had

  been emboldened by this seemingly simple prey who was visibly slow in intellect.

  <p align="justify">2 Predators like the present Accused who attack vulnerable females in

  this horrific manner must be locked up for a long, long time to keep our housing estates

  and our streets safe by day or by night.</p>
<p align="justify">3 The Accused is accordingly sentenced as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1<sup>st</sup> Charge : 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the

    cane.</p>
<p align="justify">2<sup>nd</sup> Charge : 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the

    cane.</p>
<p align="justify">3<sup>rd</sup> Charge : 6 months imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">4<sup>th</sup> Charge : 6 months imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">5<sup>th</sup> Charge : 9 months imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">6<sup>th</sup> Charge : Minimum of 2 years imprisonment and 6 strokes

    of the cane.</p>
<p align="justify">7<sup>th</sup> Charge : 5 years imprisonment.<font size="2"></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></font>The imprisonment terms for the 1<sup xmlns="">st</sup>, 2<sup xmlns="">nd</sup>

  and 7<sup xmlns="">th</sup> Charges are to run consecutively. The other imprisonment sentences will

  run concurrently with those three. The Accused is therefore sentenced to a total of 25

  years imprisonment with effect from 1 September 1999 and to suffer the maximum number of

  strokes mandated by law, i.e. 24 strokes of the cane."
