<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
appeal concerns a trust (“the Trust”) declared in a deed on 12 October
1960 (“the Trust Deed”) by the first appellant, the plaintiff in
the action below, over a property at 10 Rangoon Lane (formerly 156E
Rangoon Road) (“the Property”). The action below, <em>ie</em>,
Originating Summons No 1021 of 2012 (“OS 1021/2012”), was instituted
by the appellants for a declaration that the Trust is void and that
the first appellant (“Koh”) is the sole beneficial owner of the
Property. The application was opposed by the respondent in his capacity
as the protector of charities, and it was dismissed by the High
Court judge (“the Judge”): see the report of the decision in <em>Koh Lau Keow and others v Attorney-General</em> [2013]
4 SLR 491. The sole issue at the hearing before the High Court and
in this appeal is whether the Trust created in the Trust Deed is
a valid charitable trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Koh,
presently aged 96, was born in China and came to Singapore in 1936.
Sometime in 1948, she decided to purchase the Property to serve
as a home for herself and three other women (whom she refers to
as her “Aunts” although they were unrelated by blood). She paid
the entire purchase price of $3,500. However, in the conveyance
of the Property to Koh, she added the Aunts, in addition to herself,
as registered owners of the Property because she did not want them
to become homeless should she pre-decease them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Initially
Koh built on the Property a small wooden structure, with a hall
in the front portion and two rooms in the back portion. The hall
was used as a Buddhist temple for religious worship while the two
rooms were used as living quarters by Koh and her Aunts. Later,
in 1957, as the wooden structure had become badly in need of repair,
Koh engaged a contractor to erect a concrete single-storey building
on the Property. In the agreement with the contractor, the building
to be erected was described as a “Chinese nunnery”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The
building has since been renovated twice, in 1993 and 2009; the last
renovation saw the conversion of part of the kitchen into two additional
bedrooms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Soon
after purchasing the Property, Koh was advised by some devotees
who prayed at the Property that she could request for an exemption
from the payment of rates on the basis that the Property was being
used for religious purposes, that is, as a temple. Accordingly,
she engaged lawyers who corresponded on her behalf with the authorities
on the issue. It appears from the correspondence that the first
application for exemption was made in April 1948, and in relation
to which the Municipal Assessor asked the following questions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Whether
the [P]roperty was vested under a Deed of Trust and, if so, the
names of the Trustees in whom the management of the building is
vested?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Particulars as to how funds for the
upkeep of the Temple are derived?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Whether the whole was used for public
religious worship and, if not, the number of persons dwelling therein,
with their occupations?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    Was any pecuniary profit derived from
the occupation of the [P]roperty, such as selling joss-sticks etc.?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Koh’s lawyers did not reply to this query from the Municipal
Assessor. In July 1949, Koh wrote to the Municipal Assessor again
requesting for exemption from rates. The Municipal Assessor replied
on 22 July 1949 repeating the questions which he had posed in the
previous letter. On 16 August 1949, Lim Boon Hian (one of Koh’s
Aunts) replied as follows (“the 16 August 1949 Letter”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There
is a substantial gap in the evidential record as to the further correspondence
between Koh and the authorities on this issue. The next letter on
record is dated 27 September 1960 from one Chan See Kan, Secretary
of the Assessment Appeals Committee, informing Koh’s lawyers of
the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With reference to your application for
exemption from payment of assessment on the above [P]roperty, I
have to inform you that the Assessment Appeals Committee, at its
meeting held on 17.8.60, agreed that No. 156E, Rangoon Road be exempted
from the payment of rates with effect from 1.1.59 for so long as
the premises are used for religious purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Upon
obtaining exemption from rates in respect of the Property, Koh was
advised by her lawyers that, in view of the 27 September 1960 letter,
it would be helpful for evidential purposes to sign a document declaring
that the Property was being and would continue to be used for religious purposes.
Accordingly, she and her Aunts executed the Trust Deed prepared
by her lawyers. The relevant portions of the Trust Deed state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">WHEREAS [Koh and the Aunts] are seised
for an estate in fee simple as joint tenants in possession free

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Two
of the Aunts passed away in April 1970 and April 1975 respectively.
The third and remaining Aunt retired as a trustee in June 1976 and
passed away in April 1990.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The
second to sixth appellants were appointed as trustees between 1992
and 2003 at the behest of Koh. The third and fourth appellants were
adopted by Koh at birth. The second, fifth and sixth appellants
were close to Koh, who treated them as daughters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Since
its establishment, the following temple activities have been conducted
on the Property:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     mass
worship sessions and celebrations four times a year (on the birthdays
of the Goddess of Mercy in the second, sixth and ninth lunar month
and on the Lunar New Year);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     daily
prayer recitals in the morning and evening;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     ad
hoc worship sessions by relatives, close friends and neighbours;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     teaching
of Buddhist doctrines to a few old and uneducated vegetarian women
(but this was stopped since 1970).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to Koh, the Temple was never open to the public
for worship except for the aforementioned four times a year. In
other words, the public did not have any access to the Property
for prayers except on these four occasions in a year. All along,
she only allowed a close group of relatives, friends and neighbours
(initially numbering about 20 but currently numbering about 70 to
80) to freely visit or use the temple.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
individuals who have resided on the Property include Koh, her Aunts,
her adopted daughters, her granddaughter, and one Ms Koh Chun, the
daughter of one of her relatives in China. Koh deposed that no one
else has lived on the Property besides these individuals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At
this juncture we would pause to explain that with the enactment
of the Property Tax Ordinance 1960 (No 72 of 1960), “rates” payable
in respect of property had thereafter become known as “property
tax”. In 2005, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”)
reviewed the property tax exemption for the Property and informed
Koh that property tax on it was payable retrospectively from 1 January
1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Due
to her advanced age and limited physical mobility, Koh has been contemplating
ceasing all temple activities on the Property. Her adopted daughters
are either unwilling or unable to continue maintaining the temple.
Wishing to terminate the Trust and make provisions for the Property
in a will, Koh (together with the other trustees) filed OS 1021/2012 and
the decision of the Judge on that summons is the subject of the
present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
appellants initially sought to impeach the Trust on two grounds. First,
Koh claimed that she had no intention to give up beneficial ownership of
the Property absolutely when she executed the Trust Deed. Because
she and her aunts did not understand English, they did not read
the Trust Deed before signing it; neither did her lawyers explain
to them that this would be the effect of the Trust. But at the hearing
before the Judge, the appellants decided to abandon this ground.
Hence, the second and only ground relied on by the appellants at
the hearing below was that the Trust is not a valid charitable trust
because the use of the Property “as and for a home or sanctuary
for such Chinese women vegetarians of the Buddhist faith as may from
time to time be chosen by the trustees of this deed” (<em>ie</em>, Purpose B) is not a valid charitable
purpose. Accordingly, the Trust is void for violating the rule against
perpetuities, and there is a resulting trust of the Property in favour
of its original owners, of whom Koh is the only survivor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On
the other hand, the respondent argued that Purpose B was charitable
because it advanced religion. Significantly, he agreed in the proceedings
below that Purpose B was <em>not</em> for
the relief of poverty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
Judge held that the Trust was a valid charitable trust and dismissed
the application. With respect to Purpose B, he found that the phrase
“home and sanctuary” connotes “a religious institution where the defined
class of persons (of that religion) is looked after and finds refuge
or sanctuary” (at [31]). In his judgment, the use of the Property
for this purpose directly advances religion, as the persons residing
in the Property would have benefited from “passive advancement and
personal spiritual contemplation” (at [36]). Furthermore, despite
the respondent’s concession, the Judge found that Purpose B also
had the effect of relieving poverty, given that those who choose
to reside in the Property (with the approval of the trustees) are
likely to be compelled by special circumstances such as orphanhood,
poverty or dysfunctional family situations (at [47]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It
is common ground that Purpose A and Purpose C advances the Buddhist
religion and are therefore charitable. But that is not sufficient
to render the trust as a whole charitable unless Purpose B is also
a charitable purpose. Thus the proper construction of Purpose B
is the bone of contention. The appellants submit that Purpose B
is not charitable in nature. They aver that the Judge had erred
in reading words into Purpose B that were not there – that is, that
the Buddhist Chinese female vegetarians who choose to reside in
the Property are likely to be compelled by special circumstances
such as orphanhood, poverty or dysfunctional family situations.
Purpose B, as drafted, is not restricted to such individuals and should
not have been found to relieve poverty. Furthermore, even if the Judge’s
interpretation of Purpose B were correct, the personal spiritual contemplation
of the residents of the Property does not and could not advance
religion or confer a public benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
respondent contends that the Judge was correct in interpreting “home
or sanctuary” exegetically to mean a place of refuge for persons
who need care or have no home of their own. Such a purpose advances
religion because activities relating to social welfare undertaken
by religious bodies have been held to advance religion. The element
of public benefit is also present because the category of “Chinese
women vegetarians of the Buddhist faith” is capable of capturing
a sufficiently broad segment of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As
for the relief of poverty, the respondent now adopts the Judge’s view
that Purpose B does relieve poverty as well. He contends that the intention
to relieve poverty may be inferred from the very nature of the gift itself,
and it is not necessary for Purpose B to expressly stipulate that
the Buddhist Chinese female vegetarians who reside in the Property
must be poor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
following propositions are undisputed by the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
Trust must be a charitable trust to be valid. This is because (i)
the Trust is stated to be “in perpetuity” and would be void for offending
the rule against perpetuities (which does not apply to charitable
trusts); and (ii) the Trust is a purpose trust with no definite beneficiaries
and is void unless charitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Under
common law, if the funds of a charitable trust may be used for some
non-charitable purpose, it will not be a valid charitable trust:
see Hubert Picarda, <em>The Law and Practice Relating
to Charities</em> (Bloomsbury Professional, 4th Ed, 2010)
(“<em>Picarda</em>”) at pp 329–330. For it
to be a charitable trust, its objects must be wholly charitable: Peter
Luxton, <em>The Law of Charities</em> (Oxford
University Press, 2001) at paras 6.01–6.03. The common law position
has since been modified by s 64(1) of the Trustees Act (Cap 337,
2005 Rev Ed), which provides that no trust shall be invalidated
by reason that its purposes include some non-charitable and invalid
purpose as well as some charitable purpose. However, this provision
is not relevant here because it does not apply to trusts declared
before 14th July 1967.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     For
a purpose to be classified as charitable, it must fall within one
of the four heads of charity enunciated by Lord Macnaghten in <em>The Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income
Tax v John Frederick Pemsel</em> [1891] 1 AC 531 (“<em>Pemsel</em>”) at 583: (i) trusts for the relief
of poverty; (ii) trusts for the advancement of education; (iii) trusts
for the advancement of religion; and (iv) trusts for other purposes
beneficial to the community.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     Leaving
Purpose B aside, the other purposes of the Trust (see [6] above)
are charitable in nature because they advance religion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Thus,
the only issue before us is whether Purpose B, on its true construction,
is charitable because it falls within one of the <em>Pemsel</em> categories.
Only two of Pemsel’s categories are relevant here: trust for the relief
of poverty and trust for the advancement of religion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How should Purpose B be interpreted?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For
ease of reference, we set out again the terms of Purpose B:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As and for a home or sanctuary for such
Chinese women vegetarians of the Buddhist faith as may from time
to time be chosen by the trustees of this deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It
is trite that the principle of benignant construction applies to charitable
gifts – in other words, where a bequest is capable of two constructions,
one of which would make it void, and the other would make it effectual,
the latter should be adopted: <em>Tudor on Charities</em> (Sweet
&amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2003) (“<em>Tudor</em>”)
at para 4-002. On the other hand, the court must not strain the
will to gain money for charity: <em>Picarda</em> at
p 354.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As
mentioned at [14] above, the Judge’s interpretation of Purpose B hinged
on the meaning he ascribed to the phrase “home or sanctuary”. First,
he considered the dictionary definitions of “home” and “sanctuary” separately,
as follows (at [25]–[26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The <em>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</em> (Oxford
University Press, 6th ed, 2007) (Volume 2) has several definitions
for “sanctuary” (at p 2661), two of which are relevant to the language
of Purpose B:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>1</b> A building
or place set apart for the worship of a god or gods; a church; a
temple. Also (<em>arch</em>.), a church or
body of believers; a priestly office or order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>5 a</b> Orig.,
a church or order sacred place in which, by the law of the medieval
church, a fugitive or debtor was immune from arrest. Later <em>gen</em>., any place in which a similar immunity
is granted to a fugitive; a place of refuge and safety. <b>b</b> Immunity from arrest or punishment, secured
by taking refuge in a sanctuary; the right or privilege of such protection;
shelter, refuge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2"> </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The <em>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</em> (<em>ibid.</em>) (Volume 1) also has several relevant
definitions for “home” (at p 1266):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>2</b> The place
where one lives permanently, esp. as a member of a family or household;
a fixed place of residence. Freq. without article or possessive,
esp. as representing the centre of family life. [“Definition 2”]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>4</b> A place
or region to which one naturally belongs or where one feels at ease.
Also <em>spiritual home</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>6</b> An institution
looking after people etc. who need care or have no home of their
own. [“Definition 6”]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     He
found that the most apt definition for “home” was Definition 6 (“[a]n
institution looking after people <em>etc</em> who
need care or have no home of their own”), and the most apt definition
for “sanctuary” was “a place of refuge and safety”. He then held
at [31] that because there was a sufficient overlap in the meaning
between “home” and sanctuary”, the phrase “home or sanctuary” should
be interpreted exegetically and not conjunctively as true alternatives.
In other words, instead of applying Definition 2 of “home” as a
place of residence and construing it as an alternative use to which
the Property might be put (thereby rendering Purpose B not exclusively charitable),
the Judge read “home or sanctuary” as a phrase whereby “sanctuary”
is a synonym that <em>explains</em> the true
meaning of the word “home”, which is not Definition 2 but Definition
6. Thus, Purpose B does not allow the trustees to use the Property
as a place of residence for <em>any</em> Buddhist
Chinese female vegetarian but only those who are homeless or otherwise
in need of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     With
respect, we are unable to agree with the Judge’s interpretation
of Purpose B as it is inconsistent with the express terms of the
Trust Deed as well as the circumstances prevailing at the time the
Trust Deed was executed. First, it is contradicted by cl 4, which
confers on the trustees the “absolute and uncontrolled discretion”
to select the persons who may reside in the Property. Equally significant
is the fact that the Trust Deed nowhere states that only destitute
or needy persons would be allowed to reside in the Property. Indeed
this omission is completely in line with the intention as expressed
in cl 4. Second, the Judge’s interpretation is inconsistent with
the circumstances surrounding the execution of the Trust Deed. The uncontroverted
evidence indicates that Koh had never meant to restrict the class
of persons who could reside on the Property to <em>needy</em> Buddhist Chinese
female vegetarians. Before the Trust was declared, Koh stayed on the
Property together with her Aunts, and this did not change even after
the Trust was declared. Beside Koh and her Aunts, the only people
who had ever stayed on the Property were her relatives, and there
is no evidence that these individuals were homeless or in need of
care. In short, the Property was at all times used as a private
residence rather than as an institution or place of refuge for needy
individuals. Given this factual matrix, we do not think it was justified
for the Judge to infer and conclude that the Buddhist Chinese female
vegetarians who choose to reside in the Property (with the approval
of the trustees) are likely to be compelled by unfortunate circumstances
such as poverty or family dysfunction to live there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We
note that the respondent has contended that the intentions of the settlor
should be inferred from the Trust Deed as a whole, and that the actual
use of the Property as a private residence by Koh and the trustees should
be regarded as a breach of trust instead of causing the trust to
fail.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> But this is plainly a circular
argument, as whether or not there has been a breach of trust depends
on how this Court should construe Purpose B. We further reject the
proposition that extrinsic evidence should be ignored when interpreting
a trust deed. While purely subjective and uncorroborated evidence
by a settlor as to his intentions at the time the trust deed was drafted
is inadmissible (<em>Tudor</em> at para 4-004), <em>objective</em> evidence of the settlor’s intent
is highly relevant in construing a trust deed, especially in cases
where its language is ambiguous. As stated in <em>Picarda</em> (at
p 358):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Naturally the contemporaneous acts of the
donor are of particular importance for the purpose of construing
a deed of gift executed by him. Evidence is also admissible of the
early application or distribution of the fund, and of the construction
placed on doubtful questions which arose in the early administration
of the trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Likewise, <em>Tudor</em> states (at
para 4-008):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The contemporaneous acts and condition
of a donor are of the greatest possible importance for the purpose
of construing a deed of gift executed by him … So also the manner
in which the donor of the fund, if he was the first trustee, conducted
himself in distributing it, the contemporaneous application of the
funds, and contemporaneous deeds relating to the same charity, are
of importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Given that the word “home” in Purpose B is capable of multiple
meanings, including Definition 2 (a fixed place of residence) and
Definition 6 (an institution looking after people who need care
or have no home of their own), it is important to consider the contemporaneous
evidence to ascertain Koh’s intent when the Trust Deed was drafted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As
we have noted, Koh’s use of the Property both before and after the Trust
was executed demonstrates that she had intended to use it as a private residence
and not as a home for the needy. This is corroborated by the 16 August
1949 Letter, which stated that the back portion of the Property
was used for “dwelling purposes” by the owners (see [4] above).
As this letter was written in support of a request for property
tax exemption, one would expect that if Koh and her Aunts had indeed
meant to use the Property as a home for the needy, they would have
put this fact front and centre. Instead, their letter made it clear
that half of the Property was being used as a temple and the other
half as a private residence. There is also no evidence that this intention
had changed by the time the Trust Deed was executed – on the contrary,
this intention persisted as Koh has been living in the Property with
her relatives from 1960 till today. Thus, if the respondent’s contentions were
accepted, it would mean that Koh had set up the Trust with the intention
of breaching it from the very outset – a rather strange proposition or
outcome indeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
endorsing the Judge’s interpretation of “home”, the respondent also
cites the case of <em>In re Isabel Joanna James</em> [1932]
2 Ch 25 (“<em>Re James</em>”), in which Farwell
J held that a trust to provide a “Home of Rest for the sisters of
the Home of the Community of the Epiphany at Truro, the Clergy of
the Diocese of Truro, and such persons as the Mother Superior for
the time being of the said Home of the Community of the Epiphany
at Truro shall from time to time nominate and appoint” was charitable.
He stated (at 30–33):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prima facie at any rate, I think, a gift
of a fund or property for the purpose of founding and endowing a
Home of Rest is a charitable object. … It may be that to provide
a Home of Rest for a particular class of persons, who could not
be in any sense described as in need of such a home, would not be charitable;
but <em>prima facie in my judgment the words “Home
of Rest” themselves indicate something in the nature of a hospital,
although not strictly a hospital, that is to say, a home which is
to provide relief for those who are in need of it, not by means
of medicine or medical attendance, but by providing them with the
means and possibility of rest, and that is in my view in a true sense
providing for the impotent, and accordingly to provide a Home of
Rest is, in my judgment, prima facie a good charitable object.</em> If
that be so, if the provision of a Home of Rest is prima facie a
good charitable object, then it does not necessarily follow that
the gift will fail because some of the uses to which the Home may
be put might, upon a right construction of the language of the will,
be uses which would not be strictly charitable. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, looking at the terms
of this will, the object is to establish a Home of Rest, and the
persons for whose benefit that Home of Rest is to be provided are,
firstly, the Sisters of the Home of the Epiphany at Truro. That
is an association of ladies for the purpose of doing charitable
work. I do not think that it is necessary for me to consider exactly
what is the position of these ladies, <em>except
to say that from the evidence it appears that under the rules </em><b><em>the ladies who enter the community give up their
private means, and are themselves, therefore, without means</em></b><em>.</em> The lady who desired to found this Home
of Rest was anxious that among the persons who might benefit from such
a home should be those ladies who carry on what is I think clearly
a charitable work. Then there are the clergy, who are to have the
advantage of the Home. <b><em>The clergy of the diocese
are clearly persons who are carrying on charitable work.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But when one comes to the words “such persons
as the Mother Superior for the time being of the said Home of the
Community of the Epiphany at Truro shall from time to time nominate
and appoint,” they would indicate that the Mother Superior, who
is not a trustee, would have the widest possible discretion to appoint
anybody she pleased, irrespective of their means or any question
of that kind. I think that the words bear that meaning, but, <em>in my judgment, when one reads the clause as a whole
the duty of the Mother Superior (not because she is the Mother Superior
of this particular Home, or in any way owing to her position in
the Home, but owing to the fact that the object of the trust is
charitable) is </em><b><em>to nominate only
such persons as are properly suitable to a Home of Rest as a charity</em></b><em>, and if she were to nominate persons who were unsuitable
for such a purpose, it would, in my judgment, be the duty of the
trustees to refuse such nomination</em>. It is for the trustees
to see that the Home of Rest is used and carried on as a charity,
and, in my judgment, <em>the power of the Mother
Superior to nominate persons must be limited to that overriding
purpose, and only such persons as are suitable for the Home can
be properly nominated and appointed by her</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, however, <em>Re James</em> is
distinguishable from our case. In the first place, the use of initial
capital letters in “Home of Rest” indicates that the phrase was
meant as a specialised term and did not simply refer to a private residence.
Second, Farwell J was influenced by the fact that the named beneficiaries
such as the Sisters and the clergy were either without means themselves
or carrying on charitable work, and it would therefore be charitable
to provide them with a home. No such assumption can be made of “Chinese
women vegetarians of the Buddhist faith” – these women need not
necessarily be poor or destitute (see for example the case of <em>In re Sanders’ Will Trusts</em> [1954] 1 Ch
265 where a trust to provide dwellings for the “working classes”
was held not to be a trust to relieve poverty since “working classes”
did not necessarily mean to relieve the poor). Third, there was
no evidence of contrary intent on the part of the testator in <em>Re James</em>, whereas in our case there is
evidence that the donor of the Property – Koh – had regarded the
Property as a private residence and had administered the Trust as
such from the very beginning. Fourth, the wording of the clause
in <em>Re James</em> allowed Farwell J to
hold that the Mother Superior’s seemingly broad discretion to nominate
persons to reside in the Home of Rest was in fact restricted; this
is not possible in our case as cl 4 of the Trust Deed expressly
gives the trustees the absolute unfettered discretion to decide whom
they wish to permit to reside at the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     What,
then, is the effect of the phrase “or sanctuary”? Reading Purpose
B in context, the word “sanctuary” was probably used for its religious
connotations. It is clear from the Trust Deed as a whole and the surrounding
circumstances that Koh had meant to use the Property as a place
to conduct Buddhist worship; indeed, as mentioned at [3] above,
the Property was described as a “Chinese nunnery” in Koh’s 1957
renovation agreement. Consequently, the phrase “home or sanctuary”
is more likely to mean a residence for religious individuals who
would practise their faith in the course of their stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     We
therefore find that Purpose B does not require the trustees to allow
only homeless or needy people to stay on the Property, and cannot
be said to be charitable on the basis that it relieves poverty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does Purpose B advance religion?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The
next question is: does Purpose B advance religion because the individuals
living on the Property would likely benefit from passive advancement
and personal spiritual contemplation?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In
holding that it does, the Judge at [33] relied on a report by the Charity
Commission for England and Wales, <em>The Advancement
of Religion for the Public Benefit</em> (December 2008, as
amended December 2011) (“<em>English Charity Commission
Report</em>”), which stated that religion could be advanced
in two ways: (i) seeking new followers or adherents, and (ii) encouraging
and facilitating religious practice by existing followers or adherents
(at p 24). One example of the second way is “‘passive advancement’,
meaning leaving religious buildings open for people to enter and
benefit from personal spiritual contemplation and the provision
of property for retreat” (at pp 24–25).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     But
it is trite law that for a trust that purports to advance religion
to be considered charitable, there must be a sufficient element
of public benefit (<em>Picarda</em> at pp
111–113). In <em>In re White</em> [1893]
2 Ch 41 (“<em>Re White</em>”), Jenkin LJ
said (at 51): “A society for the promotion of private prayer and
devotion by its own members, and which has no wider scope, no public
element, no purposes of general utility, would be a ‘religious’
society, but not a ‘charitable’ one.” As the <em>English
Charity Commission Report</em> itself notes (at p 21):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a fundamental part of the public benefit
requirement is that the benefits that are identified must be sufficiently
available or accessible to the public. <em>So where
the practices of the organisation advancing religion are </em><b><em>essentially private or limited to a private group
of individuals</em></b><em>, this requirement
would not be met</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There
is a long line of authority stating that gifts in favour of individuals
conducting private religious worship do not satisfy the public benefit
requirement. We have already referred to <em>Re
White</em>. It suffices to cite four more such cases here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Cocks v Manners</em> (1871) LR 12 Eq 574 (“<em>Cocks v Manners</em>”), the testatrix bequeathed
her property to, <em>inter alia</em>, two
institutions. The first was a Dominican convent consisting of Roman
Catholic females living together by mutual agreement in a state
of celibacy, under a common superior, for the purpose of sanctifying
their own souls by prayer and pious contemplation. The second was
the Sisters of Charity of St Paul, an institution composed of Roman
Catholic women living together by mutual consent, whose primary
object was personal sanctification, and who, as a means thereto,
employed themselves in the exercise of works of piety and charity
in teaching the poor and nursing the sick. Sir John Vickens VC held that
the Sisters of Charity was a charitable institution because of their
social work, but not the Dominican convent (at 584–585):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The community of sisters at Selley Oak
is, in point of law, a voluntary association for the purposes of
teaching the ignorant and nursing the sick; and I cannot distinguish
it in this respect from any of the numerous voluntary associations
established in London, such as the Scripture Readers, Home Missionaries,
or Anglican Sisters of Mercy, in which zealous persons unite for
the purpose of performing charitable functions, taking out of the funds
of the association so much as is necessary for their own wants,
and extending their operations as their means permit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards the Dominican convent the case
is a little different, and more difficult. … A voluntary association
of women for the purpose of working out their own salvation by religious
exercises and self-denial seems to me to have none of the requisites
of a charitable institution, whether the word “charitable” is used
in its popular sense or in its legal sense. <em>It
is said, in some of the cases, that religious purposes are charitable,
but that can only be true as to religious services tending directly
or indirectly towards the instruction or the edification of the
public;</em> an annuity to an individual, so long as he spent
his time in retirement and constant devotion, would not be charitable,
nor would a gift to ten persons, so long as they lived together
in retirement and performed acts of devotion, be charitable. Therefore
the gift to the Dominican convent is not, in my opinion, a gift
on a charitable trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     
          <em>Cocks v Manners</em> was cited with approval
by the House of Lords in <em>Gilmour v Coats and
others</em> [1949] 1 AC 426. The latter case concerned a trust
in favour of a priory consisting of cloistered nuns who devoted
their lives to prayer, contemplation, penance and self-sanctification
within their convent and engaged in no exterior works. The court
held that the purposes of the priory were not charitable because
the element of public benefit was absent. In particular, Lord Simonds
rejected the argument that intercessory prayer by the nuns or edification
by example could constitute benefit to the public (at 446–447):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, I would speak with all respect
and reverence of those who spend their lives in cloistered piety,
and in this House of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, which daily commences
its proceedings with intercessory prayers, how can I deny that the
Divine Being may in His wisdom think fit to answer them? But, my
Lords, whether I affirm or deny, whether I believe or disbelieve,
what has that to do with the proof which the court demands that
a particular purpose satisfies the test of benefit to the community?
Here is something which is manifestly not susceptible of proof.
But, then it is said, this is a matter not of proof but of belief:
for the value of intercessory prayer is a tenet of the Catholic
faith, therefore in such prayer there is benefit to the community.
But it is just at this “therefore” that I must pause. It is, no
doubt, true that the advancement of religion is, generally speaking,
one of the heads of charity. But it does not follow from this that
the court must accept as proved whatever a particular church believes. <em>The faithful must embrace their faith believing where
they cannot prove: the court can act only on proof. A gift to two
or ten or a hundred cloistered nuns in the belief that their prayers
will benefit the world at large does not from that belief alone
derive validity any more than does the belief of any other donor
for any other purpose</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I turn to the second of the alleged elements
of public benefit, edification by example. And I think that this
argument can be dealt with very shortly. <em>It
is in my opinion sufficient to say that this is something too vague
and intangible to satisfy the prescribed test. The test of public
benefit has, I think, been developed in the last two centuries.
To-day it is beyond doubt that that element must be present. No
court would be rash enough to attempt to define precisely or exhaustively
what its content must be.</em> But it would assume a burden
which it could not discharge if now for the first time it admitted
into the category of public benefit something so indirect, remote,
imponderable and, I would add, controversial as the benefit which
may be derived by others from the example of pious lives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Next
is the case of <em>In re Warre’s Will Trusts</em> [1953]
1 WLR 725 (“<em>Re </em><em>Warre’s</em>”),
where the testatrix gave the residue of her estate to be held on trust
for, <em>inter alia</em>, the provision and
upkeep of “a retreat house”. Harman J held that such a purpose was
not charitable (at 728–729):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The testatrix proposed secondly what she
called a retreat house; this phrase is explained as meaning a house
devoted to a form of religious activity or inactivity which is known
as a “retreat,” and that is a well understood form of religious
experience in the Church of England. It is a retirement from the activities
of the world for a space of time for religious contemplation and
the cleansing of the soul. No doubt that it is a highly beneficial
activity for the person who undertakes it, but it is not an activity,
which for the reasons so often set out in English law is a charitable
activity. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Activities which do
not in any way affect the public or any section of it are not charitable. </em>
<em>Pious contemplation and prayer are no doubt good
for the soul, and may be of benefit by some intercessory process,
of which the law takes no notice, but they are not (legally speaking)
charitable activities.</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The respondent points out that <em>Re Warre’s</em> has
been criticised by <em>Tudor</em> and <em>Picarda</em> as being wrongly decided.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The
authors of those textbooks argue that there is public benefit in
a diocesan retreat house because it is open to any member of the
Church of England, and individual retreatants return to the outside
world after their short stay to mingle with their fellow citizens.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> As
argued by <em>Picarda</em> (at p 128):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There is surely a material difference
between a closed religious community consisting of private individuals
working out their own salvation in private and a retreat house to
which members of the public resort for only a very limited period
of time and possibly only once. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">But this argument, even if accepted, would not apply to the
present case where the clear intent of Purpose B was to create a
long term residence for individuals selected by the trustees, and
not a temporary religious retreat that any Buddhist Chinese female
vegetarian can resort to. And while we accept that some mingling
between the residents and the public might occur when the Property
is open to the public four times a year for the public to participate
in the religious activities, such sporadic interaction and participation
is simply insufficient to change the essentially private character
of Purpose B. In any event, we would underscore the fact that the terms
of the Trust, in particular Purpose B, do not require the trustees
to open the Property and allow the public to reside therein temporarily
for the purposes of a retreat. It was because of this aspect of
public participation in retreats in <em>Re Warre’s</em> that
academic writers viewed that case as being wrongly decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Last,
but not least, there is the local case of <em>Re
Chionh Ke Hu, Deceased</em> [1964] MLJ 270, where the executors
of a will were directed to distribute some shares to “such persons
professing or practising the Buddhist religion” as the executors
in their absolute discretion thought fit. The High Court found that
the trust did not advance the Buddhist faith as there was no element
of public benefit, and held that it was not a charitable trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Therefore,
even if Purpose B can be said to advance religion in the sense that
the women selected to live on the Property would benefit from “passive
advancement”, we find that it does not benefit the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Before
leaving this issue, we would also like to address briefly the appellants’
argument that Purpose B does not satisfy the public benefit requirement
because the category of “Chinese women vegetarians of the Buddhist
faith” is too small. In this regard, the appellants rely on <em>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Baddeley and others</em> [1955]
1 AC 572, where Viscount Simonds apparently said in <em>obiter</em> that
a charitable trust might fail the public benefit test if it restricted
access to something of general utility only to a selected body of
public. But it is clear on a reading of Viscount Simonds’ remarks
that he was referring to the <em>fourth</em> head
of charity, <em>viz</em>, other purposes
beneficial to the community. This is plain from the following extracts
(at 590–592):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… as I have said elsewhere, it is possible
… <em>that a different degree of public benefit
is requisite according to the class in which the charity is said
to fall.</em> But it is said that if a charity falls within
the <em>fourth class</em>, it must be for
the benefit of the whole community or at least of all the inhabitants
of a sufficient area. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, however, in my opinion, particularly
important <em>in cases falling within the fourth
category</em> to keep firmly in mind the necessity of the
element of general public utility, and I would not relax this rule.
For here is a slippery slope. In the case under appeal the intended
beneficiaries are a class within a class; they are those of the
inhabitants of a particular area who are members of a particular
church: the area is comparatively large and populous and the members
may be numerous. But, if this trust is charitable for them, does
it cease to be charitable as the area narrows down and the numbers
diminish? …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Somewhat different considerations arise
if the form, which the purporting charity takes, is something of
general utility which is nevertheless made available not to the
whole public but only to a selected body of the public—an important
class of the public it may be. For example, a bridge which is available
for all the public may undoubtedly be a charity and it is indifferent how
many people use it. <em>But confine its use to
a selected number of persons, however numerous and important: it
is then clearly not a charity. It is not of general public utility:
for it does not serve the public purpose which its nature qualifies
it to serve.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bearing this distinction in mind, though
I am well aware that in its application it may often be very difficult
to draw the line between public and private purposes, I should in
the present case conclude that <em>a trust cannot qualify
as a charity within the fourth class</em> in [<em>Pemsel</em>]
if the beneficiaries are a class of persons not only confined to
a particular area but selected from within it by reference to a
particular creed. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the fact that Purpose B is restricted to Buddhist Chinese
female vegetarians does not <em>ipso facto</em> strip
it of public benefit. As we have found, the real reason why the
Trust fails the public benefit requirement is that Purpose B only
benefits the handful of Buddhist Chinese vegetarian women, who need
not be poor, chosen in the absolute discretion of the trustees to
live on the Property. Those women were, in fact, simply Koh’s close
friends and relatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is Purpose B merely ancillary
to the other charitable purposes of the Trust?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
Judge held in the alternative that even if Purpose B, read alone, does
not strictly constitute the advancement of religion, it is merely ancillary
to the overriding charitable intention of the Trust to advance religion
and therefore would not render the Trust non-charitable. In defence
of the Judge’s holding, the respondent referred us to certain authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In <em>Presbyterian Church (New South Wales) Property Trust
v Ryde Municipal Council</em> [1978] 2 NSWLR 387 (“<em>Presbyterian Church</em>”), the New South Wales
Court of Appeal had to consider whether a trust of land in favour
of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in New South Wales was charitable.
It was found that the land had to be used for the purposes of the Presbyterian
Church, which was primarily the advancement of religion but also
included other purposes which were non-charitable in nature. The
land was in fact used to build a home for the aged. Nonetheless,
the court held that the trust was charitable because it was for
the advancement of religion. Glass JA explained (at 393):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the Presbyterian Church is an organization
whose main purpose is the advancement of religion, although it doubtless
has incidental and ancillary purposes of a non-charitable kind.
If a body holds property on trust for purposes of that kind it is
proper to describe it as a public charity. What was said by the
High Court in <em>Thistlethwayte’s</em> case
[(1952) 87 CLR 375 at 442] respecting the Congregational Union applies
with equal force, in my opinion, to the Trust: “We are concerned
with the question whether a particular corporate body is a charitable
institution. Such a body is a charity even if some of its incidental
and ancillary objects, considered independently, are non-charitable.
The main object of the Union is predominantly the advancement of
religion … <em>an institution is a charitable institution
if its main purpose is charitable although it may have other purposes
which are merely concomitant and incidental to that purpose</em>.
The fundamental purpose of the Union is the advancement of religion.
It can create, maintain and improve educational, religious and philanthropic
agencies only to the extent to which such agencies are conducive
to the achievement of this purpose.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mahoney JA similarly held as follows (at 408):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion, it is proper to recognize
that, <em>where a gift is made to a church or equivalent
body as such, the gift may be upheld as for the advancement of religion,
notwithstanding that the church has purposes which extend beyond the
purposes which are</em>, in the conventional formulation as
set out in such cases as the <em>Keren Kayemeth</em> case
[[1931] 2 KB 465]. There is, in my opinion, a proper basis for recognizing
that, where what is involved is a church, such a body has necessarily
a direct connection with, or influence on, the advancement of religion
in the relevant sense, so that it should be recognized as charitable,
even though its property may be applied to some purposes which,
were they purposes of bodies of a different kind, would not be seen
as charitable purposes. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In <em>Neville Estates Ltd v Madden and others</em> [1962]
1 Ch 832 (“<em>Neville Estates</em>”), the
issue was whether a trust of land to a synagogue was charitable.
The trust deed included a clause authorising the trustees of the synagogue
to establish, <em>inter alia</em>, halls
for religious and social purposes, pursuant to which the synagogue
had erected a communal hall near the synagogue building in which
social functions were held. Cross J held that this did not render
the trust non-charitable because the social activities were merely
ancillary to the religious activities (at 851–852):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The chief purposes which a synagogue exists
to achieve are the holding of religious services and the giving
of religious instruction to the younger members of the congregation.
But just as today church activity overflows from the church itself
to the parochial hall, with its whist drives, dances and bazaars,
so many synagogues today organise social activities among the members.
… The plaintiffs … argue that the trust in this case is open to
the objections which proved fatal to the trust for the foundation
of a community centre which came before the court in <em>Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Baddeley</em>.
But in my judgment there is a great difference between that case and
this. <em>Here the social activities are merely
ancillary to the strictly religious activities</em>. … [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     We
agree that a trust in favour of a religious entity like a church
or a synagogue would generally be charitable despite the fact that
the entity also engages in ancillary activities which are not in
and of themselves charitable. But we do not think that this principle
applies here. Unlike the trusts in <em>Presbyterian
Church</em> and <em>Neville Estates</em>,
the Trust in the present case is not a trust in favour of an established
religious entity whose primary purpose was the advancement of religion.
Instead, it is a trust allowing the trustees to use the Property
for <em>all or any</em> of three listed purposes,
including Purpose B. The trustees are hence free to use the Property <em>only</em> for Purpose B, <em>viz</em>,
as a residence for Buddhist Chinese female vegetarians selected
in their sole discretion. This is the vital aspect of the Trust
Deed which makes all the difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
Judge was alive to this difficulty. He sought to overcome it at [37]–[38]
by relying on the preamble to the Trust Deed, which states that the
settlors were “desirous of dedicating [the Property] to charity”,
and cl 1, which states that the Property shall be used for the listed
purposes under the name “Chee Teck Kwang Imm Tng” (<em>ie</em>,
Chee Teck Guan Yin Temple) (see [6] above). Such language, he held,
allowed him to construe Purpose B as being ancillary to the “overriding
charitable intention” of the Trust to advance religion. But it is
trite law that an unequivocal statement of a general charitable
intention on the part of the settlor is insufficient to render a
trust charitable if, on its true construction, its purposes are
in fact not exclusively charitable: <em>In re Sanders’
Will Trusts</em> [1954] 1 Ch 265 at 273. And the mere fact
that the Property is to be named “Chee Teck Kwang Imm Tng” cannot
override the express words of cl 1, which state that the trustees may
use the Property for “all or any” of the listed purposes, thereby
giving them the discretion <em>not</em> to
use it as a temple at all despite its name. It thus cannot be said
that the overriding object of the Trust is to advance religion, with
Purpose B being merely ancillary to that purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Moreover, <em>Picarda</em> states (at 333–334) that if a
non-charitable activity or benefit is an independent object of the
trust (<em>ie</em>, it is an end in itself
and not merely the means to or consequence of some other charitable
end), then the trust is not exclusively charitable. The leading
case cited by <em>Picarda</em> for this proposition
is <em>Oxford Group v Inland Revenue Commissioners</em> [1949]
2 All ER 537 (“<em>Oxford Group</em>”). In
that case, the appellant company sought exemption from income tax
on the ground that it was a body of persons established for charitable
purposes only. The appellant’s memorandum of association set out
its objects as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The objects for which the association
is established are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(A) The advancement of the Christian religion,
and, in particular, by the means and in accordance with the principles
of the Oxford Group Movement, founded in or about the year 1921
by Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(B) The maintenance, support, development
and assistance of the Oxford Group Movement in every way, and, in
particular, (subject to the provisions of s. 14 of the Companies
Act, 1929), by holding, administering and dealing with property,
including all or any of the property which at the date of the incorporation
of the association was held by trustees or nominees for the Oxford
Group Movement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(C) The exercise of all or any of the following
powers:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(9). To establish and support or aid in
the establishment and support of any charitable or benevolent associations
or institutions, and to subscribe or guarantee money for charitable or
benevolent purposes in any way connected with the purposes of the
association or calculated to further its objects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(10). To do all such other things as are
incidental, or the association may think conducive, to the attainment
of the above objects or any of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Tucker LJ noted that it was common ground between parties
that the “main objects” of the appellant were expressed in cll 3(A)
and 3(B), and held that although cl 3(A) was clearly charitable,
cl 3(B) was not exclusively so (at 539–540). But more pertinent
for present purposes was Cohen LJ’s reasoning. He held that although
cl 3(C) was not a main object, paras (9) and (10) thereof conferred
wide powers on the trustees to engage in non-charitable activities,
and thus could not be construed as being merely ancillary to the
main objects expressed in cll 3(A) and (B) (at 544–546):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the appellants … said that
where, as here, you have got no such provision … making each sub-clause
of the objects clause a separate and independent main object, you
must, when you have found the main object, construe the remainder
as ancillary thereto. Now, that may be true if you get no guidance
from the various clauses themselves, but I think counsel for the Crown
was right when he said that, <b><em>although sub-cl.
(C) is expressed to be only a collection of powers, the extent to
which they must be construed as subsidiary to the main objects under
sub-cll. (A) and (B) is defined in the sub-clauses themselves</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I turn to para. (9) of sub-cl. (C)
I find, first of all, that this paragraph authorises the establishment
and support of benevolent associations or institutions and the subscription
of money for benevolent purposes. <em>Prima facie</em> this
is not a charitable object, but it is said that the benevolent purposes must
be connected with the purposes of the association and calculated
to further its objects, and that, therefore, although <em>prima facie</em> non-charitable, it is ancillary
to a charitable object and thus itself charitable. … I feel, however, a
difficulty in reaching a similar conclusion here, for the power
given to apply money for benevolent purposes is not confined to
benevolent purposes which further the advancement of religion, but
to benevolent purposes in any way connected with the main object.
I think an institution could be connected with the advancement of
religion without being itself an institution for the advancement
of religion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Then, again, under para. (10) of sub-cl.
(C), the association is empowered to do, not merely things which
are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the main object,
but also such things as the association may think conducive to it.
In other words, the question which the court would have to decide,
if any activity of the association was being challenged as being <em>ultra vires</em>, would be not whether, in
the opinion of the court, the activity was conducive to the main
object, but whether the association, in undertaking it, had thought
it conducive. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am unable to hold that such wide powers
as are given in paras. (9) and (10) of sub-cl. (C) are merely ancillary
to the main objects specified in sub-cll. (A) and (B). For these
reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In
our view, Cohen LJ’s reasoning in <em>Oxford Group</em> applies
to the present case. Even if it could be said that the main object
of the Trust is the settlors’ overriding charitable intention to
advance religion, the language of Purpose B confers wide powers
on the trustees to decide who could reside on the Property without
any qualification that the individuals selected must be destitute
or must contribute in some way to the running of the temple or otherwise
do anything to advance religion. Purpose B therefore must be construed
as an independent object of the Trust, and, because it is not a charitable
purpose, it renders the Trust void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The property tax issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As
mentioned at [10] above, IRAS had reviewed the property tax exemption
for the Property in 2005 and determined that property tax was payable
retrospectively from 1 January 1999. But under s 6(6)(c) of the Property
Tax Act (Cap 254, 2005 Rev Ed) (“PTA”), a building is entitled to be
exempted from property tax if it is used exclusively for charitable purposes.
As there seemed to be an inconsistency in the position of the State
in levying tax on the Property on the one hand and maintaining before us
that the Trust is entirely charitable on the other, we invited the respondent
to file further written submissions on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Having
made inquiries with IRAS, the respondent conveyed the following
information to us:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     IRAS
did not have the Trust Deed in its file records. It made the decision
to levy tax on the Property based on (i) a form signed by Koh stating
that the Property was only used as a Buddhist temple by friends
and relatives and was not open to the public, and (ii) a site inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     Property
tax was only payable with effect from 1999 because of s 21(7) of
the PTA as at October 2005, which stated that tax shall not be payable
in respect of a property for more than six years prior to the property’s
inclusion for the first time in a Valuation List for any year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     If
it is proved to the satisfaction of the Comptroller that any tax has
been paid in excess of the amount with which any property is properly
chargeable, the owner of the property shall be entitled to have
the amount so paid in excess refunded, provided that the claim for
refund is made within five years of such excess payment: ss 6(13) and
6(14) of the PTA. By way of example, if a valid refund claim is made
by Koh in January 2014, IRAS may refund property tax from January
2009 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We
record these facts here purely for the sake of completeness, as
we do not think that our decision – which is based on a construction
of the Trust Deed and the application of trust law – is affected
in any way by this additional information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For
the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Trust is not a valid charitable
trust. We therefore allow the appeal and declare that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
Trust is void; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Koh
is the sole beneficial owner of the Property.</p>
