<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. The plaintiff and the defendant are both in the construction

industry. In 1998, the defendant obtained a sub-contract in respect of part of the work

for a project relating to the construction of a depot for the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit

System North East line (‘the project’). The project involved the erection of a

large number of concrete beams and columns over a large area. In September 1998, the

parties entered into a contract whereby the plaintiff agreed to sell and the defendant

agreed to purchase the plaintiff’s formwork system for use in the construction of the

project.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. In July 2001, the plaintiff filed this action pursuant to which it

claimed from the defendant the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) the sum of $1,032,987 in respect of the outstanding purchase price

  of formwork supplied;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) $339,460.19 as compensation for formwork which had not been

  returned; </p>
<p align="justify">(c) $270,741.68 as compensation for damaged formwork; and</p>
<p align="justify">(d) $895,700.77 as the cost of additional material supplied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In due course, the defendant filed a defence and counterclaim

whereunder it claimed the sum of $308,116.26 in respect of what it considered to be

overpayment to the plaintiff as well as costs which it incurred by reason of the

plaintiff’s breach of contract.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. The plaintiff subsequently filed an application for summary

judgment. The defendant resisted this application successfully and was given unconditional

leave to defend. The plaintiff appealed. I heard the appeal and allowed it, in part. I

ordered that the plaintiff be entitled to enter interlocutory judgment in respect of the

formwork which had not been returned by the defendant. Damages for this loss were to be

assessed. The defendant has appealed.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The contract</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The contract was not the normal contract for sale of goods. Although

it started by stating that the plaintiff had agreed to sell and the defendant had agreed

to buy what was described as the ‘THYSSEN HUNNEBECK FORMWORK SYSTEM for Refurbished

KST Table Form and Refurbished Manto Column Form’, and set out the lump sum price

payable for the same (S$3,000,000 plus GST) it then contained a buy back guarantee. This

read as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘1.2 BUY BACK PRICE </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Buyer [the defendant] guarantees to sell-back and the Seller [the

    plaintiff] agrees to buy-back 40% of all standard sale equipment from the Buyer as

    follows:</p>

</table>
<p align="justify">*This Buy-back Price will be subject to variation due to lost or

    damaged equipment. The Seller will be entitled to compensation for the cost of lost

    equipment as per Appendix B, C, &amp; D (refer to Buy-Back Terms &amp; Conditions Appendix

    A).’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It should also be noted that under clause 6, payment for the formwork

had to be made upon delivery of the same and that the amount of the payment was the net

value after deduction of the buy-back price. Thus, in the first instance, the plaintiff

would receive only the ultimate price of $1,920,000 and not the original lump sum price of

$3,000,000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. Under clause 2 of the contract, the parties agreed on the area of

formwork to be delivered in respect of each type to be supplied. The plaintiff also agreed

under clause 2.3 to supply the defendant with additional formwork on loan without rental

charges in the event that acceleration of the project was required provided that the

defendant gave the plaintiff four weeks advance written notice. It was specifically

provided that if loan equipment was lost, the plaintiff would be compensated for the lost

of the equipment in the manner set out in Appendices B, C and D of the contract.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. There were also clauses in the contract relating to the fabrication

of the formwork. Under clause 3 the plaintiff was obliged to provide the defendant with

all necessary shop drawings for the first application of the materials related to the

system formwork. It had also to provide two site supervisors at the project site for a

period of six months for the purpose of assembly, erection and operation of the system

formwork. Under clause 9 it was specified that the defendant was to provide adequate

labourers/site personnel who were to liase closely with the plaintiff’s site

supervisor during the fabrication, erection and dismantling of the formwork on site.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Parties’ contentions</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. In the first affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff in support

of its order 14 application, its general manager, Mr Prins, dealt briefly with the claim

for lost formwork. He pointed out that under clause 1.2 of the contract, the plaintiff was

entitled to compensation for the cost of lost formwork as set out in the Appendices to the

contract. He went on to assert that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation of

$339,460.19 (inclusive of GST) for the cost of lost formwork and referred to a schedule

annexed to his affidavit. This schedule was a document prepared by the plaintiff which

contained very brief details of the type of formwork lost together with the cost of the

same. Nine types of formwork were specified but there were no details of the number of

individual pieces lost nor the total area of the lost pieces.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. In  22 and  23 of its defence and counterclaim, the defendant

had asserted that under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was obliged to fabricate

the formwork and/or supply the formwork in pre-assembled form ready for use by the

defendant. In breach of such obligation, the plaintiff failed to fabricate the formwork

and/or supply it in pre-assembled form. Due to the plaintiff’s said breach of

contract, many of the materials and items supplied had to be cut and consumed in the

fabrication and assembly undertaken by the defendant. Accordingly, the quantities of the

materials returned could not tally with the quantities supplied. The defendant asserted

that the non-return of formwork was therefore due to the plaintiff’s own breach of

contract and the plaintiff’s claim was not maintainable. This assertion was

reiterated in the affidavit filed by Mr Teo Hock Chwee, the defendant’s managing

director, in the order 14 proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. Mr Prins replied to Mr Teo’s affidavit. He disputed the

assertion that the plaintiff had any obligation to fabricate the formwork and/or supply it

in pre-assembled form as alleged. He said that it was not possible to pre-assemble the

formwork and then take it to the construction site because of the sheer size of the

formwork. There was, in fact, a designated area within the construction site for

fabrication of the formwork. Mr Prins pointed out that under clause 3 of the contract, the

plaintiff’s obligation was to provide two site supervisors to supervise the assembly,

erection and operation of the formwork on site. He also said that although the plaintiff

gave the defendant a quotation of $2,100,000 (sale price less buy-back price) for the

supply of formwork, the defendant had itself given a much higher quotation for formwork to

the main contractor. The amount quoted by the defendant was $8,851,229. Mr Prins claimed

that the higher quotation showed that the defendant knew full well from the onset that it

was the defendant’s obligation to fabricate the formwork.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. In a further affidavit, Mr Prins elaborated on his assertion that

it was impossible to pre-assemble the formwork. He stated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of his

third affidavit that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘9. … Due to the height of the tables required, the KST Table

  Form used on this project was of the fixed leg type (as opposed to folding leg type). The

  pre-assembled KST Table Forms are several storeys high, as can be seen from the

  photographs annexed hereto and exhibited as ‘<b>MFP-17</b>’. It would not be

  possible to transport these to the construction site and the formwork has to be

  pre-fabricated on site in the configuration required, which would normally consist of six

  (6) legs along with KST heads and a flat table fixed to the top.</p>
<p align="justify">10. For the record, it should be noted that in many formwork systems

  such as the plaintiff’s Manto column forms, the moulds for the concrete are assembled

  before each separate casting. The speciality of the plaintiff’s KST Table Form System

  is that the table is pre-assembled out of a mixture of steel and timber components to form

  the finished table shape. These pre-assembled tables are then joined together to form the

  support of the slab table to be cast. After casting of the concrete slab, the tables are

  then separated and moved to the next casting area, and they are continuously used in their

  pre-assembled form.’</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Reasons</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant had

no ground on which to assert that the plaintiff had to pre-assemble the formwork before

delivering it to the site. The photographs annexed to Mr Prins’ affidavit showed the

massive nature of the formwork once assembled. The parties could not have contemplated any

pre-assembly of this formwork. The plaintiff’s obligation was to supply the

components of its formwork system and the defendant then had to assemble these components

into the structures required for the construction of the project. That this was so was

made quite clear by the contract which obliged the defendant to provide sufficient labour

for the assembly and also required the plaintiff to have two supervisors on site for a

period of six months. If the assembly was to take place prior to delivery there would have

been no need for the plaintiff’s supervisors to go to the site at all let alone for

such a long period.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. It was also provided in the contract that the defendant was to be

responsible for the maintenance of the equipment during the construction period and to

keep it in good working condition. On completion of the project, the defendant was

responsible for the dismantling and rounding up of all the parts and bringing them back to

street level. These provisions of the contract were also contrary to the defendant’s

submission about pre-assembly. If the defendant had nothing to do with the assembly of the

formwork and it could be delivered in pre-assembled condition, it did not need to have any

responsibility for dismantling since such pre-assembled formwork could also be redelivered

in the same condition.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The defendant had admitted that it had, in putting pieces of the

formwork together for the purposes of the project, cut and consumed parts of the formwork

in this fabrication and assembly work. It had further admitted that accordingly the

quantities of the materials returned could not tally with the quantities supplied. The

defendant was the purchaser of the formwork. If it wanted to rely on the resale provisions

in the contract, it had to be able to redeliver what it had purchased originally. It could

not do so. It was contemplated in the contract that it might not be able to do so and the

defendant agreed that in that event it would pay for those parts of the formwork that it

could not redeliver.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. In my opinion, the defendant had no defence in principle to the

plaintiff’s claim for the cost of formwork that was not redelivered and thus resold

to the plaintiff. The only reason why I gave interlocutory judgment to the plaintiff was

that the plaintiff had not sufficiently proved the calculation of its loss at $339,460.19.

I considered that it should at an assessment hearing produce the delivery orders and the

redelivery orders respectively and then quantify the number and type of pieces of formwork

which had not been redelivered so that the court and the parties could calculate the

amount due in respect of each of the lost pieces. The defendant would then also have the

opportunity of challenging the plaintiff’s calculations and/or documents to show that

more pieces had been returned than the plaintiff had given credit for.</p>
