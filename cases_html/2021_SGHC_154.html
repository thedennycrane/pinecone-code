These were SEAA Enterprises Pty Limited Trust (“SEPLT”) and SEAA Properties Trust (“SPT”) (collectively, the “Trusts”). The Trusts were managed by SEAA Enterprises Pty Limited, a company incorporated in Australia (the “Trustee Company”).

In December 2001, Mr Ding requested the auditing of these financial accounts and the inspection of the financial records of the Trustee Company. However, Mr Lee was not forthcoming with the audited accounts and the financial records. This led the defendants to assert control over Gracedale and the ACU Account in March 2002 by removing Mr Lee’s wife as a director of Gracedale and withdrawing Mr Lee and his wife as authorised signatories of the ACU Account (see <span class="font-italic">ANZ v Ding </span>at [9] and [15]–[29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Subsequently, around June 2002, the defendants instructed ANZ Bank to remit A$820,000 of the ACU Account Moneys to M/s Mei Leong and A$150,000 to Mr Choo for his consultancy services. However, these instructions were countermanded by Mr Lee’s wife. These conflicting instructions led ANZ Bank to file for interpleader relief in Originating Summons No 902 of 2002 (the “OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings”) on 1 July 2002.

The defendants’ position was that Mr Lee had agreed to relinquish control of Gracedale and the ACU Account to them. Hence, they had the authority to act for and on behalf of Gracedale in operating the ACU Account. Therefore, they had the authority to pay the A$820,000 to M/s Mei Leong as Mr Lee had previously agreed to this payment (see <span class="font-italic">ANZ v Ding </span>at [10]). On the other hand, Mr Lee’s wife argued that she and Mr Lee had never agreed to cede control of Gracedale and the ACU Account to the defendants (see <span class="font-italic">ANZ v Ding </span>at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings culminated in the judgment of Ang J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">ANZ v Ding</span>, which was delivered on 30 June 2004. In that judgment, Ang J found that there was indeed an agreement by Mr Lee to entrust control of Gracedale and the ACU Account to the defendants, such that they had authority to act for and on behalf of Gracedale in operating the ACU Account. However, Ang J ordered that the ACU Account Moneys were to be retained in the ACU Account until further order. This was because there were other unresolved issues which had to be determined with reference to Gracedale’s articles of association and the laws of the BVI, which were outside the scope of those proceedings. In particular, whether 144 Gracedale bearer shares had been properly issued on 24 July 2001 (see <span class="font-italic">ANZ v Ding </span>at [57]–[58] and [61]).

Thus, Mr Phua counterclaims against Mr Choo for an account and inquiry into all sums, interests, profits and assets arising from or traceable to the sale proceeds of the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares and for the same to be paid by Mr Choo to Mr Phua upon the taking of an account and inquiry.

He claimed that his case was supported by various documents which did not in fact support his claims, or which, upon further questioning, he was unwilling or unable to produce in court for inspection. On numerous occasions, while he was on the witness stand, he sought to correct alleged errors in the documentary evidence he himself had placed before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 At this point, I shall illustrate the enormously unreliable and sieve-like nature of Mr Choo’s testimony with some examples.

The 8 June 2013 Invoice stated that the fees owed to Mr Choo for services rendered from 2004 to 2013 were S$120,000 for advice and S$80,000 for attending meetings and discussions, amounting to an (incorrect) total of S$100,000. According to Mr Choo, the actual invoice was for S$100,000, but Mr Ding had instructed Mr Choo to change the fees for advice to S$120,000 and the fees for attending meetings and discussions to S$80,000.

</div> In my view, if Mr Choo had in fact been so suspicious of Mr Ding’s intentions, he could have declined to issue this invoice entirely, instead of deliberately voiding the 8 June 2013 Invoice. His explanation in court is incredible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In contrast, Mr Ding offers a far more logical and credible explanation for the incorrect figures in the 8 June 2013 Invoice. According to Mr Ding, when Mr Choo first issued the 8 June 2013 Invoice to him, he noticed that the total bill was incorrect. He told Mr Choo over the phone that there was an error in the invoice and Mr Choo told him to return the invoice for correction. Mr Choo then cancelled the figure of S$100,000, wrote the figure of S$200,000 in its place and returned the amended invoice to Mr Ding with the total corrected to S$200,000.

To appreciate this example, it is pertinent to give some background to the purported oral Melbourne Capital Agreement. As noted at [37(a)] above, Mr Choo alleges that an oral agreement was made in September 2000 under which Mr Phua agreed to pay him S$50,000 in relation to the recovery of the capital from the investments in the Melbourne Properties from Mr Lee. Mr Phua denies that there was such an agreement as Mr Lee was prepared to return the capital to the defendants. It was also in the parties’ second Agreed Statement of Facts that, “[b]etween 25–27 October 2000, Lee returned A$5.25 million out of the A$8.4 million [which Mr Lee had transferred without authorisation] to Lee, Ding and Phua in the proportion of 60%, 20%, and 20% respectively as a return of their capital investment in the Melbourne Properties”.

Mr Choo also affirmed in his affidavits that he only provided law-related business consultancy services even during the period when he had a practising certificate in force. Thus, Mr Choo made a carefully considered factual and legal concession that he was not relying on his practising certificate to legitimise his services to the defendants.

This is because ss 32–36 of the LPA were enacted to protect the public from claims to legal services by unauthorised persons. The agreement for Mr Choo’s legal services was formed when Mr Choo did not have a valid practising certificate in force.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The applicable law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As a preliminary point, I note that Mr Choo’s work was performed over a period spanning from 2000 to (on Mr Choo’s account) 2018. During this period of 18 years, several different versions of the LPA were in force. However, the relevant provisions are <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with the current version of the LPA and the parties have referred to the current version in their submissions, thus I shall similarly refer to the current version.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Section 32(1) of the LPA provides that no person shall practise as an advocate and solicitor, or do any act as an advocate and solicitor, unless his name is on the roll and he has in force a practising certificate. If a person does not have in force a practising certificate, he is an “unauthorised person” for the purposes of the LPA (s 32(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Pursuant to s 36(1) of the LPA, no costs in respect of anything done by an unauthorised person as an advocate or a solicitor, or in respect of any act which is an offence under s 33, shall be recoverable in any action, suit or matter. “Costs” are defined in s 2(1) of the LPA as including fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration. It is important to note that there are two disjunctive limbs of s 36(1): it bars the recovery of any costs in respect of anything done by an unauthorised person as an advocate or solicitor, <span class="font-italic">or</span> acts which are an offence under s 33. Hence, it is not necessary for an act to be an offence under s 33 in order for s 36(1) to apply. Section 36(1) will bar an unauthorised person from recovering his costs so long as those costs are in respect of acts done as an advocate or solicitor. Further, under s 36(2), any payment to an unauthorised person for anything done by him which is an offence under s 33 may be recovered by the person who paid the money.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Under s 33(1) of the LPA, an offence is committed by any unauthorised person who acts as an advocate or solicitor or agent for any party to proceedings, or performs certain acts as such advocate or solicitor, or wilfully or falsely uses any title or description implying that he is duly qualified or authorised to act as an advocate or solicitor:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Unauthorised person acting as advocate or solicitor</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">33.</span>—(1) Any unauthorised person who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) acts as an advocate or a solicitor or an agent for any party to proceedings, or, as such advocate, solicitor or agent —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) sues out any writ, summons or process;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) commences, carries on, solicits or defends any action, suit or other proceeding in the name of any other person, or in his own name, in any of the courts in Singapore; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) draws or prepares any document or instrument relating to any proceeding in the courts in Singapore; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) wilfully or falsely pretends to be, or takes or uses any name, title, addition or description implying that he is duly qualified or authorised to act as an advocate or a solicitor, or that he is recognised by law as so qualified or authorised, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $25,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Section 33(2) of the LPA lists examples of specific acts that will fall within the prohibition in s 33(1). This includes an unauthorised person who, directly or indirectly, “draws or prepares any document or instrument relating to any movable or immovable property or to any legal proceeding” (s 33(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)), unless he proves that the act was not done for or in expectation of any fee, gain or reward.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The LPA does not define what it means to act as an advocate and solicitor for the purposes of ss 32(1), 33(1), and 36(1). However, the tests for determining when a person is acting as an advocate and solicitor were set out by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>. Chan JC noted that what constitutes acting as an advocate and solicitor could be inferred from the list of specific acts set out in what is now s 33(2) of the LPA, but that this list was not exhaustive of all the acts or services of an advocate and solicitor (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [14]). Having considered the text of the relevant provisions as well as case law from different jurisdictions, Chan JC said (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, two tests may be constructed from these authorities and the provisions of ss 29 and 30 of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Other than those specific acts listed in ss 30(1) and 30(2), an act is an act of an advocate and solicitor when it is customarily (whether by history or tradition) within his exclusive function to provide, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> <span class="font-italic">giving advice on legal rights and obligations</span>, drafting contracts and pleadings<span class="font-italic"> </span>and pleading in a court of law [the “first <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>test”].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) A person acts as an advocate and/or solicitor if, by reason of his being an advocate and solicitor, he is <span class="font-italic">employed to act as such in any matter connected with his profession</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[the “second <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>test”].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>concerned a firm of New York attorneys who had purported to represent one party (the subcontractor) in the arbitration proceedings. The other party to those proceedings (the contractor) had applied for an interim injunction restraining the New York attorneys from acting in the arbitration, on the ground that this would contravene the then s 29(1) or s 30(1) of the LPA (now s 32(1) and s 33(1) of the LPA). It was undisputed that the New York attorneys would be providing services which included advising on the subcontractor’s rights and liabilities under the subcontract between the parties and drafting such documents as might be required for the arbitration (see <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [4]–[5], [7] and [10]). Applying the two <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>tests, Chan JC found that it was “beyond any doubt” that the New York attorneys would be acting as advocates and solicitors in providing their services to the subcontractor. The first <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>test was satisfied as these were “services customarily provided by advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court” and indeed could be said to “constitute the core services of the legal profession”. The second <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>test was also satisfied as the New York attorneys’ employment in the arbitration proceedings was “in connection with their profession as attorneys and because they [were] attorneys”, rather than in “some other non-legal capacity” (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [21]). Consequently, Chan JC found that the New York attorneys’ representation of the subcontractor in the arbitration proceedings in Singapore would contravene the then-s 29(1) and/or s 30(1) of the LPA and ordered the interim injunction to be made permanent (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [35]). Chan JC also remarked that even though the New York attorneys were acting in only one dispute, the “degree and duration” of their participation in the proceedings were “relevant factors to be taken into account”. In <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, the dispute was “of a substantial character which [might] take a long time to be resolved by arbitration and/or in further proceedings by way of appeal”. Hence, they would be practising as advocates and solicitors for the duration of the case (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 While Chan JC’s remarks were made with reference to ss 29 and 30 of an earlier version of the LPA, these provisions are <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with ss 32 and 33 of the LPA (as extracted at [77] above) respectively. Further, in my view, the two <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>tests are equally applicable in determining whether an act was “done by an unauthorised person as an advocate or a solicitor” for the purposes of the current s 36(1) of the LPA. Following Chan JC’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, the LPA was amended to provide that ss 32 and 33 would not extend to arbitration proceedings. This was done through the introduction of what is now s 35 of the LPA.

</div> The purpose of this amendment was to overcome the “unintended adverse effects [of <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>] on the commercial reputation of Singapore as a centre for international arbitrations” and to “enable the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to be as competitive as the other centres”, such as Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong, which allowed foreign lawyers to appear in arbitration proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(27 February 1992) vol 59 at col 425 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Law)).

</div>
</div> Thus, only one of the tests needs to be satisfied for a person to be found to have acted as an advocate and solicitor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In particular, while the giving of advice on legal rights and obligations is not specifically listed in s 33 of the LPA, it is one of the quintessential services rendered by advocates and solicitors. In the words of the Supreme Court of Victoria in <span class="font-italic">Cornall v Nagle</span> [1995] 2 VR 188 at p 208, “the giving of legal advice, at least as part of a course of conduct and for reward, can properly be said to lie <span class="font-italic">at or near the very centre of the practice of the law</span>, and hence of the notion of acting or practising as a solicitor” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Based on the above, there are three types of work for which an unauthorised person cannot claim any remuneration and which are relevant in the present case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) work that he was employed to do as an advocate and solicitor in any matter connected with the profession of advocates and solicitors (the second <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>test);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) work done by him that falls within any of the specific categories set out in s 33 of the LPA (in particular, acting as an advocate or solicitor in preparing any document relating to any legal proceeding); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  work done by him that is customarily within the exclusive function of advocates and solicitors to provide (in particular, giving advice on legal rights and obligations) (the first <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>test).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 At this juncture, I would like to address Mr Choo’s arguments regarding the interpretation of the above provisions of the LPA. He submits that s 33 of the LPA states exactly the scope of services that an unauthorised person is disallowed from carrying out, and that the list of disallowed acts under s 33 must be exhaustive since they attract potential criminal sanctions. Accordingly, Mr Choo contends that the LPA places no restrictions on the following acts: (a) business consultants referring their clients to professional lawyers to commence legal proceedings; (b) business consultants giving inputs on legal issues during the course of their consultancy services; and (c) all types of consultancy work (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, mediation, negotiation, and drafting contractual documents) that may contain legal elements.

</div> To support this argument, Mr Choo relies on cases such as <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Bhaskaran Shamkumar</span> [2005] SGDC 147 (“<span class="font-italic">Bhaskaran</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mahadevan Lukshumayeh</span> [2005] SGDC 129 and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Jasvendar Kaur d/o Avtar Singh</span> [2006] SGDC 216, where the accused persons were charged under s 33 of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In my view, this argument is flawed for two reasons. First, in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, Chan JC expressly stated that acts other than the specific acts listed in (what is now) ss 33(1) and 33(2) of the LPA may nevertheless be acts of an advocate and solicitor (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [20]). Second, Mr Choo’s argument fails to consider the operation of s 36(1) of the LPA which, as stated at [76] above, has two disjunctive limbs. In this case, Mr Choo was an unauthorised person even though he was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court under s 16 of the LPA as he did not have a practising certificate in force during the relevant periods (see s 32(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA). Therefore, so long as the work done by him was done “as an advocate or a solicitor”, s 36 operates to bar his <span class="font-italic">civil</span> claim for fees charged in connection with that work. It is not necessary for me to ascertain whether he is guilty of an offence under s 33.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 This accords with the policy concerns underlying the prohibition on unauthorised persons acting as advocates and solicitors, namely, that members of the public should receive and pay for legal services only from those duly qualified and authorised to carry on legal work. The acts undertaken by advocates and solicitors have “grave financial and other implications on their clients, including potential loss of liberty in personal criminal matters” (<span class="font-italic">Bhaskaran </span>at [12]). Unauthorised persons who conduct themselves as advocates and solicitors undermine public confidence in, and the repute of, the legal profession. Furthermore, they also expose their clients to possible loss because they do not possess the necessary professional indemnity insurance cover (see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan See Leh Jonathan</span> [2020] 5 SLR 418 at [5] and [8]). Further, advocates and solicitors are subject to “a stringent set of professional rules and restrictions” (<span class="font-italic">Bhaskaran </span>at [12]), including rules relating to professional practice, conduct and discipline (in Part VI of the LPA), as well as rules relating to the recovery and taxation of costs (in Part IX of the LPA). While the rules and restrictions prescribed in the LPA may apply to both authorised and unauthorised persons, the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) (the “LP(PC)R”) do not apply to solicitors who do not have a practising certificate in force (see r 3 of the LP(PC)R). The LP(PC)R contains important and detailed rules governing legal practitioners’ duties to their clients and the professional fees and costs they can charge. The following observations made in <span class="font-italic">Bhaskaran</span> at [17] are worth setting out in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, the statutory prohibition against the practice of law in the absence of a valid practicing certificate is for the protection of the public. <span class="font-italic">Even though the accused may have the legal and personal ability to practice, he is immune from control, regulation and, in the case of misconduct, from discipline by the Law Society for any ethical or disciplinary matters.</span> Second, the client of a lawyer who is authorized to practice has <span class="font-italic">the protection and benefit of the high professional standards of care that the law requires of lawyers, as well as the authority that the courts do exercise over them</span>. Other safeguards include group professional liability insurance up to $1 million for each and every claim for civil liability that may be incurred by a practising lawyer, rights with respect to the assessment of lawyers’ accounts, rules regarding trust funds, and the requirements for the maintenance of funds financed by lawyers to compensate clients who have been victimized by dishonest lawyers. <span class="font-italic">In contrast, all such safeguards are absent in the case of an unauthorised person who acts as an advocate or solicitor.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 During his oral submissions, Mr Choo’s counsel sought to argue that there are alternative forms of recourse against unauthorised persons who act as advocates and solicitors, namely: suing such persons in court, prosecuting them for offences and relying on principles of contract law.

</div>
</div> This submission misses the point. The LPA and the LP(PC)R form a key part of the regulatory framework governing unauthorised persons who act as advocates and solicitors. To argue that the provisions of the LPA and LP(PC)R should not be given their full effect simply because other forms of recourse might also be available to those in the defendants’ position would severely undermine this regulatory framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Similarly, Mr Choo’s argument that he was a “legally trained business consultant”, and was, therefore, not governed by the LPA,

If the nature of the work done is in fact <span class="font-italic">legal </span>work, then the fact that it is provided by a self-styled “business consultant” is no defence under the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) My findings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is not disputed that Mr Choo did not have a valid practising certificate in force from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2006, and from 1 April 2014 onwards (see [40] above). Mr Choo was, therefore, an unauthorised person during these periods. With this in mind, I shall now consider whether the work done and services rendered by Mr Choo during the periods when he did not have a valid practising certificate fall within the types of work outlined at [84] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Work done in the course of employment as an advocate and solicitor</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I shall first consider whether Mr Choo was employed by the defendants to act as an advocate and solicitor in any matter connected with the profession of advocates and solicitors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Mr Choo contends that he never held himself out to be a qualified advocate and solicitor.

Prakash J remarked that, in the absence of an express agreement or express assertion of authority to act on the purported client’s behalf, one would need to show that an objective consideration of all the circumstances led to the conclusion that an intention to enter into a solicitor-client relationship ought fairly and properly be imputed to both parties. The implication that a solicitor-client relationship existed must be “so clear that the solicitor ought to have appreciated it” (at [58]). Mr Choo submits that he falls squarely within the facts of <span class="font-italic">Rabiah </span>because there was no formal document or contract, such as a warrant to act or letter of engagement, indicating that the defendants had engaged Mr Choo as their solicitor, and the defendants had also appointed various external counsel during the material time.

</div> During his cross-examination by Mr Ding’s counsel, he blamed it on Phillip Securities for putting these details about his legal qualifications on his name card and argued that the printing and distribution of his name cards were beyond his control.

</div>
</div> I find this explanation unsatisfactory. Phillip Securities must have sought Mr Choo’s approval on the details of his name cards before they were sent for printing. Mr Choo could have rejected the name cards and sought a reprint of the name cards without his legal qualifications. Even if I accept his explanation, Mr Choo could have chosen not to distribute his name cards or could have easily cancelled his legal qualifications from his name cards so as not to mislead others into perceiving that he could offer legal services for a fee. None of these steps were taken in this case. Indeed, by Mr Choo’s own account, he allegedly took steps to rectify the information on his name card around six months after it was given to Mr Ding in Kuala Lumpur.

</div> This attempt to rectify his name card belies Mr Choo’s argument that the words “Advocate &amp; Solicitor” were merely a reflection of his past work experience and qualifications.

</div> The problems that beset the defendants were disputes of a legal nature with Mr Lee and others. Hence, they sought legal advice and services from Mr Choo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In my view, it is clear that the defendants employed Mr Choo to act as an advocate and solicitor, rather than in some other non-legal capacity. Much like the New York attorneys in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span> who were employed in the arbitration proceedings “in connection with their profession as attorneys and because they are attorneys”, and not “to act as experts in the science of building construction or the valuation of works done under the subcontract or in some other non-legal capacity” (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [21]), Mr Choo was engaged by the defendants specifically for his expertise <span class="font-italic">in law</span>. This was the basis on which the defendants first engaged his services. This is also consistent with the work subsequently done by him in relation to the defendants’ various legal disputes. This is further corroborated by Mr Ding’s e-mail dated 9 July 2014 (the “9 July 2014 E-mail”), in which he stated that he had “fully trusted” Mr Choo and “act[ed] according to [his] advice” from the beginning, including appointing various lawyers, because he had been told by Mr Phua that Mr Choo had “very wide legal knowledge”.

</div> The grounds on which Mr Choo sought to distinguish his case from <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>are, therefore, not persuasive. In particular, the absence of a warrant to act or letter of engagement signed between Mr Choo and the defendants does not prevent the court from finding that the defendants, as laypersons, in substance engaged Mr Choo to provide them with legal services as their lawyer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The foundation of Mr Choo’s case in relation to the LPA is that he rendered business consultancy services, and not legal services, to the defendants.

</div> However, there is no evidence that Mr Choo provided the defendants with financial or investment advice relating to the Melbourne Properties. Instead, it is clear that Mr Choo was engaged for the purpose of assisting the defendants in disputes that were fundamentally <span class="font-italic">legal</span> in nature, from the negotiation of the 2001 Mei Leong Settlement Agreement to their long-running dispute with Mr Lee in various jurisdictions over the Melbourne Properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The case of <span class="font-italic">Rabiah</span> does not assist Mr Choo. In <span class="font-italic">Rabiah</span>, the plaintiff and the defendant, who were siblings, had entered into a joint venture to invest in properties in London. The parties’ relationship soured and the plaintiff brought a claim against the defendant alleging, among other things, that he had breached the fiduciary duties he owed to her as her solicitor. The defendant was a practising lawyer and had acted as the plaintiff’s solicitor when she was conducting her fashion business. The relevant issue before the court in <span class="font-italic">Rabiah</span> was, therefore, whether the defendant was acting in his capacity as the plaintiff’s lawyer for the joint venture<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Rabiah </span>at [51]–[52]). It was in this context that the court held that the defendant was not the plaintiff’s personal solicitor and that any advice he gave was given to her in his capacity as her business partner, with the aim of protecting and advancing the interests of the joint venture. Such advice was not directed to protecting or advancing the individual interest of the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">Rabiah </span>at [60]). Further, in <span class="font-italic">Rabiah</span>, the defendant does not appear to have received any remuneration for his advice. The circumstances of the present case are completely different. In this case, the issue is not whether Mr Choo has breached the professional duties he owed the defendants as their solicitor, but instead whether Mr Choo was engaged by the defendants to perform the work of an advocate and solicitor while he was an unauthorised person, and whether he should be allowed to claim fees for such work from them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Given that Mr Choo had rendered his legal services to the defendants (who are laypersons with regard to the law), it was incumbent on him to inform them that he was unable to render legal services to them because he did not have a practising certificate in force. However, Mr Choo did not do so.

In these circumstances, it certainly does not lie in Mr Choo’s mouth to argue that he “cannot be responsible for the impression [the defendants] had of him”, to shift the blame to the defendants for not conducting their own checks to ensure that Mr Choo had a valid practising certificate or that his qualifications were accurately stated.

Thus, although Mr Choo insists that he only provided the defendants with <span class="font-italic">business </span><span class="font-italic">consultancy </span>services, or legal <span class="font-italic">opinions </span>which the defendants were not obliged to follow, it is clear from the evidence that Mr Choo in substance gave the defendants advice on their legal rights and obligations.

Therefore, Mr Choo is barred from recovering any remuneration in respect of such work under s 36(1) (read with s 2(1)) of the LPA.

</div>
</div> This would be a wholly inaccurate characterisation of my findings above. It bears emphasising that this Suit was <span class="font-italic">commenced</span> <span class="font-italic">by Mr Choo </span>to claim an extremely large sum of over S$2m from the defendants as payment for his fees. In view of my findings that these fees were in respect of work done by Mr Choo as an advocate or solicitor while he was an unauthorised person, Mr Choo is statutorily barred from recovering remuneration in respect of this work. This outcome is the result of the application of s 36(1) of the LPA to give effect to the legislative object of “protect[ing] the public from claims to legal services by unauthorised persons” (<span class="font-italic">Turner </span>at [34]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 These findings are sufficient to dispose of Mr Choo’s claim for unpaid fees in respect of work done while he was an unauthorised person, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2006 and from 1 April 2014 onwards. However, Mr Choo did have a practising certificate in force from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2014. The question is whether he is also barred from recovering remuneration for work done during that period. Even putting aside Mr Phua’s submission that Mr Choo’s provision of legal services to the defendants breached the conditions imposed on him by the Law Society when he had a practising certificate in force (see [70] above), I am of the view that Mr Choo is also not entitled to claim his fees from the defendants during the period from 2006 to 2014 when he had a practising certificate in force as his remuneration was based on a champertous arrangement with the defendants, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement. This was evidenced by the Consultancy Agreement which was drafted by Mr Choo himself. As will be recalled from [30(a)] above, under the 20% Remuneration Arrangement, Mr Choo was to be remunerated 20% of the moneys recovered from the two Trusts (including the ACU Account Moneys) less expenses and allowances already paid to him. The champertous arrangement started in 2000 with the Choo-Phua 2000 Oral Agreement that resulted in the Consultancy Agreement in 2003 when Mr Choo was an unauthorised person providing legal services to the defendants and it continued into the period when Mr Choo had his practising certificate from 2006 to 2014. I shall explain below why I reject Mr Choo’s claim that there was an oral agreement that he would charge the defendants at the hourly rates of S$800 for ordinary work and S$1,200 for foreign issues and/or urgent matters. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Summary on the nature of the work done by Mr Choo </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In summary, applying the two tests set out in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, I find that the work done by Mr Choo for the defendants was work done as an advocate and solicitor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Mr Choo was employed by the defendants to act as an advocate and solicitor and the work he performed for them was done in this capacity. His contention that he was engaged by the defendants only as a business consultant is untenable. There is overwhelming evidence from the defendants that they always viewed Mr Choo as their lawyer and relied primarily on his <span class="font-italic">legal </span>expertise. The defendants did not have to rely on Mr Choo to assist them in financial matters (see [96]–[103] above). This finding is also buttressed by the fact that Mr Choo took no steps to correct Mr Ding’s perception of him as their legal adviser even after this perception was clearly communicated to him in Mr Ding’s 9 July 2014 E-mail (see [106] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Furthermore, Mr Choo <span class="font-italic">himself</span> described the work he did as “legal” work in written correspondence and written agreements with the defendants, the Invoices and his affidavits. His legal work involved preparing documents relating to legal proceedings, in particular, the drafting of the defendants’ affidavits. He also gave legal advice on the defendants’ rights and obligations. Indeed, even Mr Choo appears to have viewed himself as being engaged by the defendants to act as an advocate and solicitor (see [114]–[129] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Mr Choo was deeply involved in the preparation of documents relating to legal proceedings. His bare assertion that he had only <span class="font-italic">assisted </span>the defendants’ instructed solicitors in the drafting of these affidavits is belied by the defendants’ evidence, Mr Choo’s own Invoices and further breakdowns, as well as his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (see [116]–[122] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Mr Choo also gave advice on legal rights and obligations, although he insists that he only provided the defendants with <span class="font-italic">business </span><span class="font-italic">consultancy </span>services or legal <span class="font-italic">opinions</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> What is crucial is the substance of the work done and not the label attached to it. Mr Choo advised the defendants on matters including directors’ duties, fiduciary duties, <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>, limitation periods, equitable relief and potential criminal liability. This was legal work that should only have been provided for a fee if Mr Choo had a practising certificate in force at the relevant time (see [123]–[129] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 As Mr Choo did not have a valid practising certificate in force from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2006, and from 1 April 2014 onwards, he was an unauthorised person during these periods. Hence, he is barred by s 36(1) (read with s 2(1)) of the LPA from recovering any fees from the defendants for work done during these periods (see [131] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 However, I decline to grant Mr Phua’s application for an order for the refund of the various sums of money paid by the defendants to Mr Choo under s 36(2) of the LPA. The person who paid Mr Choo the fixed fee of A$50,000 and the settlement sum of S$200,000 was Mr Ding, not Mr Phua. Further, the payment of A$70,000 to Mr Choo for his travelling allowance does not fall within the scope of s 33 of the LPA (see [134] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Basis on which the parties agreed Mr Choo was to be remunerated</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 If, contrary to my findings above, Mr Choo’s claim for unpaid fees is not barred by s 36(1) of the LPA, the next issue to be determined is the basis on which the parties agreed Mr Choo was to be remunerated. This will also determine whether Mr Choo can recover his remuneration for work done during the period when he had a practising certificate in force. I shall first deal with the 26 alleged Invoices which Mr Choo adduces in support of his claims, which the defendants contend were fabricated by Mr Choo. As the parties’ cases are based on starkly different versions of what was agreed between them, I shall then examine each of the alleged agreements in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Invoices</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The Invoices were exhibited for the first time in Mr Choo’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim filed on 7 September 2018,

The Invoices are also not referred to in Mr Choo’s Statement of Claim in the present Suit. Indeed, as Mr Choo himself acknowledged during his cross-examination by Mr Ding’s counsel, the amounts claimed by Mr Choo in his Statement of Claim, the TKQP Letter of Demand and the Invoices all differ. He was unable to provide any explanation for these serious discrepancies, apart from claiming that this was an “error in calculation”.

Thus, even assuming the Invoices were prepared in 2016 (as Mr Choo claims), some of the Invoices went back to events that took place more than a decade ago. It is impossible for anyone to remember and recall in detail the work done that long ago without records.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 It is also unclear why the Invoices were not issued periodically when such huge sums were involved. Why were all 26 of the Invoices issued on the same day, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 August 2016? When I questioned him on this point, Mr Choo stated that he decided to issue all the Invoices at once because the defendants had agreed that he would only bill them for the full amount of fees upon the completion of the defendants’ various matters, and the matter relating to the financial accounts of the Trusts was only completed in 2016.

</div> However, I do not find this purported explanation convincing. It is implausible that the defendants would have agreed to only be informed of the total accrued amount of fees at the end of the matter if they were indeed being charged on an hourly basis. Mr Choo has not produced any evidence to support the existence of such an agreement. In addition, even if I accept Mr Choo’s explanation, it only accounts for his omission to <span class="font-italic">send </span>the Invoices to the defendants progressively. It does not explain why he did not <span class="font-italic">prepar</span><span class="font-italic">e </span>them progressively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Furthermore, Mr Choo explained in court how he prepared the Invoices. He said he first estimated the value of his work. Thereafter, he worked backwards by dividing the estimated value of his work by the number of hours spent to ascertain the applicable hourly rate. He explained his methodology of his billing on two occasions, one of which was in response to my request for him to clarify and explain how he prepared his Invoices.

Otherwise, it would have been almost impossible for Mr Choo to prepare these Invoices with reasonable accuracy so many years after the work was done.

</div> He makes two arguments. First, that the stark contrast between the absence of any documentary evidence of the alleged oral Melbourne Capital Agreement and Mr Choo’s tendency to reduce the parties’ various agreements (such as the LOAU 1, the Trust Agreement and the Consultancy Agreement) into writing shows that there was never any such agreement.

</div> Second, that there was no reason for him to engage Mr Choo for the purposes of claiming the capital invested in the Melbourne Properties, as there was simply no dispute with Mr Lee in relation to the return of the capital. Indeed, the capital was released by Mr Lee in October 2000 to Mr Phua without any dispute and without any involvement by Mr Choo. Mr Phua only became suspicious of Mr Lee some months after Mr Lee had returned the capital, as the profits were not returned at the same time as the return of the capital.

</div> The only documentary evidence before this court that could indicate the existence of such an agreement is Mr Choo’s alleged Invoice entitled “Claim Against Lee Wan Hoi for Recovery of Your Investment Capital in the Melbourne Properties”.

</div> The Invoice purports to charge Mr Phua a “[c]onsultancy fee (agreed)” of [S]$50,000, for work done from November to December 2000.

Therefore, Mr Choo’s legal services would not have been required from November to December 2000. I agree with Mr Phua’s submission that this is a serious contradiction in Mr Choo’s case.

</div> The first set of legal proceedings (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings) was only commenced in November 2001. There was, therefore, no reason for Mr Phua to enter into an agreement with Mr Choo in September 2000 to pay him S$50,000 for any services in relation to the recovery of the capital from the investments in the Melbourne Properties. There was simply no need for Mr Choo to be involved.

</div> Similarly, there was no need for legal advice on possible litigation in Australia relating to these properties. Furthermore, Mr Choo did not ask for payment of the S$50,000 from the defendants even after Mr Lee returned the capital to the defendants between 25 and 27 October 2000. Mr Choo did not seek payment of the S$50,000 until the invoice was prepared purportedly in 2016, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 16 years later! There is also no evidence that Mr Choo verbally chased the defendants for this payment. In my view, this is because there was never such an oral Melbourne Capital Agreement as alleged by Mr Choo. Otherwise, he would have asked the defendants for the S$50,000 soon after they were paid by Mr Lee in October 2000. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of Mr Phua’s evidence in this regard. Thus, the factual matrix suggests that the oral Melbourne Capital Agreement never existed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Mr Choo’s submission that the requirements of s 94(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) are satisfied

In <span class="font-italic">Coburn v Colledge </span>[1897] 1 QB 702 (“<span class="font-italic">Coburn</span>”), Lord Esher MR held that a person “who does work for another person at his request on the terms that he is to be paid for it, unless there is some special term of the agreement to the contrary, his right to payment arises as soon as the work is done; and thereupon he can at once bring his action” (at 705). The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Coburn </span>was a solicitor who sought payment of his bill of costs from the defendant. Applying this principle, the English Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff’s cause of action had accrued “the moment that the work which the plaintiff was retained to do was completed” (at 707). This was recently applied in <span class="font-italic">ICE Architects Ltd v Empowering People Inspiring Communities </span>[2018] EWHC 281 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">ICE Architects</span>”), where the court remarked that “<span class="font-italic">Coburn </span>is authority for the proposition that, absent a special term of the agreement, the cause of action accrues at the time of completion of works in a services agreement” (at [28]). The approach taken in <span class="font-italic">ICE </span><span class="font-italic">Architects </span>was applied by our High Court in <span class="font-italic">BMI Tax Services Pte Ltd v Heng Keok Meng and others </span>[2019] SGHC 9 (see [61] and [63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I see no reason why the principle articulated in <span class="font-italic">Coburn </span>should not also apply in determining when the cause of action accrues in contracts for services for the purpose of our Limitation Act.

As explained above, different principles apply in determining when the cause of action accrues under a contract for services.

As more than six years elapsed between 27 October 2000 and the date on which the writ of summons in the present Suit was filed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>5 July 2018), I agree with the defendants that even if the oral Melbourne Capital Agreement existed, Mr Choo’s claim thereunder would clearly be time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Summary on the oral Melbourne Capital Agreement </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In summary, Mr Choo has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the oral Melbourne Capital Agreement existed (see [161]–[164] above). There is no corroborative evidence to substantiate the existence of such an agreement other than Mr Choo’s bare assertions. The alleged Invoice for work done from November to December 2000, which Mr Choo relies on, is self-serving and is inconsistent with the fact that the capital from the Melbourne Properties had been returned to the defendants by 27 October 2000 uneventfully.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 At the time of the alleged oral Melbourne Capital Agreement, the defendants had a very good relationship with Mr Lee.

Therefore, there was no reason for Mr Phua to engage Mr Choo’s legal expertise and enter into the oral Melbourne Capital Agreement with him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I, therefore, find that Mr Phua did not agree in September 2000 to pay Mr Choo a fixed fee of S$50,000 for his legal services to recover the capital from the investments in the Melbourne Properties.

</div> On the contrary, none of the contemporaneous documents – including those drafted by Mr Choo himself and which specifically dealt with matters relating to his fees, such as the Trust Agreement, the Consultancy Agreement and the Tripartite Agreement – contain or make reference to any terms stipulating that he was to be remunerated based on his alleged hourly rates, or to any accrued time costs. Further, Mr Choo was the legally trained drafter of these documents, and had a tendency to reduce important matters (such as the parties’ agreements and his remuneration) into writing. Mr Choo was continuously engaged by the defendants for at least 13 years. During this long period, there were many opportune moments for Mr Choo to put these allegedly agreed hourly rates or accrued time costs in the written agreements or correspondence between the parties, yet this was not done.

</div> Although (as noted at [181] above) it is stated in the Consultancy Agreement that Mr Choo was engaged to attend to matters in respect of the OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings, the defendants’ position is that the Consultancy Agreement also covered work done for the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings.

Therefore, the work done for the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings also falls within the scope of the Consultancy Agreement.

The Consultancy Agreement deals with the scope of Mr Choo’s work for the defendants and the terms of his remuneration, which was based on 20% of the moneys recovered from the two Trusts including the ACU Account Moneys. In contrast, the Tripartite Agreement sets out the <span class="font-italic">priorities</span> of the defendants and Mr Choo’s claims to the ACU Account Moneys from three sources (namely, the alleged consultancy and retainer fees due from Ms Mei Leong; the alleged consultancy fees due from Mr Phua for services rendered in relation to the High Court case involving the settlement of the moneys with Phillip Securities; and the alleged consultancy fees due from the defendants for services rendered in relation to the various legal proceedings concerning Gracedale, as well as the expenses incurred in relation to those services).

</div> Similarly, the Tripartite Agreement made no mention of these alleged hourly rates, even though it specifically set out each of the parties’ claims to the ACU Account Moneys. The only explanation proffered by Mr Choo for not stating these rates in the Tripartite Agreement was that he “deliberately left it vague” because his rates would vary with the difficulty of the task and there were “just too many rates to fill in”.

</div> It would not have made any logical and economic sense for Mr Ding to engage Mr Choo’s legal services to claim his interest to the ACU Account Moneys. There is also no mention of the amount of these accrued time costs in cll 2.4(II)–2.4(III) of the Tripartite Agreement, which pertain to the fees due from the defendants to Mr Choo. This stands in contrast to cl 2.4(I) of the Tripartite Agreement, which states the total estimated fees due from Ms Mei Leong by 2012. Mr Choo’s only explanation for this omission was that he just did not “want to” or did not “make an effort to” crystallise the sum owed to him by the defendants.

</div> This explanation is similarly incredible and unbelievable. I agree with the defendants’ submission that if Mr Choo had indeed been engaged based on hourly rates, one would have expected him to inform Mr Phua that his fees had ballooned to an amount exceeding his maximum potential claim to the ACU Account Moneys, so as to let Mr Phua know that it was no longer financially feasible to continue his legal battle. It also beggars belief that Mr Phua would have continued to engage Mr Choo to act for him if he had any inkling of how much Mr Choo’s alleged accrued time costs amounted to by this point in time.

</div> However, these two positions are self-evidently different. During his cross-examination by Mr Ding’s counsel, Mr Choo admitted that the rates applied were “discretionary” and he was free to reduce or increase the rate charged depending on what he thought was fair for the work done because he was “not bounded by [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] company’s regulation”.

The written agreements that were entered between the defendants and Mr Choo at different stages after the sale of the Melbourne Properties by Mr Lee and the defendants were largely undisputed save for the interpretations of the terms of those agreements. The first written agreement was the Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement, which was reduced to writing in the 25 July 2001 E-mail from Mr Choo to Mr Phua in which the former set out his terms on which he was to be remunerated for his legal services. There was no mention of the rates of S$800 and S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour. In fact, the rates Mr Choo charged for preparing a legal opinion were between S$100 and S$150 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour depending on the difficulty and urgency of the matter. However, if Mr Choo was able to seek a complete settlement with M/s Mei Leong regarding Mr Phua’s Letters of Indemnity and the release of A$820,000 to M/s Mei Leong, Mr Choo would be paid A$50,000. This sum would include all legal fees to be paid to Mr Choo and other expenses incurred. In other words, the 25 July 2001 E-mail clearly set out the limits of the defendants’ financial commitments. Similarly, the Consultancy Agreement clearly set out the limits of the defendants’ financial commitments, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 20% of the amount recovered from the profits of the investments in the Melbourne Properties and the ACU Account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Therefore, it is not plausible that the defendants would have entered into an oral agreement with Mr Choo on the basis of the hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour depending on the nature of the work. The defendants would not know the extent of the potential legal costs that they would incur as there would be huge uncertainty on Mr Choo’s remuneration based on the high hourly rates. Indeed, Mr Phua testified that Mr Choo never told him that he would be charged these hourly rates and that if Mr Choo had, he would certainly have rejected Mr Choo’s services because he was unable to afford these rates at that time. In 2000, Mr Phua was in financial difficulty as he had incurred significant contra losses of around S$2.5m in the course of his work as a trader with Phillip Securities, which he was to repay in instalments over a period of 7 years.

</div> This was not disputed by Mr Choo.

If it were true that the defendants had agreed for Mr Choo to charge them based on hourly rates, I would have expected Mr Choo to send his invoices periodically to the defendants.

</div> The Invoice is not evidence of the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Phua) as it was recreated at least 16 years after the work under this agreement was allegedly done. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that Mr Phua would have agreed to Mr Choo’s high rates of S$800 and S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour in September 2000, given that he had incurred significant contra losses of around S$2.5m in the course of his work as a trader with Phillip Securities in 2000.

Furthermore, in terms of chronology, the alleged oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint), which allegedly contained the S$800 and S$1,200 hourly rates, was purportedly agreed one month before the 25 July 2001 E-mail. Yet there was no mention in the 25 July 2001 E-mail that the exorbitant hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200 would not be applicable. Mr Phua’s handwritten note on Mr Choo’s 25 July 2001 E-mail to Mr Lee and Mr Ding regarding Mr Choo’s charges in the e-mail also did not indicate or suggest that Mr Choo’s purported exorbitant hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200 would otherwise apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Mr Choo further submits that, if the defendants were prepared to pay him S$100 to S$150 <span class="font-italic">per </span>hour as a benchmark hourly rate for simple review and research work (as stated in the 25 July 2001 E-mail), he was fully justified in charging S$800 to S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour for more complex matters involving the Melbourne Properties.

For clarity, I emphasise that the issue is not whether the hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200 were extraordinarily high when compared to the hourly rates in the 25 July 2001 E-mail. Rather, the issue is whether there was, indeed, an oral agreement between Mr Choo and the defendants that Mr Choo’s legal services were to be charged on hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200. The discrepancy between the hourly rates alleged by Mr Choo and the hourly rates stated in the 25 July 2001 E-mail suggests that there was never such any oral agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 Having regard to the <span class="font-italic">ARS v ART </span>guiding principles set out at [160] above, the documentary evidence, the parties’ contemporaneous conduct at the material time and the factual matrix of the present case do not support Mr Choo’s claim that the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint) existed.

During cross-examination, Mr Phua explained that when he engaged Mr Choo in November 2000, it was on a contingent basis because he was “very broke” at the time and would only have agreed to an arrangement premised on the prospect that he might be able to gain or recover something in the future.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 The defendants allege that the Choo-Phua-Ding 2002 Oral Agreement was eventually evidenced in the Consultancy Agreement. The preamble to the Consultancy Agreement records an agreement made in February 2002 in Melbourne by the defendants to appoint Mr Choo to act for them in the recovery of moneys belonging to the two Trusts. Pursuant to this, Mr Choo was to be “remunerated on the basis of 20 percent of money recovered from the said trusts less all expenses and allowances advanced to [Mr Choo] so far”.

</div> This corroborates the defendants’ case regarding the existence and terms of the Choo-Phua-Ding 2002 Oral Agreement. This also coheres with the terms of the Consultancy Agreement, which clearly provided for Mr Choo to receive “20 percent of all funds recoverable from the two [T]rusts minus all expenses paid so far to [Mr Choo]” for the work done thereunder.

The OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings concerned the issue of who had the authority to act for and on behalf of Gracedale in operating the ACU Account. Thus, this work falls within the scope of the first clause of the preamble to the Consultancy Agreement, which refers to the defendants’ agreement to appoint Mr Choo to act for them “in the recovery of monies belonging to [the Trusts] <span class="font-italic">which includes money in Gracedale Technology Ltd</span>” [emphasis added]. While this clause does not specifically refer to the moneys in the <span class="font-italic">ACU Account</span> held in Gracedale’s name, it is not disputed that this refers to the ACU Account.

</div> In my view, this purported explanation is untenable as there is no evidence that the defendants agreed to these alleged hourly rates. Instead, they agreed to remunerate Mr Choo based on 20% of the sum recovered from the profits of the investments in the Melbourne Properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In addition, I agree with the defendants’ submission that Mr Choo’s position based on the high hourly rates is inconsistent with the Tripartite Agreement. Clause 2.4 of this agreement states that he was to be paid his fees for “services rendered for the Singapore High Court case involving the settlement of the moneys with Phillip Securities” (cl 2.4(II)) and “services rendered in relation to the legal proceedings in the Singapore High Court, the proceedings in [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] Australia Federal Court and the British Virgin Islands High Court concerning Gracedale” (cl 2.4(III)) from the ACU Account Moneys.

</div>
</div> This is consistent with the defendants’ case that, under both the Consultancy Agreement and the Tripartite Agreement, Mr Choo was to be paid for his work done in relation to OS 601 from the ACU Account Moneys. If, as Mr Choo claims, his remuneration under the Consultancy Agreement was limited to <span class="font-italic">OS 902</span>, it is unclear on what basis the Tripartite Agreement would subsequently have stated that he was to be paid for his work in <span class="font-italic">OS 601</span> from the ACU Account Moneys as well. Indeed, if Mr Choo was really to be remunerated for his work in OS 601 based on hourly rates, his fees would have been capable of being crystallised by the end of 2004 (after the conclusion of the OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings). Mr Choo could have claimed those fees from the defendants at that point. However, there is no record of any crystallised sum of fees save for the alleged Invoices. On the contrary, cl 2.4(II) of the Tripartite Agreement (which was signed in July 2012) only refers vaguely to the “[c]onsultant fee” due from Mr Phua, without specifying any amount.

</div> In his Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, Mr Choo attempted to rely on Mr Ding’s affidavit in the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings to show that the defendants admitted that they had agreed to pay him A$50,000 for each overseas trip. However, this was a misquoting of Mr Ding’s affidavit, and Mr Choo admitted that this was “wrong” and “ought to be deleted” (see [66] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 Mr Choo was also unable to explain the stark discrepancy between these alleged overseas fees and the overseas fees recorded in the Consultancy Agreement.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 I, therefore, find that there was no agreement to pay Mr Choo the alleged overseas fees, and that he is not entitled to claim these overseas fees or expenses incurred from the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Summary on the recovery of profits from the Melbourne Properties and the Yip Atech Shares Transaction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Mr Choo has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Phua), the oral Interpleader Agreement and the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint) existed. Mr Choo claims that he was entitled to charge hourly rates of S$800 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour for ordinary work and S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour for work on foreign issues and/or urgent matters under these agreements. However, there is not a shred of documentary evidence to support Mr Choo’s alleged hourly rates. In particular, these alleged hourly rates are not stated or alluded to in any of the written agreements between the parties, which were drafted by Mr Choo. He was unable to provide any satisfactory explanation for this omission (see [198]–[201] above). There were also inconsistencies between Mr Choo’s pleaded position and his testimony at the trial with regard to <span class="font-italic">when </span>these alleged hourly rates were agreed on, and even <span class="font-italic">what </span>these hourly rates were (see [202]–[203] above). Further, the absence of any contemporaneous time sheets recording the time Mr Choo spent on his work for the defendants strongly suggests that the alleged hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200 never existed. Finally, the evidence shows that the defendants would not have agreed to these exorbitant hourly rates (see [204]–[206] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 With regard to the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Phua), the only documentary evidence Mr Choo relies on is the Invoice for work allegedly done from September 2000 to June 2001. However, the Invoice alone provides no evidence of this agreement, especially in view of the defendants’ evidence that there was no dispute with Mr Lee in September 2000 and they also did not need Mr Choo to provide them with any financial services at this time. Further, given that Mr Phua had incurred significant contra losses in 2000, it is unlikely that he would have agreed to Mr Choo’s alleged high hourly rates in September 2000 (see [205]–[206] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 Regarding the oral Interpleader Agreement, the only documentary evidence Mr Choo relies on is the Invoices for work allegedly done from January 2000 to December 2003. Again, these Invoices provide no evidence of this agreement. Further, given Mr Phua’s testimony that he was facing serious financial difficulties in November 2000, it is unlikely that he would have agreed to Mr Choo’s exorbitant alleged hourly rates at this time (see [206] and [214] above). In any event, even if the oral Interpleader Agreement existed, Mr Choo’s claims for unpaid fees thereunder are time-barred under s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (see [215] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 As for the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint), the only documentary evidence Mr Choo relies on is the Invoices for work allegedly done from June 2001 to December 2016. There is no evidence that the defendants agreed to Mr Choo’s alleged high hourly rates. On the contrary, the contemporaneous documentary evidence provided by the 25 July 2001 E-mail suggest that no such rates were agreed upon, since Mr Choo’s proposed hourly rates in this e-mail were a mere fraction of his alleged hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour (see [216]–[220] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 Mr Choo has also not proven on a balance of probabilities that the scope of the Consultancy Agreement was limited to the work done for the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings. I agree with the defendants’ interpretation that the Consultancy Agreement applied to all work done by Mr Choo in relation to their investments in the Melbourne Properties, including <span class="font-italic">both</span> the OS 601 and the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings (see [223]–[226] above). Mr Choo’s claim at the trial that the reference to OS 601 in the first clause of the Consultancy Agreement was a “mistake” is inconsistent with the hourly rates that Mr Choo purported to charge for work done in relation to OS 902 in his Invoices. It is also inconsistent with the Tripartite Agreement (see [227]–[229] above). Further, Mr Choo’s assertion that the parties agreed <span class="font-italic">prior </span>to the release of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">ANZ v Ding </span>to revert to the alleged hourly rates after the release of the judgment is unsupported by any documentary evidence (see [230] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 Therefore, in my view, the defendants never agreed to pay Mr Choo his alleged hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200. On the contrary, I find that the 20% Remuneration Arrangement applied to <span class="font-italic">all</span> the work done by Mr Choo for the defendants with respect to the recovery of the profits from their investments in the Melbourne Properties and the Yip Atech Shares Transaction, including the OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings and the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings. The 20% Remuneration Arrangement was first orally agreed in the Choo-Phua 2000 Oral Agreement and the Choo-Phua-Ding 2002 Oral Agreement, and subsequently subsumed within the Consultancy Agreement in 2003. Under this 20% Remuneration Arrangement, Mr Choo was to be paid based on 20% of any sums he recovered for them from the profits of the investments in the Melbourne Properties. For the reasons explained at [205]–[206] and [221]–[226] above, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement coheres with the documentary evidence adduced by the parties (including the terms of the Consultancy Agreement) and is more plausible in the circumstances of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 Further, with regard to Mr Choo’s claim for overseas fees and expenses, I find that there is no evidence of any agreement to pay Mr Choo the alleged overseas fees of A$50,000 <span class="font-italic">per </span>trip to Australia, S$4,500 <span class="font-italic">per </span>trip to Kuala Lumpur, and S$8,000 <span class="font-italic">per </span>trip to Hong Kong. Indeed, these alleged overseas fees are inconsistent with the fees recorded in the Consultancy Agreement. Mr Choo has also not produced any evidence to support his claim for expenses. He is, therefore, not entitled to claim these overseas fees or expenses incurred from the defendants (see [233]–[238] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Annual retainer under the oral Lee Claim Agreement and the Tripartite Agreement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Finally, Mr Choo claims unpaid fees amounting to A$420,000 based on a retainer of A$30,000 <span class="font-italic">per</span> year for 14 years of work done from 2002 to 2018. This sum of A$420,000 comprises A$240,000 for eight years of work allegedly done pursuant to the oral Lee Claim Agreement during the period from 2002 to 2012 (with breaks in between factored in), and a further A$180,000 for six years of work allegedly done pursuant to the Tripartite Agreement from 2012 to 2018.

</div> However, this is unsupported by the plain wording of the Tripartite Agreement.

</div> It was expressly drafted by Mr Choo in cl 2.4 of the Tripartite Agreement that he had claims against three separate groups of persons. In cl 2.4(I), Mr Choo claimed from Ms Mei Leong; in cl 2.4(II), he claimed from Mr Phua; and in cl 2.4(III), he claimed from both of the defendants. As I have outlined at [247] above, Mr Choo has not provided any cogent or consistent basis for claiming these retainer fees due from Ms Mei Leong under cl 2.4(I) of the Tripartite Agreement <span class="font-italic">from the defendants</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 Thus, even if the oral Lee Claim Agreement indeed existed, Mr Choo’s attempt to claim payment of his annual retainer from the defendants is patently misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Summary on the alleged annual retainer under the oral Lee Claim Agreement and the Tripartite Agreement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 In summary, Mr Choo has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the oral Lee Claim Agreement, under which he was allegedly to be paid a retainer of A$30,000 <span class="font-italic">per</span> year for eight years of work done from 2002 to 2012 (with breaks in between factored in), existed. Mr Choo’s final position at the trial and in his written submissions was that it was Ms Mei Leong who had agreed to pay him this annual retainer. However, although the Tripartite Agreement referred to an annual retainer of A$30,000 <span class="font-italic">per </span>year due from Ms Mei Leong for eight years from 2002 to 2012, Mr Choo was unable to produce any evidence that Ms Mei Leong (who was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement) had ever entered into this alleged agreement with him even though, by his own account, it was operative for a total of 14 years. Mr Choo relies only on the brief e-mail dated 30 June 2015 from Ms Mei Leong to him, a plain reading of which does not assist Mr Choo at all in showing that the oral Lee Claim Agreement existed (see [252]–[253] above). Further, the plain wording of the Tripartite Agreement does not support Mr Choo’s claim for the annual retainer for six years of work allegedly done from 2012 to 2018 (see [254] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 Even if the alleged annual retainer existed, Mr Choo has no basis to claim his unpaid fees thereunder from the defendants. There is no evidence that the defendants were parties to the oral Lee Claim Agreement, or that they held any part of the sum of A$820,000 in the ACU Account as “constructive trustees” for Mr Choo. On the contrary, the A$820,000 was merely one of the sums that was set aside to meet contingent liabilities arising from the investments in the Melbourne Properties, including any potential claims by M/s Mei Leong or its clients. Further, while the defendants were parties to the Tripartite Agreement, cl 2.4(I) of the Tripartite Agreement stated that these retainer fees were due from Ms Mei Leong. Mr Choo has not provided any cogent or consistent explanation for his claim that <span class="font-italic">the defendants</span> are obliged to pay him these retainer fees (see [256]–[260] above).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the 20% Remuneration Arrangement is void for champerty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 For the reasons explained at [221]–[232] above, I have found that the parties agreed that Mr Choo was to be remunerated for his work in respect of the recovery of profits from the investments in the Melbourne Properties and the Yip Atech Shares Transaction based on the 20% Remuneration Arrangement. I shall now consider whether this arrangement was champertous or savoured of maintenance and is therefore void <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span> and unenforceable as it is contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 The defendants submit that the 20% Remuneration Arrangement is unenforceable because it is champertous in nature.

</div> Further, the defendants argue that this arrangement is champertous regardless of whether Mr Choo was providing legal services, because champerty can be found even where the party providing assistance is not a lawyer. The underlying policy against champerty is universal and is not limited to advocates and solicitors providing aid in the bringing of a claim.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The applicable law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 It is undisputed that, from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2006 and from 1 April 2014 onwards, Mr Choo was an unauthorised person for the purposes of the LPA as he did not have a practising certificate in force. Under s 2 of the LPA, Mr Choo was a “solicitor”, notwithstanding that he did not have a practising certificate, as he was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore in 1989. Section 107(3) of the LPA states: “<span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">A solicitor shall, notwithstanding any provision of this Act, be subject to the law of maintenance and champerty like any other person</span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">.”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 Although s 5A(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) abolished the common law tort of maintenance and champerty, s 5A(2) provides that this “does not affect any rule of [Singapore] law as to the cases in which a contract is to be treated as contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal”. It is established that contracts which savour of maintenance or champerty are void as being contrary to public policy at common law (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at [13.068] and [13.075]). In <span class="font-italic">Ochroid</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]–[40], the Court of Appeal affirmed the principle that a contract which is prohibited by one of the established heads of common law public policy would be rendered void and unenforceable and no recovery pursuant to the contract would be permitted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 The Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Otech </span><span class="font-italic">Pakistan Pvt Ltd v Clough Engineering Ltd and another </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 989 (“<span class="font-italic">Otech</span>”) at [32] that “champerty exists where one party agrees to aid another to bring a claim on the basis that the person who gives the aid shall receive a share of what may be recovered in the action”. The traditional rationale for treating champertous agreements as contrary to public policy was that such agreements “would tempt the champertous maintainer to subvert the course of justice” (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Kurubalan s/o Manickam Rengaraju</span> [2013] 4 SLR 91 (“<span class="font-italic">Kurubalan</span>”) at [42]). Where the champertous agreement is entered into with a lawyer, this rationale has particular force, as such an agreement may hinder “the ability of the lawyer to maintain a sufficient sense of detachment so as to be able to discharge his duty to the court”, which is “ultimately paramount and trumps all other duties” (<span class="font-italic">Kurubalan</span> at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) My findings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 Applying these principles in the present case, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement is self-evidently champertous. Under this arrangement, Mr Choo was to be remunerated by the defendants based on 20% of any sums he recovered for them from the profits of the investments in the Melbourne Properties. Mr Choo, therefore, had a direct financial incentive to assist the defendants in recovering as large a sum of moneys as possible. This falls squarely within the scope of the doctrine of champerty as contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Otech</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 Mr Choo’s counsel attempted to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Otech </span>on the ground that it concerned a consultant (a company) which was engaged to assist one party in reaching a negotiated settlement with its contractual counterparty.

</div> He argued that Mr Choo’s case was different because Mr Choo’s work had open-ended outcomes: the defendants could have recovered their moneys from the investments in the Melbourne Properties if Mr Lee willingly paid them these sums; or if they won these sums from Mr Lee through litigation; or if they entered into a settlement agreement with Mr Lee. At the time the 20% Remuneration Arrangement was entered into, no one could have accurately predicted which of these three outcomes would eventually materialise.

</div> I do not find this objection convincing. Mr Choo knew Mr Ding to be a man of significant financial means and would have had no reason to be concerned that the 23 November Cheque would not be honoured. In these circumstances, I find it entirely believable that Mr Choo signed the Second Acknowledgment Slip upon receiving the 23 November Cheque from Mr Ding.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 I also accept Mr Ding’s explanation for the issuance of the four separate bank drafts amounting to A$20,000 on 21 September 2001, instead of a single bank draft for the same amount. According to Mr Ding, in or around September 2001, after the financial crisis, Malaysia imposed capital controls limiting the amount of money that could be transferred in each bank draft. Splitting the sum of A$20,000 across four separate bank drafts for smaller amounts therefore avoided the need for Mr Ding to obtain approval for the transfers.

</div> Mr Choo’s explanation for not demanding the A$50,000 is not convincing. The LOAU 1 (which was signed on 13 July 2002) made no mention of any sum of A$50,000 owed to Mr Choo under the Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement, even though the very purpose of the LOAU 1 was to provide security for the payment of Mr Choo’s fees. In my view, it is unbelievable that Mr Choo would have refrained from demanding payment from the defendants or mentioning the A$50,000 due to him in any of the written agreements or correspondence between the parties from late 2001 onwards, if he had indeed not been paid this sum. I agree with the defendants’ submission that Mr Choo did not include his purported claim for the A$50,000 anywhere in the written agreements between the parties (despite being the legally trained drafter of these documents). Mr Choo also made no attempt to demand payment from the defendants for so many years clearly indicates that he had already been paid the A$50,000.

</div> However, the payment of the A$20,000 to Mr Choo was acknowledged by him in the First Acknowledgment Slip, the authenticity of which Mr Choo has not successfully challenged. In these circumstances, the fact that Mr Ding was unable to recall the payment mode or produce further documentary evidence of the transfer of A$20,000, which took place almost two decades ago in 2001, is no basis for Mr Choo to claim that he never received this sum. As Mr Ding explained during his cross-examination, he no longer had his bank statements from 2001 and would not be able to get them from the bank so many years later. He would have been able to show them to Mr Choo if the payment had been disputed earlier.

</div> Mr Choo argues that, viewed holistically, the 9 July 2014 E-mail and the 9 July 2014 Reply show that Mr Ding and Mr Choo had not yet terminated their working relationship, and that Mr Choo was still doing work for Mr Ding in relation to his claim against Mr Lee. This shows that the sum of S$150,000 did not operate as a full and final settlement of Mr Choo’s fees.

</div> Mr Choo argues that Mr Ding’s explanation is unbelievable because Mr Ding was unable to provide documentary proof that he retrieved or paid Mr Choo the sum of S$50,000, and also did not adduce passport extracts to show that he was in Singapore on 4 June 2013.

</div> However, it is understandable that there was no documentary proof of the retrieval of this sum of money since it was cash taken directly from Mr Ding’s own safes. Mr Choo admitted in his pleadings and affidavit of evidence-in-chief that he had received the full sum of S$200,000. He disputed this for the first time in his opening statement before the trial. The defendants, therefore, proceeded on the basis that the payment of the full S$200,000 was not in dispute.

</div> Further, if Mr Ding had not been in Singapore or had not passed Mr Choo the S$50,000, one would have expected Mr Choo to ask Mr Ding for payment or dispute receiving this sum of money, yet Mr Choo did not do so.

Therefore, in 2013, the total outstanding amount of fees that had accrued to Mr Choo would not yet have been clear to the parties. Further, by Mr Choo’s calculations, the total amount owed to him for his work done pursuant to the OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings under the oral Interpleader Agreement from December 2000 to 2004 was S$193,880. This amount being less than S$200,000, I do not see how the parties could have agreed, in 2012 or 2013, to pay Mr Choo S$200,000 as <span class="font-italic">part</span>-payment for these fees.

In my view, on a plain reading of the 10 June 2013 E-mail and the 10 June 2013 Reply, the understanding reached between Mr Choo and Mr Ding was that Mr Choo would be paid S$200,000. Thereafter, Mr Choo would have no claim for fees against Mr Ding’s share of the ACU Account Moneys which was under the custody of the defendants. Otherwise, Mr Choo could claim 20% of the recovered sum from the defendants under the Consultancy Agreement. It is clear from the wording of these e-mails that the payment of S$200,000 was intended as a <span class="font-italic">settlement</span>, at least in relation to any claim Mr Choo might have to Mr Ding’s share of the ACU Account Moneys. The wording of these e-mails is inconsistent with the S$200,000 being intended as merely a part-payment of Mr Choo’s fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">320 I turn next to Mr Choo’s 10 June 2013 Reply, where he said that, notwithstanding the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement, he would retain his claims against Mr Phua for “services rendered to him for fee due on the first case” and “claim to Mei Leong for representing her interest”. According to Mr Phua, when Mr Choo referred to “the first case” in his 10 June 2013 Reply to Mr Ding, he thought Mr Choo was referring to his purported claim for work done under the PS Consultancy Agreement, which was time-barred (see [50] above).

However, after Mr Ding reminded Mr Choo in the 9 July 2014 E-mail that he (Mr Choo) had agreed to accept S$200,000 in exchange for relinquishing his claim on the ACU Account Moneys entirely, Mr Choo confirmed in his 9 July 2014 Reply to Mr Ding that Mr Phua’s portion had indeed been “taken over” by Mr Ding. Pursuant to the DATBI dated 9 January 2013 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before the 10 June 2013 e-mails regarding the full and final settlement), Mr Ding had assumed “[Mr] Phua’s consultancy and legal fees owing to [Mr] Choo” in consideration of Mr Phua transferring “all his beneficial interest in the Gracedale’s [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] account to [Mr] Ding without any conditions attached”.

</div> In the 9 July 2014 Reply, Mr Choo also acknowledged that his attempt to claim his consultancy fees on a retainer basis from Mr Ding was a “mistake” and apologised for “any misunderstanding”. Thus, the evidence shows that Mr Choo acknowledged that the payment of S$200,000 was a full and final settlement of all the legal fees payable to him by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">322 Further, I agree with the defendants’ submission that Mr Choo’s 10 June 2013 Further Reply is consistent with their understanding of the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement. Mr Ding explained that he understood Mr Choo’s reference to his “legal fee for work to be done” to be a token sum that Mr Choo wanted in the event that the defendants resolved their dispute with Mr Lee.

</div> This argument is misconceived as the DATBI was signed on 9 January 2013, before the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement was entered into in or around March or April 2013. Thus, the DATBI was also signed before the settlement sum of S$200,000 was paid to Mr Choo in May and June 2013. In any event, the e-mail correspondence between Mr Ding and Mr Choo in 2013 and 2014, when read together, provides clear evidence of the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement. I am, therefore, also unable to accept Mr Choo’s counsel’s further submission that the parties’ omission to draft and sign “a proper agreement, with proper wording that is legally binding” indicates that the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement did not exist.

</div> In my view, the contemporaneous documentary evidence establishes the existence and terms of the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement on a balance of probabilities.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 The 8 June 2013 Invoice is also not inconsistent with the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement. The 8 June 2013 Invoice, which was prepared by Mr Choo, reflected that sums amounting to S$200,000 were to be paid to Mr Choo for his fees. The original version of the 8 June 2013 Invoice contained an addition error (whereby the total sum was incorrectly reflected as S$100,000). Mr Choo’s claim that he deliberately made this addition error because he found Mr Ding’s instructions suspicious is incredible. In contrast, the amended version of the 8 June 2013 Invoice exhibited by Mr Ding indicates that the correct total sum was S$200,000 (see [60]–[61] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 That said, I note that the 8 June 2013 Invoice was described as a “Statement of Professional Consultancy Fee” and stated that the fees therein were for “legal and professional advice rendered from 2004 to 2013 on the legal issues in respect of the case to be heard in the British Virgin Islands” and “attending meeting and discussions from 2004 to 2013 in Singapore”.

</div> The phrase “the case to be heard in the British Virgin Islands” is ambiguous. At the time of the 8 June 2013 Invoice, the only ongoing court proceedings were the BVI Proceedings, which were commenced in October 2012 and concluded on or around 9 July 2013 (see [25] above). Hence, this phrase could refer to the defendants’ broader dispute with Mr Lee which, <span class="font-italic">as at</span><span class="font-italic"> 8 June 2013</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>had yet to be fully “heard in the British Virgin Islands”. Further, although the 8 June 2013 Invoice refers to work done from 2004 onwards, the e-mail correspondence between Mr Ding and Mr Choo in 2013 and 2014 does not contain any suggestion that Mr Choo’s fees for work done prior to 2004 were still payable by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 Moreover, Mr Ding’s evidence provides a plausible explanation for why Mr Choo may have been willing to accept the sum of S$200,000 in 2013 in full and final settlement of all fees payable by the defendants.

</div> This is consistent with my finding (at [310] above) that Mr Ding paid the sum of S$200,000 to Mr Choo in two instalments in May and June 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 Therefore, even if Mr Choo were not barred from recovering remuneration for work done by him while he was an unauthorised person, and even if he were entitled to be paid for his services pursuant to the 20% Remuneration Arrangement, I find that Mr Choo’s claim for fees from the defendants was fully and finally settled by Mr Ding’s payment of S$200,000 to him in 2013. No further fees are due from the defendants to Mr Choo.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Summary on the remuneration already paid to Mr Choo </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 I now summarise my findings in relation to the amount of remuneration already paid to Mr Choo by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 With regard to the oral Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement, the defendants have proven on a balance of probabilities that Mr Choo was paid the full fixed fee of A$50,000. The defendants’ account is corroborated by the four 21 September Bank Drafts, the First Acknowledgment Slip and the Second Acknowledgment Slip (see [281] and [283]–[286] above). I am unable to accept Mr Choo’s bare assertion that these documents are not authentic. My finding is buttressed by the fact that Mr Choo made no attempt to demand payment from the defendants and did not mention the A$50,000 allegedly still due to him in any of the written agreements or correspondence between the parties after the crystallisation of the oral Mei Leong Settlement Agreement on 15 October 2001 (see [289] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">330 In any event, even if the full fixed fee of A$50,000 was not paid to Mr Choo, his claim for this fee is time-barred as more than six years elapsed between Mr Choo’s completion of his work under the oral Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 15 October 2001) and the filing of the writ of summons in the present Suit (see [291] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">331 With regard to the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement, the defendants have proven on a balance of probabilities that the full sum of S$200,000 was paid to Mr Choo in 2013. Prior to his opening statement, Mr Choo had not once disputed receiving this sum in full. The defendants’ account is further supported by the contemporaneous correspondence between the parties, in particular the 10 June 2013 E-mail and the 9 July 2014 E-mail sent by Mr Ding to Mr Choo (see [306]–[308] above). In contrast, Mr Choo’s argument that he did not receive S$50,000 of this sum in cash is inconsistent with his own pleaded case and affidavit of evidence-in-chief (see [308] above), and is also premised, somewhat flimsily, on his recollection that he did not meet Mr Ding on 3 June 2013. Thus, Mr Choo <span class="font-italic">assumes </span>that Mr Ding could not have paid him the S$50,000 in cash. In view of Mr Ding’s testimony that he had a separate meeting with Mr Choo on 4 June 2013 where he passed Mr Choo the S$50,000 in cash, which I have no reason to doubt, the basis of Mr Choo’s argument falls away (see [309] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">332 The defendants have also proven on a balance of probabilities that this sum of S$200,000 was paid to Mr Choo in full and final settlement of all fees payable by both defendants. The existence of the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement alleged by the defendants and the fact that the S$200,000 was intended as a settlement of Mr Choo’s claim are corroborated by the correspondence between the parties, in particular, the 10 June 2013 E-mail, the 10 June 2013 Reply, the 9 July 2014 E-mail and the 9 July 2014 Reply (see [319]–[321] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">333 On the other hand, Mr Choo’s assertion that this sum was merely a part-payment of his fees is unsupported by any corroborative evidence. On the contrary, at the time the S$200,000 was paid in 2013, the total outstanding amount of fees that had allegedly accrued to Mr Choo would not yet have been clear to him, since the Invoices were only prepared in August 2016. Mr Choo was also unable to produce any evidence to support his assertion that the original 2012 DATBI existed and that it contained a clause requiring Mr Ding to pay him a sum of S$200,000 as part-payment of the fees owed to him by Mr Phua in respect of work done for the OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings (see [312]–[318] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effect of the DATBI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">334 I turn now to consider the legal effect of the DATBI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">335 It is axiomatic that novation is the process by which both the benefits and the burdens under a contract are transferred from the original contracting parties to new contracting parties. This requires the consent of both the original and the new contracting parties (<span class="font-italic">Kam Thai Leong Dennis v Asian Infrastructure Ltd </span>[2020] SGCA 87 at [31]). To determine whether there has in fact been a novation, the court will apply the ordinary principles of contractual interpretation. In giving effect to the objective intentions of the contracting parties, the court will consider the relevant contractual, contextual and commercial background against which the document purporting to effect the novation came about (see <span class="font-italic">Fairview Developments Pte Ltd v Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 318 at [47]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">336 It is undisputed that the DATBI was drafted by Mr Choo, save that Mr Choo contends that the version of the DATBI before this court is not the original version of the DATBI, which Mr Choo claims was the alleged 2012 DATBI (see [32] above). The relevant clauses of the DATBI state:

Thus, Mr Phua cannot rely on the DATBI as a defence to Mr Choo’s claims, and the DATBI at best allows Mr Phua to compel Mr Ding to meet Mr Choo’s claims instead.

Given that Mr Choo was specifically referred to by name in cll 2(d) and 3 of the DATBI, I find that the reference in cl 5 to “any other person or company” does not include Mr Choo himself. This interpretation of the DATBI is also supported by the correspondence between the parties, as discussed above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">345 Further, I accept Mr Phua’s submission that Mr Choo impliedly consented to the novation by drafting the DATBI. As explained at [314]–[318] above, Mr Choo’s assertions regarding the 2012 DATBI are entirely unsubstantiated. Having regard to the relevant contextual background against which the DATBI came about, I find that the requirement of mutual consent for the novation of Mr Phua’s liabilities to pay Mr Choo’s fees to Mr Ding was satisfied. Hence, there was a valid novation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">346 Therefore, even if (contrary to my findings above on other grounds) Mr Phua owed Mr Choo any outstanding fees, Mr Choo cannot claim these fees from Mr Phua in this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">347 For completeness, I shall also briefly address Mr Choo’s argument that because cl 7 of the DATBI states that it is “subject to the laws and jurisdiction of Australia”, it has no legal force in Singapore until parties have submitted to Singapore’s jurisdiction.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In any case, this argument is a non-starter since the parties have plainly submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts by commencing and defending the present proceedings. There is no conduct or action by Mr Choo to suggest that he had objected to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts (see <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 500 at [33] and [45]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary on Mr Choo’s claim for unpaid fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">348 Before I summarise my overall findings in relation to Mr Choo’s claim for unpaid fees, I wish to reiterate two preliminary points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, I have already mentioned that Mr Choo is an extremely unreliable witness. He had no compulsion to speak the truth. His testimony in court was like a chameleon constantly changing to suit the various scenarios to establish his claims in a dishonest manner. His testimony was beset with numerous inconsistencies and vacillations, including departures from positions he had previously affirmed in his affidavits. He also lied that his case was supported by various documents which did not in fact assist him, or which he was ultimately unwilling or unable to produce in court for inspection. On many occasions while on the stand, he also sought to correct alleged errors in the documentary evidence he himself had placed before the court. I am, therefore, of the view that Mr Choo’s evidence must be treated with extreme caution and that I must exercise vigilance before I accept his evidence at face value without corroborative evidence (see [58]–[67] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the authenticity and reliability of the Invoices relied on by Mr Choo in support of his claim are questionable. There is no evidence to support Mr Choo’s assertion that these Invoices were prepared and sent to the defendants by Mr Choo in late 2016, and Mr Choo’s version of events is riddled with internal inconsistencies. Further, the metadata evidence adduced by the defendants suggests that these Invoices were only created by Mr Choo around the time the present Suit was commenced, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in 2018 and not 2016 as he alleged. I, therefore, treat them as having limited probative value unless they are supported by some other corroborative evidence (see [145]–[156] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">349 With these preliminary points in mind, I now summarise my findings in relation to Mr Choo’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">350 First, Mr Choo was engaged by the defendants to act as an advocate and solicitor and did in fact act as an advocate and solicitor. He was an unauthorised person within the definition in s 32(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2006 and from 1 April 2014 onwards, as he did not have a valid practising certificate in force during these periods. He is, therefore, barred by s 36(1) (read with s 2(1)) of the LPA from recovering any fees from the defendants for work done during these periods (see [90]–[136] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">351 Second, the oral agreements as alleged by Mr Choo, namely the oral Melbourne Capital Agreement, the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Phua), the oral Interpleader Agreement, the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint) and the oral Lee Claim Agreement did not exist. There was no agreement by the defendants to pay Mr Choo hourly rates of S$800 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour for ordinary work and S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per</span> hour for work on foreign issues and/or urgent matters. On the contrary, for work done in relation to the recovery of the profits from the investments in the Melbourne Properties and the Yip Atech Shares Transaction, Mr Choo asked to be paid based on the 20% Remuneration Arrangement, which was reduced to writing in the Consultancy Agreement (see [158]–[263] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">352 However, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement is a champertous contract because it was an agreement that Mr Choo would be paid 20% of any sums recovered for the defendants from the profits of the investments in the Melbourne Properties. Under s 107(3) of the LPA, Mr Choo is subject to the ordinary law of maintenance and champerty, which prohibits champertous arrangements. Therefore, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement is void as it is contrary to public policy. Consequently, even in respect of the period when Mr Choo did have a practising certificate in force (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2014), he is not entitled to claim his unpaid fees pursuant to the 20% Remuneration Arrangement (see [264]–[277] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">353 Third, Mr Choo has no outstanding claim for unpaid fees under the Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement as he has already been paid the full fixed fee of A$50,000 by the defendants (see [283]–[290] above). Further, Mr Choo’s claim for fees was fully and finally settled by Mr Ding’s payment of S$200,000 to him in 2013 pursuant to the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement. Therefore, no further fees are due from the defendants to Mr Choo (see [308]–[310] and [312]–[327] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">354 Fourth, even if Mr Choo was owed any outstanding fees by Mr Phua, he cannot claim them from Mr Phua in this Suit as the effect of the DATBI was to novate Mr Phua’s liabilities to pay Mr Choo’s fees to Mr Ding. This interpretation of the DATBI is supported both by the wording of the DATBI itself and the correspondence between the parties (in particular, the 9 July 2014 E-mail from Mr<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>Ding to Mr<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>Choo and the 9 July 2014 Reply from Mr Choo, as well as the 10 November 2014 SMS from Mr<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>Choo to Mr<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>Phua). Further, Mr Choo impliedly consented to the novation as he drafted the DATBI (see [334]–[346] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Phua’s counterclaim for an account and inquiry</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">355 As explained at [33] above, Mr Phua and his nominees transferred the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares to Mr Choo in 2002 under two separate written agreements, namely the LOAU 1 and the Trust Agreement. Under these agreements, Mr Choo held the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares on trust for Mr Phua.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">356  It is undisputed that the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares have since been sold by Mr Choo.

On Mr Choo’s own case, the defendants were trustees of the ACU Account (see [247(b)]–[247(c)] above). Moreover, at the time of the signing of the Trust Agreement in November 2002, Mr Phua was the full owner of the 2.45 million Atech shares, and Mr Choo knew this.

</div> There would, therefore, have been no basis for Mr Lee to lay any claim to the sale proceeds of the 2.45 million shares. On the other hand, the defendants’ dispute with Mr Lee over the ACU Account had undoubtedly arisen by November 2002 since the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings (which concerned the issue of whether the defendants had the authority to act for and on behalf of Gracedale in operating the ACU Account) had commenced on 1 July 2002. This directly contradicts Mr Choo’s testimony that, at the time the Trust Agreement was signed, there was no dispute concerning the ACU Account.

</div> It is well-established that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn </span>(1893) 6 R 67 requires parties to put to a witness important points of contention in order to give the witness a fair opportunity to meet that contention, and that failure to do so may preclude the party concerned from making that submission (see <span class="font-italic">Daniel Fernandez v Edith Woi and another </span>[2021] SGHC 117 at [68] and the authorities cited therein). Though the rule may not always be strictly applied, the implications of this allegation are sufficiently significant that they ought to have been put to Mr Phua during the trial. In these circumstances, it is not open to Mr Choo to now rely on Mr Phua’s inaction in relation to the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares after the DATBI was signed in 2013 and the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement to argue that Mr Phua’s counterclaim in respect of these shares is not genuine.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">379 Therefore, Mr Choo was not entitled to sell the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares.

Apart from the Invoice (which, even by Mr Choo’s account, was only created in August 2016), Mr Choo has not adduced any corroborative evidence to support the existence of the PS Consultancy Agreement. For the reasons explained at [145]–[156] above, the authenticity and reliability of the Invoices are generally suspect. Mr Choo himself admits that the first time this oral PS Consultancy Agreement was raised was when the writ of summons in this Suit was filed on 5 July 2018, 18 years after this alleged agreement was made.

</div> In my view, if the PS Consultancy Agreement had indeed existed, it would have been mentioned in the LOAU 1 and the Trust Agreement, the express purpose of which was for Mr Phua to transfer some of his Atech shares to Mr Choo as security for the payment of his fees. These agreements mentioned other lesser fees owed to Mr Choo but not the purported PS Consultancy Agreement, under which Mr Choo charged a high fixed fee of S$200,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">384 Further, the terms of the alleged PS Consultancy Agreement are implausible in the circumstances.

</div> it would have been illogical for Mr Phua to have agreed to pay the same amount of S$200,000 to Mr Choo to negotiate this reduction in his contra losses, since this would achieve nothing in terms of reducing Mr Phua’s absolute liability. Given the significant losses that Mr Phua had suffered and the financial difficulties he was facing, I find it improbable that Mr Phua would have agreed to pay Mr Choo a fixed fee of S$200,000 merely to negotiate a settlement with Phillip Securities, which Mr Phua was capable of doing on his own. I agree with Mr Phua’s submission that it is bizarre that Mr Phua would have agreed to pay Mr Choo to negotiate for him when he was “broke”, or that he would have agreed to pay Mr Choo S$200,000 for effectively nothing in return.

Mr Choo was only entitled to sell the 1.08 million Atech shares transferred to him under the LOAU 1 after the defendants had recovered the ACU Account Moneys and Mr Phua had failed to pay his legal fee. Similarly, Mr Choo was only entitled to sell the additional 2.45 million Atech shares transferred to him under the Trust Agreement if Mr Lee made no claim to the ACU Account Moneys. The defendants’ dispute with Mr Lee over the ACU Account, and their recovery of the ACU Account Moneys, only took place in or around August 2016. Therefore, at the time Mr Choo sold the shares (which, on Mr Choo’s own account, was 2015 at the latest), neither of these conditions had been satisfied. Furthermore, the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares were held as security for the payment of Mr Choo’s legal fees. If Mr Choo’s legal fees were paid, he could not sell the Atech shares (see [370]–[375] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">390 Further, under the LOAU 2, Mr Choo would only become beneficially entitled to 50% of the 1.08 million Atech shares transferred to him under the LOAU 1 if he paid the legal costs due from Mr Phua to JCHK. This condition was not satisfied as JCHK eventually waived their legal fees, such that Mr Choo was not required to make any payments to JCHK (see [372]–[373] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">391 Mr Choo was, therefore, not entitled to sell the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares under any of these written agreements. Further, Mr Choo was unable to produce any evidence to show that Mr Phua consented to the sale of the Atech shares, or to the use of the sale proceeds to pay for any fees allegedly owing to him. Mr Choo was also unable to produce any evidence to support his assertion that he had already orally accounted in 2006 for the first tranche of 3 million shares that he sold, and sometime in 2014 or 2015 for the second tranche of 530,000 shares that he sold (see [376]–[377] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">392 Mr Choo argues that he is, nevertheless, entitled to at least part of the sale proceeds from the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares as payment due to him for work done under the PS Consultancy Agreement, under which he claims Mr Phua agreed to pay him a fixed fee of S$200,000 for his services in resolving the dispute between Mr Phua and Phillip Securities in relation to Mr Phua’s contra losses. However, I find this argument to be devoid of merit as Mr Choo has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the PS Consultancy Agreement existed. It is improbable that Mr Phua would have agreed to pay Mr Choo a fixed fee of S$200,000 merely to negotiate a settlement which ultimately did nothing to reduce Mr Phua’s absolute liability (see [383]–[384] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">393 However, as an account and inquiry would be an exercise in futility in the circumstances, I allow Mr Phua’s alternative counterclaim for A$214,524 as representing the sale proceeds of the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares. I further order Mr Choo to pay Mr Phua interest on the sum of A$214,524 at the default rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum </span>from the date of the writ (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 July 2018) (see [387] above)<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Ding’s counterclaim for repayment of the alleged loans </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">394 Two issues arise with respect to Mr Ding’s counterclaim for Mr Choo to repay alleged loans amounting to S$24,000: (a) the amount of moneys transferred by Mr Ding to Mr Choo in 2015; and (b) the purpose of these transfers of moneys. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Amount of moneys transferred by Mr Ding to Mr Choo in 2015 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">395 Mr Ding claims that he transferred a total of S$24,000 to Mr Choo in 2015: S$9,000 on 30 April 2015 and a further S$15,000 on 15 December 2015.

</div> he has not adduced any evidence (apart from the Invoices, which I have already dealt with at [145]–[156] above) to show precisely how he was to be remunerated for this work. Mr Choo himself has denied that Mr Ding agreed to pay him a token sum for the work done by him after the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement (see [322] above). It is, therefore, not clear how Mr Choo would have calculated the fees that had accrued to him for this work as at 2015. In these circumstances, it is unlikely that Mr Ding intended the S$24,000 to be an advance payment of Mr Choo’s fees. I agree with Mr Ding’s argument that the use of the word “advance” referred to a loan in the context of the parties’ relationship in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">401 I, therefore, find that Mr Ding made loans amounting to S$24,000 to Mr Choo in 2015, which Mr Choo is required to repay with interest. I see no reason to depart from the default interest rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">annum</span> prescribed by para 77 of the Supreme Court Practice Directions. Accordingly, I award Mr Ding interest at the rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum </span>on the sums of S$9,000 and S$15,000, from the date of the writ (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 July 2018). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of Mr Ding’s counterclaim for repayment of the alleged loans</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">402 In summary, Mr Ding has proved, on a balance of probabilities, that he transferred a total of S$24,000 to Mr Choo. This is corroborated by the DBS Deposit Slips. In contrast, Mr Choo’s assertion that he did not receive the first sum of S$9,000 from Mr Ding is unsupported by any corroborative evidence (see [395]–[397] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">403 Mr Ding has also proved, on a balance of probabilities, that these transfers were loans and not part-payment for Mr Choo’s outstanding consultancy fees or advances for ongoing or future work to be done by Mr Choo. Following the payment of S$200,000 to Mr Choo under the 2013 Choo Settlement Agreement, Mr Ding did not owe any further sums to Mr Choo for work done up to this point. Further, apart from the Invoices, Mr Choo has not adduced any evidence to show how he was to be remunerated for any work done for the defendants after June 2013 (see [400] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">404 I, therefore, order Mr Choo to repay the loans amounting to S$24,000 to Mr Ding with interest at the default rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum </span>from the date of the writ (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 July 2018). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1) "></span><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">405 For the above reasons, I dismiss Mr Choo’s claim against the defendants for unpaid fees. I make the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Choo was engaged by the defendants to act as an advocate and solicitor and did in fact act as an advocate and solicitor while he was an unauthorised person. Therefore, he is barred from recovering any remuneration for the legal work he did for the defendants under s 36(1) (read with s 2(1)) of the LPA. However, I decline to grant Mr Phua an order for the refund of the various sums of money paid by the defendants to Mr Choo for his legal services under s 36(2) of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The oral Melbourne Capital Agreement alleged by Mr Choo did not exist. In any event, his claim for the fixed fee of S$50,000 thereunder is time-barred. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Phua), the oral Interpleader Agreement and the oral Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint) alleged by Mr Choo did not exist. Even if they did exist, his claim for fees under the oral Interpleader Agreement is time-barred. Instead, Mr Choo was to be remunerated for the work purportedly done under these agreements based on the 20% Remuneration Arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) However, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement is champertous and, therefore, void and unenforceable on the ground of being contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mr Choo is not entitled to claim his alleged overseas fees and expenses as there is no evidence of any agreement by the defendants to pay Mr Choo these fees. Further, Mr Choo has not produced any evidence to support his claim for his alleged expenses.    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The alleged annual retainer under the oral Lee Claim Agreement did not exist. Further, Mr Choo cannot rely on the Tripartite Agreement to claim this annual retainer for the six years of work allegedly done from 2012 to 2018. In any event, Mr Choo has no basis to claim any unpaid fees for work done under this agreement from the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The defendants had paid Mr Choo the full fixed fee of A$50,000 under the Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement. In any event, even if the fixed fee of A$50,000 was not paid to Mr Choo in full, Mr Choo’s claim for this fee is time-barred. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The defendants had also paid Mr Choo a sum of S$200,000 in 2013. This payment served as full and final settlement of all fees payable by the defendants from the ACU Account Moneys.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In any event, the effect of the DATBI was to novate any liabilities that Mr Phua had to pay Mr Choo’s fees to Mr Ding. Consequently, Mr Choo can no longer claim any unpaid fees from Mr Phua.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">406 I allow Mr Phua’s counterclaim against Mr Choo for the sum of A$214,524 as representing the sale proceeds of the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares. I find that Mr Choo was not entitled to sell the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares. Further, the PS Consultancy Agreement did not exist, and Mr Choo is, therefore, not entitled to the proceeds from the sale of the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares as payment for work done under the PS Consultancy Agreement. As Mr Choo has failed to produce any documentary evidence of the sale price and total sale proceeds of the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares despite several invitations to do so, an account and inquiry would be futile. As Mr Choo’s own position is that the 3.53 million Choo Atech Shares were sold for a total sum of A$214,524, I order Mr Choo to pay Mr Phua this sum together with interest at the default rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum </span>from the date on which the writ of summons in the present Suit was filed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 July 2018).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">407 I also allow Mr Ding’s counterclaim against Mr Choo. I find that Mr Ding made loans amounting to S$24,000 to Mr Choo in 2015, and I order Mr Choo to repay these loans with interest at the default rate of 5.33% <span class="font-italic">per annum </span>from the date on which the writ of summons in the present Suit was filed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 July 2018). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">408 Mr Choo is to pay costs, to be agreed or taxed, to the defendants on the main action and the defendants’ counterclaims. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Che Wei Chin (Covenant Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Wai Kit Darren Dominic and Ng Yi Ming Daniel (Characterist LLC) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chow Chao Wu Jansen and Ang Leong Hao (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

However, from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2006 and from 1 April 2014 onwards, he did not have a valid practising certificate in force and was an “unauthorised person” under s 32(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The defendants, Mr Phua Swee Khiang (“Mr Phua”) and Mr Ding Pei Chai (“Mr Ding”), had collaborated with Mr Lee Wan Hoi (“Mr Lee”) to invest in several properties in Melbourne (the “Melbourne Properties”) in 1993 and 1994. These properties were sold in or around July 2000. The capital which the defendants had invested was returned to them by Mr Lee by 27 October 2000, and part of the sale proceeds were set aside in a bank account (the “ACU Account”) to meet various contingent liabilities.     </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Mr Choo was appointed by the defendants in 2000–2001 to assist them with their legal disputes relating to the Melbourne Properties, including a dispute with Mr Lee. These legal disputes included court proceedings in Singapore (namely, interpleader proceedings in OS 601786/2001 (“OS 601”) and OS 902/2002, and Suit 420/2014), Australia, and the British Virgin Islands. It was undisputed that the defendants had entered into two written agreements with Mr Choo relating to his services and remuneration: a Consultancy Agreement in 2003 and a Tripartite Agreement in 2012.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 In 2002, Mr Choo received 3.53 million shares in Atech Holdings Limited (the “Atech Shares”) from Mr Phua as security for the payment of his fees. He was to hold the Atech Shares on trust for Mr Phua. Subsequently, Mr Choo sold the Atech Shares.   </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 In 2016, the defendants settled their dispute with Mr Lee and recovered a sum of US$1.04m from the ACU Account. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 In the present suit, Mr Choo claimed that he had provided law-related business consultancy services to the defendants and that he was entitled to approximately S$2.09m from the defendants for work done under various alleged agreements from 2000 to 2018: </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. an oral agreement made in September 2000 for Mr Phua to pay Mr Choo a fixed fee of S$50,000 for his services in relation to the recovery of the capital from the investments in the Melbourne Properties (the “Melbourne Capital Agreement”);</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. an oral agreement made in September 2000 for Mr Phua to pay Mr Choo hourly rates of S$800 or S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per </span>hour for his services in relation to the recovery of the profits from the investments in the Melbourne Properties (the “Melbourne Profits Agreement (Phua)”); </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. an oral agreement made in December 2000 for Mr Phua to pay Mr Choo hourly rates of S$800 or S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per </span>hour for his services in relation to the OS 601 interpleader proceedings (the “Interpleader Agreement”); </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. an oral agreement made in June 2001 for the defendants to pay Mr Choo hourly rates of S$800 or S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per </span>hour for his services in relation to the recovery of the profits from the investments in the Melbourne Properties (the “Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint)”); </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">e. an agreement made in July 2001 for the defendants to pay Mr Choo a fixed fee of A$50,000 if he successfully negotiated a settlement with M/s Mei Leong, Lam &amp; Co, which was then a law firm in Hong Kong (“M/s Mei Leong”) (the “Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement”). This settlement concerned letters of indemnity which Mr Phua had executed in 1999 in relation to the raising of capital for the investments in the Melbourne Properties; and </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">f. an oral agreement made in or around April 2002 for M/s Mei Leong to pay Mr Choo a retainer of A$30,000 <span class="font-italic">per </span>year for his services in ensuring that its client’s claim to part of the money in the ACU Account was looked after (the “Lee Claim Agreement”).    </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Mr Choo also claimed overseas fees and expenses under the Interpleader Agreement and the Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The defendants disputed Mr Choo’s characterisation of his services as business consultancy services and argued that he had, instead, provided <span class="font-italic">legal</span> services. They contended that Mr Choo’s provision of these legal services while he was an unauthorised person contravened the LPA. The defendants also disputed the existence of all of the alleged agreements relied on by Mr Choo, save for the Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement. They contended that Mr Choo was instead to be paid 20% of the moneys recovered from the profits of the investments in the Melbourne Properties (the “20% Remuneration Arrangement”), and that this arrangement was void for champerty. Alternatively, the defendants argued that Mr Choo had already been paid what he was entitled to. In any event, they argued that his claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Mr Phua counterclaimed against Mr Choo for an account and inquiry in respect of the sale proceeds of the Atech Shares. Alternatively, Mr Phua sought a sum of A$214,524 from Mr Choo, based on Mr Choo’s own position as to the sale proceeds he had received from the Atech Shares. Separately, Mr Ding counterclaimed against Mr Choo for the repayment of loans amounting to S$24,000 which he had extended to Mr Choo in 2015. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision  </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of Mr Choo’s work </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The court found that Mr Choo was engaged by the defendants to act as an advocate and solicitor, and did in fact act as an advocate and solicitor, while he was an unauthorised person. There was overwhelming evidence that the defendants had always viewed Mr Choo as their lawyer and relied primarily on his legal expertise, and had not employed him in some other non-legal capacity. Mr Choo himself described his work as “legal” work in his written agreements and correspondence with the defendants, his invoices, and his affidavits. He was deeply involved in preparing documents relating to legal proceedings; in particular, he had drafted the defendants’ affidavits for various court proceedings. He also advised the defendants on matters including directors’ duties, fiduciary duties, <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, limitation periods, equitable relief, and potential criminal liability. Therefore, he was barred by s 36(1) of the LPA from recovering any fees for the legal work he did for the defendants while he was an unauthorised person: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">131]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[137]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[142]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(a)]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 However, the court declined to make an order under s 36(2) of the LPA for Mr Choo to refund the various sums of moneys already paid to him. Such an order was sought only by Mr Phua, but Mr Phua had not paid Mr Choo any of these sums. Further, the payment of Mr Choo’s travelling allowance did not fall within the scope of s 33 of the LPA, as was required by s 36(2): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[132] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[134]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[143]</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(a)]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Basis on which Mr Choo was to be paid</span> </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 First, the court found that the Melbourne Capital Agreement did not exist. Other than Mr Choo’s bare assertions, there was no evidence of such an agreement. Further, at the time of this alleged agreement, the defendants had no dispute with Mr Lee regarding the recovery of their capital from the Melbourne Properties. In any event, even if the Melbourne Capital Agreement had existed, Mr Choo’s claim for fees thereunder would have been time-barred because more than six years had elapsed between the return of Mr Phua’s capital from the investments in the Melbourne Properties and the filing of the writ of summons in the present suit: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[16</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[177]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(b)]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 Next, the court found that the Melbourne Profits Agreement (Phua), the Interpleader Agreement, and the Melbourne Profits Agreement (Joint) did not exist. Mr Choo claimed hourly rates of S$800 and S$1,200 <span class="font-italic">per </span>hour under these alleged agreements. However, there was no documentary evidence to support these alleged hourly rates. There were also inconsistencies between Mr Choo’s pleaded position and his own testimony at the trial as to when these hourly rates were agreed on, and even what these hourly rates were. The evidence also showed that the defendants would not have agreed to these exorbitant hourly rates, especially when the extent of their potential legal costs would be uncertain. Furthermore, even if the Interpleader Agreement had existed, Mr Choo’s claim for fees thereunder would have been time-barred because more than six years had elapsed between Mr Choo’s completion of his work under the Interpleader Agreement and the filing of the writ of summons in the present suit: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[19</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">220]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[239]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[242]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(c)]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Instead, Mr Choo was to be paid in accordance with the 20% Remuneration Arrangement for all the work done for the defendants with respect to the recovery of the profits from their investments in the Melbourne Properties and OS 601. This arrangement cohered with the documentary evidence, including the written Consultancy Agreement, and was also more plausible in the circumstances: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">205] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">206]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[221] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[23</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">243] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">244]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(c)]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 However, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement was champertous as it was based on Mr Choo receiving a 20% share of whatever the defendants recovered from the profits of the investments in the Melbourne Properties. As such, the 20% Remuneration Arrangement was contrary to public policy and was, therefore, void and unenforceable: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">267] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[277] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(d)]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 There was also no evidence that the defendants had agreed to pay Mr Choo his alleged overseas fees, which were inconsistent with those recorded in the written Consultancy Agreement. Furthermore, Mr Choo had not produced any documentary evidence to support his claim for the expenses he had incurred on air tickets and accommodation: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[233] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[238]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[245]</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(e)]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 As for the Lee Claim Agreement, the court found that the alleged annual retainer under this agreement did not exist, and that Mr Choo could not rely on the written Tripartite Agreement to support his claim. In any event, Mr Choo had not provided any cogent or consistent basis for claiming this alleged retainer from the defendants: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">246] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">263] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">f)]</span>.       </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mr Choo had already been paid </span> </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 It was undisputed that the Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement existed and that Mr Choo was entitled to A$50,000 thereunder. However, the court found that the defendants had paid Mr Choo the full fixed fee of A$50,000 in 2001. This was supported by the documentary and circumstantial evidence. In any event, Mr Choo’s claim for this fee was time-barred as more than six years had elapsed between Mr Choo’s completion of his work under the Mei Leong Indemnity Agreement and the filing of the writ of summons in the present suit: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[280] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">291]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[329] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[330]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">g)]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 The court found that the defendants had also paid Mr Choo a sum of S$200,000 in 2013, which served as full and final settlement of all fees payable by them to Mr Choo from the moneys in the ACU Account. The evidence showed that the full sum of S$200,000 was paid to Mr Choo by Mr Ding and that it was intended as a settlement of Mr Choo’s claim against the defendants: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">292] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">327]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[331] </span>to<span class="font-weight-bold"> [333]</span>, and<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[405(h)]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Novation</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 In any event, the defendants had signed a Deed of Agreement of Transfer of Beneficial Interest (the “DATBI”) in January 2013, under which Mr Ding agreed to assume Mr Phua’s liability to pay Mr Choo’s fees for services rendered since 2000. The court found that the DATBI had novated any liabilities that Mr Phua had to pay Mr Choo’s fees to Mr Ding, and that Mr Choo had impliedly consented to the novation as he had drafted the DATBI. Consequently, Mr Choo could no longer claim any unpaid fees from Mr Phua: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[33</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5] </span>to<span class="font-weight-bold"> [346] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[405(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">i)]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Phua’s counterclaim</span> </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 The court found that Mr Choo was not entitled to sell the Atech Shares or retain any of the sale proceeds as payment for work done. Mr Choo held these shares on trust for Mr Phua and was only entitled to sell them without Mr Phua’s consent if certain conditions were satisfied. At the time Mr Choo sold the shares, these conditions had not been satisfied. Furthermore, as the Atech Shares were held as security for the payment of Mr Choo’s legal fees, and these legal fees were paid, he had no basis to sell the Atech Shares. However, as Mr Choo had failed to produce any documentary evidence of the sale price and total sale proceeds of the Atech Shares despite several invitations to do so, an account and inquiry would be an exercise in futility. Based on Mr Choo’s own position that the Atech Shares were sold for a total sum of A$214,524, the court ordered Mr Choo to pay Mr Phua this sum with interest: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">355] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[393]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[406]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Ding’s counterclaim </span> </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 The court found that Mr Ding had made loans amounting to S$24,000 to Mr Choo in 2015. Mr Choo’s contention that these sums were intended to be advance payments of his fees was unsupported by the evidence. Consequently, the court ordered Mr Choo to repay these loans with interest: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">394] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[404]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[407]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
