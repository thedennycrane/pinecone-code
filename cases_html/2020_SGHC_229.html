</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The issues raised at [20(c)] and [20(e)] above are issues relating to OS 320, rather than SUM 1281. The plaintiff, through SUM 3929, seeks a declaration in relation to SUM 1281 which has nothing to do with OS 320. Hence, OS 320 may not be fully relevant to SUM 3929. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I turn now to whether para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether SUM 1281 related only to the issue of costs. In my view, para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies. SUM 1281 is an application for the reimbursement of the second defendant’s solicitors’ fees, or solicitor-and-client costs. This is the only issue in SUM 1281 as the Consent Order requires the second defendant’s solicitors to be paid. The plaintiff does not deny that the second defendant’s solicitors had to be paid for their services in safeguarding the interest of the second defendant in OS 1446. The bone of contention was the amount or quantum of the Fees. The first defendant had paid the second defendant’s solicitors and sought reimbursement from the second defendant, which was resisted by the plaintiff who wanted the second defendant’s solicitors’ bills to be taxed. It is obvious that this issue, in substance, relates only to the Fees (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, costs). Therefore, para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies. This is based on a broad reading of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), with a view to evaluating the <span class="font-italic">substance </span>of the dispute between the parties and consequently, the issue that will arise on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In adopting this substantive approach, I consider the purpose of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as well as the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu </span>[2016] 2 SLR 105 (“<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span>”) in its interpretation of s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SCJA (as enacted prior to the amendments made to the SCJA in 2018). Section 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the old SCJA is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> to<span class="font-italic"> </span>para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA as presently enacted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The purpose of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)/s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was alluded to by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [33], where it observed that “Parliament’s intention in [the SCJA] as a whole has always been to assist the efficient working of the Court of Appeal by allowing the screening of certain categories of appeals”. The effect of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is that costs constitute<span class="font-italic"> </span>one of the subject matters in respect of which appeals are restricted. This is logical – costs are often of lesser significance than the substantive claim itself and generally do not involve novel or complicated principles of law. In the interest of ensuring the efficiency of the Court of Appeal and maximising court resources, appeals are restricted to “where the only issue in the appeal relates to costs”. After all, the use of court resources involves public funds that have to be utilised prudently and judiciously. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Turning to <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> itself, the Court of Appeal held that an application under s 122 of the LPA fell within the scope of s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).<span class="font-italic"> </span>The following observations by the Court of Appeal in particular are pertinent: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 … To accept the appellant’s argument meant that we would be restricting the meaning of the term ‘only issue … relates to costs’ in s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to the issue of quantum of costs. There is no reason why that term should be limited in this way. <span class="font-italic">When one is considering an issue relating to costs, one can be considering a whole host of matters</span>. For example, whether or not costs should be awarded at all or whether parties should be allowed to argue about costs in a taxation (<span class="font-italic">per </span>s 122 of the LPA) or whether costs should be fixed or whether separate costs orders should be made in respect of separate issues. <span class="font-italic">There are many aspects that may need a court’s attention when it </span><span class="font-italic">has to decide issues which relate to costs, whether at first instance or on appeal</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 … Although the 1993 <span class="font-italic">Hansard </span>does not contain any specific discussion of this amendment, <span class="font-italic">bearing in mind that Parliament’s intention in this legislation as a whole has always been to assist the efficient working of the Court of Appeal by allowing the screening of certain categories of appeals, it</span><span class="font-italic"> would be hard to argue that Parliament did not intend to widen the scope of the word ‘costs’ </span>when it removed the phrase that had hitherto qualified it and limited it to costs orders made by the court. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Based on the above, the Court of Appeal rejected the appellant’s submissions that s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) should be restricted to the issue of quantum of costs or to party-and-party costs, holding that a broader interpretation should be given to the provision.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  DWS, at para 41. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In coming to its decision, the Court of Appeal also considered the wording of s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as well as the fact that such an interpretation would not be unfair (see <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [32] and [33]). Instead, it would accord with the policy consideration underlying s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Furthermore, in applying s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to the facts of that case, the Court of Appeal identified the issue on appeal as such at [35]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… That was far from the issue here: the appellant accepted liability as a client but was dissatisfied with the quantum of that liability in respect of the amount that the respondent received, while not disputing the reasonableness of the total bill. <span class="font-italic">The issue which the appellant sought to raise related </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">essentially</span><span class="font-italic"> to quantum, not to liability per se</span>. In our view, the appellant’s grievance was an issue that was encompassed by the phrase ‘issue [that] relates to costs’ that appears in s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Court of Appeal thus gave a broader reading to the phrase “issue [that] relates to costs” and considered the essence of the issue sought to be raised by the appellant. I agree with this approach. In my view, a substantive approach to the interpretation of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would be in line with the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>as well as with Parliament’s intention for the following reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, it is notable that para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) uses the word “relates” besides the other words “only issue”. Therefore, the central plank of the appeal has to relate to or focus on costs although there could be tangential issues. This affords some latitude to the court when assessing whether the issue arising on appeal bears some relation to costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Secondly, a substantive approach is in line with the nature of the issues relating to costs. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> at [31], “[w]hen one is considering an issue relating to costs, one can be considering a whole host of matters” and “[t]here are many aspects that may need a court’s attention when it has to decide issues which relate to costs”. A substantive approach to determine the issues arising on appeal and whether these relate to costs accords with the breadth of the issues that may arise when the court is dealing with costs. It also diminishes the possibility that a case essentially dealing with costs will fall outside the scope of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) just because it tangentially relates to matters not pertaining to costs <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Finally, such an interpretation of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would not be unfair. To the contrary, adopting a technical and narrow reading of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would allow the appellant to easily circumvent the subject matter restriction in para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) by dividing the substance of the case into an entire range of potential sub-issues in order to bring the case on appeal through the backdoor. This would mean that parties could creatively open a Pandora’s box on costs and overcomplicate the costs issues in order to gain access to the Court of Appeal.  This also means that the Court of Appeal will be faced with a greater caseload although issues relating to costs are generally quite minor. Moreover, it is important to emphasise that the restriction in para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is not absolute. The appellant can still seek leave to appeal against the court’s decision if it believes that the case warrants an appeal despite the fact that the only issue on appeal relates to costs. In this way, the court can sieve out the cases deserving of appeal while avoiding a deluge of cases to the Court of Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Therefore, I find that a substantive approach to para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is justified on the wording of para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), as well as in principle and policy. On this approach, SUM 1281 falls within para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) because the only issue therein – whether the plaintiff can resist procuring the second defendant to reimburse the first defendant for the Fees – relates to costs. All of the parties’ arguments in SUM 1281 ultimately led to the question of whether the first defendant had to be reimbursed for the Fees and whether the plaintiff’s arguments that the Fees had to be taxed were justifiable. The underlying context for the application for reimbursement is the Consent Order and this is merely tangential and does not change the fact that in substance, SUM 1281 is essentially about costs. This was recognised by the plaintiff himself, as evident from both the written and oral submissions of his solicitors.

In essence, the general philosophy that is reflected in these provisions is that a party’s ability to appeal an interlocutory matter ought to depend on the importance of that matter to the substantive outcome of the case. Hence, matters that are non-appealable include decisions to grant unconditional leave to defend or to set aside unconditionally a default judgment, which send the matter back along the ordinary route to trial, where the parties’ substantive rights will be decided after undertaking the forensic process … Matters that are appealable with leave concern matters which, although they do not directly determine the substantive outcome of the case, may nevertheless have some material impact on it … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 The cases have recognised that para [1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>)] of the Fifth Schedule of the Act should operate in a way that is consistent with this general philosophy which places the focus on whether the application in question is one that has an effect on the final outcome of the case. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiff submits that SUM 1281 is not an interlocutory application, and that the orders made in SUM 1281 finally determined the parties’ rights in relation to SUM 4 and OS 320.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I agree with the first defendant’s submission. The plaintiff’s arguments are incorrect in law. The assessment of whether the application and/or order finally determines or disposes of the parties’ rights must be made in the context of the proceedings in which they arise. As the Court of Appeal made clear in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Nasco Gem </span>at [16] (affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Telecom Credit</span> at [17] and [26]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To determine whether an order made at an interlocutory application is final, the matter must be viewed in the context of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the cause in the pending action</span>.

The point may again best be illustrated by an example. Taking the case of an action for breach of contract, where an application is made for the discovery of documents, the order on discovery will be an interlocutory order. But it does not follow that every discovery order will necessarily be an interlocutory order. <span class="font-italic">It will depend on the nature of the originating process and the relief(s) prayed for</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 This also appears to have been the legislative intention behind para 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>), based on the following explanation of para 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) given by the Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 October 2010), vol 87 at cols 1368–1370): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Between the time <span class="font-italic">when a party files a civil case in court</span> and <span class="font-italic">when the case is heard</span>, lawyers may file what are known as ‘interlocutory applications’ in court.

With this calibrated approach, some interlocutory orders will not be allowed to go to the Court of Appeal, whilst others can only go to the Court of Appeal with the permission of the High Court. The decision of the High Court whether to grant permission is final. The right to appeal all the way to the Court of Appeal will, however, remain for interlocutory applications that could affect the <span class="font-italic">final outcome</span><span class="font-italic"> of the case</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Thus, the authorities and parliamentary intention affirm the conclusion that the court should look at the originating process from which the application arises. While the plaintiff seeks to distinguish the relevant cases on the basis that none of them involved multiple related originating processes, I do not think it is appropriate to do so. As explained above, the purpose of para 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) is to limit appeals to applications and/or orders which do not finally determine or dispose of the substantive outcome of the case itself. That is the threshold which Parliament considered would strike an appropriate balance between the various policy considerations of allowing access to avenues of appeal, developing jurisprudence on interlocutory matters, avoiding strain to the ability and resources of the Court of Appeal, and effective case management in the interests of timely and efficient administration of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Dorsey</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [35]–[37]). The plaintiff has not produced any authority supporting its contention that the court should assess the effect of the application and/or orders by reference to other summonses in the same originating process, or to another originating process altogether. Therefore, the reference point for SUM 1281 must be OS 1446 and not OS 320. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Applying this principle to the present case, the application and orders made in SUM 1281 must be assessed in the context of OS 1446 and the relief prayed for in OS 1446. Since the plaintiff withdrew his claim in OS 1446, the relevant claim is the first defendant’s counterclaim, which involves a declaration that several notices of EGMs and the decisions taken at those EGMs, as well as several notices of the board of directors’ meetings and the decisions taken at those meetings, are invalid and of no effect (“the Declarations”) (see [4] above). The parties’ rights as to the Declarations would not be affected by a determination of SUM 1281 either way. This is because SUM 1281 deals with the entirely separate issue of whether the first defendant should be reimbursed by the second defendant for the Fees she paid to the second defendant’s solicitors. Similarly, the orders made in respect of SUM 1281 pertain only to the reimbursement to the first defendant for the Fees and have nothing to do with the Declarations sought by the first defendant in OS 1446. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This coheres with the fact that SUM 1281 in effect arises as a result of SUM 4 (the application in respect of which the Consent Order was made). SUM 4 was taken out by the first defendant in OS 1446 due to her concern that the plaintiff’s solicitors were also representing the second defendant in OS 1446, which gave rise to a conflict of interest situation. This relationship between SUM 4 and SUM 1281 was not denied by the plaintiff. SUM 4 thus arose out of OS 1446. In this light, SUM 4 is clearly an interlocutory application as it did not concern the Declarations sought for in OS 1446. Instead, it was purely facilitative in so far as it ensured that the second defendant would have appropriate and independent representation for the proceedings in OS 1446. The plaintiff  argues  that SUM 4 is “standalone” and “bears absolutely no relation to the ultimate issue to be determined in OS 1446” and that is why he submits that SUM 4 is also not an interlocutory application.

</div> But SUM 4 is an interlocutory application that arose from the plaintiff’s initiation of OS 1446 where he chose his own solicitors to also represent the second defendant. The outcome of SUM 4 will not determine the substantive rights of the parties in OS 1446. It was the Consent Order in SUM 4 that resulted in SUM 1281 as the first defendant sought reimbursement of the Fees. Given the close relationship between SUM 4 and SUM 1281, it is logical that SUM 1281 must be an interlocutory application from which the interlocutory orders were derived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Therefore, SUM 1281 is an interlocutory application and the orders made in respect of SUM 1281 are interlocutory orders falling within the scope of para 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on whether leave is required to appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 For the above reasons, I find that both paras 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA apply in the present case.

The decision in SUM 1281 was handed down on 27 July 2020. The latest date on which leave to appeal could have been sought was 6 August 2020. However, this application was only filed on 11 September 2020.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Court of Appeal also set out the following general principles in relation to these four factors: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The precise facts and circumstances of each case are “all-important” (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Although all four factors are “equally important” and must be “balanced against one another”, the emphasis will invariably be on the first two factors of the length of the delay and the reasons for the delay (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [19] and [28]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The court’s approach towards the applications for the extensions of time will be “far stricter” than in other situations. The starting point is that the Rules of Court should be obeyed, with reasonable diligence being exercised. This is because the court’s “overriding concern” is the need for finality in order to ensure justice and fairness. In the Court of Appeal’s words, the winning party “should not be kept waiting – at least, not indefinitely – on tenterhooks to receive the fruits of its judgment” (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [18] and [33]; <span class="font-italic">Lai Swee Lin Linda v Attorney-General </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In relation to the individual factors themselves, the Court of Appeal explained as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If the delay is not <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>, the court must examine the reasons for such delay. What amounts to a satisfactory explanation depends on the precise factual matrix, although the mere assertion that there was an oversight is insufficient. In assessing the applicant’s explanation, the court must “ensure that justice and fairness are ultimately achieved in the context of the need to ensure that there is finality in litigation” (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [21]–[23]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In evaluating the chances of the appeal succeeding, the court applies a “very low threshold” – whether the appeal is “hopeless” or “there are no prospects of the applicant succeeding on appeal”. In considering this factor, the court should not go into a full-scale examination of the issues. If the appeal is not hopeless, the factor will be neutral (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether prejudice to the would-be respondent can be shown depends on the precise facts of the case. The prejudice must be one that cannot be compensated by an appropriate order as to costs. Moreover, the prejudice must be “tangibly proven” and cannot simply refer to the fact that the appeal would continue if the extension is granted, or that the respondent would be deprived of the benefits of the judgment until after the appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [24]–[27]; <span class="font-italic">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd and another v Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd and others </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 335 (“<span class="font-italic">Aberdeen</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The plaintiff submits that if leave is required, it should be granted an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal.

</div> I am not entirely convinced that the plaintiff and his solicitors were seriously of the view that leave to appeal was not required. If that was the case, there would have been no need to file this present application to seek a declaration to the same effect. The plaintiff could simply have contested the first defendant’s application in CA SUM 91 to strike out his Notice of Appeal in CA 140, as he is doing in respect of CA SUM 90. The plaintiff is not seeking a declaration that leave is not required to appeal against the decision in OS 320 notwithstanding that the first defendant has lodged CA SUM 90 to strike out CA 137 on the ground that leave is required to lodge an appeal. The plaintiff’s solicitors explained that this was because there was no uncertainty regarding the need for leave to appeal against the decision in OS 320. In other words, the plaintiff is confident that he can fend off the first defendant’s striking out application in CA SUM 90. The implication of this explanation is that the plaintiff was not as certain about his position in SUM 1281 as he seeks to suggest.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Secondly, even if I accept the plaintiff’s explanation that he honestly believed leave to appeal was not required, this only means that the plaintiff and his solicitors made a mistake in interpreting and/or applying the applicable legal principles.

</div> the position that leave to appeal is not required was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a reasonable or principled conclusion to reach based on the existing jurisprudence and authorities. In particular, the principles relating to para 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) are well-settled and the courts have clearly spelt out the ambit of what constitutes interlocutory applications and interlocutory orders. Indeed, these principles were set out in the cases cited by the plaintiff in his written submissions. In these circumstances, it seems that there was a dereliction of duty on the part of the plaintiff’s solicitors when they advised the plaintiff not to apply for leave to appeal, which resulted in an application for leave to appeal being made long after the time limit for doing so had expired.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Finally, even if the legal principles and/or facts of the present case are of such complexity as the plaintiff contends, the appropriate course of action for the plaintiff was to seek a declaration from the court that leave to appeal was not necessary. This was explained by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Xin Chang Shu” </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1195 (“<span class="font-italic">Xin Chang Shu</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The Court of Appeal] suggested that in an appropriate case, where there is uncertainty over whether leave to appeal is required, <span class="font-italic">the proper approach is for the appellant to seek a declaration from the judge that it does not need leave to appeal</span> (at [57]). I should mention that it is implicit in the suggestion by the Court of Appeal that <span class="font-italic">any application to seek clarification from the judge should be </span><span class="font-italic">made … within the seven-day deadline</span> stipulated under O 56 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is true that such a course of action should only be taken where there is “<span class="font-italic">genuine </span>uncertainty” (see <span class="font-italic">Xin Chang Shu </span>at [9]). However, in this case it is notable that the issue of whether leave to appeal is necessary surfaced almost immediately after I handed down my decision in respect of SUM 1281. After SUM 1281 was granted, the plaintiff’s solicitors made an oral application for a stay of execution in light of the fact that the plaintiff was considering an appeal. In response, the first defendant’s solicitors stated that as far as SUM 1281 was concerned, the plaintiff needed to apply for leave to appeal.

</div> Therefore, it was expressly brought to the plaintiff’s attention immediately after SUM 1281 was decided that leave to appeal was required. At the very least, it should have alerted the plaintiff and put him on notice that there might be some contention between the parties on the issue of whether leave was required to appeal. Although the plaintiff contends that it was only “formally alerted” to this position when the first defendant filed CA SUM 91 to strike out CA 140,

</div> this misses the point. The first defendant’s solicitors had informed the plaintiff’s solicitors and the court in an official court hearing that the first defendant’s position was that leave to appeal was required. This should have made the first defendant’s position abundantly clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In these circumstances, if the plaintiff had truly found the facts and applicable principles complex, he should have applied for a declaration that leave to appeal was not required as soon as possible. The plaintiff cannot have his cake and eat it too; he cannot contend that the facts and/or legal principles were so complex that a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>mistake was justifiably made, yet not complex enough to warrant an application for a declaration that leave was not required. With due respect, the application of paras 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) to<span class="font-italic"> </span>SUM 1281 was not legally and factually complex as it is clear that SUM 1281 was an interlocutory application giving rise to interlocutory orders, and only dealt with reimbursement of the Fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For these reasons, I do not find that the plaintiff has provided a satisfactory explanation for his 36-day delay in seeking leave to appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Chances of the plaintiff’s appeal succeeding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I turn now to the chances of the plaintiff’s appeal succeeding. I reiterate that the threshold in this regard is extremely low as it only requires that the appeal cannot be described as “hopeless” or having “no prospects” (see [47(b)] above). Having considered the arguments that the plaintiff intends on raising in the appeal, I find that the chances of success in the appeal, while not completely “hopeless”, are nevertheless extremely remote. I shall elaborate on the plaintiff’s arguments in greater detail below. Since the plaintiff’s chances of success in the appeal are remote but not completely “hopeless”, I consider this a neutral factor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prejudice to the first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Finally, I turn to whether prejudice would be occasioned to the first defendant if the court granted the plaintiff an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal. The first defendant submits that if the extension of time was granted, prejudice would be occasioned in so far as the proceedings would continue to “hang over” the first defendant and the first defendant would have to spend time and incur costs to defend the appeal.

</div> For these reasons, I do not find that the first defendant would suffer prejudice if an extension of time were granted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on whether extension of time should be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Although the first defendant would not suffer prejudice if an extension of time were granted, I am of the view that an extension of time is nevertheless not justified.  The length of the delay was excessive and the plaintiff does not have a satisfactory explanation for his delay as the plaintiff’s solicitors were alerted to the fact that leave was required for an appeal of SUM 1281 as early as 27 July 2020 when the order was made. In the circumstances, it would not be just or fair to grant the plaintiff an extension of time simply because the plaintiff’s solicitors were negligent. This was not a case in which the plaintiff’s solicitors misinterpreted or misapplied the principles relating to whether leave to appeal was required. It seems clear that the plaintiff’s solicitors decided not to apply for leave to appeal despite knowing that leave to appeal was likely to be required. I emphasise that seeking a declaration as in SUM 3929 was an option available to the plaintiff from the very beginning. However, the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">chose </span>not to take up that option until after the time limit had expired. Having made that decision, it is only fair that the plaintiff should live with the consequences.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff should be granted leave to appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Even if the plaintiff is granted an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal, I would nevertheless have declined to grant the plaintiff leave to appeal against the decision in SUM 1281. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The principles concerning leave to appeal are well-settled. There are at least three limbs which can be relied on when leave to appeal is sought. The “common thread” underlying these grounds is that to deny leave may result in a “miscarriage of justice” (see <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 at [15] and [16]).

When it comes to errors of fact, Kan Ting Chiu J in <span class="font-italic">Essar Steel Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bayerische Landesbank and others </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 25 (“<span class="font-italic">Essar Steel</span>”) at [26] held that the court will only grant leave to appeal where the error is “clear beyond reasonable argument”.

</div> Kan J suggested that this threshold might be satisfied where, for example, undisputed evidence showed the court had made a mistake in respect of the date of service of a notice. In contrast, complaints “that a judge had erred in accepting the evidence of one witness over that of another, or had erred in drawing an inference or coming to a conclusion, will not be considered”. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">IW v IX </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135 (“<span class="font-italic">IW</span>”) at [20] approved the observations in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman bin Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 138 that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he test of <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error would not be satisfied by the assertion that the judge had reached the wrong conclusion on the evidence.

Rather, the plaintiff is disagreeing with the court’s interpretation of the facts, specifically, the meaning and scope of the Consent Order. However, the threshold for errors of fact is that they must be “clear beyond reasonable argument” (see <span class="font-italic">Essar Steel </span>([64] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [26]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments that this is the case here.

</div>
</div> This is by no means the case. As I observed in the Judgment at [11], the solicitors’ fees have to be reasonable and if they are not, the first defendant’s duty as a director is to send the fees for taxation. If the first defendant fails to do so, the proper recourse for the plaintiff is to pursue an action on behalf of the second defendant against the first defendant for breach of her fiduciary duties, rather than pursue an action for the taxation of the Fees. For reasons I have explained in the Judgment (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Judgment at [20]), this would be the most appropriate and equitable course of action, taking into account the parties’ arrangement under the Consent Order, as well as the interests of the plaintiff, the first defendant, the second defendant and the second defendant’s solicitors. The plaintiff’s dogged attempts to send the second defendant’s solicitors’ bills for taxation may not be the correct approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The court’s finding that OS 320 had not been commenced in good faith</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiff submits that the court made several errors in relation to its analysis of whether OS 320 had been commenced in good faith. However, this conflates SUM 1281 and OS 320. The present application concerns the appeal against the decision in SUM 1281, not OS 320. In fact, the plaintiff himself had decided not to make such an application in respect of OS 320, electing only to do so in respect of SUM 1281. Therefore, it is unclear how the court’s reasoning as regards the plaintiff’s good faith for the purposes of s 216A of the Companies Act can affect whether leave to appeal should be granted in respect of SUM 1281. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Nevertheless, for completeness, I clarify that I do not think that the errors raised by the plaintiff provided sufficient grounds to grant leave to appeal in any case. The plaintiff raises the following arguments: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court applied the wrong legal threshold for good faith by placing undue emphasis on the issue of hostility between the parties, and failing to consider the factual context behind the plaintiff’s commencement of OS 1446 and OS 320, as well as the fact that the plaintiff was a 60% shareholder of the second defendant.

In my view, although these questions are phrased in general terms, they essentially concern the applicability of s 122 of the LPA to the present facts. Specifically, whether there had been a “delivery of bill of costs” (Question 1), whether there had been “payment of the bill” (Question 2), and whether there were “special circumstances” justifying taxation nonetheless (Question 3 and Question 4). These are not questions of general principle. Rather, they require consideration of the peculiar circumstances of this case, in particular, the ambit of the Consent Order and the way in which the Fees were paid by the first defendant. The fact that these questions can be phrased in general terms does not assist the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The same can be said for Question 5.

</div> The plaintiff has no basis to make this argument as it must be emphasised that the plaintiff, with the benefit of legal advice from his solicitors, had agreed to the Consent Order in SUM 4. Thus, the issue raised in Question 5 is one which must be decided on the particular facts of this case, rather than as a matter of general principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86  The plaintiff’s suggestion that Question 5 would be an issue raised on appeal is perplexing. The Consent Order expressly sets out the plaintiff’s and the first defendant’s agreement that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. … the 1st Defendant (“MT”) shall be entitled, in her discretion, to select one [law firm] and to engage that law firm in the name and on behalf of RTC to act for and represent RTC, as well as give instructions to and receive advice from such solicitors, in and in connection with this OS and all appeals therefrom. RTC will pay for all that law firm’s fees and expenses without requiring for that or for any other purpose the law firm or MT to produce the instructions from MT or anyone on her behalf to the law firm, the advice from that law firm or communications, oral or otherwise, between that law firm and MT or anyone on her behalf; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.

It is not clear why the plaintiff now seeks to raise on appeal the argument that the first defendant was in a position of conflict of interest <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the second defendant, or whether he can even do so given his previous position on the matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For these reasons, I find that the questions to be raised on appeal are not questions of general principle to be decided for the first time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the appeal involves a question of importance to the public advantage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I turn now to whether the appeal would involve a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.

The Consent Order was drafted specifically to cater to the particular circumstances arising between the parties in light of the plaintiff’s initial claim against the defendants. The findings made in this case, therefore, turn on their own facts and are not of such importance as the plaintiff seeks to suggest.

Taxation of the Fees is inappropriate under these circumstances for the reasons set out in the Judgment. By persisting in his application for taxation, the plaintiff is simply barking up the wrong tree.

</div> Similarly, the plaintiff contends that a finding that SUM 1281 requires leave to appeal whereas OS 320 does not would “effectively render the appeal in OS 320 nugatory” as it would enable the first defendant to “take the point that, by no appeal being taken in respect of SUM 1281, [the plaintiff] has in fact conceded the position in OS 320”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 With respect, this assumption and the consequent arguments are flawed. First, the plaintiff in OS 320 sought to send the second defendant’s solicitors’ invoices for taxation pursuant to s 216A of the Companies Act.  Thus, I agree with the first defendant that leave of the court is required for an appeal against the decision in OS 320 as it deals solely with the issue of costs. The first defendant filed CA SUM 90 and CA SUM 91 to strike out the plaintiff’s Notices of Appeal in CA 137 and CA 140 respectively. But the plaintiff only applied for a declaration that no leave was required to appeal in relation to SUM 1281. There is no similar application for the decision in respect of OS 320. Hence, there is a possibility that the Notice of Appeal in CA 137 may be struck out if the first defendant succeeds in her submission to the Court of Appeal that para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) applies to OS 320 as well. Given these circumstances, whether there will even be an appeal of OS 320 is presently uncertain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Secondly, even if there is an appeal against the decision in OS 320, the plaintiff overstates the extent of the relationship between OS 320 and SUM 1281. It is true that factually, there is an overlap between OS 320 and SUM 1281 – both deal with the Consent Order, the Fees, and the first defendant’s payment of the Fees. Some of the factual issues also overlap, for instance, the scope of the parties’ arrangements pursuant to the Consent Order. However, from a legal perspective, the two applications are quite different. OS 320 is an action between the plaintiff and the second defendant, for leave to be granted to the plaintiff to commence a derivative action on behalf of the second defendant to send the Fees for taxation. In contrast, SUM 1281 is an application by the first defendant against the plaintiff to compel the plaintiff to procure the second defendant and the finance manager of the second defendant to reimburse the first defendant pursuant to the Consent Order. The Consent Order, in turn, was arrived at after discussions between the solicitors of the plaintiff and the first defendant in SUM 4. As a result, the issues in OS 320 and SUM 1281 are different. The outcome of one may not necessarily determine the other, and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Even if the application in OS 320 had been allowed, that did not necessarily mean that SUM 1281 would have been dismissed as the dispute in SUM 1281 was only regarding the quantum to be paid to the second defendant’s solicitors. The court could have ordered the plaintiff to nevertheless procure the second defendant to reimburse the first defendant pending the taxation proceedings brought pursuant to OS 320. In similar vein, the fact that OS 320 may be appealed without the leave of the court whereas SUM 1281 may not does not render any appeal of OS 320 nugatory. The reasons given by the court in respect of its decision on OS 320 can still be considered by the Court of Appeal. If the appeal against the decision in OS 320 is eventually granted and the Fees are successfully taxed, the second defendant’s solicitors can return to the second defendant the amount of the Fees which are found to be excessive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It seems that OS 320 may also require the leave of the court for an appeal since the substance of OS 320 deals solely with the taxation of the Fees. This is as <span class="font-italic">per</span> the substantive approach to para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) which I have earlier explained (see [31] and [94] above). Notwithstanding that OS 320 is an originating summons, it could also be an interlocutory application like SUM 1281 as OS 320 also arose from SUM 4 which is an interlocutory application arising from OS 1446.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In summary, my findings are as follows. I find that leave is required to appeal against the decision in SUM 1281. Paragraph 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA applies in this case. The only issue in the appeal is whether the plaintiff can resist procuring the second defendant to reimburse the first defendant on the basis that the Fees should be taxed. This issue is one which relates to costs. Paragraph 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA also applies, because SUM 1281 is an interlocutory application and the orders made therein are interlocutory orders <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>OS 1446. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As such, leave is required to appeal. However, the plaintiff’s application for leave to appeal is out of time. I find that there are no good reasons justifying the grant of an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal, as the plaintiff’s delay is not <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>and the plaintiff was negligent and caused the delay. This is notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff’s chances of success on appeal are remote and minimal prejudice would occasion to the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Even if an extension of time is granted, there is no justification to grant the plaintiff leave to appeal against the decision in SUM 1281 as the plaintiff has not shown that any of the grounds warranting the grant of leave are satisfied in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the plaintiff’s application in SUM 3929. I shall now hear parties on the issue of costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eng Zixuan Edmund, Brinden Anandakumar, Danica Gan Fang Ling and Chang Chee Jun (Fullerton Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Davinder Singh s/o Amar Singh SC, Pardeep Singh Khosa, Tan Siew Wei Cheryl, Tan Mao Lin, Delvin Chua and Kenneth Koh (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The second defendant absent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
