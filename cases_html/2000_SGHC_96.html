<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.<b> </b>The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs are a company incorporated in

Australia. They manufacture bellows, flexible hoses and pipe expansion joints. The 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore and the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs are

their shareholders.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. Among other products, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs manufacture

bellows at their Pandan Loop factory under licence from the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs.

These bellows are essentially corrugated pipes which allow for expansion in long stretches

of pipelines in ships. They look like cylindrical concertinas. The corrugations, or

convolutions as the plaintiffs term them, are formed in 1.2mm thick stainless steel tubes

of various diameters using a bellows forming machine ("the Plaintiffs'

machine"). This machine holds the tube up and rolls it as it subjects it to a force

exerted by a wheel on the inside of the tube. In this manner a convolution is gradually

cold-formed on the tube. The process is repeated for the next convolution until the

required number of convolutions is formed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was employed by the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs as a Sales Engineer sometime in mid-1998. One of the products he sold was the

bellows. About a year later, on 20 June 1999, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant tendered a

letter of resignation which is expressed to be effective on that date. After that,

sometime in July 1999, he commenced employment with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants as their

managing director.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants are a private exempt company

incorporated on 16 March 1990. They have an authorised and paid-up capital of $200,000.

The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant owns 50% and his wife owns 49.99% of the company. She is a

director of the company, having been appointed on 12 August 1995. On 22 July 1999 the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant was appointed a director and the managing director of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. Sometime in September 1999 the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs learnt from

their customers that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had offered to sell bellows to them. As

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs believed that only they were capable of manufacturing such

bellows in Singapore, they decided to investigate. On 5 October 1999 the plaintiffs'

representatives, Ian Robinson ("Robinson") and Richard Ng Chee Sheng

("Ng"), visited the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants' premises at No. 8 Link Road and

found a number of bellows lying around. They then discovered, inside an enclosure within

the factory, a machine ("the Defendants' machine") which they determined to be

similar in all essential aspects to the Plaintiffs' machine. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant

was not present at the time. The plaintiffs decided to commence legal proceedings against

the defendants and took out the writ in this action on 5 November 1999.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">1. The Claims and Defences</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs' claim is against both defendants for

infringement of copyright. The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs claim that they are the owners of

the copyright in certain documents containing drawings and notes in relation to the

Plaintiffs' machine. They say that these documents contain original literary and artistic

works. They claim that both defendants, by copying such works on paper and by

manufacturing the Defendants' machine, had reproduced those original works in

two-dimensions and three-dimensions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. In their joint Amended Defence, the defendants put the plaintiffs to

strict proof of their claim to copyright in the works. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant denied

copying the Plaintiffs' machine or any of the plaintiffs' works. The defendants also

denied that the Defendants' machine was a reproduction of such works. In the alternative,

they also rely on the provision in section 69 of the Copyright Act ("the Act").</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs' claim is against the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant. The first part of their claim is for breach of an express term in his contract

of employment prohibiting the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant from revealing any trade secrets

and confidential information. The second part of the claim is for breach of an implied

term in the contract of employment, viz. that he owed a duty of good faith and fidelity to

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs. Both these claims relate to the disclosure by the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants of the following information:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs' literary and artistic works the

  subject matter of their claim in copyright;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the names and addresses of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs'

  customers;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the usual requirements of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs'

  customers both as to quantity and quality;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the prices charged to individual customers of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Plaintiffs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant denied disclosing the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs' works to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. He denied ever having possession of

them. As for the information relating to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs' customers, viz.

their names and addresses and their usual requirements, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant

denied ever receiving or having access to such information in the course of his

employment. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also denied using the information on prices.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2. Claim in Copyright</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. In order to succeed in the claim in copyright, the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs have to establish that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) copyright subsists in Singapore in the artistic or literary works

  concerned and is owned by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs; and</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the defendants have infringed their copyright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I shall examine in turn each of these issues, which spawn further

sub-issues, in respect of each document the literary or artistic content of which the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs claim copyright over. Although failure by the plaintiffs to prove any single

sub-issue would mean that the claim fails in respect of that document, I would, both for

completeness and in case I am wrong on that sub-issue, make findings on every sub-issue

for every document. As there are 15 separate documents and 4 sub-issues, I have summarised

my findings in a Table of Findings at the end of this part of the judgment.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2.1 Subsistence and ownership of copyright</p>
</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Section 27 of the Act sets out the conditions under which copyright

may subsist in Singapore in an original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.

Section 30 deals with ownership of copyright in such works. In the present action, the

literary and artistic works concerned are claimed to be created in Australia. Section 184

of the Act provides for the application of the Act to other countries. To this end, the

Copyright (International Protection) Regulations were promulgated on 10 April 1987. The

relevant parts of regulation 3 are paragraphs (3) and (4), which provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(3) Subject to these Regulations, the provisions of the Act relating to

  works and other subject-matter shall apply in relation to persons who, at a material time,

  are citizens or nationals of a country specified in the Schedule in like manner as those

  provisions shall apply in relation to persons who, at a material time, are citizens of

  Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Subject to these Regulations, the provisions of the Act relating to

  works and other subject-matter shall apply in relation to persons who, at a material time,

  are resident in a country that constitutes, or forms part of, the territory of a country

  specified in the Schedule in like manner as those provisions shall apply in relation to

  persons who, at a material time, are resident in Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Australia is one of the countries specified in the Schedule.

Accordingly, regulation 3(3) and 3(4) make the provisions in the Act relating to works

applicable in respect of persons who are citizens, nationals or residents of Australia in

like manner as those provisions apply in relation to persons who are citizens or residents

of Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Section 27 deals with two types of works, viz. unpublished works in

sub-section (1), and published works in sub-section (2). Section 24 deems a literary or

artistic work to be published if, but only if, reproductions of the work or an edition of

it have been supplied, whether by sale or otherwise, to the public. The plaintiffs do not

allege that this has been done; therefore the works concerned are unpublished works and

fall to be considered under section 27(1). That provision, and section 27(4), state as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">27. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist

  in an original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work that is unpublished and of

  which the author -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) was a qualified person at the time when the work was made; or</p>
<p align="justify">(b) if the making of the work extended over a period - was a qualified

    person for a substantial part of that period.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(4) In this section, "qualified person" means a citizen of

  Singapore or a person resident in Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Applying regulation 3, the copyright in the works would subsist in the

authors of such works if they were Australian citizens, nationals or residents "at a

material time". The term "at a material time" is defined in regulation 2(1)

as the time when the work in question was made, or over a substantial part of the period

over which it was made.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The plaintiffs claim that the authors of the works were employees

of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs at the time and they created the works concerned pursuant

to their terms of employment. Section 30(6) provides that in such a situation, the

employer shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting by virtue of Part III of the Act.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. Therefore, the questions to be determined under this head are as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) the identity of the authors of the literary or artistic works;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) whether the authors were citizens or residents of Singapore or

  Australia when the works were created; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) whether the authors were employees of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs

  at the time and had created the works pursuant to the terms of their employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. Before proceeding to the first question, I set out below the

documents containing the artistic and literary works over which copyright is claimed by

the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs. They had exhibited various documents at the outset but

eventually narrowed their copyright claim to the works contained in the following

documents:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) ABD81-82, which contain specifications for the material and

  dimensions of the bellows.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) ABD83, which is a table of bellows ring sizes. Bellows rings are

  steel rings used in the bellows forming process and are an element in the Plaintiffs'

  machine.</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) ABD84, which is a set of instructions on the preliminary set-up

  of the Plaintiffs' machine.</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) ABD85-88, which is a set of operating instructions for the

  Plaintiffs' machine.</p>
<p align="justify">(v) ABD89, which is a schematic drawing of the Plaintiffs' machine.</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) ABD90, which is another schematic drawing of the Plaintiffs'

  machine but which is supposed to show it in the course of performing a

  "re-rolling" function.</p>
<p align="justify">(vii) ABD91, which is a simple line drawing of the cross-section of a

  single "upper wheel", twin "lower wheels" and half of a tube with a

  convolution. The purpose of this drawing is apparently to show the alignment of the wheels

  in relation to the previous convolution in order to form the next one.</p>
<p align="justify">(viii) ABD92, which is also a simple line drawing showing the

  measurement of convolution height using an adjustable square.</p>
<p align="justify">(ix) ABD93, which is a simple line drawing of an element of the

  Plaintiffs' machine.</p>
<p align="justify">(x) ABD94, which is a detailed drawing of an element of the Plaintiffs'

  machine called the "cylinder support arm".</p>
<p align="justify">(xi) ABD95, which is a detailed drawing of the cross-section of an

  element of the Plaintiffs' machine called the "top wheel", with a part view of

  that element showing locations of a series of holes on the wheel.</p>
<p align="justify">(xii) ABD96, which is a detailed drawing of the cross-section of an

  element of the Plaintiffs' machine called the "wheel assembly" comprising the

  top wheel and twin bottom wheels.</p>
<p align="justify">(xiii) PSBD8, which is the perspective view of an element of the

  Plaintiffs' machine called the "pivot plate". </p>
<p align="justify">(xiv) PSBD11, which is a detailed drawing of an element of the

  Plaintiffs' machine, a shaft holding up the steel bellows rings, along with a

  cross-section of such rings.</p>
<p align="justify">(xv) PSBD13, which is a detailed drawing of an element of the

  Plaintiffs' machine, the twin lower wheels, showing the manner in which those wheels are

  held in position and connected to a hydraulic jack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.1.1 Authors</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. I now turn to consider the evidence on authorship. Counsel for the

defendants, Mr Lee, made certain concessions. In respect of ABD81-82, he conceded in his

written submission that the author was one Ken Holzapfel ("Holzapfel"). As for

ABD83, Mr Lee doubted that the identity of the author had been established, but did not

pursue the point as he submitted that nothing turned on the document. I took this to mean

that he did not dispute the plaintiffs' evidence of authorship of this document. Later, in

the course of his oral submissions, Mr Lee said that he was prepared to concede that the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs owned the copyright to ABD81-82 and ABD83 because he was of the view that these

documents did not affect his case. In relation to ABD94, Mr Lee said in his written

submission that he was prepared to concede that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs enjoyed

copyright "as this drawing is not relevant to their case." In view of these

concessions, I find that copyright subsists in the literary and artistic works in

ABD81-82, ABD83 and ABD94 and that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs owns such copyright.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. I now turn to the contested documents. In relation to ABD81-96, the

only evidence of authorship is paragraph 6 of Robinson's affidavit evidence-in-chief which

states as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs' work was created in Australia sometime

  on or about 9<sup>th</sup> April 1991 and was completed in Singapore on 30<sup>th</sup>

  July 1993. The 3 authors of the work were Mr. Ray Lind, Mr. Ken Holzapfel and myself, all

  employees of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs at that time. By virtue of the copyright laws

  of Australia, the copyright in the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs' work belongs to the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Plaintiffs. A copy of the Plaintiffs' work comprising the drawing, specifications,

  operating instructions and standard bellows dimension are collectively annexed hereto as

  exhibit '<b>IRR-3</b>'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Exhibit 'IRR-3' comprises the documents ABD81-96 (and two other

documents which the plaintiffs did not proceed on). It is not clear from this paragraph

alone whether it is alleged (i) that the 3 persons were joint authors of all the documents

in ABD81-96; or (ii) that one or more of them was involved in each of the documents. An

inspection of some of the documents would support the second interpretation. For instance,

ABD83 appears to be a memorandum from the Manufacturing Branch of the Energy Engineering

Division addressed to Holzapfel. The logical inference would be that Holzapfel could not

be a joint author of this document. And ABD81-82 appear to be produced by Holzapfel

because they have his initials on them. Finally, ABD95 is prima facie Lind's because his

name is recorded in the title block as the person who drew it. From this, and from the

evidence that Robinson gave in cross-examination which I will set out below, I conclude

that the second interpretation is the correct one.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. In cross-examination, Robinson said that he was the author of

ABD94. As for the rest, although he had stated in his affidavit that ABD81-96 were

authored by the 3 of them, when asked in cross-examination who prepared ABD 84, he said

that he presumed it was Holzapfel. When questioned on ABD85-88, he said that he believed

it was Holzapfel, but he was not sure. In relation to ABD 95-96, Robinson said that these

were drawn by Lind, whose name is recorded in the title blocks as the person who drew them

on 4 September 1991. Robinson said that Lind was an employee of the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs at the time. In view of Robinson's answers in cross-examination, I find that

the plaintiffs have not proved the authorship of ABD 84 and ABD85-88. However I find that

they have proved that Lind was the author of ABD95 and ABD96.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. The evidence in respect of ABD89-93 is less straightforward. On the

one hand, Robinson had made the blanket statement in paragraph 6 of his affidavit that

these were created by the 3 of them, i.e. himself, Holzapfel and Lind. As I had reasoned

above, I interpret this to mean that one or more of them authored each of the documents.

Unfortunately Mr Lee did not attempt to clarify the exact nature of the authorship of

these particular documents in cross-examination. Since this must be taken to be acceptance

of Robinson's evidence on these particular documents, I find that the plaintiffs have

proved that each of the documents in ABD89-93 was authored by either Robinson, Holzapfel

or Lind, or any combination of them jointly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. There are 3 further documents, viz. PSBD8, PSBD11 and PSBD13. When

asked whether there was any evidence of their authorship, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr

Sivakuamar, referred to paragraphs 22 to 25 of Robinson's supplementary affidavit. But

after it was pointed out to him that those paragraphs did not contain any such evidence,

Mr Sivakumar conceded that there was prima facie no evidence of the authors of PSBD8 and

PSBD11. As the burden of proof in this respect rests on the plaintiffs, I find that the

authorship of PSBD8 and PSBD11 have not been proved.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. In relation to PSBD13, Mr Sivakumar pointed out that although there

was no oral evidence of authorship, Lind's signature appears on it along with the date, 14

October 1991. Presumably he is relying on the presumption in section 131(1) of the Act

which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Where a name purporting to be that of the author of a literary,

  dramatic, musical or artistic work appeared on copies of the work as published or a name

  purporting to be that of the author of an artistic work appeared on the work when it was

  made, <u>the person whose name so appeared</u>, if it was his true name or a name by which

  he was commonly known, <u>shall</u>, in an action brought by virtue of this Part, <u>be

  presumed</u>, unless the contrary is established, <u>to be the author of the work and to

  have made the work in circumstances to which section 30 (4), (5) and (6) does not apply</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As PBSD13 is an unpublished artistic work, the criterion is whether the

"name purporting to be that of the author of an artistic work appeared on the work

when it was made". The signature on PSBD13 does not appear in a formal title block in

a box headed by the words "Drawn by". It appears at the bottom right corner of

the document encircled in a wavy line under the words "BOTTOM FORMING ASSEMBLY"

with a date. There is the question whether the name appeared on PSBD13 when it was made.

There is no evidence that this was the case. Therefore the presumption cannot be invoked.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. Even if the presumption can be invoked, there is the question as to

its scope. The words in section 131(1) underlined above provide for a two-fold

presumption, i.e. (i) the person named is presumed to be the author of the work; and (ii)

he made the work in circumstances in which section 30 (4), (5) and (6) do not apply.

Section 30(6) provides that where a literary, dramatic or artistic work (to which section

30(4) and (5) do not apply) is made by the author in pursuance to the terms of his

employment, his employer shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting under Part III of

the Act. This is the provision on which the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs rely in their claim

of ownership of the copyright in PSBD13. The presumption of authorship in section 131(1)

is invoked only along with the presumption that the author did not create the work

pursuant to the terms of his employment. It would follow that this presumption of

ownership is not available where the author's employer is the person who is bringing the

action as copyright owner.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. I next consider whether, even without the benefit of the

presumption, there is evidence that Lind is the author of PSBD13. As stated above, if his

name appeared in a title box headed "drawn by", I might infer that he is the

author because there is such an assertion on the face of the document. However in the

present circumstance, there can be a number of reasons why his signature appears other

than because he was the maker. Furthermore, this document was not in the agreed bundle.

This means that the defendants have not made an admission as to its authenticity.

Therefore it was for the plaintiffs to prove it by calling the maker or some person who

can attest to the fact that Lind made it. I should think that, at the very least, there

must be a positive statement from someone that Lind was the maker instead of relying on

the fact that his signature appears on the document. That is a simple assertion and the

fact that it cannot be made could mean that the truth is something else. While there can

be a wholly innocent explanation for this omission, it would be unfair to the defendants

to hold as proved a fact that none of the plaintiffs' witnesses have asserted. Therefore I

find that the plaintiffs have not proved the authorship of PSBD13.</p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.1.2 Citizenship or residency</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. Beyond proving the identity of the authors, the plaintiffs must

also prove that they were citizens of or resident in Australia at the time the documents

were made, or possessed that status for a substantial part of any period over which the

works were created: see section 27(1) and 27(4) of the Act, read with regulation 3(3) and

3(4).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. Some of the documents are dated and others are not. ABD81-82 are

dated November 1991. ABD83 is dated 31 May 1982. ABD84-93 are not dated. However Robinson

had stated in paragraph 6 of his affidavit that these were made between 9 April 1991 and

30 July 1993 and I accept that evidence. ABD94 is dated 16 March 1993. ABD95 and ABD96 are

both dated 4 September 1991. I accept these to be the dates of creation of those documents

and find accordingly. PSBD8 and PSBD11 have no date and there is no evidence of when they

were made. The date "4 September 1991" appears on PSBD13. But as there is no

evidence that this is the date of creation, I find that there is no evidence of that date.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. Where there is a date specified in respect of a particular document

(as opposed to the period April 1991 to July 1993), the plaintiffs should give evidence as

to whether the document was created on that date or over a particular period. They have

not done so, but I am prepared to hold that the documents concerned were made on the dates

specified because the nature of the documents do not suggest that any of them would

require more than a day to be made. However for the documents for which the plaintiffs

could only say that they were made between April and July 1993, I can only hold that they

were created over that period. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. Next the plaintiffs have to show that the authors were citizens of

or resident in Australia on those dates or over a substantial part of that period. There

is no direct evidence of the citizenship or residency status of the 3 authors, namely

Robinson, Holzapfel and Lind. I have carefully perused the affidavits of the plaintiffs'

witnesses and their answers in cross-examination and am unable to find any such evidence.

Mr Lee had studiously avoided asking such questions in his cross-examination, as was his

right so to do. Mr Sivakumar concedes that there is no direct evidence but submits that

there is circumstantial evidence of their residency status. This comes from evidence given

by Robinson that all 3 of them were employed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs and their

business cards exhibited in ABD99 had Australian addresses. He argued that as the

defendants did not produce any evidence to the contrary, on a balance of probability, they

were residents of Australia at the time. Mr Lee said that residence in Australia was not

necessarily the only conclusion to be drawn from the fact of their employment by the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs. He pointed out that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs had offices overseas and,

like Robinson who was posted to Singapore, Lind and Holzapfel could have been posted and

resident overseas at the time the works were made.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. In my view, what is relevant is residency status at the time of

creation of the documents. While one can say that the business cards show that they were

based in Australia at one time, there is no evidence that they were based there at the

time of creation of the documents. Take Robinson for example. His business card shows an

Australian office address, telephone and fax numbers. But he also said that he had

obtained a Singapore employment pass 7 or 8 years ago. He had exhibited a business card

showing an Australian address and yet he was resident in Singapore for a number of years.

Section 3(3) of the Evidence Act provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A fact is said to be "proved" when, after considering the

  matters before it, the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so

  probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act

  upon the supposition that it exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In the present case, the same possibility cannot be ruled out in

respect of Holzapfel and Lind in the absence of evidence to that effect. Therefore I

cannot consider the residency status at the material time of Lind and Holzapfel to be so

probable under the circumstances as would cause a prudent man to act on the supposition

that it is true. Accordingly I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that Lind and

Holzapfel were residents of Australia at the material time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. Robinson, who gave oral evidence in court, did not disclose his

citizenship status. He even quoted his passport number but did not state the country of

issue. Had he simply stated that it was an Australian passport, I would have been able to

infer that he was an Australian citizen, although there is still the question of whether

he possessed that status at the time he made the documents concerned. Bluntly put, there

is simply no evidence that he was an Australian citizen or was resident in Australia at

the material time. Although it would appear that he had been resident in Singapore for the

last 7 or 8 years, there is no evidence that he created the documents in question while he

was resident here. Therefore I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that Robinson was

resident in Australia or Singapore at the time he created the documents in question.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. If I were wrong about Robinson, and ought to find that he was

resident either in Australia or Singapore at the time of creation of the documents in

question, it would then be necessary to consider documents ABD89-93 in respect of which I

have found that the plaintiffs have proved that each of these 5 documents was made by

Robinson, Holzapfel or Lind individually or in any combination. The question is whether it

can be said that the plaintiffs have proved, in respect of these documents, that the

author or authors were citizens or residents of Australia. In respect of each document

there is the possibility that Robinson was not involved in its creation. Therefore the

plaintiffs cannot be taken as having proved that the author, or one of the authors, of

each document was a resident of Australia or Singapore at the time of its creation. The

burden of proving authorship of a document over which copyright is claimed rests on the

plaintiffs and it cannot be said that they have discharged this burden by proving that

Robinson <u>could</u> be its author.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. Perhaps the lack of evidence of citizenship or residency may be

attributable to the position taken by Mr Sivakumar as to the law. In paragraph 3.14 of his

written closing submission, he argued as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Defendants have further contended that there has been no evidence

  that the 3 authors of the 1st Plaintiffs’ Work were citizens or residents of

  Australia at the time the work was created. This is not necessary as by virtue of

  Regulation 3(5) of the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations, (PBA-28) the

  Singapore Copyright Act shall apply to bodies incorporated under the laws of Australia in

  the like manner as to bodies incorporated under the laws of Singapore and by virtue of

  Section 30(6) of the Copyright Act (PBA-1) all works done in the course of employment by

  an employee belongs to the employer so that in the present case the connecting factor is

  whether the 1st Plaintiffs were a body corporate incorporated under the laws of Australia

  and were the employers of the authors. This the 1st Plaintiffs have shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. With respect, I do not agree with Mr Sivakumar that it was not

necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the 3 authors were citizens or residents of

Australia. Section 30(6) provides as follows (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Where a literary … or artistic work to which subsections (4) and

  (5) do not apply, … is made by the author in pursuance of the terms of his employment

  by another person under a contract of service or apprenticeship, that other person shall

  be entitled to <u>any copyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this Part</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Counsel were unable to produce any authority on the interpretation of

this provision. Nevertheless, in my view it is clear enough. The words of the provision

underlined above refer to copyright subsisting by virtue of Part III of the Act. Section

30(6) itself does not establish any copyright. It provides that in the situation where

subsections (4) and (5) do not apply to the work concerned, the employer shall be entitled

to any copyright that subsists by virtue of Part III of the Act. Indeed the section

heading to section 30 states "ownership of copyright in original works." This

suggests that it relates to ownership and not to subsistence of copyright. The other

substantive subsections of section 30, namely (2), (4) and (5), also refer to "any

copyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this Part".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. In the present case copyright must first of all subsist by virtue

of section 27(1). If the author had made the work in pursuance of the terms of his

employment by the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs under a contract of service or apprenticeship,

then the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs would, by operation of section 30(6), be entitled to

such copyright. Therefore it is still necessary to establish that copyright subsists in

the work pursuant to section 27(1). One necessary element is citizenship or residency at

the time or a substantial part of the period of the making of the literary or artistic

work. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. Mr Sivakumar had invoked regulation 3(5). I find that this has no

relevance in question before me on the operation of section 30(6) and it is incumbent upon

me to explain the scope of this regulation. Regulation 3(5) provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Subject to these Regulations, the Act shall apply in relation to bodies

  incorporated under the law of a country that constitutes, or forms part of, the territory

  of a country specified in the Schedule in like manner as those provisions shall apply in

  relation to bodies incorporated under the law of Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">What this provision does is to treat corporations in the countries

specified in the Schedule as if they were incorporated in Singapore for the purposes of

the Act. Hence, in Part IV of the Act, a body incorporated in Australia would enjoy the

same treatment as one incorporated in Singapore in relation to copyright in sound

recordings, cinematograph films and the other matters provided for in that Part.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. However regulation 3(5) has no relevance to the present case.

Section 27 and 30 are in Part III of the Act which is concerned only with authors who are

natural persons. This is evident from section 27 where, for copyright to subsist, the

author has to be a "qualified person". That term is defined in section 27(4) to

mean a citizen of Singapore or a person resident in Singapore. The term "citizen of

Singapore" is not defined in the Act but is defined in the Interpretation Act as

"any person who, under the provisions of the Constitution, has the status of a

citizen of Singapore". Those provisions of the Constitution relate only to natural

persons. As for the term "person resident in Singapore", section 8 of the Act

provides that such term shall include a person who does so by virtue of a valid pass under

the Immigration Act. Furthermore, section 28 provides that the duration of copyright

subsisting by virtue of Part III of the Act shall continue to subsist until the expiration

of 50 years after the death of the author. For these reasons, the term "author"

in Part III refers only to a natural person. This may be contrasted with Part IV where the

term "qualified person" is defined in section 81 as (a) a citizen of or an

individual resident in Singapore or (b) a body corporate incorporated under any written

law in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36. In the result, I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that the

authors of the works were citizens or residents of Australia at the material time.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2.1.3 Whether employees of 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs</p>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37. Robinson had said in paragraph 7 of his affidavit that he,

Holzapfel and Lind were employees of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs for, respectively, more

than 35 years, 10 years and 4 years. He also exhibited business cards of the 3 of them

under the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs' name. Mr Lee disputed that this constituted evidence

that Holzapfel and Lind were employed at the material time but was not in a position to

give evidence to the contrary. However the defendants had in their Defence, not admitted

the plaintiffs' ownership to the copyright and had put them to strict proof thereof.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38. In my view, it is necessary for the plaintiffs to produce

documentary evidence of employment, such as the employment contract or letter of

appointment. A mere assertion by Robinson that Holzapfel and Lind were employees would not

suffice to satisfy the burden of proof in the present case. This is because section 30(6)

provides that for the employer to be entitled to copyright in works created by an

employee, that employee must have made the work in pursuance of the terms of his

employment under a contract of service or apprenticeship. There is a difference between a

contract <u>of service</u> and a contract <u>for service</u> and it would be necessary for

the plaintiffs to produce evidence of the nature of such employment. It is not for

Robinson to determine whether their employment contract was a contract <u>of service</u>

or <u>for service</u>. Further, as this fact is not admitted, the production of such

documents would enable the defendants to cross-examine the witnesses on this issue or to

point to anything in the documents that may be in their favour. Accordingly I find that

the plaintiffs have not satisfied the burden on them to prove this fact.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.2 Infringement</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39. On the assumption that the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs own the

copyright to the literary and artistic works in the documents in question, I now turn to

the question of infringement. The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants

infringed their copyright in their works by reproducing them in a material form in the

following 3 ways:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) by making unauthorised photocopies of ABD81-96;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) by making unauthorised sketch copies of PSBD8, PSBD11 and PSBD13;

  and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) by making the Defendants' machine without authorisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.2.1 Photocopies</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant denied making photocopies of ABD81-96.

The plaintiffs were unable to produce any witness who could say that he had seen the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant make the copies or in possession of such copies. All that Mr Sivakumar could do

was to point to the affidavit evidence-in-chief of one Victor Goh ("Goh"),

paragraph 7 of which goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant] confided in me by telling me that he had

  secretly returned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs' office after working hours to

  photocopy documents in order to design his machine and to secure customers. He said that

  he was collecting information progressively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Even if this is evidence of an admission, it fails to identify the

documents that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had admitted photocopying. In

cross-examination Goh said that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not tell him what

documents he had photocopied. He also said that when he was at the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants' factory, he did not see anything that could be construed as the property of

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41. To prove infringement by photocopying, the plaintiffs must prove

that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had made the photocopies of the documents over which

copyright is claimed. Clearly there is no evidence of this before me and I must find that

the plaintiffs have not proved that the defendants had photocopied ABD81-96.</p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.2.2 Sketch copies </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants had made sketches that are

unauthorised copies of:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) PSBD8 in the defendants' document ABD366-367</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) PSBD11 in the defendants' document ABD375; </p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">I shall examine each pair of drawings in turn.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2.2.2.1 PSBD8 and ABD366-367</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43. The plaintiffs' document, PSBD13, is a sketch of an element of the

Plaintiffs' machine, a triangular steel plate called the pivot plate. Its function is to

transfer the direction and magnitude of a force from a hydraulic jack onto the top wheel

which presses on the tube to form the convolution. The sketch itself is a line

representation of the side view of the pivot plate, showing essentially a triangle with

rounded and bulging corners and holes at each of the 3 corners for the pins. The distances

between the 3 holes are 250, 500 and 574mm. The sketch shows 2 of the 3 angles of the

triangle as 34.5<sup>o</sup> and 59.5<sup>o</sup> and from this the third angle may be

computed to be 86<sup>o</sup>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44. The defendants' ABD376 is a sketch of the corresponding pivot plate

in the Defendants' machine. It is also essentially a triangle with 3 holes at the corners.

Two of the holes are also 250mm apart. However the differences are as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) the 3 corners appear different, in particular there is no bulge in

  the defendants' drawing;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) only one angle of the defendants' triangle is given, making the

  other 2 indeterminate. However this angle, 46<sup>o</sup>, corresponds to the corner in

  the plaintiffs' sketch which is marked as 59.5<sup>o</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Visually, because of these 2 differences, the triangles look different.

I find that there is no substantial reproduction in ABD366-367 of the drawing in PBD8.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2.2.2.2 PSBD11 and ABD375 </p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45. The plaintiffs' drawing, PSBD11, is a side view cross-section of

another element of the Plaintiffs' machine, a device used to hold the bellows rings. It

also contains a cross-section of the bellows rings. The defendants' ABD375 is a drawing of

the corresponding device in the Defendants' machine. However it is a top view of the

device. In terms of appearance, the 2 drawings are dissimilar, mainly because one is a

side view cross-section and the other is a view from the top. I find that there is no

substantial reproduction in ABD375 of PSBD11.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2.2.2.3 PSBD11 and ABD376</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46. The defendants' document, ABD376, is a rough sketch of the same

bellows rings holding device in the Defendants' machine. This time it is a side view

cross-section as in the plaintiffs' PSBD11. The similarities are as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) both feature a 90mm square bar, the plaintiffs' is 354mm long and

  the defendants' is 360mm;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) both feature a 50mm diameter shaft at the end of the 90mm square

  bar, of length 270mm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47. The dissimilarities are as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) The defendants' drawing features two triangles that are hatched

  adjoining the entire length of the 90mm square bar. There is no such feature in the

  plaintiffs' drawing;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) The defendants' drawing comprises entirely of the 90mm square bar,

  the 50mm shaft, the 2 hatched triangles and a 25mm-thick plate at one end. The plaintiffs'

  drawing has the 90mm square bar and the 50mm shaft, no triangles and the plate at the end

  is 20mm thick. But it also has details of other parts of the device, including the

  important part which shows how the bellows rings sit on it. This comprises a pair of 40mm

  shafts with bearings for the rings to roll over. And the cross-section of the bellows

  rings are drawn on the plaintiffs' drawing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48. In view of the simplicity of the defendants' drawing, the amount of

details in the plaintiffs' drawing which is left out in the defendants' drawing, and the

fact that the 2 triangles in the defendants' drawing are striking features which do not

appear in the plaintiffs' drawing, I find that there is no substantial reproduction in

ABD376 of PSBD11.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.2.2.4 PSBD13 and ABD381</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49. The plaintiffs' drawing, PSBD13 is a drawing of an element of the

Plaintiffs' machine, the bottom wheel assembly. It shows how the pair of bottom wheels is

mounted on a shaft which in turn is mounted on a series of steel plates welded in a

box-shaped assembly. This assembly is bolted to the shaft of a hydraulic cylinder. The

defendants' drawing, ABD381, comprises 2 parts and the similarity only concerns the

drawing on the left. That is a drawing of the corresponding element of the Defendants'

machine. It also shows the pair of bottom wheels mounted on a shaft which is in turn

mounted on a box-like plate assembly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50. The following are the points of similarity:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) the general layout are similar, although some dimensions differ;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) both pairs of wheels are 25mm thick;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) both wheel shafts have substantially the same thickness

  (plaintiffs' is 66mm and defendants' is 65mm);</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) plates used in both box-assemblies are 40mm thick;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) the internal widths of both box assemblies are substantially the

  same (plaintiffs' is 156mm and defendants' is 158mm);</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) the distance between the shaft and the base of the box-assembly is

  230mm in both drawings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51. The following are the points of difference:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) the diameter of the plaintiffs' wheels is 250mm whereas the

  defendants' is 300mm;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the gap between the wheels is 37mm in the plaintiffs' drawing and

  30mm in the defendants';</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the lengths of the wheel shafts are different, 360mm in the

  plaintiffs' and about 250mm in the defendants';</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the defendants' drawing features slide bearings which are not

  found in the plaintiffs', and various other details of bushes are different;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) the defendants' drawing features two bolts connecting the 2 wheels

  which is not featured in the plaintiffs' drawing;</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) The plaintiffs' drawing shows a bolt and nut connecting the

  assembly to the hydraulic cylinder. No such features are in the defendants' drawing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52. Whether one drawing amounts to a substantial reproduction of

another does not depend solely on a comparison of the number of similarities and

differences. It is the quality of what is copied that matters. In <i>Ladbrooke (Football)

Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd</i> [1964] WLR 273, Lord Reid said at p. 276:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Copyright gives the exclusive right to do certain things including

  "reproducing the work in any material form" … and reproduction includes

  reproduction of a substantial part of the work … Broadly, a reproduction means

  copying, and does not include cases where an author or compiler produces a substantially

  similar result by independent work without copying. And, if he does copy, the question

  whether he has copied a substantial part depends much more on the quality than on the

  quantity of what he had taken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">From a cursory glance of the 2 drawings one could easily conclude that

they refer to the same contraption and it is only in a detailed study that the differences

are observed. This is because the striking feature of the drawings are the twin wheels,

the wheel-shaft and the box-like assembly. On balance, I would find that the drawing in

ABD381 is of a degree of similarity to PBSD13 as would make it a substantial reproduction

thereof if ABD381 had been copied from PBSD13.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53. The remaining question is whether it was copied from PSBD13. There

is no allegation that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had access to PSBD13. Indeed there is

no evidence as to where PSBD13 was kept within the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs' premises, if

at all it was kept there. The only mention of this document is in paragraph 25 of

Robinson's supplementary affidavit where he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[ABD381] is a copy of the Defendants' drawing and I identify it as a

  Bottom Wheel Assembly. The Plaintiffs' drawing of the same can be found at [PSBD13]. The

  function of the Bottom Wheel is to form convolutions on the bellow tube. I note that the

  height measuring from …</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As was the case with regard to the issue of authorship, there was no

evidence on the role that PSBD13 played in the making of the ABD381. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant denied having seen PSBD13 before. Even if the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had to

copy the drawing in ABD381 from somewhere, as I shall find below, he could have done so

from looking at the Plaintiffs' machine or from some other document. As there is no causal

link between the 2 documents, I cannot find ABD381 to be a reproduction of PSBD13.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.2.3 Defendants' machine</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54. The plaintiffs claim that the Defendants' machine is a reproduction

in 3-dimensions of their artistic works in the following documents: ABD89, 95 and 96, and

PSBD8, 11 and 13. Before embarking on a consideration of those documents in relation to

the Defendants' machine, it is necessary to set out the facts relating to its

construction.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.2.3.1 Construction of Defendants' machine </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant claimed that he designed and built the

Defendants' machine with the help of one Ong Beng Sim ("Ong"), the foreman of

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. Ong gave evidence that he had worked for more than 30 years

in the mechanical engineering industry. He was a machinist for more than 10 years and had

extensive experience as a machine fitter and in pipe fabrication and welding work. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant said in cross-examination that the machine at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs'

premises was located at a place where all persons working there, whether on the shop floor

or at the office upstairs (where he was) had to pass it in order to go to the toilet. To

that extent he had access to the machine. But he said that he was not shown, nor had he

seen, any of the drawings of the Plaintiffs' machine. He said that as a sales engineer he

was not involved in the manufacture of the bellows. He gave evidence of his background: he

obtained a technician's certificate from the Industrial Training Board in 1979. In 1983 he

attended courses in Tool and Die Making at the Vocational and Industrial Training Board.

He had worked as a machinist in various companies. Thereafter he worked at various marine

companies before enrolling at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 1992 for a course in Electrical

Plant Maintenance. He said that as a result of his training and work experience, he was

qualified to design and build machine tools.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56. Robinson gave evidence that he held a Certificate of Mechanical

Engineering III from Sydney Technical College. He had experience in the field of flexible

technology and in the manufacture of flexible metal expansion joints. He said that

Holzapfel held a civil engineering degree and was employed by the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiffs as a Technical Applications Engineer for 10 years. Lind had a degree in

Mechanical Engineering and was the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs' design engineer for 4 years.

The 3 of them had designed and built the Plaintiffs' machine, expending approximately

1,500 hours and relying on their skill, experience and extensive research on bellows form

and design criteria.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57. Having heard the oral evidence and having seen both the Plaintiffs'

machine and the Defendants' machine, I find that neither the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant nor

Ong possessed the technical expertise to design and build a machine of this nature. I am

satisfied that the Plaintiffs' machine merits the 1,500 hours that Robinson claimed were

spent by the 3 of them in designing and building it. Robinson said that as an engineer who

had been intimately involved in this area, it was apparent from the defendants' drawings

and photographs of their machine that they had taken all the essential elements of the

Plaintiffs' machine. I accept his evidence because from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants'

answers in cross-examination, it was clear that he had sized the structural elements of

the Defendants' machine based, not on his own calculations, but on the corresponding

elements in the Plaintiffs' machine. I am satisfied that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was

not capable of building his machine without considerable information coming from the

plaintiffs, whether by way of documents or measurements of the Plaintiffs' machine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58. Obviously the plaintiffs cannot claim infringement of copyright

over documents not proved before me. The plaintiffs' claim is based purely on the

documents ABD89, 95 and 96, and PSBD8, 11 and 13. Mr Sivakumar submits that the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant had access to these documents. I had dealt earlier with the documents PSBD8, 11

and 13 and have found that there was no evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had

access to them nor even as to where they were kept. The plaintiffs' evidence only shows

that he had access to ABD81-96. I accept the evidence in this regard and accordingly find

that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had access to ABD89, 95 and 96, but not to PSBD8, 11 and

13.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2.2.3.2 Was Plaintiffs' machine based on ABD89, 95 and 96?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59. I now turn to consider the nature of the 3 documents, ABD89, 95 and

96. ABD89 is a "general arrangement" drawing of the Plaintiffs' machine. It is

not to scale and does not contain any dimensions. It essentially shows the locations of

the various elements of the machine. Robinson said that ABD89 was part of the operating

instructions for a re-rolling process and not a drawing based on which the Plaintiffs'

machine was built. His evidence in cross-examination was as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q No, I'm referring to the two drawings, the two sketches, [ABD] 89 and

  90.</p>
<p align="justify">A 89 and 90 is part of the machine of the Radcoflex RF-2 machine.</p>
<p align="justify">Q Are these blue print drawings?</p>
<p align="justify">A No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q They don't have dimensions in them?</p>
<p align="justify">A Obviously, no.</p>
<p align="justify">Q The person who drew these two sketches, the name is not there?</p>
<p align="justify">A No. It's a general arrangement drawing.</p>
<p align="justify">Q So you cannot build a machine based on these two sketches?</p>
<p align="justify">A No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q Therefore, the RF-2 machine could not have been built based on these

  two sketches, it follows.</p>
<p align="justify">A The machine was not built with those two drawings. If you refer to a

  part of the drawings---</p>
<p align="justify">Q Thank you.</p>
<p align="justify">A ----you will see that the machine was built from engineering

  drawings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Accordingly I find that the Plaintiffs' machine was not built based on

ABD89. I should state that ABD90 contains a drawing similar in all respects save in one

detail. The plaintiffs do not appear to base their case on this document, but in any event

all the considerations for ABD89 apply in relation to ABD90.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60. As for ABD95, it is a drawing entitled "Top Wheel" and

shows the cross-section of a wheel 420mm in diameter and 25mm thick. It has a 60mm

diameter hole in the centre and 8 smaller holes at a radius of 130mm from the centre.

Robinson could not say for sure that the corresponding element on the Plaintiffs' machine,

i.e. the top wheel, had the same dimensions. However he believed that it did. Robinson

also was not able to assert that the top wheel of the Plaintiffs' machine was based on

ABD95. Therefore I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that the top wheel on the

Plaintiffs' machine was built based on that document.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61. ABD96 is a drawing entitled "Wheel Assembly" and shows

the cross-section of the top wheel mounted on a shaft and the 2 bottom wheels mounted on

another shaft. The components of this assembly are set out in a table in the document but

the dimensions of the top and bottom wheels are not given. Robinson explained that this

was an assembly drawing, i.e. one which showed how each part fitted in the assembly. The

detailed dimensions of each part would be specified in other drawings. He said that he

presumed that this drawing related to the Plaintiffs' machine but could not be sure

because there was no indication as such on the document. He also agreed with Mr Lee that

it was not possible to construct a wheel assembly based on ABD96. As Robinson could not

state with certainty that the wheel assembly on the Plaintiffs' machine is based on ABD96,

I also cannot find that the plaintiffs have proved this.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2.2.3.3 The law on indirect copying</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62. By virtue of section 15(3) of the Act, an artistic work in

2-dimensions is deemed to be reproduced if a version of it is produced in a 3-dimensional

form (subject to section 69, which is considered later in this judgment). There is no

evidence that the plaintiffs' drawings were used to build the Defendants' machine. But I

have found that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had used information either from the

plaintiffs' drawings of their machine or directly obtained from the Plaintiffs' machine.

The latter situation is described as indirect copying of the drawing and I turn to examine

the law in this respect.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63. Where a 3-dimensional object, "A", is copied from another

3-dimensional object which is a copy of a drawing, "A" is a reproduction of that

drawing for the purposes of copyright infringement. In <i>King Features Syndicate Inc v O.

and M. Kleeman Ltd</i> [1941] AC 417 the plaintiffs sued for infringement of copyright in

respect of the comic strip figure "Popeye, the Sailor". The plaintiffs had

licensed third parties to reproduce toys and figurines based on the "Popeye"

character. The defendants had in fact negotiated with the plaintiffs for such a licence

but the parties could not agree to the terms. Without authorisation of the plaintiffs, the

defendants bought toys and brooches resembling the character for sale and the plaintiffs

commenced the action. Because the number of drawings of "Popeye" was large, the

plaintiffs restricted themselves to proving ownership of copyright in respect of only 55

drawings. The licensees' figures were made based on one or other of the drawings. The

defendants' brooches were copied not from the drawings but from the licensees' figures.

The defendants submitted that as their brooches were copied from the licensees' figures

and not from the plaintiffs drawings, they were not reproductions of the drawings. The

ratio of the decision of the House of Lords is accurately summarised in the following

passage from the headnote:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><p align="justify">Held</p></i>, that the defendants' dolls and brooches were reproductions

  in a material form of the plaintiffs' original artistic work and were not the less so

  because they were copied, not directly from any sketch of the plaintiffs, but from a

  reproduction in material form derived directly or indirectly from the original work …

  

</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">64.    The "Popeye" case involved drawings that had eye appeal

and were of a non-functional nature. The same principle applies in respect of drawings

that are purely functional in nature. <i>L.B. (Plastics) Ltd v Swish Products Ltd</i>
<nobr>[1979] RPC 551</nobr> concerns plastic components of knock-down drawers. The plaintiffs produced

such components and were the owners of the copyright in the drawings of such components.

The trial court found that the defendants produced their components by using a sample of

the plaintiffs' components as a model. The House of Lords affirmed the court's finding

that such indirect copying amounted to production of a version of the drawings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65. The House of Lords re-affirmed the principle of indirect copying in

<i>British Leyland Motor Corp Ltd v Armstrong Patents Co Ltd</i> [1986] 2 WLR 400. In that

case, the defendants made exhaust pipes by copying the shape and dimensions of pipes made

by the plaintiffs, a process known as "reverse engineering". The plaintiffs

brought an action for infringement of copyright in their drawings of the exhaust pipes.

The House of Lords unanimously held that on the basis of the line of authorities leading

up to the <i>Swish</i> case, indirect copying of a drawing relating purely to a functional

design constitutes infringement of copyright in the drawing. Lord Templeman said (at

p.427):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision of this House in L.B. (Plastics) Ltd. v. Swish Products

  Ltd. [1979] R.P.C. 551 shows clearly that as the law now stands the first argument put

  forward by Armstrong namely that copyright does not apply to prevent the indirect copying

  of drawings of functional articles cannot be sustained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66. In all the 3 cases discussed above, the 3-dimensional objects which

were copied by the defendants were themselves copies of drawings over which copyright was

established. In the present case, the plaintiffs have not proved that the drawings over

which copyright is claimed were the ones used to construct the Plaintiffs' machine. Indeed

Robinson had said that their machine could not have been constructed from ABD89. Although

there are similarities between the Defendants' machine and the drawings in ABD89, 95 and

96, the question is whether, if the Defendants' machine had been directly copied from the

Plaintiffs' machine, it would amount to indirect copying of those drawings as they were

not used to construct the Plaintiffs' machine. For my part, the answer is clear. If a

3-dimensional object was not made based on a drawing, a second 3-dimensional object which

was copied directly from the first cannot be an indirect copy of the drawing

notwithstanding any similarity between that second object and the drawing. It would be a

travesty of logic if it were otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67. Quite apart from logic, to hold otherwise would result in an

unjustified extension of the principle of indirect copying. The law of copyright is

intended to protect the skill and labour of the maker of the artistic work and not that of

the person who undertook the engineering design constituting the technical basis for the

artistic work. In the <i>British Leyland</i> case, Lord Templeman said (at p.419):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">BL's engineering drawings are artistic works but they are only original

  in so far as they represent the skill and labour of the draughtsman. The shape,

  configuration, dimensions and exact measurements of the exhaust pipe were contributed by

  the skill and labour of the design engineer not by the draughtsman. By directly copying

  the exhaust pipe Armstrong make use of the work of the design engineer but do not make use

  of the work of the author of the drawing. BL's exhaust pipe could have been made without

  BL's drawing. Armstrong's exhaust pipe was made without BL's drawing. BL's object in these

  proceedings is not to prevent reproduction of the drawing which is protected by copyright

  but to prevent reproduction of the exhaust pipe which is not entitled to any protection

  whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68. Indeed the House of Lords wrestled with the notion that copyright

could subsist in a purely functional design but concluded that such was the state of the

law. As Lord Griffiths said (at p.434):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It might at one stage in the history of artistic copyright have been

  possible to argue that Parliament only intended copyright to extend to paintings or

  drawings which could fairly be described as works of fine art; indeed, when Parliament

  first gave the protection of copyright to artists by the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862 (25

  &amp; 26 Vict. c. 68) I believe that it was probably so limited. But, whatever may have

  been the position in the past, Parliament when it enacted the Copyright Act 1956 followed

  the advice of the Gregory Report (Report of the Copyright Committee (1952) (Cmd. 8662))

  and conferred copyright on any drawing irrespective of artistic quality and included in

  the definition of drawing any diagram, map, chart or plan. Thus, Parliament made clear, to

  my mind beyond argument, that the draughtsman is entitled to the copyright in every

  original mechanical drawing that he produces and if he does so in the course of his

  employment the copyright is that of his employer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69. Lord Griffiths had taken a different tack from the other 4 members

of the House in this decision and said that the decision in the <i>Swish</i> case

upholding the principle of indirect copying should be reversed. Although the other judges

did not resort to this drastic step, they nevertheless expressed their dissatisfaction

with the direction that the law had taken in respect of artistic works which were simply

functional designs. This is because the protection given in respect of artistic works is

to the skill of the author whereas the protection sought in the case of functional design

drawings is over the work of the designer and not that of the draughtsman who put that

output on paper. The remedies for this in copyright law are quite inappropriate. As Lord

Bridge of Harwich said (at p.413):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">But I must add that I regard the present law as highly unsatisfactory

  in at least two respects. First, copyright protection for functional designs, as extended

  to articles of functional utility manufactured in accordance with those designs, would

  certainly seem to be capable of abuse as a means of obtaining many of the advantages

  conferred by patent monopoly while circumventing the many stringent conditions and

  safeguards to which patent protection is subject. Secondly, whatever protection the

  industrial designer may need to safeguard the product of his skills against piracy, I find

  it difficult to suppose that a rational legislator, devising a comprehensive code ab

  initio for the protection of intellectual property, would deliberately include a provision

  for the recovery of conversion damages in respect of industrial products which infringe

  the protection accorded to industrial designs. In the field of fine arts substantially the

  entire value of a copy accrues from the work of the original artist. This is surely the

  rationale of the provision for conversion damages for infringements of copyright. In the

  field of industrial design the designer contributes only a modest fraction of the value of

  the product. Thus, to award conversion damages for infringing industrial copies of a

  protected industrial design is irrationally generous to the designer and punitive of the

  infringer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70. Lord Templeman, with whom Lord Scarman agreed, expressed the same

sentiments (at p.420):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>An article embodying an invention which is not patented does not enjoy the 20 years

  restriction on use of the invention afforded by patent law. An article embodying a design

  which is not registrable does not attract the 15 years restriction on reproduction

  afforded by design copyright. An article which is not an artistic work does not attract

  the life plus 50 years restriction on reproduction afforded by copyright law to artistic

  works. But if BL are right, an article which is not patented, not registered and is not an

  artistic work acquires the life plus 50 years restriction on reproduction afforded by

  copyright to an artistic work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71. I therefore hold that where a 3-dimensional object is copied from

another 3-dimensional object, the scope of the principle of indirect copying does not

extend to drawings which were not the basis of the construction of the object copied from.

In the present case, even if it can be said that the Defendants' machine is substantially

similar to the drawings in question, it cannot amount to a reproduction of those drawings

merely because it is copied directly from the Plaintiffs' machine.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.4 Section 69 defence</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73. Mr Lee submitted that even if the court found that the Defendants'

machine is a reproduction of the drawings over which copyright subsists and the plaintiffs

prove that they own such copyright, the defendants have not infringed the copyright by

operation of section 69 of the Act. In view of the findings that I have made, this defence

is a minor point and I do not propose to examine it in detail. A discussion of the origin

of the English equivalent of this provision, viz. section 9(8) of the English Copyright

Act 1956, appears in the speech of Lord Templeman in the <i>British Leyland</i> case (at

pp.424-428).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74. Section 69 provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">69. For the purposes of this Act -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the making of an object of any kind that is in 3 dimensions does

    not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 2 dimensions; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the making of an object of any kind that is in 2 dimensions does

    not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 3 dimensions,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">if the object would not appear to persons who are not experts in

  relation to objects of that kind to be a reproduction of the artistic work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75. This provision has prompted comment in the <i>Swish</i> and <i>British

Leyland</i> cases in relation to the manner in which evidence is to be brought. It appears

to have been accepted that the trial judge would make the assessment, putting himself in

the shoes of "persons who are not experts in relation to objects of that kind"

and deciding whether the object appears to such persons to be a reproduction of the

artistic work. Lord Wilberforce said in the <i>Swish</i> case (at p.622):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[Section 9(8)] introduces, in the context of reproduction in another

  dimension, a test which may be described as a test of lay recognition - one well known and

  applied in many different contexts in American law - for example in relation to dolls or

  toys made after comic strip characters, or in relation to musical reproductions. It

  inevitably gives rise to difficulties as to the nature of the evidence which may be

  received, and as to the degree of non-expertise to be attributed to the judge. The

  subsection applies by way, and only by way of defence, i.e. after the issue of copying has

  been decided, and on the assumption that it has been decided in favour of the plaintiff.

  It is for the defendant to make it good. In relation to the subject-matter, it was, as

  both sides seem to have accepted, for the judge, placing himself in his position of a

  non-expert in relation to extruded or moulded components (see the wording of the

  subsection), to decide whether the respondents' components appeared, or rather did not

  appear, to be reproductions of the appellants' drawings. For this purpose he must be

  entitled to compare the objects with the drawing, and, in my opinion, to take account of

  any written matter on the drawing. … In performing this task the judge must also be

  credited with some ability to interpret design drawings: the subsection does not say the

  contrary, and without it the comparison could not be made. But the comparison to be made

  is, as I understand it, a visual comparison. The (non-expert) judge should not repeat the

  process which, as judge with the assistance of expert and other witnesses, he has gone

  through in deciding whether there has been copying or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76. In the present case, I have viewed the Defendants' machine.

Comparing it with the ABD89, which is a schematic drawing of the machine, I find that

there are similarities in the major features, viz. the motor, the wheel assembly, the long

beam running from the base of the motor to the bottom wheel assembly, the shaft connecting

the motor to the top wheel, the top wheel housing, the pneumatic jacks, and the

"pendulum bar" which connects one of the jacks to the top wheel. There is also

substantial similarity in the co-location of these features. I would hold that the

similarities are so substantial that a non-expert of such objects would conclude that the

Defendants' machine is a reproduction of ABD89. Therefore, if this defence applies - and I

have found that it does not - it would fail.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77. ABD95 is an outline drawing of a wheel which the plaintiffs say is

reproduced in the top wheel on the Defendants' machine. Although the drawing shows the

dimensions of the wheel and its various features, there is no evidence that the top wheel

on the Defendants' machine has similar dimensions or similar relative dimensions. I am of

the view that in relation to a drawing of a common shape such as a wheel, in order to

satisfy the test of similarity, it is not sufficient to prove that the infringing object

is of a similar shape. Otherwise there would be a great number of copyright infringements.

In such cases it would be necessary to show that some other unique features, such as

dimensions, have been followed. Accordingly, in the present case, I find that the top

wheel in the Defendants' machine would not appear to a non-expert to be a reproduction of

ABD95.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78. ABD96 shows the top and bottom wheel assembly. The top wheel bears

no resemblance to the corresponding feature in the Defendants' machine. As for the bottom

wheel assembly, that shown in the drawing has a long shaft going through it whereas that

in the Defendants' machine has a much shorter shaft which extends only just outside the

wheels. In addition the thickness to diameter ratio of the wheels appear different, the

wheels in the drawing appear to be thicker in relation to the diameter. I find that the

bottom wheel of the Defendants' machine would not appear to a non-expert to be a

reproduction of ABD96. </p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. Claim under Employment Contract</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">79. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs' offer of employment to the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant is dated 31 March 1998. He signed it on 1 April 1998 to signify his acceptance.

Clause 9.0 of this letter, which constitutes a term of the employment, states as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<u><p align="justify">NON-DISCLOSURE OF TRADE SECRETS</p>
</u><p align="justify">You shall not, during your employment or afterwards, except as

  authorised by the Company or required by your duties, reveal to any person any trade

  secrets or confidential information concerning the business or affairs of the Company or

  any of its related companies or customers which may come to your acknowledge [sic] by

  reason of your employment and shall keep with complete secrecy all confidential

  information entrusted to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr Lee attempted to challenge the validity of this clause on the ground

that there is no time or geographic limitation but conceded that he had no authority that

such limitations are necessary in a clause such as this in order for it to be enforceable.

Furthermore the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs contend that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant owed

them a duty of good faith and fidelity. This duty was breached when the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant divulged trade secrets and confidential information to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">80. The plaintiffs contend that the trade secrets and confidential

information that have been divulged by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants were as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs' literary and artistic works the

  subject matter of their claim in copyright;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the names and addresses of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs'

  customers;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the usual requirements of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs'

  customers both as to quantity and quality;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(iv) the prices charged to individual customers of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Plaintiffs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.1 Literary and artistic works</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">81. I accept the plaintiffs' evidence that the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs kept copies of the drawings of the Radcoflex RF-2 drawings in Singapore in an

unlocked metal container which was clearly marked as containing confidential information

and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant by virtue of the nature of his job had access to the

drawings and other confidential information of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs. However the

plaintiffs have only exhibited ABD81-96 and PSBD8, 11 and 13. There is no evidence of any

other documents and I need only to consider these. Furthermore, the evidence does not show

that PSBD8, 11 and 13 were stored in the metal container nor that they were confidential.

Therefore the plaintiffs' evidence in this respect is restricted only to ABD81-96.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">82. There is the question of the nature of the information. Mr Lee

conceded that ABD81-83 was necessary to be disclosed to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in

his capacity as a sales engineer. These documents relate to the sizes of the bellows and

the convolutions. However he submitted that it was not necessary to disclose to the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant ABD84-96, which relate to the operation of the Plaintiffs' machine, as he was

not involved in production. If the plaintiffs chose to disclose these documents to the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant when there was no necessity to do so, they cannot be confidential information or

trade secrets. In support of this contention he cited <i>Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler</i>

[1986] 1 All ER 617. In that case the English Court of Appeal held that in the absence of

an express term, there was an implied term of non-disclosure of information which is of a

sufficiently high degree of confidentiality as to amount to a trade secret. In considering

whether any information fell within the scope of protection of this implied term, the

court would consider the nature of the employment, the nature of the information and the

manner in which the employer treated the information. Mr Lee submitted that the

information in ABD84-96 could not be confidential information as the plaintiffs had given

the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant access to it although it was not necessary for his work.

However in this case there is an express term, clause 9.0, which prohibits disclosure of

confidential information. The documents concerned were stored in a location clearly marked

as containing confidential information. In the circumstances I would hold that such

information would fall within the scope of clause 9.0.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">83. However there is no direct evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant had actually used or made copies of ABD81-96. As explained earlier, although he

must have obtained information from the plaintiffs in order to build the Defendants'

machine, there is no evidence of the exact source of such information. More importantly,

one possible and likely source would be the Plaintiffs' machine. Therefore I cannot infer

that ABD81-96 was used. Accordingly, I am unable to find that the plaintiffs have proved

their claim under this head.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">3.2 Names and addresses of customers</p>
</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">84. The plaintiffs did not exhibit any document containing the names

and addresses of customers that they claim the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had divulged to

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. Robinson said in cross-examination that there was a name

list but failed to produce it when asked to do so. He said that there was a set of

customers' business cards but he was not sure if he had given this to the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant. No other witness gave evidence that this was given to him. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant denied receiving such information from Robinson or anyone else. Mr Sivakumar

conceded that the plaintiffs have not proved this fact. Therefore this aspect of the claim

must fail.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.3 Customers' usual requirements</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">85. The same situation obtains here. Robinson said that there was a

list of usual requirements of the plaintiffs' customers. But he was not the one who gave

this list to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. He said that his product manager, Ng, would

know about this. However Ng did not say anything about this. I should add that the list

was not produced. Mr Sivakumar makes the same concession that there is no evidence in

respect of this breach. Accordingly this claim also fails.</p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.4 Prices</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">86. The evidence on this is equally scarce. Again nobody gave any

evidence of the existence of a list of prices and that these were given to the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant. However I accept that, from the nature of his employment as a sales engineer, I

can infer that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant knew the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs' prices for

their bellows. I also accept that the information on prices is confidential information.

However there is no evidence of disclosure by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants. Of course the information is inside the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants' head and he

is capable of memorising it. As he is the person behind the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants it

would be a simple matter for him to use it. However at the very least, there should be

evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had made use of his knowledge of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs' prices, whether by way of undercutting his former employer or in any other

manner. The plaintiffs had access to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants' documents through the

pre-trial discovery process and yet no evidence is adduced on how the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants priced their products. Indeed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had given evidence

that he priced his products according to what the market could bear, it being a quite

imperfect market. I therefore cannot find that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had disclosed

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs' confidential information relating to prices to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants.</p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. Conclusion</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">87. I have no doubt that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had made use of

information from the plaintiffs in constructing the Defendants' machine. In all

likelihood, he had used either the engineering drawings based on which the Plaintiffs'

machine was built - and which were not exhibited by the plaintiffs - or he had somehow

taken the dimensions off the Plaintiffs' machine. The difficulty faced by the plaintiffs

is to prove exactly what he had used. However the plaintiffs' problem is not

insurmountable. They could simply have exhibited the engineering drawings of their machine

and proved that copyright subsists and that they are the owners. If the drawings do relate

to their machine, and are not of a nature as would afford the defendants a defence under

section 69 of the Act, then I would have no difficulty in holding for the plaintiffs on

the question of infringement by indirect copying. It baffles me that they have chosen not

to exhibit and prove copyright in the engineering drawings and instead used ABD81-96. Be

that as it may, I have to decide the case on the evidence before me and the plaintiffs

have to live with the consequences of their decision. As for their case in breach of the

employment contract, the lack of evidence was equally stark. But I suspect that their

primary complaint is in relation to the copyright infringement and this part of their

claim was only included for good measure.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">88. I accordingly dismiss the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants

in their entirety. I will hear counsel on the question of costs.</p>
