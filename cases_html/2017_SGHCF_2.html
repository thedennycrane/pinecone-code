District Court Appeal No 63 of 2016 (“DCA 63/2016”) is an appeal brought by the Husband, and District Court Appeal No 65 of 2016 (“DCA 65/2016”) is an appeal brought by the Wife. The Husband is presently 45 years old and works as a Sales Relationship Manager at a multinational company. The Wife is presently 43 years old and is a Manager at a bank. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span>The parties married on 18 June 1998 in the United Kingdom. On 23 November 2011, the Husband filed for divorce on the basis of the Wife’s adultery. The divorce was initially contested but the parties eventually agreed for the divorce to proceed on the basis of the Husband’s claim, amended to the fact of unreasonable behaviour instead of adultery. Interim Judgment was granted on 4 December 2012.  The marriage lasted 13 years. There is one child to the marriage (“the Child”). The Child was born on 27 June 2001 and is now 15 years old. The parties jointly own three properties but the Wife presently lives with the Child in a rented apartment. The three properties are:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a HDB flat at xxx, which was the matrimonial home (“the matrimonial home”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) a four-bedroom condominium unit at xxx (“the xxx property”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) a property in the United Kingdom (“the UK Property”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">3 </span>The ancillary matters were heard before the learned District Judge (“the DJ”) in 2015. The DJ gave her decision on the ancillary matters on 15 February 2016. The DJ’s Grounds of Decision can be found at <span class="font-italic">TPY </span><span class="font-italic">v TPZ </span>[2016] SGFC 79 (“the GD”). After the DJ rendered her decision, the Husband applied to present further arguments. After hearing the further arguments, the DJ adjusted her orders on 26 April 2016. The adjusted orders are included within the GD. Dissatisfied with the DJ’s decision, the Husband filed DCA 63/2016 appealing the DJ’s orders in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. The two issues raised by the Husband on appeal are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the DJ erred in law and in fact in attributing a ratio of 70:30 for indirect contributions (in favour of the Wife) (“the indirect contribution issue”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the DJ erred in failing to consider the Husband’s submissions that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Wife (“the adverse inference issue”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span>The Wife then filed DCA 65/2016 also appealing the DJ’s orders in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. The issues raised by the Wife are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the DJ erred in not attributing to the Wife a higher share ratio in respect of her indirect contributions; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the DJ erred in not attributing to the Wife a higher share ratio in the division of the parties’ pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>As pointed out by Ms Adriene Cheong (“Ms Cheong”), the Husband’s counsel, the issues raised by the Wife in DCA 65/2016 are linked to the indirect contribution issue raised by the Husband in DCA 63/2016. I therefore deal with the Wife’s case in DCA 65/2016 together with the Husband’s indirect contribution issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>After the trial below, the DJ ordered the division of matrimonial assets in the ratio of 34.5:65.5 in favour of the Wife. This ratio was based on the DJ’s finding that the Husband made direct contributions of 41% while the Wife contributed 59% towards the value of the pool of matrimonial assets. As for the parties’ indirect contributions, the DJ found that the Husband contributed 30% while the Wife contributed 70%. The DJ’s conclusions are summarised in the table below:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-right"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct contributions (50% weightage)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">41%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">59%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect contributions (50% weightage)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">30%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">70%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Average percentage contributions</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">35.5%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">64.5%</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>In arriving at her decision on the indirect contributions of the parties, the DJ found the parties’ indirect <span class="font-italic">financial</span> contributions to be equal. This is stated at [44] of the GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44. Both parties contributed towards paying for the family’s and [the Child]’s expenses before the breakdown of the marriage. The bank statements exhibited by the Wife were inconclusive as to whether parties contributed equally into the joint accounts or not, or whether this was the practice throughout the years of marriage. The Wife said she bore more of [the Child]’s expenses after she and [the Child] moved out of the Matrimonial Home in 2012. It is undisputed that the Husband earned more than the Wife in the first ten years of the marriage and that the situation was reversed for the following five years. My analysis below on the contributions towards the assets show that the Husband paid more for the properties purchased in those earlier years as well and that in subsequent years, the Wife’s payments towards the properties overtook the Husband’s. The Wife has also accumulated substantially more assets in her own name than the Husband.   I would conclude <span class="font-italic">on the totality of the evidence that parties’ contributions towards the expenses would have evened out over the years, and would attribute such contributions equally to both parties</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span>In arriving at her decision on the parties’ indirect<span class="font-italic"> non-financial</span> contributions, the DJ took the following issues into consideration at [71] – [72] of the GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71. I accept that the Wife had made the following indirect non-financial contributions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. She had nurtured and taken care of [the Child], and invested time and effort to promote his development and well-being, particularly when he was very young. Her efforts are especially recognised as it is undisputed that the Husband is out of Singapore for half of the week. She also continued this role after she and [the Child] moved out.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. I accept that as a working mother, she had to have domestic help to assist in [the Child]’s care while she is working. However, I do not think this substantially reduces her role as [the Child]’s mother. In Tay Yong Kwang J’s words, “Having a maid in the household, or a number of maids for that matter, does not mean abdication of parental responsibility” <span class="font-italic">Lee Chung Meng Joseph v. Krysgman Juliet Angela </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 965 at [41]. She would thus also have had to train and supervise the maid for the childcare arrangements and household chores. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. She had made sacrifices in her career in the first years of the marriage, in order to take better care of [the Child]. This is obvious from the way her salary stagnated in those years, then quickly rose when [the Child] was older and the Wife could [better balance work and her other responsibilities] (<span class="font-italic">Note: bracketed words added on 26 April 2016</span>). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">d. She had used her employee rates at xxx Bank for the mortgage of various properties owned by the parties throughout the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">e. She was involved in the renovations for some of the properties, and had also played a part in deciding on investing in the Malaysian property. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72. I accept that the Husband had made the following indirect non-financial contributions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. He had spent time and engaged in activities with the child during the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. It was largely his idea to take the risk of investing in real estate. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. He had arranged for and managed various of the properties, particularly the UK property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The indirect contributions issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>On appeal, the Husband claims that the DJ erred in attributing a ratio of 70:30 for indirect contributions in favour of the Wife. The Husband claims that a fair ratio to accurately reflect the circumstances of the marriage is 55:45 in favour of the Wife. The Husband is not seeking to disturb the DJ’s finding that the parties made equal indirect financial contributions and his appeal <span class="font-italic">only</span> relates to the indirect non-financial contributions of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span>First, Ms Cheong argues that the DJ erred in finding that the fact that the parties had a domestic helper was immaterial because the Wife would have had to train and supervise the domestic helper in performing household chores. Ms Cheong submits that both Husband and Wife would have had to manage the helper on a daily basis and cites <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] SGCA 32 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”) at [27(c)]) for the proposition that the assistance of a domestic helper would reduce the indirect contributions made by the homemaker.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span>Secondly, Ms Cheong argues that the DJ erred in finding that the Wife had made sacrifices in her career to care for the child. Ms Cheong submits that the Wife’s salary stagnated and rose without any correlation to the Child’s age or the supposed effort put in by the Wife. The Husband also claims that the Wife was ambitious and focused on her career throughout the marriage. In particular, he claims that the Wife would work whenever she could and despite her indications that she would stop working to care for the Child, she did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span>Thirdly, Ms Cheong submits that the DJ erred in considering the Wife’s special employee rates for the mortgages on the parties’ properties as an indirect non-financial contribution on the Wife’s part. The Husband submits that the special employee rates should be considered as indirect financial contribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span>Finally, Ms Cheong submits that the DJ failed to take into consideration the Husband’s indirect non-financial contributions. The Husband claims that the DJ did not take into account the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Husband had assisted the Wife in finding employment and was supportive towards her in her times of need. The Husband was the one who helped the Wife secure her first job in London after the parties got married; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The parties were put up in a hotel paid for by the Husband’s employer for the first month after they relocated from the United Kingdom to Singapore (including related expenses); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Husband had opened various savings accounts for the Child.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">14 </span>In the light of the above, the Husband submits that there is no reason for the ratio of indirect contributions that the DJ awarded and that the ratio of 55:45 in favour of the Wife would be more appropriate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>Mr Gulab Sobhraj (“Mr Sobhraj”), counsel for the Wife, submits that the DJ erred in attributing an indirect contributions ratio of 70:30 in her favour and ought to have to have attributed a higher ratio of 90:10 in her favour. In this endeavour, the Wife challenges the DJ’s findings on <span class="font-italic">both</span> the indirect financial contributions and the indirect non-financial contributions. In relation to the indirect non-financial contributions, the Wife relies on the following circumstances in support of her case: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Wife had given up her career and family in the United Kingdom to relocate to Singapore in January 2000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Wife had to juggle with managing her career and household in Singapore while the Husband was travelling for work on a regular basis; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) When the Child was born, the Wife had taken unpaid leave to nurse the child and tend to his needs; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Wife dealt with every aspect of managing the household and the Child, including but not limited to supervising the Child’s education, training domestic helpers, supervising renovation works of some of the properties that the parties had purchased as investments and taking care of the Husband. The Wife claims that her career progression suffered as a result as she could not take on positions that required extensive travelling; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Wife suffered from weight loss, low blood pressure and a general state of unwell due to her contributions to the marriage; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The Wife had procured employee rates from her employer so that the parties could enjoy preferential mortgage loan terms for the various properties that they had jointly purchased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span>In relation to the indirect financial contributions, the Wife alleges that more should have been apportioned to her. She relies on the following circumstances in support of her case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At a time when the Wife was earning less than the Husband, the Wife claims that she had made an equal contribution towards the household and family expenses;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Wife claims that she had to bear the burden of paying for the majority of the expenses because the Husband was not regular in depositing funds into the joint account that the parties contributed to for household expenses;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Wife claims that she had set aside funds for the Child’s future expenses such as education and insurance. She claims that the Husband did nothing in this regard but withdrew more than his contributions for his own benefit, for <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>to pay for his personal income tax, mobile phone bills and personal expenses; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Wife claims that since September 2011 the Husband had ceased in making any contributions towards the maintenance of the Child. Between September 2011 and September 2015, the Wife has paid $212,600 for the Child; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Wife claims that since 15 February 2016, the Wife pays all the monthly mortgage and interest each month for the xxx property as the Husband has stopped CPF payments towards his mortgage; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f)  The Wife claims that the Husband is occupying the xxx property rent free and that had the property been rented out, it would fetch about $5,500 per month; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The Wife claims that the Husband cleaned out the joint accounts and left these with zero or close to zero balances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span>In response to the Wife’s claim in relation to the indirect non-financial contributions, the Husband raises the following in addition to what he claims in DCA 63/2016 (see [9] – [14] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Husband claims that the Wife did not give up her career in the UK. Instead, the Husband claims that the Wife was removed from her job in November 1999 for falsifying her resume and would not have had any career prospects in the UK. The Husband also points out that the Wife had demanded that the Husband place her name on the parties’ property in the United Kingdom as a condition for relocating to Singapore; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Husband claims that the Wife’s first job in Singapore was secured through the help of the Husband. The Husband also denies that the Wife managed the household on her own as the parties had employed a domestic helper;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Husband claims that he did not travel for half of each month as alleged by the Wife.

In support of this, the Husband avers that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Wife was secretive about her income and did not contribute her fair share towards the parties’ household expenses during the course of the marriage;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) He had paid for the lion’s share of the household expenses throughout the years such as the purchase of the parties’ vehicles, petrol and hire-purchase instalments, dining, utilities and upkeep of properties as well as the majority of the Child’s expenses;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Contrary to the Wife’s allegation, he did contribute money into the joint account in 2011 and points to the fact that $45,000 was deposited in August 2011 by him;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Wife stopped contributing to the joint account sometime in 2011;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) He did not withdraw joint account monies for his own use during the marriage and that his withdrawals from the joint account during the marriage were legitimate and for the benefit of the family; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The Wife had withdrawn a large sum of money from the parties’ UK Citibank joint account and paid it to her solicitors;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) He had made a proposal on affidavit to contribute a reasonable sum for maintenance of the Child after the Wife and the Child moved out of the matrimonial home and the Wife commenced maintenance proceedings against the Husband;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) In relation to the rental expenses incurred by the Wife, he claims that the Wife could have chosen to stay at the xxx flat, which was vacant but chose to incur rental proceeds for another apartment; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) He had offered to pay half of the mortgage on the xxx property but the Wife refused his contributions; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) He had not cleaned out the joint accounts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision on the indirect contribution issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>Having considered the parties’ submissions and the evidence, I am of the view that the appropriate ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions should be 60:40 in favour of the Wife instead of 70:30 as awarded by the DJ. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indirect financial contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>In respect of the DJ’s findings on the parties’ indirect financial contributions (which the Wife has appealed in DCA 65/2016), I am not minded to disturb the DJ’s findings that the parties had contributed equally as I find that the contentions raised by the Wife are unmeritorious. First, the evidence referred to by the Wife does not, contrary to her allegations, show that the Wife had been compelled to make equal contributions towards household and family expenses <span class="font-italic">throughout</span> the course of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first set of bank statements referred to by the Wife are bank statements which show withdrawals made from the Wife’s sole account and do not show that the parties had a practice of depositing equal amounts into the joint account. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The text messages referred to by the Wife are merely text messages showing the parties discussing financial arrangements. They do not point towards any practice of equal financial contributions or evidence any default of contribution on the part of the Husband.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The withdrawals shown on the bank statement of the parties’ joint account between 2001 and 2003 do not evidence any impropriety on the part of the Husband. I accept Ms Cheong’s submission that the parties, at the material time, were happily married and there is insufficient reason to support the allegation that the withdrawals made by the Husband during that time were improper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>Second, the Wife’s contention that the Husband had ‘cut off’ maintenance since September 2011 is unsupported by the evidence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Wife has not been able to point to any evidence that the Husband had stopped providing maintenance for the Child between September 2011, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the time when the action commenced until April 2012, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the time when the Wife and Child moved out of the matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Wife has also not been able to point to any evidence that she had requested the Husband to pay maintenance for the Child prior to her application for maintenance for the Child in Summons 14132/2012. I note that it is recorded in the Husband’s affidavit dated 2 November 2012 in response to Summons 14132/2012 that the Husband was, in fact, willing to contribute a sum of maintenance, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $1,500 per month, for the Child. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At paragraph 23(b) of the Wife’s submissions for DCA 65/2016, the Wife implicitly accepts that the Husband had complied with the Order of Court dated 22 August 2012 to pay $2,200 per month for the Child’s maintenance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>Third, the Wife’s allegation relating to the Husband’s action of locking her out of xxx property causing her to have to live in a rented apartment and incur rental expenses does not advance her case that her indirect financial contributions exceeded the Husband’s. As pointed out by the Husband in his submissions, the Husband only moved into the xxx property on 10 July 2012, three months after the Wife moved out of the matrimonial home and the Wife could have moved into the xxx property had she wanted to do so in that intervening period. Furthermore, after the Husband moved out of the matrimonial home, the matrimonial home was left vacant and the Wife could have moved back to the matrimonial home but instead chose to incur rent by renting an apartment. Finally, the Wife has been unable to point to any evidence that the Husband had withdrawn all or almost all the money in the joint accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>For completeness, I should also state that I agree with the DJ’s findings on the indirect financial contributions of the parties. It is apparent that the Husband’s salary was higher than the Wife’s in the earlier years of the marriage and that the Wife’s salary had caught up and exceeded the Husband’s in the later years of the marriage, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 2010 onwards. Also, given the evidence presented to the court, no party had been able to prove the parties’ financial arrangements over the course of the marriage. Nonetheless, it is more likely than not that the parties would have contributed their incomes during the better times of their marriage in a manner which focused on the betterment of the household. This would, as found by the DJ, entail the Husband contributing more when he could, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 2000 to 2009, and the Wife doing the same when she could, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 2010 to 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>Accordingly, the DJ’s finding that the parties had contributed equally in respect of their indirect financial contributions is a justified one and I uphold it as such.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indirect non-financial contributions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>In respect of the indirect non-financial contributions of the parties, I am of the view that the DJ should have weighed some of the factors differently. This mainly accounts for my variation of the indirect contribution ratio. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>First, the presence of domestic help throughout the marriage is a material consideration that justifies a downward adjustment of the DJ’s findings. Generally, the presence of a domestic helper in a household reduces the burdens of homemaking and caregiving for both parties. This, as observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [27] may have an impact in determining the parties’ indirect contributions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the engagement of a domestic helper naturally reduces the burden of homemaking and caregiving responsibilities undertaken by the parties, and to that extent, the weight accorded to the parties’ collective indirect contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Nevertheless, I caveat that the presence of a domestic helper within a household should not be treated as an overriding factor in the determination of the parties’ homemaking and caregiving contributions. Domestic helpers play different roles and provide differing extents of help to the families they assist. In some families, it is also possible that the parties continue to contribute actively as homemaker and caretaker even in the presence of domestic help. This is consistent with the view taken by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AQS </span><span class="font-italic">v AQR</span> [2012] SGCA 3 where it stated at [40] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having domestic help does not mean the wife made no contribution as a homemaker at all, especially when the parties’ household here included two children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, the specific role that domestic helpers play within each household should be carefully considered in determining its effect on the parties’ indirect contributions. The parties’ participation in the management and supervision of the domestic helper should also be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span>In the present case, both the Husband and the Wife worked full-time throughout the marriage and relied on the domestic helper substantially for homemaking and caregiving in order to focus on their respective careers. Nonetheless, the Wife was the main supervisor of the domestic helper as the Husband frequently travelled for work throughout the marriage and was not at home in those periods. Notwithstanding the fact that both parties had benefitted from the domestic helper in terms of reducing their homemaking responsibilities, the fact that the Wife was the main supervisor and manager of the domestic helper weighs slightly in her favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>Second, although I accept that the Wife made certain sacrifices in her career in order to care for the Child, I do not find them sufficient to justify the 70:30 ratio awarded by the DJ and a ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Wife is more appropriate. It is undisputed that the Wife worked full-time throughout the marriage even after the Child was born. It follows that for a significant part of each working day, the Wife was not at home and the Child was most likely cared for by the domestic helper. The Husband also worked full-time throughout the marriage and frequently travelled for work. This meant that for some periods, the Wife was the only parent at home with the Child and some regard should be given to this fact. Given the evidence of the stagnation of the Wife’s salary in the early years of the marriage, I accept that the Wife may have given up certain employment opportunities (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, working abroad or taking up a job that requires frequent travel) in the light of the marriage and the Child. Nevertheless, I am cognisant of the fact that the Wife has succeeded tremendously in her career and in fact earned more than the Husband in the latter years of the marriage. In the circumstances, I find that a 60:40 ratio in favour of the Wife is more justified than a 70:30 ratio.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>Third, my interview with the Child supports the finding that both parents had contributed substantially to the care of the Child such that a 70:30 ratio awarded by the DJ was not justified. In the interview, which neither party had any objection to, I observed the Child to be articulate, well-adjusted and independent. During the interview, the Child informed me of the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Wife worked from 8am to 7pm daily and went to work about the same time as the Child went to school. The Child and the Wife have dinner together when the Wife comes home from work.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Husband worked overseas for some parts of the week and the Child meets the Husband during the weekends. The Husband brings the Child out and engages the Child in sports activities.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The domestic helper cooks for the family and the Wife taught the domestic helper to cook. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These points are consistent with my findings made at [27] and [28] relating to the contributions of the Husband and the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>I agree with the Husband’s submission that the special employee rates for the mortgages that the Wife secured for the parties’ properties ought to have been considered as an indirect financial contribution rather than an indirect non-financial one. Indirect financial contributions generally refer to the parties’ monetary contributions to the household expenses. In the present case, the special employee mortgage rates would have helped the parties save on interest expenses that would otherwise have been incurred had the parties sought a mortgage from a bank at the normal rates. This is a financial contribution. However, in any event, I find that there is insufficient evidence concerning the Wife’s special employee rates to justify disturbing the DJ’s finding that the parties’ were equal in their indirect financial contribution (see [20] to [23] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>Finally, the two cases cited to me by Ms Cheong are not helpful as they are borne out of different circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">TJT v TJU</span> [2015] SGFC 166, the Court awarded the Wife 55% for her indirect contribution on the basis of a marriage which lasted 12 years with two children. In that case, the Husband worked full-time and the Wife worked part-time over the weekends and was the children’s main caregiver. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">TKU v TKV</span> [2016] SGFC 17, the Court granted the Wife 60% for her indirect contributions on the basis of a marriage which lasted 16 years with two children. Similarly, the Husband worked full-time while the Wife worked part time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>As rightly pointed out by Mr Sobhraj, both cases cited by Ms Cheong concerned situations where the Wife did not work full-time and had made little indirect financial contributions. That said, I do not agree with Mr Sobhraj’s submission that the Wife’s indirect contributions in the present case should be significantly higher than those cited by Ms Cheong because she had worked full-time and contributed equally in terms of indirect financial contributions. It bears reminding that the approach in determining indirect contributions is a “broad brush” one where the court takes into account all factors before making a conclusion on the indirect contribution of the parties. This cannot be a strict mathematical exercise simply because “[n]o mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios…as to how the parties may have chosen to divide among themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere” (see <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>For the reasons stated above, I allow the Husband’s appeal in part and vary the ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions to 60:40 in favour of the Wife instead of 70:30 as awarded by the DJ. I dismiss the Wife’s appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The adverse inference issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span>The Husband claims that the DJ erred in not drawing adverse inferences against the Wife for the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Wife’s retention of the rental proceeds received from the rental of the parties’ xxx property that the Husband says remain unaccounted for; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Wife’s increased spending habits which coincided with the Husband’s discovery of her adultery and commencement of legal proceedings that the Husband alleges diminished the pool of matrimonial assets available for division. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ms Cheong submits for an adverse inference to be drawn against the Wife and asks for an additional 5% of the matrimonial assets, valued at $211,092.98, to be awarded to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span>The Wife’s responses are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In respect of the rental proceeds received from the rental of the xxx property, the Wife claims that the rental proceeds had been accounted for and that the withdrawals from the joint account containing the rental sums were used for the parties’ other properties and for household and family expenses. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In respect of the increased spending habits, the Wife claims that the Husband had failed to prove that the increased expenses had been used for the Wife’s sole personal expenses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I note that the DJ did not draw any adverse inferences in the GD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>The court has the power to draw adverse inference against the party who fails to make full and frank disclosure of the matrimonial assets (see <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [29]). In order for the court to draw an adverse inference, there must be (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</span> [2015] 2 SLR 195 at [62]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a substratum of evidence that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that person must have had some particular access to the information he/she is said to be hiding.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rental proceeds from xxx property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>By way of background, the rental income (of approximately $3,800 per month) from the xxx property was deposited directly into a joint bank account of the parties at xxx bank. The mortgage of the xxx property (amounting to $5,700 per month) was also paid out directly from the same joint bank account. The Husband mainly contends that the excess amount from the rental proceeds (amounting to $1,900 per month) remains unaccounted for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>I find that the Husband fails in his contention as there is no evidence to suggest that the Wife had drawn down on the rental proceeds in the joint bank account for her personal use or had failed to account for the proceeds. Contrary to the Husband’s assertions, the evidence shows that both parties had access to the joint account and that many withdrawals had been made on the account although it is unclear whether the Husband or the Wife made the withdrawals on each occasion. The Husband admits to making a number of withdrawals from the joint bank account for various purposes. The Wife explains that she made withdrawals on the account for use for the other properties owned by the parties as well as for household and family expenses. At the trial below, the Wife produced cheque stubs which correspond to the withdrawals on the parties’ joint bank account. In my view, this is sufficient to discharge her duty of full and frank disclosure and the Husband has not been able to provide any evidence to the contrary to challenge the authenticity of the cheque stubs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>Furthermore, I do not agree with the Husband’s contention that the Wife had prevented him from accessing the joint bank account. The Husband’s reliance on an email sent from xxx bank to prove that he could not access the bank statements is misplaced. A simple reading of an excerpt of the email shows that the bank was willing to send him statements relating to the joint bank account, albeit only by physical mail or encrypted email: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You have requested that we <span class="font-italic">re-send to you a set of statements relating to your account</span> <span class="font-italic">[xxxx]</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As email is not a secure form for the sending of confidential documents, our privacy guidelines mandate that copies of your statement be mailed to you.

This means that the Husband had access to the records of the joint account. Accordingly, I refuse to draw an adverse inference against the Wife as the Husband assertion that the rental proceeds are unaccounted for is not proved.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Wife’s increased spending habits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>Before considering the Husband’s contention on the Wife’s increased spending habits, I pause to comment that it is incorrect for the Husband to be seeking to draw an adverse inference on the basis of the Wife’s misconduct in dissipating the assets through her personal expenditures. Instead, the Husband ought to have sought a negative contribution against the Wife for the alleged misconduct (see the Court of Appeal’s approach in <span class="font-italic">AQS v AQR</span> [2012] SGCA 3 cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] SGCA 2 at [24]). Nevertheless, even considering the Husband’s case as a properly framed argument, I am of the view that the Husband’s allegations are not proved.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>The Husband’s position is that from August 2011 onwards, after legal proceedings commenced, the Wife began a spending spree which drew down significantly on her sole bank accounts that should have rightly been part of the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband asserts that the Wife’s increased expenditure is linked to the Wife’s new romantic relationship and her loss of desire to preserve the matrimonial assets in the view of an impending divorce. In response, the Wife contends that the Husband failed to show that the increased expenses had been used for the Wife’s personal expenses and that her increases in expenses were due to legitimate reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>I disagree with the Husband’s contention. While it is true that the expenditures of the Wife, as observed from the bank statements of her sole account, increased substantially since August 2011, I am of the view that the Wife had been able to sufficiently explain most of the expenditures. The Wife moved out of the matrimonial home with the Child sometime in March 2012 and I accept that she would have had to shoulder increased expenses in relation to the Child and the household for the period of time before April 2013 when Summons 14132/2012 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for the maintenance of the Child) was granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>Finally, in respect of the increase in the Wife’s expenses for spa and beauty services, I am of the view that although this is a personal expense, there is insufficient proof to find that it amounted to a dissipation of the matrimonial assets to the extent that justifies this court’s intervention to ascribe a negative contribution to the Wife. For completeness, I also find that the Husband’s allegations of the Wife’s misconduct is not proved and therefore insufficient to warrant this court’s intervention to ascribe a negative contribution to the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>For the above reasons, I dismiss the Wife’s appeal in DCA 65/2016. As made clear in my judgment, the ratio of 70:30 in relation to the indirect contributions of the parties made by the DJ in favour of the Wife is too high. It thus follows that the ratio of 90:10 for the same sought by the Wife in favour of her would be excessive. I allow the Husband’s appeal in DCA 63/2016 in part and vary the DJ’s orders relating to the parties’ indirect contributions to 60:40 in favour of the Wife. The overall division of matrimonial assets is now based on the ratio of 59.5:40.5 in favour of the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-right"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct contributions (50%)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">41%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">59%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect contributions (50%) </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">40%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">60%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Average percentage contributions</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">40.5%</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">59.5%</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>The division of assets is now to be effected as follows: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Description </span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband’s share ($)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife’s share ($)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Matrimonial home  $507,000</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">430,384.75</div><div class="txt-body text-right">(84.89% of the value)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">76,615.25</div><div class="txt-body text-right">(15.11% of the value )</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">UK property $786,654</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">786,654</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">xxx $1,010,718.49</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"> </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">1,010,718.49</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Joint accounts $22,242.25</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">22,242.25</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Husband’s nett assets</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">470,572.13</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Wife’s assets</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">1,424,672.71</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Share of total pool of </span></div><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">$4,221,859.58</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">1,709,853.13</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">2,512,006.45</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">% share of matrimonial assets</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">40.5%</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">59.5%</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">47 </span>In order to effect this change, the orders of the DJ concerning the matrimonial home at [2(9)] of the GD is set aside, and the following are ordered:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the matrimonial home at xxx shall be sold in the open market within 6 months of the Certificate of Final Judgment.
