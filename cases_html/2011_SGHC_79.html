        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this action, the Defendant, Chenet Finance
                    Limited, was given conditional leave to defend the claim of the Plaintiff,
                    Rankine Bernadette Adeline. The Defendant has appealed against my order. In the
                    meantime, final judgment has been entered after the Defendant failed to comply
                    with the condition imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff was a holder of 1,000,000 shares
                    of a company Berlian Ferries Pte Ltd (“Berlian”) in May 2004. The
                    Plaintiff discovered that those shares in Berlian (“the shares”)
                    had purportedly been sold by her with consideration paid to her, and that the
                    Defendant was the purchaser of the shares. As the Plaintiff had not agreed to
                    sell the shares to the Defendant and had not received any consideration from the
                    Defendant, she sought from Berlian copies of any transfer of shares signed by
                    her. Berlian in turn informed the Defendant that it (Berlian) did not have the
                    transfer forms relating to the shares. Berlian also informed the Defendant that
                    as the Defendant’s representatives had inspected and made copies from the
                    secretarial files of Berlian, the Defendant should reply to the Plaintiff, but
                    the Defendant had not supplied copies of the transfer forms to the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       When she received no satisfactory reply to her
                    queries, the Plaintiff sued the Defendant. She asserted that the alleged
                    transfer was a fraud and was void, that the Defendant is not the legal or
                    beneficial owner of the shares, and claimed for the return of the shares and
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleaded defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Defendant filed its defence to the
                    Plaintiff’s claim. In the defence, the Defendant stated that it was the
                    holder of 24,017,983 shares of Berlian including the 1,000,000 shares claimed by
                    the Plaintiff. The Defendant pleaded that it was unable to give full particulars
                    of the acquisition of the Plaintiff’s shares, and the best particulars
                    that the Defendant could give was that “1,000,000 shares was acquired
                    from the Plaintiff around 2005”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Defendant pleaded further that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">7.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... The Plaintiff was well aware of the transfer of
                            her shares in Berlian to the Defendant and also signed all relevant
                            documents including the share transfer form to transfer her shares to
                            the Defendant. Further, the Plaintiff was at all times also aware of the
                            corporate structure of Berlian and the fact that [the Defendant] had
                            invested further sums of monies to increase its shareholding in Berlian
                            over time.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">8.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">By reason of the matters aforesaid, the Plaintiff
                            is estopped from denying the transfer of the shares to the Defendant.
                            Further, the Defendant’s claim to be unaware of the transfer of
                            her shares in Berlian to [the Defendant] is frivolous, vexatious, and
                            scandalous and/or the claim herein is an abuse of process.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The unpleaded defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Defendant resisted the Plaintiff’s
                    application for summary judgment and filed an affidavit through its director and
                    shareholder, Tan Yeang Tze Tobby (“Tan”). In this affidavit, it
                    was alleged that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">9.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As far as the Defendant is concerned, the shares
                            were lawfully acquired in 2005 from the Plaintiff, and certainly not by
                            fraudulent means. The Plaintiff’s shares were issued to her in
                            2004 at a time when the Defendant stepped into Berlian to rescue it from
                            its severe business difficulties by injecting S$2,000,000 in cash into
                            Berlian. This sum was converted to 2 million shares at S$1.00 per share.
                                <em>1 million shares were then allocated to the
                                Plaintiff by the Defendant as part of a re-structuring arrangement
                                for no consideration</em>, as the Plaintiff and the Defendant
                            were on friendly business terms at that point in time. <em>In 2005, the 1 million shares were transferred from the
                                Defendant back to the Plaintiff for no consideration</em>.
                            Since 2005 up to the commencement of the Suit, the Defendant has never
                            objected to or raised any of her alleged concerns as regards the
                            transfer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I refer to this defence as the “re-structuring arrangement
                    defence”, and will comment on this later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Tan also referred to the absence of the records
                    of the transfer. He deposed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">13.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... the Defendant unable to access to its
                            documents which were located in Berlian’s premises. These document
                            have been relocated to a warehouse in Tanjong Pagar Distripark, as they
                            are allegedly part of a group of documents which are the subject of
                            competing claims by various parties. ... In order to fully explain to
                            the Court the circumstances behind the transfer of the shares to the
                            Defendant, the Defendant requires access to these documents and to
                            adduce them before the Honourable Court at trial.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the Defendants’ Submissions, the same
                    matter was brought up, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Some time in April 2009, a series of events began, which resulted in the
                        Defendant losing possession, custody and control of its Company Kit and
                        other corporate secretarial documents, ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After the statement of claim and defence were
                    filed, the Plaintiff applied for summary judgment under O 14, Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed). The matter went on for hearing
                    before an Assistant Registrar who dismissed the application and gave the
                    Defendant unconditional leave to defend the action. The Plaintiff appealed
                    against the Assistant Registrar’s decision and the appeal came before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiff started its submission in the
                    appeal with the law governing applications for summary judgment. This has been
                    succinctly stated by Justice Judith Prakash in <em>Associated
                        Developments Pte Ltd v Loong Sie Kiong Gerald</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 389 at [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... that in order to obtain judgment, a plaintiff has first to show that
                        he has a <em>prima facie</em> case for judgment. Once
                        he has done that, the burden shifts to the defendant who, in order to obtain
                        leave to defend, must establish that there is a fair or reasonable
                        probability that he has a real or <em>bona fide</em>
                        defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff had
                    established that she was the owner of 1,000,000 Berlian shares by producing a
                    copy of the share certificate. In any event, the Defendant acknowledged that the
                    Plaintiff held 1,000,000 shares, and the Defendant claimed ownership over
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For the purpose of the application under
                    O 14, the Plaintiff had a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    for judgment on her claim that she was the owner of the shares, and the shares
                    were transferred to the Defendant without her consent or knowledge. Although the
                    Defendant disputes the Plaintiff’s ignorance over the transfer, the
                    Plaintiff had put forward a <em>prima facie</em> case for
                    judgment in that she can get judgment <em>if</em> her case
                    is accepted. It does not mean that she is entitled to judgment as of right; that
                    is the very question to be decided at the hearing of her application, when her
                    claim as well as the defence is examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Admissibility of the re-structuring arrangement defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel for the Plaintiff questioned the
                    Defendant’s right to rely on the re-structuring arrangement defence. The
                    objection was taken because the arrangement was not raised as a defence to the
                    Plaintiff’s claim, and was not even mentioned in the defence
                filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There have been several decisions on this
                    question. In <em>Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 786 (“<em>Lim Leong Huat</em>”), Justice Woo Bih Li addressed the issue
                    with admirable thoroughness in his decision delivered on 25 January 2008.
                    He took note of the Malaysian decision in <em>Lin Securities
                        (Pte) Ltd v Noone &amp; Co Sdn Bhd</em> [1989] 1 MLJ 321
                        (“<em>Lin Securities</em>”) where it was
                    said in p 322:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No doubt a defendant is bound by the four corners of his pleading at the
                        trial of the action but he is not so bound at the O 14 proceedings.
                        Order 14 r 4(1) provides that a defendant may show cause against an
                        application for summary judgment by affidavit or otherwise. He is entitled
                        to show at the hearing of the O 14 application that over and above what
                        has been pleaded in the statement of defence he has other defences. The
                        issue at an O 14 application is whether the defendant has a defence and
                        not whether the statement of defence provides him with a defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">but he was not content to adopt that approach to the issue. He went on
                    to give further thought to the matter. He explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22     I had some reservation about the
                        correctness of the decision in <em>Lin Securities</em>
                        for various reasons. It is one thing for a rule to say that a defendant may
                        show cause against an application for summary judgment by affidavit or
                        otherwise. In such a rule, a defendant need not file an affidavit to show
                        cause if, for example, he is able to rely on the statement of claim and/or
                        the affidavit for the plaintiff to establish that summary judgment should
                        not be granted. The rule does not necessarily mean that a defendant may say
                        something in his affidavit which is not pleaded in his defence. Let me
                        elaborate. Supposing a defendant were to be allowed to rely on an allegation
                        in his affidavit which is not in his defence and, solely because of that
                        allegation, he is able to avoid summary judgment. What happens if, when he
                        subsequently applies to amend his defence to include this allegation he is
                        not allowed to amend? This would mean that summary judgment should have been
                        entered in the first place. Such an incongruous situation would be avoided
                        if he were not to be allowed to rely on the allegation unless the defence is
                        first amended to include that allegation. I was also of the view that the
                        pleadings govern the issues between the parties throughout the action and
                        the pleadings apply to all interlocutory proceedings. On the other hand, the
                        decision in <em>Lin Securities</em> seemed to suggest
                        that for the purpose of applications for summary judgment, the pleadings did
                        not govern.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23     It should also be remembered that
                        previously, applications for summary judgment were often made before a
                        defence was filed. Accordingly, there was usually no question of an
                        affidavit for a defendant raising an allegation which was not in the
                        defence. Such a problem would arise only when a defence had already been
                        filed. I will say more about this later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24     Secondly, it is one thing to say that a
                        defendant may rely on an affidavit allegation not pleaded in his defence but
                        it is quite a different thing to say he may rely on an affidavit allegation
                        which is contradictory to that which has already been pleaded in his
                        defence. In such a situation, it seemed to me all the more so that the
                        defence must first be amended before he can rely on the affidavit
                        allegation. As mentioned above, it is by no means certain that the
                        application to amend the defence would be allowed. Certainly in the case
                        before me, Lim and Tan [the Defendants in the application] would have to
                        explain why, if the new allegation were true, it was not mentioned at the
                        earliest opportunity when the initial defences were filed. It would then be
                        questionable whether an application to amend the defence would be
                        allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25     Thirdly, our Rules of Court were amended
                        recently in 2006 so that currently, a plaintiff may apply for summary
                        judgment only after the defence has been served. This is unlike the previous
                        situation where, as I have mentioned, a plaintiff might and often did apply
                        for summary judgment even before the defence was filed. The purpose of the
                        amendment was so that a plaintiff would know the specific defence before
                        applying for summary judgment. <em>I was of the view that to
                            allow a defendant to raise a substantive allegation in his affidavit
                            which was not pleaded in his defence would undermine the purpose of the
                            amendment</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Woo J re-visited the question in his decision
                    in <em>HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Ltd v
                        Elchemi Assets Pte Ltd and another</em> [2010] SGHC 67
                        (“<em>HSBC v Elchemi</em>”) delivered on
                    3 March 2010. In this case, the plaintiff as landlord sued the first
                    defendant, its tenant, and the second defendant, the guarantor of the first
                    defendant, for arrears in rent. After the defendants had filed their defence and
                    counterclaim, the plaintiff applied for and obtained summary judgments against
                    the defendants, and the defendants applied to set aside the judgments. Woo J
                    dismissed their appeals. In his judgment, he noted that the second defendant
                    had, in the affidavit filed to resist the application for summary judgment,
                    raised fresh allegations not found in the defence. Woo J stated at [21] of his grounds of decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was of the view that he was not entitled to do so unless the defendants
                        had first applied for and obtained leave to amend his defence (see my
                        decision in <em>Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee
                            Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 786). The
                        defendants did not seek leave to do so and accordingly, were not entitled to
                        rely on the fresh allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Within a week after Woo J stated his view in
                        <em>Lim Leong Huat</em>, Judith Prakash J delivered her
                    grounds of decision on 30 January 2008 in <em>United States
                        Trading Co Pte Ltd v Ting Boon Aun and another</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 981 (“<em>United States
                        Trading</em>”) which touched on the same issue. In this case,
                    the plaintiff sued the two defendants for the return of a loan, and applied for
                    summary judgment against the second defendant after he had filed his defence,
                    judgment in default of appearance having been entered against the first
                    defendant. In his affidavit filed to resist the application, the second
                    defendant raised a defence that was not pleaded in the defence he filed. An
                    Assistant Registrar allowed the plaintiff’s application and entered
                    judgment against the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the appeal against the Assistant
                    Registrar’s decision, counsel for the second defendant argued that the
                    judgment should be set aside. That did not find favour with Prakash J who took
                    care to explain:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23     [Counsel] stated that the assistant
                        registrar had not accepted these arguments [on the unpleaded defence]
                        because they were not based on matters pleaded in the defence. He argued
                        that the omission to plead such arguments as defences was irrelevant because
                        at a summary judgment hearing, the defendant was entitled to raise matters
                        which had not been pleaded. In support he cited the 1989 case of <em>Lin Securities (Pte) v Noone &amp; Co Sdn Bhd</em> [1989]
                        1 MLJ 321 ("the <em>Lin Securities</em> case"). That
                        was a Malaysian case which held that whilst the defendant was bound by the
                        four corners of his pleadings at the trial of the action, he would not be so
                        bound at the O 14 proceedings. The Malaysian O 14 r 4(1) Rules of the High
                        Court 1980 (PU(A) 50/1980) provided that a defendant may show cause against
                        an application for summary judgment by affidavit or otherwise and it was
                        held that he was therefore entitled to show at the hearing of an O 14
                        application that over and above what had been pleaded in the statement of
                        claim, he had other defences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24     The present O 14 regime as
                        encapsulated in the Rules of Court is predicated, unlike the regime that
                        applied in Malaysia and Singapore in 1989 when the <em>Lin
                            Securities</em> case was decided, on both the statement of claim
                        and the defence having been filed before the application for summary
                        judgment is taken out. As the commentary in <em>Singapore
                            Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P Selvam ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        2007) ("the <em>White Book</em>") notes at para 14/1/7,
                        the previous procedure was unsatisfactory:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... as the plaintiff who applies for summary judgment may not be in a
                            position to pinpoint the specific defences that the defendant may raise.
                            This has often resulted in the plaintiff's affidavit in reply to the
                            defendant's show cause affidavit raising new issues, which the defendant
                            then requires leave of court to respond to. This disrupts the timetable
                            for the filing of affidavits set out in O.14, r.2. With the amendments,
                            the service of a defence by the defendant and not just the entry of
                            appearance is now a prerequisite to an application under O.14.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>White Book</em> at para 14/2/12 also restates
                        the principle established by the <em>Lin
                            Securities</em> case that the defendant is not bound by the four
                        corners of his defence at the summary judgment stage but follows that with a
                        reference to the case of <em>Pembinaan V-Jaya Sdn Bhd v
                            Binawisma Development Sdn Bhd</em> [1987] 2 CLJ 446 which it cites
                        for the principle that where the defence amounts to nothing more than a bare
                        denial of the claim, the court may be particularly cautious about defences
                        suddenly raised by the affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25     In my view, now that the Rules of Court
                        have been amended to require the defence to be filed before the summary
                        judgment application can be made, the principle in the <em>Lin Securities</em> case must be looked at again. I consider that
                        it behoves a defendant to set out all his defences in his defence so that
                        the plaintiff can make a proper assessment of the chances of an application
                        for summary judgment being successful. It is not correct for the defendant
                        to plead one thing which, objectively, does not seem to afford him a good
                        defence and then when the application is made by the plaintiff to bring up
                        various other points and take the plaintiff by surprise. To allow a
                        defendant to do this as a matter of course would be to allow an abuse of
                        process. This does not mean that in all circumstances a defendant should not
                        be able to raise a new defence in his affidavit responding to the O 14
                        application but he should be able to give good reasons for not having raised
                        such defence in his pleading and, if he is not able to do so, the defences
                        should be either disregarded or treated with a great deal of
                        suspicion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     From these three decisions, the position
                    appears to be that a fresh defence that is not pleaded cannot be relied on
                    unless the defence is amended, or in exceptional cases where the court finds
                    that there are good reasons to allow that to be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     These cases have been noted and discussed in
                        <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (LexisNexis
                    2009) at 14/3/2A:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pleading defences for the purpose of challenging O 14
                        application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A respondent to an application for summary judgment must ensure that he
                        pleads all the defences he intends to rely on in his pleading. If he fails
                        to do this, he may not be able to raise a defence at the hearing of the
                        application even if it is stated in his affidavit or other source. This
                        principle, which was propounded by Judith Prakash J in <em>United States Trading Co Pte v Ting Boon Aun</em>
                        [2008] SGHC 15 (‘<em>United States
                            Trading’</em>), reverses the previous practice which did not
                        bind the defendant to the four corners of his pleading (see, for example,
                            <em>Lin Securities (Pte) Ltd v Noone</em> [1989] 1
                        MLJ 321, which is cited in United States Trading, at [24]–[25]; and <em>Superbowl Jurong Pte Ltd v
                            Sami’s Curry Restaurant Pte Ltd</em> [2007] SGDC 157). The
                        binding effect of the defence pleading was also propounded in <em>Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte
                            Ltd</em> [2008] SGHC 12 (decided within a week of
                            <em>United States Trading</em>). Woo J considered
                        that the rule permitting the defendant to challenge an application for
                        summary judgment by ‘by affidavit or otherwise’ (see O 14,
                        r 2(3)) (RC) did not mean that he was entitled to omit defences from
                        his pleading (ibid, at [20]–[28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The latest decision on the question is the
                    decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Poh Soon Kiat v Desert
                        Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace)</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 1129 delivered on 28 April 2009. In this case, the
                    appellant, against whom summary judgment had been entered, applied to the Court
                    of Appeal to amend his defence as a prelude to his appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Court of Appeal did not deal with the
                    application to amend, and explained in its judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15     In this connection, the Appellant applied
                        to this court via SUM 1312/2009 for leave to amend his defence to plead that
                        the 2001 California Judgment was not a foreign money judgment ... We
                        declined to hear this application and treated it as withdrawn. In our view,
                        it was an unnecessary application as, in summary judgment proceedings, "[a]
                        defendant may raise defences in his affidavit even if they are not referred
                        to in the pleaded defence" (see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                            2007</em> (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007)
                        at para 14/2/12) and is "bound by the four corners of his pleadings [only]
                        at the trial of the action but ... not ... [in] the O. 14 [<em>ie</em>, summary judgment] proceedings"</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The quoted statements are from a
                    passage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A defendant may raise defences in his affidavit even if they are not
                        referred to in the pleaded defence (<em>Lin Securities (Pte)
                            Ltd v. Noone &amp; Co Sdn Bhd</em> [1989] 1 MLJ 321). A defendant
                        is bound by the four corners of his pleadings at the trial of the action but
                        is not so bound at the O.14 proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">which did not have the advantage of considering the reasoning in the
                    decisions of Woo J and Prakash J and their views on the statement of law laid
                    down in <em>Lin Securities</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There is a possibility that the Court of
                    Appeal would have dealt with the issue differently if its attention was drawn to
                        <em>Lim Leong Huat</em>, <em>United
                        States Trading</em> and the <em>Singapore Court
                        Practice 2009</em>. We have to wait till the question goes before the
                    Court again to have an answer. In the mean time, it can only be said that there
                    is room for greater clarity and certainty on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I did not exclude the unpleaded defence from
                    the appeal as counsel for the Plaintiff was prepared to deal with
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Examination of the defences</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The re-structuring arrangement defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for the Plaintiff had pointed out that
                    this defence was not only absent from the pleaded defence, but was not
                    consistent with it. In the defence filed on 4 December 2009, the Defendant
                    pleaded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendant is a shareholder of Berlian and currently hold 24,017,983
                        shares in Berlian amounting to some 88.9% of the paid capital of Berlian.
                        The Defendant acquired its shareholding in Berlian over time and complied
                        with all applicable regulations and requirements in relation to the same.
                        The Defendant is unable to give full particulars of the due acquisition of
                        the said shares as many of the documents of the Defendant has been
                        wrongfully withheld [from the Defendant] ... The Defendant reserves its
                        rights to give further particulars upon discovery of the said documents.
                        Save as aforesaid<em>, the best particulars the Defendant can
                            give</em> at this time are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">1,000,000 shares was acquired from the Plaintiff
                            around 2005;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In Tan’s affidavit filed six weeks later
                    on 18 January 2010, clear references were made to the re-structuring
                    arrangement and the transfer of the 1,000,000 shares (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Obvious questions arise from this. One
                    question is why was the re-structuring arrangement not mentioned in the defence
                    pleaded? The Defendant stated that “(t)he Defendant is unable to give
                    full particulars of the acquisition of the shares as many of the documents of
                    the Defendant has [sic] been wrongfully withheld ...” That only means
                    that the Defendant was unable to produce documentary evidence of the
                    re-structuring arrangement; it cannot mean that the Defendant cannot remember
                    that it had acquired the shares through a re-structuring arrangement. The
                    pleaded defence made no reference to any re-structuring arrangement, and only
                    stated that the 1,000,000 shares were acquired from the plaintiff around
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     A second question is why was no documentary
                    evidence produced? The Defendant had stated that it did not have access to the
                    corporate secretariat documents. It did not say that its non-secretarial
                    records, <em>eg</em>, its account books, external
                    correspondence and internal records were also in the possession of its corporate
                    secretaries; such records would not be kept by the corporate secretaries whose
                    duties do not extend to the management and custody of such records. It is
                    unlikely that matters as important as the injection of $2 million by the
                    Defendant into Berlian and the re-restructuring arrangement were not referred to
                    in the account books, external correspondence and internal records of the
                    Defendant. In any event, if the Defendant had injected $2 million into Berlian,
                    evidence of the payment would be obtainable from its bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Tan’s account of the re-structuring
                    arrangement and the transfer of the Plaintiff’s 1,000,000 shares should be
                    read carefully. He had deposed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1 million shares were then allocated to the Plaintiff by the Defendant as
                        part of a re-structuring arrangement for no consideration, as the Plaintiff
                        and the Defendant were on friendly business terms at that point in time. In
                        2005, the 1 million shares were transferred <em>from the
                            Defendant back to the Plaintiff</em> for no consideration. Since
                        2005 up to the commencement of the Suit, the <em>Defendant
                            has never objected</em> to or raised any of her alleged concerns
                        as regards the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The reference to the “Defendant” and the
                    “Plaintiff” in the second and third sentences are clearly
                    reversed, and these two sentences can only be meaningful if they are taken to
                    mean that the shares were transferred from the Plaintiff back to the Defendant,
                    and the Plaintiff had not objected to that. This is in fact the position taken
                    in the Defendant’s submissions in the appeal at para 41(d) and (e)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(d)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the Shares were transferred back to the Defendant
                            for no consideration in 2005; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(e)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">since 2005 up to the commencement of the present
                            action, the Plaintiff has never objected to or raised any of her alleged
                            concerns as regards the transfer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The mistake and carelessness in the narration of the
                    re-structuring arrangement and the movement of the shares raise further
                    questions over the veracity of the defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The estoppel defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Besides the defence that the Defendant
                    acquired the Plaintiff’s shares in 2005, the other defence is the defence
                    of estoppel pleaded in para 8 of the defence (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> <em>supra</em>). Although it was pleaded that “the
                    Plaintiff is estopped from denying the transfer of the shares to the
                    Defendant”, the Defendant really meant that on the facts, the Plaintiff
                    cannot deny that she had transferred the shares to the Defendant, and
                    “estopped” was not used in the strict sense of the Plaintiff
                    having made a representation which the Defendant had relied on to its detriment.
                    This point was alluded to by the Plaintiff’s submissions,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and the Defendant did not respond to
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the appeal the Plaintiff did not ask for
                    summary judgment to be entered against the Defendant. Instead it was submitted
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given the highly questionable nature of the Defendant’s case, it is
                        respectfully submitted that the imposition of conditional leave to defend is
                        called for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The submission accorded with my findings on
                    the issues. The defences raised by the Defendant were indeed questionable, but I
                    was not minded to reject them and to enter final judgment. The Defendant should
                    be given the opportunity to produce direct or corroborative documentary evidence
                    to support its defences, but appropriate conditions should be imposed before the
                    Defendant is allowed to proceed further with those defences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As the primary claim was for the return of the
                    1,000,000 shares, a condition that the shares be placed into the custody of
                    stakeholders pending the disposal of the trial would be a suitable condition,
                    but the Defendant stated that the shares are not in its possession. In these
                    circumstances, an order that the Defendant is to furnish security at the value
                    of the shares was discussed with counsel. However, there was no satisfactory
                    evidence on the value of the shares. Counsel for the Plaintiff proposed that the
                    par value of $1 be used, while counsel for the Defendant countered with a
                    suggestion of 10¢ a share. In the absence of any reliable evidence, I adopted a
                    value of 20¢ a share, and gave the Defendant leave to defend on the provision of
                    security in the sum of $200,000. The quantum of the security could be set on a
                    more informed basis. If the professional evidence on the value of the shares is
                    now or shall become available, the parties may consider seeking the leave of the
                    Court of Appeal to admit that evidence for the appeal.</p>
