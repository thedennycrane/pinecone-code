On the contrary, I find that P had delayed the sale of the flat. D did not reside at the Clementi Flat when Mdm Yap passed away but had been staying at a flat at West Coast Road which she had purchased in 1991 in joint names with ML (“D’s Flat”), whilst P had moved into the Clementi Flat in December 2004 and only vacated it on 3 November 2014. As a beneficiary to the remaining proceeds of sale of the Clementi Flat (after the purchase of a substitute flat for ML), it would not have been in D’s interest for the sale of the flat to be delayed. On the other hand, P had no beneficial entitlement in the proceeds of the Clementi Flat but had gained by staying there rent-free. Being an Executor, P had breached his duty in failing to act in the interest of the beneficiaries, by refusing to move out of the Clementi Flat thus delaying its sale and by benefitting from staying rent-free. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Misleading the court in OS 311/2013 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>P asserted that D had misled the court in the recording of the consent order in OS 311, and had failed to come to court with clean hands.

If the claim is that ML was <span class="font-italic">entitled to $400,000</span> and thus had suffered loss due to its devaluation in the meantime (as Ms Wong submitted in closing submissions), then this claim also fails. ML was never entitled to $400,000 under Mdm Yap’s will. The will provided for a 3-room HDB flat to be purchased for ML from the sale proceeds of the Clementi Flat. The $400,000 was an estimated sum set aside after a negotiated settlement to buy a flat for ML to give effect to Mdm Yap’s will, and in fact ML’s New Flat was purchased for $308,000. It is unclear what cause of action ML has on the $400,000 and what loss she had suffered. Consistent with Mdm Yap’s wishes to provide for ML, ML had a place to stay throughout and a flat that belonged to her thereafter.

This was in the context of the court’s discretion to extend the one-year period from the death of the testator to distribute his legacy before a legatee has a right to claim interest on the legacy, pursuant to s 39 of the New Zealand Administration Act 1969 (No 52 of 1969). In the United Kingdom, s 44 of the Administration of Estates Act 1925 (c23) (UK) provides that an administrator/executor of an estate is not bound to distribute the estate before the expiration of one year from the deceased’s death. While there is no statutory equivalent in Singapore for the period of distribution of an estate, the point is that an executor/administrator should do so within a reasonable time from the deceased’s death.

Mdm Yap also told him that ML would be the co-owner of the flat and instructed him to safeguard ML’s interest as ML could not fend for herself. As such D should account to ML for the value of D’s Flat, on the basis of a resulting trust in ML’s favour or a common intention for ML to have a 50% share in D’s Flat.

Hence, even applying the approach in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, D would hold the entire beneficial interest as she paid the entire purchase price. There was also no evidence to show an inferred common intention between D and ML that ML would have a beneficial interest in D’s Flat.

I accept D’s explanation that she subsequently removed ML’s name to enable another HDB flat to be purchased in ML’s name (to give effect to Mdm Yap’s will) as HDB would not permit a person to be a registered owner of two HDB flats simultaneously.

</div> ML, being mentally incapacitated from birth, could not have consented and did not consent to D making these payments on her behalf. D claimed that she had arranged for the insurance policies and paid the premiums “in expectation of reimbursement when [ML] is able to pay”. However she admitted in court that when she initially agreed to pay the insurance premiums (purportedly at Mdm Yap’s request), D had no expectations of repayment, that ML never agreed to repay D the insurance premiums or the Medisave top ups, and that in any event ML did not have money to do so. D also stated that she had made the Medisave top-ups for ML without expecting ML to repay her and she took it upon herself to care for ML.

</div> Whilst P admitted that D made some of the payments for ML, he also claimed to have contributed to ML’s expenses. Hence, I am not satisfied that D has discharged the burden to prove her claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>As such, I dismiss D’s claim against ML for sums pertaining to the above expenses totalling $44,348.35. D thus had no basis to withdraw the $11,575.03 which belonged to ML to set-off against the $44,348.35 which D claimed were expended on ML’s behalf. The issue that remains is whether P’s claim in conversion or unjust enrichment can be sustained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>The general rule is that money can be converted except where it has passed into currency (<span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</span> (Michael A. Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2014) at [17-37]; Gary Chan Kok Yew, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at [11.042]). Conversion only protects interest in chattels or things that can be possessed. Intangibles such as choses in action cannot be converted save for a recognised exception in the form of documentary intangibles such as cheques and negotiable instruments (<span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 308 at [131]). ML’s right to her monies in the D-ML POSB Account is a chose in action. It was unclear how the claim of conversion has been made out, as there was insufficient evidence as to what the subject of the conversion was and whether that could be converted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>Next, to find a claim in unjust enrichment, P has to show that D has been benefitted or enriched, the benefit or enrichment was at ML’s expense, D’s enrichment was unjust and there are no applicable defences. However, P did not expressly plead the cause of action or the specific unjust factor sought to be relied upon. (See <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [98]–[99] and [134]–[136].) Nevertheless, a balance has to be struck between instilling procedural discipline in civil litigation and permitting parties to present the substantive merits of their case notwithstanding a procedural irregularity (<span class="font-italic">Sun J</span><span class="font-italic">in Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo</span> [2011] 2 SLR 196 at [20]). The purpose of pleadings is to ensure that each party was aware of the respective arguments against it and that neither was therefore taken by surprise (<span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltd and other appeals and another matter</span> [2020] SGCA 7 at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>I find that D could not have been taken by surprise at a claim in unjust enrichment. P had pleaded that D had withdrawn $11,575.03 from the D-ML POSB Account which belonged to ML, that D had not rendered any credible account to justify her claim over the $11,575.03, and that D had thus wrongfully taken, retained or misappropriated the money belonging to ML.

</div> Pursuant to s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”), I award ML pre-judgment interest on the sum of $11,575.03. However, I find that the default interest rate of 5.33% (as provided for in the Supreme Court Practice Directions at para 77(9)) would over-compensate ML: see<span class="font-italic"> Ong Teck Soon (executor of the estate of Ong Kim Nang, deceased) v Ong Teck Seng and another</span> [2017] 4 SLR 819 at [85]. ML has been fully incapable of managing her affairs and there is no evidence that P (even after assuming the role as court-appointed deputy) would have invested the money to produce returns. If the $11,575.03 had not been withdrawn, it would have been left in the D-ML POSB Account, and which would have generated a relatively low interest rate. I will thus impute an interest rate of 1% per annum. As P has prayed for this interest to run from 2016 when D had closed the D-ML POSB Account, I will order the interest rate of 1% per annum to run only from 2016 until judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">D’s counterclaims against P</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>I next turn to D’s counterclaims against P as follows:

She claimed to have single-handedly administered the estate over the years. D thus prayed for a reasonable and fair commission pursuant to s 66 of the PAA of $23,942.47. This sum is the difference between $65,000, which the parties had agreed to set aside for payment of testamentary expenses, and $41,057.53 claimed by D from the estate.

</div> P objected on the basis that D had breached her fiduciary duties as Executrix, caused loss to the beneficiaries and profited from her position. In court, P agreed that given the time D spent administering Mdm Yap’s estate, she should be awarded a reasonable commission from the estate, provided she kept proper accounts.

In the same vein, D sought a declaration that P had breached his fiduciary duties and for his removal as Executor. D claimed that P was disinterested in administering the estate and did not make any effort to do so. Instead, he made spurious and unfounded allegations against D. D further alleged that P had refused to vacate the Clementi Flat resulting in a delay of its sale and refused to allow the reimbursement of testamentary expenses incurred by D in relation to Mdm Yap’s estate.

</div>
</div>
</div> Section 32 of the PAA provides that any probate or letters of administration may be revoked or amended for any “sufficient cause”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where there has been undue and improper administration of the estate in total disregard of the beneficiaries’ interests (<span class="font-italic">Jigarlal Kantilal Doshi</span><span class="font-italic"> v Damayanti Kantilal Doshi (executrix of the estate of Kantilal Prabhulal Doshi, deceased) and another</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 290 (“<span class="font-italic">Jigarlal</span>”) at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">119 </span>I had found that P caused delays in the sale of the Clementi Flat, and had benefitted to the detriment of the beneficiaries of the Clementi Flat by staying there rent-free after Mdm Yap’s demise. On the other hand, I had also found that some of D’s actions were in breach as Executrix. For instance, D had retained the whole of $1,403.87 in Mdm Yap’s OCBC Account after the Account was closed, when she had no basis to that sum in full at the material time. D had delayed in distributing to ML her share of the KL Property Proceeds. She had also commingled Mdm Yap’s estate monies with Wendy’s estate monies without good reason, as the sum from Mdm Yap’s estate would have differed from Wendy’s estate, and the distribution to the beneficiaries would also have differed in the two estates. D had also failed to procure D’s SCB Account statements even though she could have obtained some of the statements when P requested for them in 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">120 </span>Nevertheless, this was not a case in which D had administered the estate in total disregard of the interest of the beneficiaries. There was no evidence that D had gained personally and at the expense of the other beneficiaries of the estate.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was not disputed that Mdm Yap’s estate <span class="font-italic">has been properly distributed</span> save for certain defined and specified sums which are mainly the subject of the consent orders (see [27] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whilst D had commingled estate monies of Mdm Yap’s with Wendy’s and had failed to retain the bank statements at the material time, the fact remained that Mdm Yap’s estate has been properly distributed save for the sums mentioned at paragraph (a) above, and the parties have crystallised the amount due to each beneficiary from Wendy’s estate (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, at $92,902.38). There was no evidence that D had siphoned off monies from Mdm Yap’s estate and Wendy’s estate for her benefit.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Although D had retained part of the $1,403.87 at the material time when she should not have done so, the amounts incurred by her for Mdm Yap’s estate exceeded what she had retained and thus I had allowed D to retain the excess as reimbursement for such expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">121 </span>Based on the totality of the circumstances, I did not find sufficient cause to remove D as Executrix of Mdm Yap’s estate. Even if there were, it would be necessary to consider whether in the circumstances of the case, it would be in the beneficiaries’ interest to do so: see <span class="font-italic">Jigarlal</span> at [17]. I am of the view that this would not be so. In removing D as Executrix, P would become the sole executor of the estate, as no other person has indicated an interest in administering the estate. This would be an unsatisfactory position, as I have found P to be disinterested in the administration of the estate even whilst he was (and still is) an executor, and in view of his conduct in casting numerous aspersions and allegations against D which I had found to be untrue. Also, P had caused delay in the sale of the Clementi Flat. Whilst P alleged that he was prevented from managing the estate, the fact remained that, as Executor, he could have conducted independent investigations into the accounts, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by asking for bank statements and documents directly from source.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">122 </span>Likewise, I am not minded to grant D’s prayer to remove P as Executor, even though P had failed to discharge his duties as Executor. D herself was not entirely free from blame. She had not been forthcoming in producing the accounts and keeping proper records of supporting documents pertaining to the KL Property Proceeds and the commingling of estate funds at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">123 </span>Ultimately, Mdm Yap’s estate has been properly distributed save for certain specified and defined sums which parties have agreed on how to resolve via the consent orders. It is thus pointless to change the status quo now. Whilst I am cognisant of the hostile relationship between the parties, maintaining both P and D as executors of the estate will act as a check and balance to ensure the remaining monies in the estate, the subject of the consent orders, will be properly accounted for and distributed to the beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">124 </span>Finally, in closing submissions, P (on ML’s behalf) had decided not to pursue a claim against D for rental proceeds and/or of D’s occupation of the West Coast Flat from February 2008 to November 2016 as he intends to pursue the matter under the 2018 Consent Order. D objected to P’s belated attempt to withdraw the claim and to reserve his rights to pursue it under the 2018 Consent Order. Given P’s decision, I make no findings and give no orders on this claim. As to whether he would be entitled to this claim as part of the 2018 Consent Order, this matter is left to be determined at the appropriate stage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">125 </span>In summary, I allow the following claims:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) ML’s claim against D for $11,575.03, with pre-judgment interest of 1% per annum from 2016 until judgment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) D’s claim against Mdm Yap’s estate relating to the Clementi Flat and estate expenses being $18,599.12 (for outstanding mortgage payments), $16,242.80 (for S&amp;CC), $2,874.77 (for property tax), $1,301.66 (for TV licence fee), $1,042.75 (for home insurance) and $300 (for miscellaneous estate expenses); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a commission of $20,000 to D pursuant to s 66 of the PAA, from Mdm Yap’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">126 </span>I will hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"><br/>ge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Soo Chih, Nicholas Roshan Rai and Koh Shin-E Mandy (Ho Wong Law Practice LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Yap Jie Han and Seah Yan De Bryan (Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
