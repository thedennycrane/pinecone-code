<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This interlocutory appeal raised a procedural
                    issue arising from a dispute concerning the completion of the sale and purchase
                    of shares, owned by the Appellant in the 1<sup>st</sup>

                    27 April 2009, by consent of the parties (“the Consent
                    Order”), that the “2<sup>nd</sup> [Respondent]

                    [Respondent] at [a] fair value” to be determined by an independent
                    valuer, whose valuation report (“Valuation Report”) setting out
                    the fair value of the Appellant’s shares in the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Respondent would be final and binding on all
                        parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The valuer, Stone Forest Corporate Advisory Pte
                    Ltd (“Valuer”) was appointed on 27 May 2009. The Consent
                    Order prescribed that the completion of the sale and purchase of the
                    Appellant’s shares was to take place within three weeks after the Valuer
                    had furnished its Valuation Report to the parties. The Valuation Report was
                    finally released on 8 December 2009. However, on 29 December 2009,
                    three weeks after the release of the Valuation Report, the sale and purchase of
                    the shares had still not taken place. This was despite the fact that the
                    solicitors for the 2<sup>nd</sup>,
                        3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>,
                        5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>,

                        10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>
                    Respondents (“Relevant Respondents”) had written to the
                    Appellant’s solicitors on 11 December 2009 and 22 December 2009
                    offering to tender a cashier’s order as payment for the shares and
                    requesting for completion of the sale and purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 30 December 2009, the Appellant’s
                    newly appointed solicitors wrote to the Relevant Respondents’ solicitors
                    requesting for more time to respond to the latter’s letter of
                    22 December 2009. The Relevant Respondents agreed to give the Appellant
                    more time and a fresh request was sent by the Relevant Respondents’
                    solicitors to the Appellant’s new solicitors requiring completion of the
                    sale and purchase of the shares by 5 January 2010. However, when
                    5 January 2010 arrived, the Appellant’s solicitors requested, once
                    again, for more time. Accordingly, the sale and purchase did not take place. On
                    7 January 2010, the Relevant Respondents applied by way of Summons
                    No 76 of 2010 (“Summons No 76”) for a direction that any
                    Assistant Registrar and/or the Registrar of the Supreme Court be authorised to
                    sign the share transfer forms on behalf of the Appellant so as to effect
                    completion of the sale and purchase of the shares as directed under the Consent
                    Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Summons No 76 was heard by a Judicial
                    Commissioner in the High Court (“the Judge”). In opposing the
                    Summons, the Appellant ran three arguments before the Judge:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The filing of Summons No 76 was
                        the wrong procedure to enforce the Consent Order. The Relevant Respondents
                        should have started the enforcement proceeding by way of a fresh originating
                        summons or writ and not by way of a summons under the existing suit (Suit
                        No 53 of 2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant could not accept the valuation of the shares set out in
                        the Valuation Report and was actively engaged with experts to commence legal
                        action to challenge the Valuation Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Relevant Respondents had improperly sought to
                        enforce the Consent Order pursuant to O 45 r 8 of the Rules of
                        Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of
                        Court”), which provided for the enforcement of Mandatory Orders,
                        injunctions and orders for the specific performance of contracts. That rule
                        did not apply to the enforcement of consent orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Judge made short shrift of these arguments.
                    With respect to (a), he felt that the authority cited by the Appellant’s
                    solicitors, <em>Indian Overseas Bank v Motorcycle Industries
                        (1973) Pte Ltd &amp; Ors</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 841
                        (“<em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>”)
                    ,stood for the uncontroversial principle that a consent order puts an end to
                    proceedings as it supersedes the original cause of action altogether. No further
                    steps could be taken in that action in pursuance of the original cause of
                    action. What was sought in Summons No 76, however, was performance or
                    enforcement of the Consent Order and <em>not</em> the
                    original cause of action. Therefore, the Judge did not think that the principles
                    enunciated in <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>
                    precluded the Relevant Respondents from filing Summons No 76. This argument
                    was, in his view, wholly unmeritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In connection with (b), the Judge noted that
                    there “(was) no obstacle to the [Appellant] challenging the [V]aluation
                    [R]eport in a separate legal action”. And finally, in regard to (c), he
                    was of the view that it could not be the case that a consent order could
                    “only be enforced under O 45 r 8 of the [Rules of Court] by a
                    further action and another court order”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Accordingly, the Judge allowed the Relevant
                    Respondents’ application in Summons No 76 and granted an order of
                    court in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_1"></a>(1)     Any Assistant Registrar and/or
                        Registrar of the Supreme Court may sign the share transfer forms to give
                        effect to the completion of the sale and purchase of the Appellant’s
                        shares in the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent as provided for
                        under the terms of the Consent Order; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_2"></a>(2)     The Appellant is to file a consent to entry of
                        satisfaction within three days of completion of the sale and purchase of the
                        Appellant’s shares in the 1st Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">This appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In this appeal, we were primarily concerned with
                    two questions: (a) whether the Relevant Respondents ought to have started a
                    fresh action to enforce the Consent Order; and (b) whether the Relevant
                    Respondents were entitled to relief under O 45 r 8 of the Rules of
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Relevant Respondents ought to have started a fresh action
                to enforce the Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler SC Gen Ed, LexisNexis 2009)
                        (“<em>Singapore Court Practice
                    2009</em>”), the author made the following commentary relating to
                    consent judgments and orders at para 42/1/6:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>42/1/6. Consent judgments and orders</em>. The
                        terms of a settlement agreement may be enforced by a separate action,
                        assuming the agreement has the status of a legally binding contract. (See
                            <em>Green v Rozen</em> [1955] 1 WLR 741;
                            <em>Deans Property v Land Estates Apartments</em>
                        [1994] 2 SLR 198; <em>Tong Lee Hwa v Chin Ah
                            Kwi</em> [1971] 2 MLJ 75.) …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, <em>the advantage of embodying the
                            terms of the settlement in a consent judgment or order is that it may be
                            automatically enforced in the event of non-compliance (as in the case of
                            any other judgment or order)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A consent judgment or order is meant to be the formal result and
                            expression of an agreement already arrived at between the parties to
                            proceedings embodied in an order of the court. The fact of its being so
                            expressed puts the parties in a different position from the position of
                            those who have simply entered into an ordinary agreement. It is, of
                            course, enforceable while it stands, and a party affected by it cannot,
                            if he conceives he is entitled to relief from its operation, simply wait
                            until it is sought to be enforced against him, and then raise by way of
                            defence the matters in respect of which he desires to be relieved. He
                            must, when once it has been completed, obey it, unless and until he can
                            get it set aside in proceedings duly constituted for the purpose.
                            [Wilding v Sanderson [1897] 2 Ch 534, at 543, per
                            Byrne J]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the above proposition of the law, which we
                    endorse, it would follow that the Relevant Respondents were entitled to initiate
                    execution proceedings, like Summons No 76, to enforce the Consent Order.
                    There was no necessity for the Relevant Respondents to institute a fresh action
                    to compel due compliance with the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As we saw it, there appeared to be some
                    misunderstanding on the part of the solicitors for the Appellant as to what was
                    decided in <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>, due
                    perhaps, in part, to a certain statement made by the court. In that case,
                    summary judgment was entered into against some of the respondents following a
                    compromise agreement between them and the appellant bank. In accordance with the
                    compromise agreement, the respondents would make an immediate payment to the
                    appellant bank of the sum of $300,000, with the remaining outstanding amount by
                    monthly instalments of $300,000. The appellant bank also agreed in the meantime
                    not to execute or take bankruptcy proceedings on the judgment against the
                    respondents. There was a breach of the compromise agreement. The appellant bank
                    took out a fresh action to enforce the compromise agreement. This Court, in
                    reliance on the following passage in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        England</em> Vol 37 (Butterworths, 4<sup>th</sup>
                    Ed) (“<em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                    England</em>”) at para 391:</p>

                        the agreement concluded on 9 March 1978 the bank’s remedy would
                        be to take action to enforce the agreement concluded on 9 March 1978
                        and not to execute the judgment which on our view of the law was rendered
                        otiose by the agreement concluded on 9 March 1978.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There were some aspects in this passage which
                    may require clarification. This related to the statement in the passage that the
                    summary judgment was rendered otiose by the compromise agreement. Factually the
                    summary judgment followed the compromise agreement. Presumably the parties
                    thought there was some usefulness in having a consent judgment notwithstanding
                    that under the compromise agreement the appellant agreed not to execute the
                    judgment so as to allow the respondents to pay up by instalments. We have
                    understood the statement that the summary judgment was rendered otiose by the
                    earlier compromise agreement to mean that obtaining the summary judgment would
                    not have served any purpose whatsoever. However, it seems to us that the
                    appellant bank, in obtaining the summary judgment, was not obtaining something
                    of completely no value. Admittedly under the compromise agreement the appellant
                    bank had agreed to withhold execution until full payment had been made. Should
                    the appellant bank had wanted to execute on the summary judgment when there was
                    no default on the part of the respondents, the appellant bank would be met by
                    the plea that the compromise agreement would estop the appellant bank from
                    proceeding with execution. However, if the respondents should be in breach of
                    their payment obligations under the compromise agreement (which breach was not
                    in dispute), the appellant bank could well be entitled to enforce and levy
                    execution on the summary judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We agreed that, following the passage from
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), once a suit was compromised
                    by a subsequent agreement (unless something different was set out therein), the
                    original cause of action would have ceased to exist. It would then be
                    substituted by the compromise agreement and, barring any express provision to
                    the contrary (see <em>The “Dilmun
                        Fulmar”</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 140 at [7]), either
                    party could only sue on the compromise agreement, if there was any
                    non-compliance of the latter. However, if the compromise agreement was
                    incorporated as a consent judgment or order of the court (as distinct from a
                    Tomlin order – see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> below), then
                    the party in whose favour such a judgment or order was made should be able to
                    enforce it. It should make no difference whether a judgment or order was made by
                    the court pursuant to a contested hearing or by consent of the parties. Its
                    effect or nature would and should not change on that account. There should be no
                    necessity to institute a fresh action to enforce the judgment or order, whether
                    it was obtained by consent or otherwise. In this regard, we would hasten to add
                    one rider. It does not necessarily follow that a party in whose favour a consent
                    judgment or order was given would be precluded from instituting a fresh action
                    to enforce the compromise agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the present case, the Consent Order made by
                    Woo Bih Li J incorporated <em>all</em> the terms of
                    the settlement within it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> There were no external
                    “terms” to be enforced by “a separate action”.
                    Accordingly, the Consent Order could have been enforced <em>automatically</em> in much the same way as a party could enforce any
                    other judgment or order of the court when there was
                non-compliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     At para 38 of the Appellant’s Case,
                    the Appellant advanced the following two-stage argument:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    As in [<em>IOB v Motorcycle
                                Industries</em>], it [was] immaterial that the parties’
                            agreement [was] in the form of a consent order of court, as the consent
                            order cannot stand independently from the parties’ settlement
                            agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    What the Relevant Respondents [had] sought to do
                            in [Summons No 76 was], effectively, to <em>enforce
                                the settlement agreement</em>, which gave rise to a new cause
                            of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In making this argument, it seemed to us that
                    the Appellant had perhaps, inadvertently, failed to note an essential difference
                    between the fact situation in the present case and that in <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>. The Consent Order in this case set
                    out the entire agreement of the parties. There was nothing external to the
                    Consent Order which the Relevant Respondents had sought to enforce. In contrast,
                    in <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>, the summary
                    judgment entered against the respondents did not set out all the terms of the
                    compromise agreement, either in the main body of the consent order itself or as
                    an annex thereto. This was evident from the court’s remark at [21] that
                    “any judgment that was entered should have had as a schedule attached to
                    it the agreement concluded [earlier]” Moreover, in view of the fact that
                    in <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>, the appellant bank
                    agreed under the compromise agreement not to levy execution while the
                    respondents were making payment by instalments, the appellant bank was not
                    entitled to enforce the summary judgment unless it could show a
                breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     By Summons No 76, the Relevant
                    Respondents were clearly seeking to enforce their rights under the Consent Order
                    and not under Suit 53 of 2008, which cause (consistent with the principle
                    enunciated in <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em> at 12]
                    above) had been merged with and superseded by the Consent Order. Indeed, the
                    Appellant had impliedly acknowledged this when he stated that “the Court
                    no longer had jurisdiction with respect to the original suit” (see
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> below). The Judge was therefore
                    correct in finding the Appellant’s submission to be unmeritorious because
                    “[w]hat is sought in this application by summons is the performance of
                    the Consent Order and not the original cause of action” (see the grounds
                    of decision of the Judge (“the GD”) at [2010] SGHC 66 at
                    [6]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tomlin Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We now turn to consider an aspect of argument
                    raised by the Appellant which concerned what is known as the Tomlin Order. This
                    point was set out in paras 36 – 38 of the Appellant’s Case as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36.    In <em>Chitty on Contracts Vol. 1</em>
                                (27<sup>th</sup> ed 1994) … it is stated at
                            paragraph 22-021 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“A compromise may by consent be made the subject of a judgment
                            or order of the court. A consent judgment will ordinarily extinguish by
                            merger the contract of compromise, but a consent order will not have
                            this effect. It does not itself constitute a contract, but it is
                            sufficient evidence of the contract of compromise on which it is based,
                            and such contract is no less a contract and subject to the incidents of
                            a contract because there is superadded the command of a judge. Where an
                            action has been commenced and a compromise has been reached on agreed
                            terms, the usual form of order sought by consent is a Tomlin order,
                            which provides that all further proceedings in the action be stayed,
                            except for the purpose of carrying such terms into effect, with liberty
                            to apply as to carrying such terms into effect …”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37.    The Court of Appeal should note that in this case
                            the Order of Court dated 27 April 2009 was arrived at by consent.
                            It states that the parties reached a full and final settlement of Suit
                            No. 53 of 2008/D against all the [Respondents] on a without admission
                            basis. It further states that the parties agreed to record the terms of
                            settlement. There was no adjudication by the Court of the claims in the
                            Suit. The said Order of Court is not a <em>Tomlin</em> order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38.    It is submitted that based on the reasoning in
                                <em>IOB [v Motorcycle Industries]</em> …
                            upon the parties entering into the settlement agreement, <em>the terms of which are set out in the Order of Court dated
                                27 April 2009</em>, the original cause/s of action in
                            Suit No. 53 of 2008D were compromised and superseded by the
                            parties’ agreement. <em>The court no longer had
                                jurisdiction with respect to the original

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It was not entirely clear to us what the
                    Appellant’s counsel’s point was in stating that the Consent Order
                    was not a Tomlin Order. Indeed, it could not be argued that the Consent Order
                    was a Tomlin Order and the Relevant Respondents had not suggested that. A Tomlin
                    Order is a court order in the English civil justice system under which a court
                    action is stayed, on terms which have been agreed in advance between the parties
                    and which are included in a schedule to the order. It is a form of consent
                    order, and permits either party to apply to court to enforce the terms of the
                    order, avoiding the need to start fresh proceedings. The order is named after
                    the English High Court judge Mr Justice Tomlin (as he then was) from his ruling
                    in <em>Dashwood v Dashwood</em> [1927] WN 276,
                    delivered on 1 November 1927, that such an order kept the proceedings alive
                    only to the extent necessary to enable a party to enforce the terms of the
                    settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     
          <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> offers the following commentary on Tomlin Orders at
                    para 42/1/6:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The standard ‘Tomlin’ order is in the following form:
                        ‘And the plaintiff and the defendant having agreed to the terms set
                        forth in the schedule hereto, it is ordered that all further proceedings be
                        stayed except for the purpose of carrying such terms into effect.’
                        <em>The ‘Tomlin’ order is not a consent judgment
                            because it does not actually order the parties to carry out the terms of
                            the settlement</em>. In fact, the judge is not really concerned
                        about approving or disapproving the terms of the settlement in these
                        circumstances …
                        <em>What the order does is to impose a stay of further
                            proceedings which is operative as long as the terms in the schedule are
                            observed. If any breach is committed, the other party may apply to the
                            court pursuant to the qualification in the order: ‘except for the
                            purpose of carrying such terms into effect’. The court may then
                            make the appropriate order requiring the party in breach to comply with
                            the terms of the agreement</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It was obvious that the Consent Order was not
                    a Tomlin Order. It did not contain the essential characteristic of that order.
                    The position here was that the terms of the settlement between the Appellant and
                    the Relevant Respondents were in fact <em>incorporated</em>
                    into the Consent Order, unlike what is usually countenanced under a Tomlin Order
                    (or, for that matter, what had been the case in <em>IOB v
                        Motorcycle Industries</em>, as per M Karthigesu J (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)) – a separate schedule
                    to the order, furnishing the precise terms that parties have agreed to. As
                    stated at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above, the present Consent
                    Order did not countenance any external “terms” listed in a
                    schedule annexed to it to be enforced by applying to the judge who recorded the
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Here, the Relevant Respondents were not only
                    in agreement with the Appellant that the Consent Order was not a Tomlin Order,
                    they also agreed that the original cause which they had against the Appellant in
                    Suit No 56 of 2008 had been extinguished and merged into the compromise
                    agreement and, consequently, the Consent Order. While a Tomlin Order
                    “does not actually order the parties to carry out the terms of the
                    settlement”, the present Consent Order, by its very terms, set out what
                    needed to be done by the parties- the sale of the shares by the Appellant and
                    the purchase by the Relevant Respondent. There was no necessity for the Relevant
                    Respondents, in the face of the Appellant’s persistent non-compliance with
                    the Consent Order, to initiate any fresh proceedings to compel the Appellant to
                    comply with the Consent Order. The Consent Order was <em>automatically enforceable</em> in the same way as any other judgment
                    or order of the court may be enforced. In this regard, the Relevant Respondents
                    appeared correct to say that “the Consent Order is better than a Tomlin
                    Order as it specifically orders the parties to carry out the terms of the
                    settlement contained therein”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Judgment or Order: Any real distinction?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Next, we wish to make some observations on the
                    distinction between a “judgment” and an “order” and
                    in turn a “consent judgment” and a “consent order”.
                    At <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, the Appellant was quoted as
                    arguing the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Chitty on Contracts
                            Vol. 1</em> (27<sup>th</sup> ed 1994)
                        … it is stated at paragraph 22-021 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“A compromise may by consent be made the subject of a judgment
                            of order of the court. A <em>consent judgment</em>
                            will ordinarily extinguish by merger the contract of compromise, but a
                                <em>consent order</em> will not have this
                            effect. It does not itself constitute a contract …”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     From Singapore case law, the distinction
                    between these two phrases does not appear to be clear or even useful. Indeed, in
                    the case of <em>Diversey (Far East) Pte Ltd v Chai Chung Ching
                        Chester and others</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 412, the Court of
                    Appeal did not appear to mind adopting the terminology of a “consent
                    judgment order”. In some cases the court seemed to suggest that there
                    would first be an order, and if that was not complied with, a judgment would be
                    extracted. As an illustration of this perception we would refer to the recent
                    case of <em>Nim Minimaart (a firm) v Management Corporation
                        Strata Title Plan No 1079</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1 where the High
                    Court said at [8]-[9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8 <em>After the Consent Order was recorded, the defendants
                            wrote to inform the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts that the
                            plaintiff had breached the terms of the settlement and sought leave to
                            extract the judgment ("the Judgment")</em>. The draft Judgment was
                        sent to the plaintiff for approval. However, it was not approved because the
                        plaintiff disputed the contents of the draft. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9 By this time, the defendants were already aware that the plaintiff had
                        applied to set aside the Consent Order and that the application was pending
                        to be heard. Despite the pending application and the objections from the
                        plaintiff, the defendants wrote to the Subordinate Courts on 6 May 2009
                        to extract the Judgment as drafted. <em>The plaintiff then
                            applied to set aside the Judgment on the ground that it was irregularly
                            extracted. This is a separate and distinct matter from the application
                            to set aside the Consent Order</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It seems to us that there is, in substance and
                    even in form, no real difference between an “order” or a
                    “judgment”. In terms of legal consequences, they are effectively
                    the same. Each represents the ruling of the court in the matter in dispute. It
                    would appear that in practice, a ruling of the court in a writ action would
                    ordinarily be regarded as giving rise to a judgment. In all other cases, it
                    would give rise to an order of court. But this is hardly a matter of principle;
                    more a matter of preference. The two terms could, indeed, be used
                    interchangeably and are often so used. At this juncture, it would be pertinent
                    to refer to <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) where the author states at para 42/5/4:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Equally pertinent is the instructive passage
                    from the 2009 edition of the <em>Singapore Court
                        Practice</em> (quoted at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    above) where the two terms are treated as being akin. For convenience, we set
                    out the passage again:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42/1/6. <em>Consent judgments and orders</em>. The
                        terms of a settlement agreement may be enforced by a separate action,
                        assuming the agreement has the status of a legally binding contract. (See
                            <em>Green v Rozen</em> [1955] 1 WLR 741;
                            <em>Deans Property v Land Estates Apartments</em>

                            Kwi</em> [1971] 2 MLJ 75.) …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, <em>the advantage of embodying the
                            terms of the settlement in a consent judgment or order is that it may be
                            automatically enforced in the event of non-compliance (as in the case of
                            any other judgment or order)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>A consent judgment or order is meant to be the

                                court. The fact of its being so expressed puts the parties in a
                                different position from the position of those who have simply
                                entered into an ordinary agreement. It is, of course, enforceable

                            conceives he is entitled to relief from its operation, simply wait until
                            it is sought to be enforced against him, and then raise by way of
                            defence the matters in respect of which he desires to be relieved. He
                            must, when once it has been completed, obey it, unless and until he can
                            get it set aside in proceedings duly constituted for the purpose.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     To recap, whether one uses the term
                    “judgment” or “order”, both signify a ruling or
                    determination of the court in the matter in dispute. And for the reasons alluded
                    to in <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above, the character and legal
                    effect of a judgment or order is the same and it should make no difference
                    whether a judgment or order was obtained from the court after a contested
                    hearing or by consent of the parties. The essential pre-requisite is that the
                    “judgment” or “order” must be made by the court. The
                    basis upon which the court made the judgment or order cannot alter its
                    characteristics or legal effect. At this juncture, we would again refer to
                        <em>Chitty on Contract Vol </em>1 (London: Sweet
                    and Maxell, 27<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1994) at para 22-021, which
                    is quoted at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above, and where the
                    author states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A compromise may by consent be made the subject of a judgment or order of
                        the court. A consent judgment will ordinarily extinguish by merger the
                        contract of compromise, but a consent order will not have this
                        effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To the extent that this statement would seem to suggest that there is
                    a real substantive difference between a “judgment” and an
                    “order”, we would like to record our reservations. However, we
                    note that in the later part of this passage (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above for the full quotation) there is a reference to the
                    Tomlin order. If the statement “a consent order will not have this
                    effect” is referring only to a Tomlin order, then we do not
                demur.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Relevant Respondents were entitled to relief under
                O 45 r 8 of the Rules of Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     To better appreciate the scope and effect of
                    O 45 r 8 of the Rules of Court, we shall first set out its
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Court may order act to be done at expense of
                            disobedient party</em> (O. 45, r. 8)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8. If a Mandatory Order, an <em>injunction</em> or a
                            <em>judgment</em> or <em>order for
                            the specific performance of a contract</em> is not complied with,
                        then, without prejudice to its powers under section 14 of the Supreme Court
                        of Judicature Act (Chapter 322), where applicable, and its powers to
                        punish the disobedient party for contempt, the Court may direct that the act
                        required to be done may, so far as practicable, be done by the party by whom
                        the order or judgment was obtained or some other person appointed by the
                        Court, at the cost of the disobedient party, and upon the act being done the
                        expenses incurred may be ascertained in such manner as the Court may direct
                        and execution may issue against the disobedient party for the amount so
                        ascertained and for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Appellant argued that O 45 r 8
                    was not applicable to the present case because the Consent Order was not a
                    Mandatory Order, an injunction or a judgment/order for the specific performance
                    of a contract. Specifically, the Appellant contended that O 45 r 8
                    applied only where <em>equitable relief</em> had been
                    granted by way of (a) a Mandatory Order or (b) an injunction or (c) a judgment
                    or order for specific performance. Since “the stringent tests which the
                    Court requires to be satisfied before it grants such equitable relief were never
                    met [here]”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> the Appellant submitted that
                    the Judge was wrong to have made the order which he did under O 45 r 8
                    to assist the Relevant Respondents in enforcing the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In order to understand what is it that
                    O 45 r 8 seeks to provide, one must consider the rule as a whole. It
                    bears noting that it refers to s 14 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Edn), which provides that where there is a judgment
                    or order for the execution of a deed, or the signing of a document, or the
                    endorsement of a negotiable instrument, and the party required to do the act is
                    absent, or neglects or refuses to do so, an interested party is entitled to
                    carry out that act by tendering the document or instrument to the court for
                    execution. It also states that the rule is without prejudice to s 14. It
                    seems clear to us that the thrust of the rule is really to reiterate and
                    reinforce what is provided in s 14 and, in particular, to confer upon the
                    court the power to require the defaulting party to bear whatever expenses that
                    may be incurred arising from the court authorising the interested party or a
                    third party to execute the act on behalf of the defaulting party. It is a
                    facilitative provision and should be construed accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The primary issue before the court here was,
                    therefore, this: was the Consent Order a “Mandatory Order” or an
                    “injunction” or a “judgment or order for the specific
                    performance of a contract” (hereinafter referred to as the first, second
                    and third limbs of O 45 r 8 respectively). As mentioned in <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above, the Consent Order effectively
                    encapsulated the settlement agreement between the parties. Paragraph 4 of
                    the Consent Order specifically provided that the Relevant Respondents were to
                    purchase and the Appellant to sell the shares within three weeks after the
                    Valuation Report had been furnished to them. The Consent Order was clearly an
                    order requiring the <em>specific performance</em> of the
                    settlement agreement or <em>contract</em> between the
                    Appellant and the Relevant Respondents within the specified timeframe. However,
                    we would agree with the Appellant that the term “Mandatory Order”
                    (which <em>is</em> set out in the rule in capital letters)
                    should be confined to what was previously known as the Order of Mandamus (indeed
                    the footnote to that term has expressly so provided), which is now under the
                    Rules of Court known as a “Mandatory Order” – see Order 53
                    of the Rules of Court. No Mandatory Order may be granted unless leave of court
                    is first applied for and obtained. Since it was not in dispute that before the
                    Consent Order was granted, no leave of court was first obtained, the Consent
                    Order could not therefore be a Mandatory Order within the first limb of
                    O 45 r 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Next, we will consider the second and the
                    third limbs together. It is trite law that an injunction could be in either the
                    mandatory or prohibitive terms. Most often injunctions are used to prohibit the
                    infringement of a negative stipulation under a contract. But an injunction could
                    also be granted to enforce positive contractual obligations. In <em>Injunctions and Similar Orders</em> by L A Sheridan
                    (Barry Rose Law Publishers Ltd, 1999) at p 430, the author states the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mandatory injunctions are granted to enforce positive contractual
                        obligations when no other suitable remedy is available. For example, a
                        mandatory injunction may enforce a contract between A and B that A will
                        transfer a sum of money to C to hold on trust for A and B or a contract for
                        the supply of goods, not being a contract of which the court would grant
                        specific performance, where the failure to supply them would put the
                        plaintiff out of business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     However, in the context of the Consent Order
                    we would be hesitant to say that it constituted a mandatory injunction. It was
                    more in the nature of the third limb, “a judgment or order for the
                    specific performance of a contract”. Quite clearly the settlement
                    agreement evidenced a contract for the sale of the shares from the Appellant to
                    the Relevant Respondents. In pursuance thereof, the Consent Order, and
                    particularly paragraph 4 thereof, required the Relevant Respondents to
                    purchase and the Appellant to sell the shares. The Appellant had refused to
                    comply with this order to complete the transaction notwithstanding
                    reminders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the circumstances, we held that the Judge
                    was well entitled to make the order authorising the Registrar or an Assistant
                    Registrar to execute the share transfer form on behalf of the Appellant. The
                    only authority cited by the Appellant to oppose the grant of the relief under
                    O 45 r 8 was <em>PJ Holdings Inc v Ariel Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 582 (“<em>PJ
                        Holdings</em>”), a case of the High Court which made an
                    entirely separate point that committal proceedings were a measure of last
                    resort, and that where a party had obtained an order for specific performance,
                    it ought to resort to alternative methods of securing compliance instead of
                    immediately taking out proceedings for committal. There is nothing in <em>PJ Holdings</em> which could help advance the
                    Appellant’s interpretation of O 45 r 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Before we conclude our consideration of
                    O 45 r 8, we would note in passing that the Appellant, the Relevant
                    Respondents and the Judge appear to have been involved in some semantic
                    fisticuffs over the interpretation of a particular aspect of the opening phrase
                    of O 45 r 8, <em>viz</em>, “If a Mandatory
                    Order, an injunction or a judgment or order for the specific performance of a
                    contract is not complied with …”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. There was disagreement as to whether
                    O 45 r 8 applied to <em>judgments</em> per se (a
                    disjunctive reading of the final “or”, preferred by the Relevant
                    Respondents and the Judge), or only to judgments for specific performance (a
                    conjunctive reading of that same “or”, preferred by the
                    Appellant).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In light of our foregoing discussion at
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>-<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>, however, little turned in this case on this particular
                    point. The Consent Order, as we have seen, could be viewed as either a mandatory
                    injunction or (more likely) as an order requiring the specific performance of a
                    contract, thereby bringing it squarely within the purview of O 45 r 8.
                    However, we agreed with the Appellant’s interpretation of that rule.
                    Throughout the rest of O 45, the words “judgment or order”
                    are used together in a conjunctive fashion. The wording of the disputed phrase
                    and the placement of commas also point towards a conjunctive reading. Most
                    persuasively, if the word “judgments” was to be read as a
                    disjunctive standalone, its generality would render the remaining three
                    categories countenanced by O 45 r 8 redundantly specific. Moreover, as
                    we have pointed out earlier, the words “judgment” and
                    “order”
                    <em>do</em> really mean the same thing and are being used
                    interchangeably. It will make no sense to give the word “judgment”
                    a standalone meaning and yet, for the word “order”, a
                    qualification by the phrase “for the specific performance of a
                    contract”. In any event, the resolution of this point in the
                    Appellant’s favour would not have aided the Appellant in any way
                    whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Finally, due to various administrative
                    reasons, the parties have agreed that paragraph 2 of the Order of Court
                    dated 26 January 2010 (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above)
                    should be set aside. In the light of this concession by the Respondents, this
                    appeal was allowed partially in that paragraph 2 of the said Order of Court
                    was set aside. The rest of the Order of Court was to stand. In the premises, we
                    ordered that the parties were to bear their own costs of this appeal, and that
                    the costs order made by the court below was to remain.</p>
