The High Court thus convicted him on an amended lesser charge of attempting to import the said diamorphine believing it to be a controlled drug under Class ‘C’ instead, which was a non-capital charge. Gobi was thus sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane.

</div> Notably, in its Oral Judgment, the Court of Appeal considered the Prosecution’s case in respect of Gobi’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs. In particular, the Court of Appeal noted that the Prosecution might have formulated its case on the premise that actual knowledge and wilful blindness were not distinct concepts.

</div> As such, while the Prosecution’s case at trial was one of wilful blindness to the nature of the drugs, in contrast, its case on appeal was one of actual knowledge, premised on the contention that Gobi did not in fact believe the assurances he had been given as to the nature of the drugs. This led the Court of Appeal to make the observation (at para 20 of the Minute Sheet in CM 3):

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Hui’s 1st Affidavit at para 10.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The DT found that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 1st Charge for making the Interview Statements, which were false and/or misleading allegations intended to convey to listeners of the interview and/or readers of TOC Asia that the PP and/or AG had acted in bad faith, maliciously and/or improperly so as to discredit the AGC and/or its legal officers in the eyes of the public, thereby committing an act amounting to misconduct under s 83(2)(h) of the LPA, had not been made out. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 2nd to 4th Charges, for making baseless accusations of misconduct and/or threatening to commence legal proceedings against fellow legal practitioners and the Law Society in his First Facebook Post and Second Facebook Post, were made out. The first defendant was to pay a total penalty of $6,000 and costs of $3,000 (including disbursements).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On appeal, the AG submitted that the DT had erred in finding that the 1st Charge was not made out. The AG argued that the Interview Statements meant and were intended to imply that the Prosecution had acted in bad faith, maliciously and/or improperly. The AG further submitted that the Interview Statements could not constitute fair criticism as there was no reasonable or rational basis for the Interview Statements and they were not made in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The AG’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As a preliminary point, the AG submitted that the present OS was not filed out of time. Notwithstanding the plain wording of s 97(1) of the LPA, the AG pointed to the Court of Appeal’s clarifications in the case of <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2021] 1 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span>”) that in general, the Council of the Law Society (the “Council”) considers and decides what it will do in response to the DT’s determination, and s 97 of the LPA is triggered after the Council has made its decision under s 94 and advised the parties under s 94(4) of whether it agrees with the DT’s determination (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>at [33]). As the AG received the Council’s decision on the DT’s determination on 4 January 2022 and brought this application on 18 January 2022, the application was brought within time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The AG submitted that the DT had erred in finding that the 1st Charge was not made out. The Interview Statements meant that the Prosecution acted in bad faith, maliciously and/or improperly. The AG pointed out that an ordinary reasonable listener of the interview would not have known of the observations made by the Court of Appeal in the Review Judgment and would not have understood the meanings of the Interview Statements in that context. The first defendant gave evidence that the interview was given immediately after the Court of Appeal delivered its Oral Judgment, when the full Review Judgment had not yet been seen or collected by the first defendant. It was thus inexplicable for the DT to assume that the general public, who did not have access to the Oral Judgment or Review Judgment at the time of the interview, would have known of the observations made by the Court of Appeal in the Review Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Furthermore, the insinuation of the words “<span class="font-italic">overzealous</span>” and “<span class="font-italic">troubling</span>” in the Interview Statements was that the Prosecution was so eager to secure Gobi’s conviction on the capital charge to the point that it unjustifiably and insidiously changed its case against Gobi to achieve that objective. This invariably leads to an inference that there was misconduct on the part of the Prosecution, to the extent of bad faith or malice, in its prosecution of Gobi. This severity was also emphasised by the first defendant when he claimed that even the Court of Appeal had “<span class="font-italic">called into question</span> […] <span class="font-italic">the fairness of the Prosecution”</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In addition, the first defendant had <span class="font-italic">intended</span> to imply through the Interview Statements that the Prosecution had acted in bad faith, maliciously and/or improperly. The AG argued that the contemporaneous evidence at the material time of the interview should be taken into account in determining the first defendant’s intention. Such contemporaneous evidence includes the first defendant’s response to AGC’s Letter. In particular, the first defendant did not dispute or deny the meaning attributed to the Interview Statements, but confirmed the implication that the Prosecution had acted in bad faith by posting a statement stating that “<span class="font-italic">government lawyers</span>” who “<span class="font-italic">handled Gobi’s case are the wrongdoers</span>”. The first defendant also wrote a Response Letter, in which he did not dispute or deny the meanings attributed to the Interview Statements but only denied that he knew or must have known that these allegations were false. He then posted his Response Letter on Facebook. The AG submitted that the first defendant’s collective actions of making the Interview Statements, posting AGC’s Letter in the Facebook post and stating that the “<span class="font-italic">government lawyers</span>” were “<span class="font-italic">wrongdoers</span>” confirmed that the first defendant had intended to imply and did imply that the Prosecution had acted in bad faith, maliciously and/or improperly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Lastly, the Interview Statements could not constitute fair criticism as there was no rational and cogent basis for making the Statements and the Statements were not made in good faith. There was reasonable justification for the change in the Prosecution’s case on appeal as the line between wilful blindness and actual knowledge had not been clearly drawn before <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>. Furthermore, the first defendant had made the Statements in bad faith as he omitted to mention that the Court of Appeal had expressly pointed out that it was understandable for the Prosecution to have thought that it could run a case of actual knowledge on appeal even if the trial had been substantively founded on wilful blindness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first defendant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As a preliminary point, the first defendant submitted that the AGC was out of time to make the application pursuant to s 97(1) of the LPA. The plain wording of s 97(1) of the LPA clearly requires the person who made the complaint to make the application within 14 days of being notified of the determination of the DT. In the present case, the Law Society notified the AGC of the DT’s determination on 22 December 2021, but the AGC only filed the present OS on 18 January 2022, almost one month after the notification, without good reason for the delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The first defendant submitted that the AGC had not established the elements of the 1st Charge beyond reasonable doubt. Firstly, the first defendant submitted that the word “<span class="font-italic">overzealous</span>” in the First Interview Statement was with reference to the change in the Prosecution’s case in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (CA)</span> and therefore was not false or misleading. Secondly, the Second Interview Statement was a factual observation that was not false or misleading. The word “<span class="font-italic">troubling</span>” only bore the ordinary meaning of “<span class="font-italic">causing stress or anxiety”, </span>which was natural in a case such as Gobi’s where his life was at stake. Thirdly, the Third Interview Statement was an accurate factual observation save for the opinion that the fairness of the Prosecution was called into question by the Court of Appeal, which was based on the Court of Appeal’s observation at [120] of the Review Judgment. Furthermore, there was no insinuation in the Interview Statements that the Prosecution had changed its case arbitrarily or for an ulterior purpose, or because it was biased against Gobi.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In addition, the first defendant was entitled to the defence of fair criticism in respect of the Interview Statements. The Court of Appeal itself had observed that the Prosecution’s change in case had prejudiced Gobi, as the case was never put squarely to him at trial. The first defendant therefore had a rational basis to establish the defence of fair criticism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Furthermore, the Interview Statements did not impute any bad faith, malice and/or impropriety on the Prosecution. When the first defendant gave the Interview Statements and uploaded his Facebook Post, he was simply reflecting on what the Court of Appeal had itself said in the Oral Judgment on the Prosecution’s conduct that was prejudicial to Gobi. This was also alluded to by the Court of Appeal in the Review Judgment, where it referred to its comments in the case of <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin Hamad v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1119 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”). As a matter of chronology, the first defendant gave the TOC Asia interview right outside the Supreme Court on the same day and immediately after the Supreme Court had summarised its Review Judgment. As such, he mainly had in mind the Court of Appeal’s own observations of the prejudice caused to Gobi.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues for determination </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The preliminary issue to consider was whether the AG was out of time to make this application pursuant to s 97(1) of the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The key issue for consideration in the substantive OS was whether the Law Society’s DT had erred in finding that the 1st Charge against the first defendant was not made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the AG was out of time for bringing a review application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I was of the view that the AG was not out of time for bringing the application in this OS to review the decision of the DT. Section 97(1) of the LPA states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for review of Disciplinary Tribunal’s decision </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">97.—(1)  Where a Disciplinary Tribunal has made a determination under section 93(1)(a) or (b), the person who made the complaint, the regulated legal practitioner or the Council may, within 14 days of being notified of that determination or any order under section 93(2) or (2A), apply to a Judge for a review of that determination or order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In the present case, the Law Society notified the AGC of the DT’s determination on 22 December 2021.

</div> The AG then filed the present OS on 18 January 2022, almost one month after the Law Society’s notification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, I noted that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span> had stated that (at [33]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where the recommendation of the Disciplinary Tribunal goes to the Council, the Council’s decision in respect of that determination may be challenged before a Judge under s 95. <span class="font-weight-bold">However, s 97 seems to provide an avenue of recourse even before the Council has come to a determination</span>. To make sense of this, it is necessary to return to the logic underlying the architecture of these provisions, which is that in general, the <span class="font-italic">Council</span> considers and decides what it will do in response to the Disciplinary Tribunal’s determination, though in certain limited circumstances, the Council must adhere to the determination: see, for instance, s 94(1). <span class="font-weight-bold">We have also noted that as far as the complainant is concerned, the complainant’s only recourse against a determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal is under s 97.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">That will be triggered after the Council has made </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">its</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> decision under s 94 and advised the parties under s 94(4).</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 While a complainant has the avenue of recourse even before the Council has come to a determination, it was also pointed out in the case of <span class="font-italic">Loh Der Ming Andrew v Koh Tien Hua</span> [2021] 2 SLR 1013 (“<span class="font-italic">Andrew Loh”</span>) that (at [31]):<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In practical terms, while the complainant or regulated legal practitioner would be well advised to await the decision of the Council, and would, as we anticipated in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Iskandar</span> at [33], typically do so, there is no strict impediment to their making a s 97 application once the Council has conveyed the DT’s determination to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As such, even though the time for bringing an application under s 97(1) has expired, in line with the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>and <span class="font-italic">Andrew Loh</span>, there is no impediment to the AG making a s 97 application after the Council had conveyed its decision on the DT’s determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Neither statute nor case law provides explicit guidance on the timeline before which the complainant may apply to review the DT’s decision upon receipt of the Council’s decision.

The statements were supported by a rational basis – that the Prosecution’s advancement of a different case on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (CA)</span>, premised on actual knowledge of the drugs instead of wilful blindness as put forward at trial in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (HC)</span>, <span class="font-italic">did</span> cause prejudice to Gobi. This was specifically highlighted by the Court of Appeal in both its Oral Judgment and subsequent written grounds in the Review Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did the first defendant imply that the Prosecution had acted in bad faith, maliciously or improperly? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In ascertaining the meaning of the Interview Statements, regard must be had to how an ordinary reasonable listener of the Interview Statements would understand the statements in the context in which they were made (<span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Chia Ti Lik alias Xie Zhili </span>[2011] SGDT 4 at [53]–[59] and <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd and anor v Lee Hsien Loong</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2010] 1 SLR 52<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [27]–[29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the First Interview Statement, the first defendant opined that the PP had been “<span class="font-italic">overzealous</span>” in the prosecution of Gobi, leading to the imposition of the death sentence on him. The AG submitted that the use of the word “<span class="font-italic">overzealous</span>” may carry the insinuation that the Prosecution was overly enthusiastic or too eager to secure Gobi’s conviction on a capital charge. I agreed that there appeared to be some suggestion, albeit not in explicit words, that the word “<span class="font-italic">overzealous</span>” could, on one interpretation, mean that the Prosecution was endeavouring to ensure that Gobi did not escape the death penalty. Nevertheless, I did not think that the first defendant’s characterisation had crossed the line to imply that the Prosecution had sought to achieve this at all costs or through any means. Suggesting that the Prosecution had tried its utmost to secure a conviction also did not equate to a suggestion that the Prosecution had acted improperly in its conduct of Gobi’s case on appeal when it changed its case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the Second Interview Statement, I was unable to see any issue with the first defendant’s usage of the word “<span class="font-italic">troubling</span>”, as there was some factual basis to this sentiment. The Court of Appeal did find that the Prosecution had advanced a different case against Gobi at trial as compared to what was put forward on appeal, and had expressed its concern in no uncertain terms that the fact that Gobi was never squarely confronted with the case of wilful blindness ultimately resulted in prejudice to Gobi (Review Judgment<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [120]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As for the first defendant’s Second and Third Interview Statements pertaining to whether the Prosecution had acted fairly in Gobi’s case and having its conduct “<span class="font-italic">called into question by the Court itself</span>”, these comments again may be understood as suggesting that the Prosecution had acted improperly in failing to conduct its case fairly. The Third Interview Statement could suggest that there was grave alleged impropriety on the part of the Prosecution, since the Court of Appeal had “<span class="font-italic">called into question</span>” “<span class="font-italic">the fairness of the Prosecution</span>”. That said, in view of the Court of Appeal’s remarks in its Oral Judgment that the change in the Prosecution’s case was “ultimately prejudicial to [Gobi]”,

Statements or events which emerged <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> to the making of the Interview Statements may well be connected to the Interview Statements, but I was unable to see how they are relevant in determining how an ordinary reasonable person would have understood the Interview Statements <span class="font-italic">at the time that</span><span class="font-italic"> they were made</span>. Equally, even if the evidence of subsequent statements or events in the days after may be said to shed some light on the first defendant’s intent <span class="font-italic">at the time of making the</span><span class="font-italic"> statements</span>, such evidence would, at best, only serve as a form of secondary (and weak) corroboration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I noted that the first defendant’s Facebook Post was also separately the subject of the 2nd Charge, which the DT found to have been made out. In my view, the evidence that formed the basis for the 2nd Charge, including AGC’s Letter which gave rise to the first defendant’s first Facebook Post, should not be readily conflated with the evidence that formed the context of the Interview Statements.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Taking the entirety of the Interview Statements in their context (as defined at [37] above), I was not persuaded that the first defendant had sought to imply or insinuate that the Prosecution had acted with malice, in bad faith or improperly in its conduct of the matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Interview Statements constituted fair criticism</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The DT considered that whether or not the first defendant was guilty of misconduct “depends ultimately on whether the Interview Statements constitute fair criticism which [the first defendant] is entitled to rely upon in his defence”.

</div>
</div> The concept of fair criticism was considered by the Court of Appeal in the context of contempt of court proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake Alan v Attorney-General</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2011] 3 SLR 778, where the Court of Appeal specified the following non-exhaustive factors to be considered (at [81] and [139]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The criticism must be made in good faith and must also be respectful. In determining good faith, the court is entitled to consider the rationale and basis for the criticism. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The manner in which the criticism is made. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The extent to which the criticism is supported by a cogent rational basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In addition, any such rational basis must have been accurately stated (<span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Au Wai Pang </span>[2015] 2 SLR 352 at [42]). It was also not necessary to establish an unassailable basis for the criticism made, as the court was not required or concerned to determine whether the criticism was proved or disproved as a fact (<span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v </span><span class="font-italic">Shadrake Alan </span>[2011] 2 SLR 445 at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my view, the DT was correct in finding that the Interview Statements constituted fair criticism, as the first defendant had a rational basis for making the statements. The first defendant had made the Interview Statements in a live interview with TOC Asia immediately after the Court of Appeal delivered its Oral Judgment. The relevant enquiry as to whether the first defendant had any cogent rational basis in making his Interview Statements should thus be directed at the contents of the Oral Judgment. Pertinently, in the Oral Judgment, the Court of Appeal observed that the change in the Prosecution’s case was “ultimately prejudicial to the Applicant [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Gobi]”.

</div>
</div> Nevertheless, it was understandable that the first defendant, in referring to the Court of Appeal’s unambiguous observation in its Oral Judgment of the change in the Prosecution’s case and the prejudice caused to Gobi, had stated that the “fairness of the Prosecution” was “called into question by the Court itself”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The prejudicial effect of the Prosecution’s change in its case on appeal was further elucidated in the Review Judgment. The Court of Appeal pointed to the case of <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>, which “alluded to the importance of the Prosecution running a consistent case” to “give the accused a fair chance of knowing the case that is advanced against him” (Review Judgment<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [119]). This reasoning was clearly mirrored in the Oral Judgment. The Court of Appeal had clearly accepted that the Prosecution’s failure to run a consistent case at trial and on appeal was unfair to Gobi since “he was never squarely confronted [at trial] with the case that he did not in fact believe what he had been told by Vinod and Jega, and so he could not have responded to such a case”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Taking into account both the Oral Judgment and Review Judgment, I accepted that there was reasonable justification for the manner in which the Prosecution’s case was run on appeal. However, whether Gobi was prejudiced by the Prosecution’s approach on appeal and whether the Prosecution’s approach may have been justifiable were separate and distinct considerations that should not be conflated. In the Review Judgment, the Court of Appeal reiterated that it was “understandable” that without the benefit of the guidance subsequently set out in<span class="font-italic"> Adili</span>, in formulating the case at the time of trial, the DPP “might thus have operated on the premise that actual knowledge and wilful blindness were not distinct concepts” (Review Judgment at [110] and [113]). However, in my view, the first defendant’s Interview Statements hinged on the Court of Appeal having specifically highlighted two matters in the Oral Judgment: first, the Prosecution’s change in its stance on appeal, and second, the resulting prejudice to Gobi. The former was an objective fact. The latter was also factual in that the Court of Appeal had expressly articulated its concern that prejudice <span class="font-italic">was</span> caused to Gobi by the Prosecution’s change in stance, and this was so irrespective of whether the Prosecution had reasonable justification for how it ran its case on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I was thus of the view that the first defendant’s Interview Statements were premised on the rational basis that the Prosecution’s approach on appeal had caused prejudice to<span class="font-italic"> </span>Gobi. As such, the first defendant did not make the Interview Statements with intent to impute malice, bad faith or impropriety to the AGC. To the extent that the Interview Statements had suggested unfairness in the Prosecution’s approach on appeal, this also did not necessarily imply that the AG had acted improperly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Given the Court of Appeal’s unequivocal observations in the Oral Judgment on how the change in the Prosecution’s case on appeal was “ultimately prejudicial” to Gobi, I accepted that the first defendant had a rational basis for making the Interview Statements and his statements thus constituted fair criticism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, I agreed with the DT that the 1st Charge was not made out. The OS was therefore dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On the issue of costs, the AG submitted that no costs should be ordered. The AG had filed the OS under s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA, in his role as guardian of the public interest. Adopting the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Top Ten Entertainment </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1279 (at [24]), costs should ordinarily not be ordered against unsuccessful public bodies performing regulatory functions. The first defendant submitted that a distinction should be drawn between situations where the public body performing regulatory functions is the complainant and where it is the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I agreed with the AG and considered that the AG’s decision to bring the OS was made honestly and reasonably. In any event, there was no suggestion that the AG had acted in bad faith or in dereliction of his duties. I therefore made no order as to costs.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jeyendran Jeyapal and Lee Hui Min (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Thuraisingam and Hamza Zafar Malik (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Teo Guo Zheng Titus (WongPartnership LLP) for the second defendant (watching brief). </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
