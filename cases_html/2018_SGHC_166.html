As a result, negotiations commenced with the Itochu Group (“Itochu”), a potential investor from Japan. At or around the same time, serious problems arose in respect of a contract and bill of lading involving Continental Grain. These involved allegations of improper or irregular discharge and delivery of cargo without proper bills of lading and or shipping documents which could expose Eximcoop to an allegation of fraud. Whilst Mr Leiman does not appear to be directly involved in the shipment and bills of lading, it appears he was asked by Eximcoop to assist in resolving the problem.

Legal issues also arose in respect of Agricole. On top of this, a legal dispute arose between Itochu and Eximcoop in connection with the purchase of Eximcoop’s shares. Indeed, it is apparent that various related legal proceedings ran from 2000 all the way to around 2006 and beyond, including investigations by the Brazilian tax authorities for tax offences.

The general point is that the period from 1997 to 2000 was clearly difficult for Messrs Carlier and Ozeias. Not only had Eximcoop run into financial problems, there were problems with the Continental Grain dispute, the Itochu litigation and the Brazilian tax authorities’ investigations. Whilst Mr Leiman was included in an initial complaint for tax offences he was never convicted or even charged with an offence. On the other hand, Mr Carlier was indicted on 23 June 2003 and convicted on 25 June 2007. Mr Carlier’s appeal against his conviction was eventually dismissed by the Brazilian Federal Court in January 2010.

His evidence is that he did not have much contact with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias during this time. In 2002, Mr Leiman made a successful return to the commodities trading industry as he was appointed COO of Louis Dreyfus. His evidence is that between 2002 and the end of 2005, whilst he remained in touch with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, there was little direct contact and he was unaware of the details of the unresolved legal problems regarding Eximcoop, Itochu and the tax investigations. I pause to comment that whilst Mr Leiman tried to play down the closeness of his relationship with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, I have no doubt that they were good friends.

The question whether Mr Leiman concealed his relationship with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias and their legal problems and proceedings (summarised above) is a matter in dispute, and relates to the defendants’ assertion that Mr Leiman was in breach of his duties to Noble by failing to make proper disclosures. The defendants also complain that Mr Leiman recruited his friends and former colleagues into Noble Brazil to manage and run the sugar mill business when they did not have the necessary experience in sugar mill operations. On the other hand, there is also a dispute as to whether Noble conducted a proper due diligence check on Mr Leiman and Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, and whether it had sufficient information to at least be put on notice as to Messrs Carlier and Ozeias’s backgrounds and legal problems.

Messrs Carlier and Ozeias were also involved in a separate case of fraud, conspiracy and racketeering arising from their business in Agricole. The findings of the 2012 Wolfe Report were based on the Brazilian court files for the numerous legal proceedings that arose out of the Eximcoop and Agricole affairs.

The report found that Mr Leiman had made misrepresentations to Mr Elman to the effect that Messrs Carlier and Ozeias were experienced, knowledgeable, competent and trustworthy, and that the allegations made by Itochu against them were false, just so that they could be hired by Noble to run the sugar mill. The matters surrounding the subsequent “management failures” of this sugar mill and the considerable losses it caused to Noble were mentioned in the 2008 Wolfe Memo, as noted at [37] above.

They argue that the R&amp;O Committee was not entitled to rely on past misconduct to establish that Mr Leiman had acted to Noble’s detriment for the purposes of cll 3(c) and (d) of the Settlement Agreement, nor was it the parties’ intention for the Settlement Agreement to cover conduct relating to competition that would not amount to a breach of the express non-competition clauses. Further, they contend that the defendants have not shown what detriment they suffered as a result of Mr Leiman’s alleged acts. The R&amp;O Committee’s decisions are therefore invalid according to the plaintiffs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The defendants now take the position that Rothschild Trust, as a non-party to the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement, has no right to sue on these agreements. Further, whilst Mr Leiman is a party to both agreements, it is said that he is disentitled from claiming in respect of the Shares and the Share Options because these have been transferred to Rothschild Trust. In short, the defendants’ objection is that Mr Leiman does not have property rights in the Shares or the Share Options and any loss that arises accrues only to the Adelaide Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The somewhat “odd” consequence of the defendants’ argument is that it effectively means no one apart from NRL can sue on the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement. Respectfully, I am unable to agree with the defendants’ <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> objection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 There is no doubt that the issue as to when a claimant has sufficient standing to sue and recover substantial damages in respect of a third party’s property has long been a vexed issue in the common law. From privity of contract through to agency, trust, bailment, causation of pure economic loss and tort, the common law has strived to find the appropriate balance between the interests and rights of the claimant, the defendant and the third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 One approach has been to address the issue from the perspective of what constitutes “substantial loss” in the context of a breach of contract. In <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court (a firm) v Seah Boon Lock and another (trading as Boon Lock Duck </span><span class="font-italic">and Noodle House) </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 272 (“<span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span>”), the Court of Appeal stated at [31] (albeit by way of <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span>) that there are two exceptions to the general rule that a plaintiff cannot ordinarily recover substantial damages for a breach of contract where he has suffered no loss (for instance, where the substantial loss was instead suffered by the third party who was the intended beneficiary of the contract). These exceptions can be referred to as the “narrow ground” and the “broad ground”. They are exceptions which give effect to the reality that sometimes, where the promisor contracts to render a contractual performance that would benefit a third party to the contract, the promisee can also suffer substantial losses of his own, and should therefore be entitled to recover substantial damages: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span>”) at para 15.093. It should further be noted that both grounds are conceptually distinct and inconsistent with each other such that it is not possible to apply both grounds simultaneously: <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span> at [56].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The narrow ground allows a plaintiff to recover substantial damages <span class="font-italic">on behalf of a third party</span>, and it is applicable where the contracting parties have contemplated that the proprietary interest in the contractual subject matter may be transferred from the plaintiff to the third party after the contract had been entered into and before the defendant’s breach occurs. The narrow ground, however, is only applicable where the third party has no contractual remedy against the contractual promisor. The availability of an action in tort does not, however, have the effect of rendering the narrow ground inapplicable: <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span> at [47].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The broad ground, in contrast, allows the plaintiff to recover substantial damages for breach of contract in respect of <span class="font-italic">his own loss</span>, on the basis that the plaintiff has an interest in the performance of the contract: <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]. The broad ground, however, is subject to an overriding objective test of reasonableness as to the performance interest claimed. This serves the purpose of curbing what would otherwise be an unjustified windfall and to limit the broad ground to cases where the performance interest is genuine: <span class="font-italic">Family Food Court</span> at [53].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In the present case, it appears that the narrow ground is inapplicable. At the time when the Settlement Agreement was entered into by Mr Leiman, the parties knew that the Adelaide Trust had been set up by Mr Leiman. The parties knew that Mr Leiman’s contractual entitlements to the Shares and the Share Options had by and large been assigned to the trust.

</div> The identity of the trustee was known. This is not a case where the contracting parties contemplated that the proprietary interest in the contractual subject matter may be transferred from the plaintiff to the third party after the contract was entered into and before the breach occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Instead, this is a case in which the broad ground applies. The fact that Mr Leiman had assigned his shares and share options to Rothschild Trust does not detract from the fact that this dispute is about Mr Leiman’s claim that he has not received the bargain he had contracted for under the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 It is clear that NRL was aware at all material times that the Share Options and the bulk of the Shares had been assigned to Rothschild Trust, and that the parties had intended all along that these Share Options and Shares would be covered under the Settlement Agreement between Mr Leiman and NRL. Thus, when Mr Alam first informed Mr Koenig of a trading ban on 21 December 2011 (see [33] above), it was not on the basis of anything to do with Rothschild Trust, but on the basis of Mr Leiman being a significant employee shareholder. Moreover, when Mr Koenig sent the 29 February 2012 e-mail stating that Rothschild Trust would exercise the five million share options without using the cashless facility, it is telling that Mr Alam’s almost immediate reaction was to inform the R&amp;O Committee that NGL had received <span class="font-italic">Mr Leiman’s</span> notice to exercise his five million share options. It is not surprising then, that in his testimony, Mr Alam admitted that if Mr Leiman had not acted to Noble’s detriment, Rothschild Trust would have been allowed to exercise those options.

Mr Leiman’s performance interest is reasonable and genuine. He was the settlor of the Adelaide Trust. The assets of the trust were intended to comprise Mr Leiman’s entitlements under Noble’s 2004 Share Option Scheme and the AIP. It follows that Mr Leiman has standing to bring this action and to seek substantial damages for his own loss. The question as to how damages (if any) are to be assessed and whether it is necessary to show that Mr Leiman as the plaintiff/promisee incurred loss in making good the shortfall in performance will be addressed below after the question of liability on the facts is determined.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Adelaide Trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It is convenient at this point to set out (in brief terms) some of the salient features of the Adelaide Trust which was set up on 16 May 2006.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Shares and the Share Options referred to above (save for the 5,652,421 shares) were assigned to Rothschild Trust prior to the Settlement Agreement and Advisory Agreement. It is clear that Rothschild Trust and NGL had contractually agreed to be bound by the Share Option Rules. These rules, of course, were also binding on Mr Leiman by virtue of the terms of his contract of employment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiffs’ omission to plead agency precludes a cause of action against the defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The defendants’ second objection is that, since the R&amp;O Committee is a separate body whose decision caused loss to Mr Leiman, Mr Leiman’s remedy is against the R&amp;O Committee. Mr Leiman only has a cause of action against NRL if he pleads that the R&amp;O Committee is an agent or is in any other way acting on behalf of NRL. But since Mr Leiman did not so plead, he can have no remedy against NRL. The defendants cite the cases of <span class="font-italic">Steven Andrew Clark v Nomura International Plc </span>[2000] IRLR 766 (“<span class="font-italic">Nomura</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Braganza v BP Shipping Limited </span>[2015] UKSC 17 (“<span class="font-italic">Braganza</span>”), and <span class="font-italic">Mark Hills v Niksun Inc </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 115 in support.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 But I do not think that those cases assist the defendants in any way. If anything, they show instead that “[c]ontractual terms in which one party to the contract is given the power to exercise a discretion, or to form an opinion as to relevant facts, are extremely common”: <span class="font-italic">Braganza </span>at [18], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lady Hale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In <span class="font-italic">Braganza</span>, the issue was whether the deceased employee seaman who fell overboard at sea had committed suicide or been a victim of an accident. BP Shipping (the defendant), the owners and manager of the vessel, set up an inquiry in accordance with its own internal procedures. A team investigated the events and produced a final report (following several drafts and some discussions with in-house legal) setting out the opinion that the most likely cause was suicide. The report was forwarded to the General Manager of BP Maritime Services (Singapore) Pte Ltd – the company which provided management services to the defendant. On the basis of the report, the General Manager concluded that there had been wilful default and that death in service benefits were not payable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Lady Hale stressed at [2] that the court’s task was not to decide what actually happened to the deceased seaman. Instead the court’s task was to decide whether the employer of the deceased seaman was entitled to form the opinion which it did. It is clear that in many cases, the exercise of a contractual discretion or power to form an opinion on relevant facts will involve or require some sort of fact-finding exercise. Indeed, there may be several inquiries on facts: external and internal. It must follow that the exercise of contractual discretion may be based on findings made or opinions reached by the party entitled to exercise that discretion or based on findings, opinions or recommendations of other legal persons. But at the end of the day, the key point for the purposes of the objection raised is that the right under the contract to exercise that discretion still vests in the party that is contractually granted that discretion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">Nomura</span>, the plaintiff was employed as a senior proprietary trader in equities. His remuneration comprised a basic salary supplemented by an annual bonus awarded under a discretionary scheme. The plaintiff was subsequently dismissed on three months’ notice on the ground of irretrievable loss of confidence in his ability, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. Subsequently, whilst the plaintiff was serving out the three-month notice, the employers learnt of certain disparaging remarks made by the plaintiff. The plaintiff was informed that no discretionary bonus would be paid because of the assessment of his financial performance and his behaviour. Burton J found at [56] that the decision to dismiss the plaintiff was taken during a two-day meeting of the International Markets Division (“IMD”) Management Committee (of which he had not been given prior notice). The decision to pay a nil bonus was reached later after the head of the IMD consulted the IMD Management Committee (at [75]). The point which I note is that the decision under review was made by the IMD Management Committee and the head of that division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the present case, Mr Leiman’s employer is NRL. Under the Employment Agreement, he was required to serve as COO of NGL, and subsequently, he was tasked to serve as CEO of NGL.

</div> The purpose of such a scheme is to provide executive directors and employees of the group (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, NGL and its subsidiaries, including NRL) an opportunity to participate in the equity of NGL. The scheme is administered by “the Committee”, which “compris[es] directors of [NGL], duly authorised and appointed by the Board to administer the Scheme”. I pause to underscore that there can be no doubt that the R&amp;O Committee is “the Committee” as defined in cl 2 of the Share Option Rules.

These rules include, for example, provisions on the lapse of the right to exercise options because of cessation of employment and so on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The AIP is concerned with the annual discretionary bonus as determined by the R&amp;O Committee.

The R&amp;O Committee is not an independent legal person. It simply comprises certain directors of the NGL board together with the Chairman. There is no doubt that when the R&amp;O Committee considers an issue relating to discretionary bonuses, share options or other entitlements under the Share Options Scheme or the AIP, it does so as the duly-appointed committee of the NGL board tasked precisely with that responsibility for NGL and indeed NRL (by virtue of the terms of the Employment Agreement). NGL and NRL, as corporate persons, act through their responsible officers, boards and committees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101  Under the Settlement Agreement between NRL and Mr Leiman, NRL undertook certain promises to Mr Leiman in respect of the Share Options and the Shares, provided Mr Leiman did not act to Noble’s detriment.

It is clear that the R&amp;O Committee does not, as a result of such an arrangement, become a party to any contract with either Mr Leiman or NRL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Parenthetically, I note the defendants’ point that the plaintiffs have not made submissions to the effect that: (a) there was a collateral contract between either of them and the R&amp;O Committee, or (b) NRL or NGL were under any obligation to procure the R&amp;O Committee to act in a particular way.

Thus, Mr Chan deposed that the R&amp;O Committee had unanimously decided to withhold its permission for Rothschild Trust to exercise the Share Options, but tasked Mr Alam to invite Mr Leiman to provide any response or explanation which the latter wished to bring to the R&amp;O Committee’s attention.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Accordingly, I find that the R&amp;O Committee’s decision of 27 March 2012 amounts to a final determination under the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The validity of the decisions of the R&amp;O Committee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Clause 3 of the Settlement Agreement is titled “Severance Payments and Benefits”. In particular, cl 3(c) sets out Mr Leiman’s entitlement to exercise the Share Options, “provided that prior to exercise he has not acted in any way to the detriment of Noble”. Clause 3(d) covers Mr Leiman’s entitlement to the Shares and their accrued dividends, and provides that they “shall vest and become free of transfer restrictions in accordance with its term of grant provided [Mr Leiman] does not act in any way to the detriment of Noble”. In both cases, the R&amp;O Committee “shall make a final determination in the event of any dispute”: see [27] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Having found that the R&amp;O Committee had in fact made “a final determination” within the meaning of cll 3(c) and (d), the inquiry now turns to whether the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions are valid. I begin by considering the appropriate standard by which the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions are to be reviewed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 It is now established that where one party to a contract is given the power to exercise a discretion, the courts will seek to ensure that such contractual powers are not abused by implying a term as to the manner in which such powers may be exercised. Such a term may vary according to the terms of the contract and the context in which the decision-making power is given: <span class="font-italic">Braganza </span>at [18]. In cases such as the present one, the court will imply “a term that the decision-making process be lawful and rational in the public law sense, [and] that the decision is made rationally (as well as in good faith) and consistently with its contractual purpose”: <span class="font-italic">Braganza</span> at [30]. In other words, “in the absence of very clear language to the contrary, a contractual discretion must be exercised in good faith and not arbitrarily or capriciously”: <span class="font-italic">British Telecommunications plc v Telefonica O2 UK Ltd</span> [2014] UKSC 42 (“<span class="font-italic">British </span><span class="font-italic">Telecommunications</span>”) at [37].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 These principles have been accepted by the local courts. In <span class="font-italic">MGA International Pte Ltd v Wajilam Exports (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2010] SGHC 319 which concerned the extent of a party’s discretion to decide its own remuneration and commission for services (see [9]), Belinda Ang J quoted with approval (at [104]) the following passage from the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Socimer Bank Ltd v Standard Bank Ltd</span> [2008] All ER (D) 331 (“<span class="font-italic">Socimer</span>”) at [66]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is plain from these authorities that a decision-maker’s discretion will be limited, as a matter of necessary implication, by concepts of honesty, good faith, and genuineness, and the need for the absence of arbitrariness, capriciousness, perversity and irrationality. The concern is that the discretion should not be abused. Reasonableness and unreasonableness are also not concepts deployed in this context, but only in a sense analogous to Wednesbury unreasonableness …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The analogy drawn in <span class="font-italic">Socimer</span> to the concept of <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span> unreasonableness (as developed in the seminal administrative decision of<span class="font-italic"> Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp</span> [1947] 2 All ER 680) presents the interesting question of whether the principles of judicial review of administrative action may apply in the contractual context. This was considered by the United Kingdom Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Braganza</span>. Although their Lordships found it fitting to draw some parallels to the <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span> test, they did not reach a conclusion as to the precise extent to which an implied contractual term may differ from the principles applicable to judicial review of administrative action: <span class="font-italic">Braganza </span>at [30] and [32]. Likewise, it is not necessary for me to decide this question, especially considering that the parties are in agreement that the R&amp;O Committee’s exercise of discretion would be invalid if it was arbitrary, capricious or in bad faith. I pause to stress that the present case, like <span class="font-italic">Braganza</span>, is only concerned with the exercise of contractual discretion in an employment context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The parties, however, do not agree as to whether the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions may also be invalid for its failure to act in accordance with natural justice. In particular, the plaintiffs contend that Mr Leiman should have been given notice of the allegations against him and a fair opportunity to be heard by the R&amp;O Committee. The defendants argue that there is no basis in law for the imposition of any such duty or implied term for the R&amp;O Committee to accord due process to Mr Leiman.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I agree with the defendants that there was no requirement for the R&amp;O Committee to have informed Mr Leiman of the allegations made against beforehand or to have given him an opportunity to be heard. The defendants have not been able to cite any authority in which such a requirement was recognised in the contractual context. They rely only on the cases of <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 802 and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Amateur Athletics Association v Haron bin Mundir</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 407, both of which involved decisions made by disciplinary committees. I do not think it is appropriate to read such a requirement into the contract. In the present case, there is no indication that the parties had envisioned that Mr Leiman would have an opportunity to be heard. I add that Mr Leiman was himself a member of the R&amp;O Committee between January 2010 and December 2011, and would have been familiar with the workings of the R&amp;O Committee. There is no allegation that the R&amp;O Committee departed from its usual procedure in this regard when dealing specifically with Mr Leiman. Mr Leiman was in any case aware that he could make representations to the R&amp;O Committee. Indeed, there is evidence that on 10 April 2012, NRL wrote to Rothschild Trust stating that the R&amp;O Committee would consider any request from Mr Leiman to advance information in response to the allegations that had arisen.

</div> The plaintiffs point to the following evidence in support of this argument:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The R&amp;O Committee did not inform Mr Leiman of the allegations prior to their first meeting on 1 March 2012 or give him an opportunity to respond. Mr Alam initially claimed that there was no time, but later conceded that there was no real urgency to make a decision. The R&amp;O Committee also did not invite Mr Leiman to respond after the meeting on 1 March 2012.

According to the plaintiffs, this showed that the R&amp;O Committee recognised that they had insufficient information at the time.

Mr Leiman had allegedly told Mr Rubin that he was upset with Noble not giving him what it owed him, and that he had a lot of material to use against Noble for a “full blown legal war” that would be played out in the news. Mr Alam replied with the comment that it sounded like Mr Leiman was “now adding blackmail to his other dubious talents”, and added, “If we give him enough rope ….” Mr Chan then replied, “I think we keep our cool and stick to our plan….cross the bridge when we come to it.”

As I found at [116] above, the R&amp;O Committee was not obliged to allow Mr Leiman to make representations, nor did they have to provide full reasons for their decisions. The fact that Mr Elman was concurrently a representative and large shareholder of Noble while acting as a member of the R&amp;O Committee does not in itself taint the decisions of the R&amp;O Committee, considering that, at the time the Settlement Agreement was signed, Mr Leiman knew and accepted that Mr Elman would be a member. In any case, I accept that Mr Rubin and Mr Chan were independent non-executive directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The plaintiffs rely on certain phrases used by Mr Rubin and Mr Chan, such as “stick to our plan”, to show that the R&amp;O Committee had pre-judged the matter and was merely trying to buy time and gather information to substantiate its decisions. But I do not think that these messages should necessarily be read in such a light. Instead, it seems more likely to me that the R&amp;O Committee made a tentative decision based on the reports that were before them, and that their “plan” was that this decision would stand unless further investigations revealed new information to the contrary. This was consistent with Mr Chan’s testimony.

It does not appear that anything of this nature was revealed in the final version of the 2012 Wolfe Report, and it was therefore reasonable that another meeting was not held considering that the R&amp;O Committee had already met twice to discuss this matter.

</div> it is at least apparent to me that the R&amp;O Committee did in fact base their decision on a finding that Mr Leiman had acted in ways detrimental to Noble.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 For similar reasons, I reject the plaintiffs’ arguments that the R&amp;O Committee did not have the Employment Agreement and the Advisory Agreement before them. The members were already briefed by Mr Alam on Mr Leiman’s relevant contractual obligations at the 1 March 2012 meeting, and a memorandum from Noble’s solicitors at Linklaters on issues to be considered by the R&amp;O Committee was tabled at the 27 March 2012 meeting. Further, there was nothing too unusual about Mr Leiman’s non-solicitation and non-competition restrictions. The plaintiffs argue that the R&amp;O Committee failed to consider that the restrictions in the Employment Agreement were limited to the Americas and the Asia-Pacific regions, whereas the PI had only reported Mr Leiman attending meetings in London.

</div> But the location of Mr Leiman’s meetings say nothing about where the actual competition would take place, and it is at least clear that BTG Pactual, as a Brazilian company with a large South American presence (see [35] above), would be competing in the Americas. There is also nothing in the minutes indicating whether the R&amp;O Committee did or did not consider whether the persons Mr Leiman had allegedly approached were part of Noble’s senior management or otherwise fell within the restrictions contained in the Employment Agreement, and I will shortly address this point as I turn to discuss the issue of Mr Leiman’s alleged solicitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 On a related note, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants have not shown what “detriment” Noble has suffered, or provided any evidence of loss caused to Noble as a result of Mr Leiman’s acts.

</div> However, I do not read the requirement that Mr Leiman “does not act in any way to the detriment of Noble” (as stated in cll 3(c) and (d) of the Settlement Agreement) to mean that the defendants or the R&amp;O Committee would have to show evidence of some tangible loss caused to Noble. As a matter of common sense and a plain reading, this phrase simply means that Mr Leiman would not be entitled to the Shares and the Share Options if he acted <span class="font-italic">against Noble’s interests</span>.

Mr Salvetti added that Mr Leiman had “clear ideas on what [could] be done” and could pull together a team.

The summary stated that Alliance Commodities was “[l]ed by an unrivalled management team” with an “[e]xcellent and long track record in setting up, managing and scaling a global commodities business”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although the defendants place substantial reliance on such evidence, I reiterate that these documents and correspondence were not before the R&amp;O Committee when they made their decisions. As the inquiry for this Court is to determine whether the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions were arbitrary, capricious or in bad faith, it is imperative that I look primarily to the documents which were actually placed before the R&amp;O Committee and which it relied on in coming to its decisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In my judgment, Mr Leiman’s e-mail to Summa Capital was the “smoking gun”. That e-mail made clear that Mr Leiman had actively reached out to and met with Mr Vinokurov to assess if Summa Group would be interested in being a partner in building BTG Pactual’s commodities arm into the “new Glencore”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The plaintiffs characterise the above e-mail as being mere preparatory steps, and cite the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart </span>[2012] 4 SLR 308 at [67] for the proposition that an employee’s implied duty of good faith and fidelity is only breached “if more than mere preparatory steps [towards future competition] had been taken” by the employee. The Court of Appeal highlighted at [68]–[70] that this would be a highly fact-specific inquiry in each case, and endorsed Etherton J’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Shepherds Investments Ltd v Walters </span>[2007] FSR 15 at [108]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is obvious, for example, that merely making a decision to set up a competing business at some point in the future and discussing such an idea with friends and family would not of themselves be in conflict with the best interests of the company and the employer. The consulting of lawyers and other professionals may, depending on all the circumstances, equally be consistent with a director’s fiduciary duties and the employee’s obligation of loyalty. At the other end of the spectrum, it is plain that soliciting customers of the company and the employer or the actual carrying on of trade by a competing business would be in breach of the duties of the director and the obligations of the employee. It is the wide range of activity and decision making between the two ends of the spectrum which will be fact sensitive in every case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 It is clear that an employee who has tendered his notice of resignation and is serving out his notice period (the twilight period) still owes a contractual duty of fidelity to his employer. That said, the law recognises that if a question of compliance with the duty of fidelity arises in the notice period, it is proper to make the assessment bearing in mind the fact that the employee will soon cease to be an employee. This is because the law recognises the tension between the interests of the employer and those of the employee, especially during the twilight period of his employment as well as post-employment: see Andrew Stafford and Stuart Ritchie, <span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Duties</span><span class="font-italic">: Directors and Employees </span>(Jordans<span class="font-italic"> </span>Publishing Limited, 2nd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Duties</span>”) at paras 4.30–4.31, where it is said at para 4.31 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An act should not be held to be a breach of the duty of fidelity if the employee goes no further than reasonably required for the purpose of exploring his employment prospects elsewhere. This is so even if the employee contemplates setting up in competition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 This is why, leaving aside any express terms to the contrary, an employee who in his spare time makes arrangements for setting up his own office, is not necessarily in breach of the duty of fidelity unless such acts interfere with his work or if he actually starts business whilst still employed: see<span class="font-italic"> Robb v Green</span> [1895] 2 QB 1 at 15; <span class="font-italic">Balston Filters v Headline Filters</span> [1987] FSR 330 generally; and <span class="font-italic">Lancashire Fires Ltd v SA Lyons</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1996] FSR 629 at 678–679 where the defendant employee was held to have engaged in more than purely routine acts in preparation for departure and was found to have breached his duty of fidelity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The line between permissible preparatory acts and those which breach the duty of fidelity depends on the terms of the contract and the facts of each case. It cannot be assumed that so long as the employee does not actually start competition that he is free to embark on “preparatory” acts with full speed and fervour. As suggested by <span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Duties</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 4.45, as an alternative to the label “preparatory steps”, it may be appropriate to ask whether the steps taken reveal a potential conflict between the interests of the employer and those of his employee. Yet another test or guide is to ask whether a person of ordinary honesty and intelligence would regard the employee’s acts as dishonest towards his employer: see para 4.38.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In the present case, I am of the view that Mr Leiman’s acts as evidenced by his e-mail to Summa Capital indicated that he had gone beyond mere preparatory steps. Instead, he had actively sought out Summa Capital to make his pitch and flown to Russia to meet them (as well as to Brazil to meet BTG Pactual), all while serving as Advisor to Noble.

</div> The e-mail mentioned a “project” and “business plan” which was already in place, and BTG Pactual wanted things to “move fast”: see [35] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Further, I accept the defendants’ evidence that Summa Group was one of Noble’s strategic partners with whom Noble was discussing potential joint ventures in Russia and Indonesia, and it appears likely that Mr Leiman only got to know about Summa Capital’s interest in moving into the commodities sector by virtue of internal Noble e-mails which he was privy to (see [130] above). Although neither Summa Capital nor Summa Group was a “client” or “customer” for the purposes of the non-solicitation clause in the Employment Agreement (see [129] above), such solicitation is nonetheless a fact that lends itself strongly to a finding of a breach of the non-competition clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Indeed, as will be discussed later, it is clear Mr Leiman was using sensitive confidential information about Summa Capital that he received when he was CEO of NGL. Under these circumstances, there was certainly a valid basis for the R&amp;O Committee to find (or take the view) that Mr Leiman had breached his duty of fidelity to Noble and acted in a way detrimental to Noble’s interests. Further, even taking account of the fact that by January 2012 Mr Leiman was no longer CEO of NGL or an employee of NRL, he was a highly-paid advisor to NRL. Mr Leiman was receiving not only a retainer but also his base salary (as COO) under the Employment Agreement pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. Furthermore, it bears repeating that the non-competition provisions of the Employment Agreement had been incorporated into the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The plaintiffs make the argument that the CMB Plan would not have been competing with Noble, as what Mr Leiman envisioned was akin to a private equity fund that would invest in commodities and commodity assets, and engage in asset management and trading.

Indeed, the first concept plan document dated 5 December 2011 stated that “[t]he CMB is effectively a company with three divisions”: (a) commodities trade finance; (b) “investment in and management of assets relevant in commodities value chain”; and (c) “traditional commodities trading business based on optimizing information flows and optionality which is presently exclusive to the commodity trade houses”.

</div> In any case, this subsequent event is of limited relevance to the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions in March 2012 and the nature of Mr Leiman’s conduct upon which its decisions were based.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Given the above reasons, I do not find that the R&amp;O Committee acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith in the exercise of its discretion. Its decisions were validly based – at least in part – on proof of Mr Leiman’s acts which were in competition against and detrimental to the interests of Noble.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I pause to note that the Advisory Agreement was entered into on the same day as the Settlement Agreement. Whilst the Advisory Agreement does not make express reference to the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Agreement does make reference to the Advisory Agreement and expressly extends or applies the non-competition clause in the Employment Agreement to the Advisory Agreement. Clause 4 of the Settlement Agreement states that the non-competition clause in the Employment Agreement continued to apply until the end of the Advisory Agreement, or for nine months from the effective date, whichever is longer: see [27(d)] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The Advisory Agreement also expressly provides that Mr Leiman’s duty is to “provide advisory services relating to commodities supply chain management … as designated to him by Mr Richard Elman”. The basic remuneration provided was the same as when he was first appointed as COO of NGL. Furthermore, Mr Leiman undertook in cl 3 of the Advisory Agreement that he did not have any agreement to provide advisory services in commodities supply chain management to any other company and that he would not enter into such an agreement during the term of the Advisory Agreement.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The point that I make is that Mr Leiman as COO and later as CEO owed duties of fidelity to NGL. Indeed, bearing in mind that he was also an executive director of NGL, he was in the position of a fiduciary. As <span class="font-italic">Fiduciary Duties </span>describes at para 3.17:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to, or is obliged to, act in the interests of another. He is required to demonstrate single-minded loyalty to his principal. … Fiduciaries are obliged to avoid self-interest in their dealings with their principals.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 After his resignation and termination of his positions as CEO and director of NGL, Mr Leiman’s obligation not to compete against Noble (as originally provided for in the Employment Agreement) continued. Even if Mr Leiman was not in a fiduciary position as an advisor, I have no doubt that he owed a duty of fidelity to NRL under the Advisory Agreement. Whilst NRL is not NGL, a reasoned determination (that is not capricious, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) by the R&amp;O Committee that Mr Leiman had acted to the detriment of NGL would, in my view, also provide a reasonable and legitimate basis for finding that Mr Leiman had acted to the detriment of NRL (a principal subsidiary of NGL).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Solicitation of Noble senior management</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As stated at [131] above, Mr Alam informed the R&amp;O Committee at the 27 March 2012 meeting that according to the PI’s reports, Mr Leiman had been meeting a number of Noble employees and advisors. In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs named six Noble employees (at the time they were allegedly approached), two former Noble employees and four financial advisors (companies) to Noble whom Mr Leiman had allegedly approached with a view to soliciting them to compete against Noble, as well as a list of 23 former Noble employees and directors who had joined BTG Pactual by the time the suit was filed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The non-solicitation clause in the Employment Agreement prohibits Mr Leiman from soliciting members of Noble’s senior management for employment, as well as clients and customers of Noble: see [129] above. One of the plaintiffs’ contentions is that the defendants have not shown that the persons allegedly solicited by Mr Leiman fall within these categories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 It is clear that the four companies who were stated in the pleadings to be Noble’s financial advisors (Ernst and Young, KKR, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS) were service providers and are not members of senior management or clients and customers of Noble. Further, <span class="font-italic">former</span> directors and employees of Noble such as Mr Courtis fall outside the non-solicitation clause as they were not members of senior management at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Nevertheless, it is apparent from the job positions and titles that a number of the named individuals such as Mr Brewer and Mr Cherrett were “senior management of [NRL] or a related or affiliate company with which [Mr Leiman had been] involved or had supervisory responsibility during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding [his] last day as an employee of [NRL]”: see [131] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The difficulty with the allegations of solicitation of Noble’s senior management, however, is that there was very little information before the R&amp;O Committee about the purpose of Mr Leiman’s meetings with these individuals. According to Mr Leiman, these meetings were social in nature. Indeed, Mr Leiman had served at NGL for many years and it is not at all surprising that he might have occasional contacts and meetings with some of his former colleagues. Even if the conversation included chit-chat on Mr Leiman’s plans for the future, this does not mean that he was soliciting his former colleagues for employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Against this, the defendants basically assert that an inference can be drawn that Mr Leiman discussed employment opportunities with the former colleagues whom he met up with, from the fact that 23 persons who used to be with Noble are now with BTG Pactual. The problem, however, is that even now, there is little evidence to show that Mr Leiman had in fact approached these named individuals to solicit them for employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The defendants point to several documents suggesting discussions and meetings between BTG Pactual and Mr Brewer with which Mr Leiman was involved, but it appears that the first meeting only took place on 21 August 2012 which was after the expiry of the Advisory Agreement on 1 August 2012.

That said, even if the R&amp;O Committee did not have a sufficient basis to find that there was solicitation, the overall evidence before them did show that around the same time as these meetings, Mr Leiman had moved beyond mere preparatory steps in his discussions with Summa Capital and BTG Pactual and was pursuing them hard. Even if Mr Leiman had not specifically asked Mr Brewer or any of the other senior Noble employees to come on board with his plans at this stage, the R&amp;O Committee certainly had a basis to take the view that Mr Leiman had discussed his plans with Mr Brewer and others, and to take this into account when coming to its decision as to whether Mr Leiman had acted to Noble’s detriment. I do not think that this would have been an arbitrary or capricious finding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In any event, nothing turns on the solicitation point given my finding that the R&amp;O Committee already had a proper basis for coming to the conclusion that there was conduct detrimental to Noble because of Mr Leiman’s acts of competition against Noble. Even if Mr Leiman was just discussing business matters with senior Noble employees such as Mr Brewer for the purpose of firming up his plans (BTG Pactual or the CMB Plan) as opposed to specific solicitation of services, Mr Leiman would clearly be engaging in more than preparatory acts in the period when he was bound by the non-compete obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I pause to reiterate that it is not for this Court to substitute the opinion of the decision-maker. The task, as stated by Lady Hale in <span class="font-italic">Braganza </span>at [2], is to decide whether the employer was entitled to form the opinion which it did. The standard of review is whether the decision was made in good faith and not arbitrarily or capriciously, that decision being the finding by the R&amp;O Committee that Mr Leiman had acted to the detriment of Noble. I am satisfied that the R&amp;O Committee made this finding in good faith, on the basis of the evidence showing a breach of Mr Leiman’s non-competition obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Misuse of confidential information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Given my above findings, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the allegations of misuse of confidential information for the purposes of determining the validity of the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions. Indeed, the minutes of the meetings and the other contemporaneous documents do not indicate that this particular issue was specifically discussed by the R&amp;O Committee, and it did not form part of the grounds for its decisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I note that Burton J in <span class="font-italic">Nomura</span> held at 780 that “whereas, in cases of wrongful dismissal, an employer can, in order to justify a dismissal, rely on matters which he can later show to have been the case, even if he did not know of and/or rely upon them at the time to justify dismissal”, the position is different where the issue is not wrongful dismissal but whether the employer exercised a discretion in breach of contract. For this reason, it may be thought that it is not appropriate for this Court to have regard to these allegations in deciding whether the decisions made by the R&amp;O Committee were legally defensible. That said, it is clear that the R&amp;O Committee was at least aware of the approaches made to Summa Capital and BTG Pactual in light of Mr Leiman’s e-mail to Mr Vinokurov. Further, even if the R&amp;O Committee did not specifically address the issue of breach of confidence, I am of the view that this would have formed part of the context in which it found that Mr Leiman had acted to the detriment of Noble.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In any case, I will set out my findings and observations on the issue of breach of confidence, as it is relevant to NRL’s counterclaim against Mr Leiman that is discussed towards the end of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The basic principles of the law on confidence as set out in the seminal English cases of <span class="font-italic">Saltman Engineering Co v Campbell Engineering Co</span> (1948) 65 RPC 203 and <span class="font-italic">Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd</span> [1969] RPC 41 (“<span class="font-italic">Coco v Clark</span>”), which have been followed and applied in numerous Singapore cases including <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Intrepid Offshore Construction Pte Ltd and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 36 at [55], and <span class="font-italic">Invenpro (M) Sdn Bd v JCS Automation Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1045 (“<span class="font-italic">Invenpro</span>”) at [129].

</div> Mr Leiman was made privy to this information by way of Noble’s internal e-mail discussions from August to October 2011 which related to Summa Capital. On 29 October 2011, a NRL director, Mr William Randall, e-mailed Mr Brewer and one Mr Raj Kapoor, stating that Noble had “been closely working with a group called Summa Capital (controlled by MgM) over last 4 months”. Among other things, the e-mail stated that Summa Capital had <br/>“been warned off working with Glencore from the top” as “[s]omething went wrong” and that “MgM is progressively squeezing them out of major Russian grain ports and trying to flip business to Noble / [Louis Dreyfus]”.

</div> In my view, the information in question falls squarely within the ambit of cl 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I also find that there was unauthorised use of the said confidential information. Mr Leiman contacted Summa Capital without NRL’s knowledge and in pursuit of his own CMB Plan, and effectively used the confidential information in crafting a pitch to Summa Capital, which he knew to be interested in moving into the commodities sector. I also do not think it was entirely a coincidence that Mr Leiman used the phrase “the new Glencore” as part of his pitch. Needless to say, none of this was authorised by NRL, whether implicitly or expressly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Megarry J in <span class="font-italic">Coco v Clark</span> (at 48) and the authors of Tanya Aplin <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Gurry on Breach of Confidence </span>(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Gurry</span>”) at para 15.43 remark that the case law contains no clear answer as to whether there is a separate requirement to show detriment, although it is suggested in <span class="font-italic">Gurry</span> that “i[n] almost all cases where there is an obligation and there is breach, there is likely to be detriment in some form”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Much of the uncertainty or hesitation over whether there is a separate requirement of detriment arises because of lingering doubts over the doctrinal basis of the cause of action of breach of confidence. Contract, tort, property and equity have all been referred to as possible jurisdictional bases, while some subscribe to the view that the law of confidence is <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> in nature. Under each of these approaches, a different emphasis may be placed on the requirement of detriment. For example, analogising a breach of confidence to a trespass in tort would mean that detriment is less important as the torts of trespass to land, goods and the person are generally actionable <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, while an approach grounded in equity may require detriment given the maxim that “equity does not act in vain”: see Ng Siew Kuan, “The Spycatcher Saga: Its Implications and Effect on the Law of Confidence” [1990] 32 Malaya Law Review 1 at Part VI(1) and generally. Perhaps the real question is what exactly is meant by “detriment”, and in particular, whether loss of confidentiality (for example, from an unauthorised disclosure) is sufficient in and of itself to establish detriment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 In the area of commercial or industrial trade secrets and confidential information, the value or significance of confidential information lies not in the information <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, but in the fact that the information is<span class="font-italic"> confidential</span> and not known to or readily available to the public at large: John Hull,<span class="font-italic"> Commercial Secrecy: Law and Practice</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1998) at p 44. In <span class="font-italic">A-G v Newspaper Publishing plc </span>[1989] 2 FSR 27 at 48, Donaldson LJ likened confidential information to an “ice cube”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Give it to the party who undertakes to keep it in his refrigerator and you still have an ice cube by the time the matter comes to trial…  Give it to the party who has no refrigerator or will not agree to keep it in one, and by the time of the trial you just have a pool of water which neither party wants. It is the inherently perishable nature of confidential information which gives rise to unique problems.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 I agree with the authors of <span class="font-italic">Gurry</span> at para 15.43 in preferring the view that “the requirement of detriment is not a discrete element, but rather is subsumed within both the nature of the information in question and the scope of the obligation”. I note that the same “basic” law of confidence generally applies to all types of information which passes the threshold test of confidentiality (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not readily available to the public at large). The range of information is enormous and is often organised into classes such as: (i) personal information; (ii) state and/or official information; (iii) business information; and (iv) trade secrets. That said, behind the classification of convenience there remains a question as to whether different nuances or details of the basic principles may apply depending on the nature of the information, the scope of the obligation and the circumstances under which the obligation arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I add by way of general observation that the question of detriment is also relevant to the remedy that is in issue given the nature or scope of the breach. For example, where the breach consists of unauthorised disclosure of the confidential information to the public at large (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, publication on a website), the unauthorised use (disclosure) has the effect of destroying the very subject matter of the confidence. On the other hand, where the unauthorised use comprises disclosure to just one other person (an indirect recipient) in breach of confidence, the information may still be confidential as a matter of law if that other person is caught by an obligation of confidentiality. In the former case, aside from an award of damages or accounting of profits, there is a tricky question as to whether there remains any basis for a grant of a final injunction against the defendant. On the other hand, in the latter case, the timely grant of injunctive relief against the defendant and the indirect recipient may: (i) preserve the confidentiality of the information and (ii) avoid the prospect of consequential losses to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Coming back to the case at hand, it appears that no tangible consequential loss was ultimately caused to NRL in light of the fact that the pitch to Summa Capital did not succeed. Indeed, I note for the time being that NRL does not contend that the Court ought to award damages beyond that necessary to “compensate” for benefits received by Mr Leiman under the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement. I will return to this issue in my analysis of the counterclaim below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 NRL further submits that Mr Leiman misused confidential information pertaining to the number of vessels owned by Noble.

When Itochu subsequently invested in Eximcoop believing that the funds would be used to expand Eximcoop and develop new business, part of the funds were instead used to repay CAROL without Itochu’s knowledge.

I further note some inconsistencies in the plaintiffs’ case as to whether NGL’s board of directors was involved in the decision to hire Messrs Carlier and Ozeias – contrary to what was pleaded, it appears that the board was not in fact consulted.

Even if Mr Leiman’s false representations in the hiring of Messrs Carlier and Ozeias amounted to breaches of his fiduciary or contractual duties, Noble’s conduct between 2007 and 2011/12 indicates that it did not consider these to be sufficiently serious or fundamental breaches (contrary to what they now argue) and that they had, in any event, waived or chosen not to pursue their objections. I also note that despite the alleged poor performance of Noble’s sugar mill operations in Brazil and the information which Noble already had about Messrs Carlier and Ozeias and the problems at Eximcoop, Mr Leiman was doing well at NGL and in regular receipt of annual discretionary bonuses. According to Mr Rubin, Mr Leiman “did do a lot of work and very hard work and very important work” during his tenure.

There are no express terms to this effect, and I am of the view that this is not an interpretation that a reasonable person with knowledge of the circumstances would come to on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Nor do I think it is appropriate, especially bearing in mind the well-known stringent tests for implying terms into a contract (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> at para 6.055), to read in an implied term that a past breach would disentitle Mr Leiman from his benefits under the agreement. This is especially so if the implied term included any past breach even if NRL/NGL knew of the breach or relevant facts and had still awarded Mr Leiman discretionary bonuses comprising shares and share options. If the position were otherwise it would mean that Mr Leiman and NRL were entering into an agreement whereby Mr Leiman was effectively surrendering shares and share options already awarded because of the past breach. It would be inequitable and in bad faith for NRL to enter into the contract knowing fully well that Mr Leiman would not be able to satisfy its terms on the basis of past conduct, and then later seeking to divest Mr Leiman of the benefits accruing under the contract as well as his past entitlements. I note that the defendants’ case as pleaded and fought at trial included a claim against Mr Leiman for an account and repayment of all salary, bonus and other payments he received from NRL from the date of his fiduciary and contractual breaches, although they have stated in their closing submissions they are no longer pursuing these claims. The point I make is that in the circumstances as a whole, there are insufficient grounds to suggest that the metaphorical officious bystander would have said, “it is obvious there must be this implied term,” or that the Settlement Agreement would not have made commercial sense and would have lacked business efficacy without such an implied term: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> at paras 6.060–6.064.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I note also that the tense used in cl 3(d) (“provided [Mr Leiman]<span class="font-italic"> does not act</span> in any way to the detriment of Noble” [emphasis added]) further suggests that the condition was meant to apply prospectively. Although a different tense was used for cl 3(c) (“provided that prior to exercise he has not acted in any way to the detriment of Noble”), this was by reference to the stipulated exercise date of the Share Options, and there is no indication that the parties intended for the conditions governing Mr Leiman’s entitlement to the Shares and the Share Options to be different. A plain reading thus militates against the defendants’ interpretation of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Hence, the R&amp;O Committee should not have considered Mr Leiman’s prior conduct in relation to Messrs Carlier and Ozeias when determining whether or not he had acted in a way detrimental to Noble’s interests within the meaning of cll 3(c) and (d) of the Settlement Agreement. It follows that the R&amp;O Committee could not have rationally based their decisions on such conduct. However, its decisions were also based on an independent alternative ground (Mr Leiman’s acts of competition against Noble) which I have earlier found to be valid in the sense that this decision was not capricious, arbitrary or made in bad faith. In other words, I find that the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions were valid, but only in so far as they were based on Mr Leiman’s acts of competition subsequent to the Settlement Agreement, and not on his conduct relating to the hiring of Messrs Carlier and Ozeias prior to the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether cl 3(c) of the Settlement Agreement is a penalty clause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Although I have upheld the validity of the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions, the plaintiffs also advance the further argument that cl 3(c) of the Settlement Agreement, which covers Mr Leiman’s entitlement to the Share Options, amounts to a penalty clause and is unenforceable. The plaintiffs point out that 37,090,910 out of the 44,818,182 Share Options had already vested and could have been exercised by Mr Leiman at any time prior to his resignation, under the Share Option Rules.

These distinctions originate in an over-literal reading of Lord Dunedin’s four tests and a tendency to treat them as almost immutable rules of general application which exhaust the field. In <span class="font-italic">Legione v Hateley</span> (1983) 152 CLR 406, 445, Mason and Deane JJ defined a penalty as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“A penalty, as its name suggests, is in the nature of a punishment for non-observance of a contractual stipulation; it consists of the imposition of an additional or different liability upon breach of the contractual stipulation ...”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All definition is treacherous as applied to such a protean concept. This one can fairly be said to be too wide in the sense that it appears to be apt to cover many provisions which would not be penalties (for example most, if not all, forfeiture clauses). However, in so far as it refers to “punishment” and “an additional or different liability” as opposed to “in terrorem” and “genuine pre-estimate of loss”, this definition seems to us to get closer to the concept of a penalty than any other definition we have seen. The real question when a contractual provision is challenged as a penalty is whether it is penal, not whether it is a pre-estimate of loss. These are not natural opposites or mutually exclusive categories. A damages clause may be neither or both. The fact that the clause is not a pre-estimate of loss does not therefore, at any rate without more, mean that it is penal. To describe it as a deterrent (or, to use the Latin equivalent, in terrorem) does not add anything. A deterrent provision in a contract is simply one species of provision designed to influence the conduct of the party potentially affected. It is no different in this respect from a contractual inducement. Neither is it inherently penal or contrary to the policy of the law. The question whether it is enforceable should depend on whether the means by which the contracting party’s conduct is to be influenced are “unconscionable” or (which will usually amount to the same thing) “extravagant” by reference to some norm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Instead, Lord Neuberger and Lord Sumption found at [32] the “true test” to be “whether the impugned provision is a secondary obligation which imposes a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 The plaintiffs highlight that the <span class="font-italic">Dunlop</span> test remains good law in Singapore.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Xia Zhengyan</span> (decided just before <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span>) expressly stated at [78] that the law in Singapore on this area is still basically embodied within the principles laid down by Lord Dunedin. Indeed, the Court of Appeal has not yet considered the relevance or applicability of the statements made in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span>. Nevertheless, the above passage in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> does not suggest that that <span class="font-italic">Dunlop</span> is no longer good law in the UK either. Instead, the point made in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> is that Lord Dunedin’s test in <span class="font-italic">Dunlop</span> remains “perfectly adequate” to determine the validity of “a straightforward damages clause”, but in other cases, “compensation is not necessarily the only legitimate interest that the innocent party may have in the performance of the defaulter’s primary obligations” (at [32]). In other words, “[a] damages clause may properly be justified by some other consideration than the desire to recover compensation for a breach”, and this will “depend on whether the innocent party has a legitimate interest in performance extending beyond the prospect of pecuniary compensation flowing directly from the breach in question” (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> has been cited in local decisions for the proposition that “the rule against penalty clauses regulates only remedies available for breach of a party’s primary obligations, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, only <span class="font-italic">secondary obligations</span>, and not the primary obligations themselves”: <span class="font-italic">Allplus Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Phoon Wui Nyen (Pan Weiyuan)</span> [2016] SGHC 144 at [15]. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> at [73], the rule does not empower courts to review the fairness of parties’ primary obligations. <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> has also been cited for “the strong initial presumption” in negotiated contracts between properly advised parties of comparable bargaining power that “the parties themselves are the best judges of what is legitimate in a provision dealing with the consequences of breach”: <span class="font-italic">iTronic Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Swee Leon and another suit</span> [2016] 3 SLR 663 (“<span class="font-italic">iTronic</span>”) at [177], citing <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> at [35]. It is not for the courts to relieve a party from the consequences of what may prove to be an onerous or possibly even a commercially imprudent bargain: <span class="font-italic">iTronic </span>at [177], citing <span class="font-italic">Export Credits Guarantee Department v Universal Oil Products Co </span>[1983] 1 WLR 399 at 403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 It is clear that cl 3(c) of the Settlement Agreement is not “a straightforward damages clause”. It provides for Mr Leiman’s entitlement to exercise the Share Options, subject to his forbearance to act in a way detrimental to Noble (see [28] above). In this connection, concepts such as “<span class="font-italic">in terrorem</span>” and “genuine pre-estimate of loss” mentioned in Lord Dunedin’s speech in <span class="font-italic">Dunlop</span> fit rather uneasily, just as Lord Neuberger and Lord Sumption observed in <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> (see [194] above). In such circumstances, my view is that the <span class="font-italic">Cavendish</span> inquiry as to whether the secondary obligation “imposes a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation” (at [32]) offers the most appropriate guidance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The defendants further cite the case of <span class="font-italic">Imam-Sadeque v Bluebay Asset Management (Services) Ltd </span>[2012] EWHC 3511 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Imam-Sadeque</span>”), the context and facts of which are quite close to those of the present case. That case involved a senior employee of an asset management company, Mr Imam-Sadeque, who had been remunerated over the years with shares under certain bonus plans which would vest at future dates. These shares were invested in fund units pursuant to Mr Imam-Sadeque’s directions. His entitlement to the shares under the bonus plans and the fund units would be dependent on whether he was a “good leaver”, if his employment were to be terminated before the vesting dates of the shares. He would not be considered a “good leaver” if he were to leave voluntarily. Mr Imam-Sadeque however entered into a compromise agreement with his employer, which provided that Mr Imam-Sadeque was to be treated as a “good leaver” for the purpose of the vesting of the fund units, provided that he complied with the terms of the compromise agreement and his employment contract. The employer later found out that Mr Imam-Sadeque had agreed to join a new asset management start-up, which he assisted in setting up and launching its competitive business while he was on garden leave. The employer thus argued that Mr Imam-Sadeque had breached his employment contract and the compromise agreement, and was thus not entitled to the fund units. In response, Mr Imam-Sadeque argued, among other things, that the relevant provisions in the compromise agreement concerning the forfeiture were unenforceable by reason of the penalty doctrine: <span class="font-italic">Imam-Sadeque</span> at [3]–[6] and [186].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Popplewell J rejected Mr Imam-Sadeque’s argument, finding that the penalty doctrine did not apply on the facts (at [204]). His first reason was that the compromise agreement “confer[red] upon [him] additional rights which he would not otherwise have had” (at [207]). This was an amendment to his existing rights under the bonus plans and was more advantageous to him. The additional rights were conditional upon the fulfilment of the condition of compliance with the relevant agreements, and were not acquired because these conditions were not fulfilled. Popplewell J’s second reason was that any forfeiture was only in respect of contingent future interests in the fund units, which were not equivalent to the payment of a money sum by Mr Imam-Sadeque upon breach so as to come within the penalty doctrine (at [210]). These rights were contingent upon Mr Imam-Sadeque being a “good leaver” or the vesting of the shares (at [211]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Popplewell J further held that even if the penalty doctrine were applicable in principle, the “forfeiture” provisions of the compromise agreement were not penal so as to be unenforceable (at [233]). In making this finding, Popplewell J considered, among other things, the fact that the parties were both sophisticated and of comparable bargaining power, that the compromise agreement contained a variety of rights and obligations which had their individual commercial justifications and value which could not be easily expressed in monetary terms, and the commercial objectives of such deferred remuneration plans (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the bonus plans) which were commonplace and in accordance with industry practice (at [225]–[230]). Popplewell J concluded that this was not a case where “the value of the rights forfeited exceeds the greatest loss which could conceivably be suffered from the breach”, and the true loss to the employer was likely to be impossible to establish and recover by a damages claim (at [228]). Instead, he expressed that “[i]t would be an injustice to [the employer] if Mr Imam-Sadeque could escape his bargain” by acting “in serious breach of his contractual duties as an employee, and yet still enjoy the benefits of the vested Fund Units” (at [229]–[230]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 While I am cognisant of the factual differences between the cases and certainly do not hastily conclude that they are identical in all material respects, I find the approach taken by Popplewell J in <span class="font-italic">Imam-Sadeque</span> (in particular, his first reason) to be largely instructive for the present purposes. In my view, this approach is also a generally sound one, although I prefer not to deal with the applicability of the penalty doctrine and the question of whether the relevant contractual provisions are penal as conceptually distinct or sequential inquiries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 In the present case, cl 8.3(a) of the Share Option Rules provides that any share option which is unexercised will “immediately lapse” once the participant “ceas[es] to be in the full-time employment” with Noble, “unless the [R&amp;O] Committee, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise”.

Mr Leiman is an experienced businessman and had comparable bargaining power. The Settlement Agreement and Advisory Agreement were negotiated in detail over numerous e-mails in which individual terms (especially ones related to the duration of Mr Leiman’s non-competition restrictions) were discussed and drafts were exchanged. It is not clear to me whether Mr Leiman obtained legal advice on these agreements, but he was at least alive to the need to do so.

The plaintiffs point to Mr Chan’s testimony that Noble was supposed to seek shareholders’ approval in due course and that there would be no difficulty in seeking such approval for Mr Leiman’s 5,652,421 shares.

Yet, this reply has to be seen in light of all the other evidence that contradicts the position that the shares had not been given up. First, there is the fact that cl 3(d) expressly states the number of shares as 17,276,013 (see [217] above). Next, there is the fact that the negotiations leading up to the signing of the Settlement Agreement did not betray an intention that cl 3(d) should be construed in any other way. And finally, there is also the existence of an entire agreement clause in relation to the subject matter of the Settlement Agreement, as manifested in cl 10.

</div> This clause, when read alongside cl 3(d), which states expressly that the Settlement Agreement covers only the 17,276,013 shares, gives strong support for the view that the 5,652,421 shares were not included under the Settlement Agreement. In the circumstances, I accepted Mr Alam’s evidence that his response of 26 April 2012, which stated that the R&amp;O Committee had denied the vesting on the basis that Mr Leiman had acted in a way inimical to Noble’s interests, was indeed a mistake.

But this, I think, turns the matter on its head. The question is not about which shares were stated to be excluded from the Settlement Agreement; rather, it is about which shares are included under it. As stated above, I find that the effect of cl 3(d) read with cl 10 of the Settlement Agreement is clear – the 17,276,013 shares referred to under cl 3(d) exhaustively lays out the number of shares Mr Leiman was entitled to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 It may well be that under the AIP, shares are not <span class="font-italic">automatically</span> forfeited upon Mr Leiman ceasing to be employed by NRL.

The problem, however, is cl 5. The restricted period for these shares was two years from the award date of 4 May 2011.

This is because cl 3(e) of the Settlement Agreement only provides that Mr Leiman “shall be entitled to be considered for a 2011 discretionar<span class="font-italic">y</span> bonus by the Company which (<span class="font-italic">if any</span>) will be payable in April 2012 [emphasis added]” (see [28] above). Clause 3(e) does not guarantee that Mr Leiman will be paid a bonus, but only that he will be considered for a bonus. It bears repeating that cl 10 of the Settlement Agreement sets out an entire agreement provision. In my view, it is far more likely that if Mr Elman or Mr Rubin had mentioned the 2011 discretionary bonus, all that was said was that he would be considered for the discretionary bonus in the normal manner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 In <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 30 (“<span class="font-italic">Latham Scott</span>”), the Court of Appeal held (at [72]) that unless the bonus (in an employment contract) had been expressed to be guaranteed, an employee could not claim to be legally entitled to a bonus, the granting and quantum of which are entirely at the discretion of the employer. Evidently, in such cases, much will turn on the construction of the particular provision on bonus payments to see whether the parties had intended the bonus to be guaranteed: see <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee v Citra Group Pte Ltd and others </span>[2015] 2 SLR 603 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [147].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236  In <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott</span>, the relevant provision stated that “a bonus may be paid to you at the end of each calendar year, based on Company profitability and your performance during the year”: at [56].

On the one hand fell cases like <span class="font-italic">Nomura</span> (see [92] above) and <span class="font-italic">Keen v Commerzbank AG</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 1536, where the claimant employees sought higher bonuses than those that were declared by their employers. Whilst the employee in <span class="font-italic">Nomura</span> was awarded no bonus (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he was awarded a zero bonus), the point is that at least the matter of his bonus had been considered. Against this were cases like <span class="font-italic">Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald International </span>[2005] ICR 402 (“<span class="font-italic">Horkulak</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Rutherford </span>itself, where the employer had not even made a decision at all about its employee’s bonus, whether that decision was to award a lower bonus than the employee had expected, or to award none at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 The court in <span class="font-italic">Rutherford </span>stated (at [76]) that in the former class of case, the dissatisfied employee would have to show the perversity or irrationality of the employer’s decision to declare a bonus that was (invariably) lower in quantum than what the claimant employee would be satisfied with. In the latter class of case, since there was no decision at all, there could be no question of perversity or irrationality of an existing decision to either award a bonus or none at all. If there is an obligation on the employer to consider the employee’s entitlement to a bonus, then the employer would have been in breach of that obligation for not even making a decision regarding its employee’s bonus. The court would then have to put itself in the employer’s position and consider the employee’s possible entitlement to the bonus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 Additionally, if an employer is obligated to exercise its discretion to consider the question of its employee’s bonus, then in order not to render the contractual bonus provision otiose, when the employer does in fact exercise its discretion, it must do so rationally and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 In <span class="font-italic">Horkulak</span>, the bonus provision in the employment contract stated that the employer “may in its discretion, pay [the employee] an annual discretionary bonus … the amount of which shall be mutually agreed by [the employee], the chief executive of the company and the president of Cantor Fitzgerald Ltd Partnership, [although] the final decision shall be in the sole discretion of the President of Cantor Fitzgerald Ltd Partnership”. That provision also stated that it was a condition precedent to the payment of the bonus that the employee shall “exercise best endeavours to maximise the commission revenue” and that he should still be working for the employer: see [11]. In affirming the decision of the judge below, Potter LJ stated (at [46]—[47]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the judge was correct ... to hold that the claimant was entitled, had he remained in [the defendants’] employment, to a <span class="font-weight-bold">bona fide and rational</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exercise by [the employer] of their discretion as to whether or not to pay him a bonus and in what sum. It is correct … that the contractual discretion is drafted in wider terms than those employed in the earlier cases. The use and positioning of the word “may” attaches the discretion to the obligation to pay a bonus at all rather than to the assessment of the amount payable (cf <span class="font-italic">Clark v BET plc</span>) and it lays down no specific criterion of “individual performance” (cf <span class="font-italic">Clark v Nomura</span><span class="font-italic"> International plc</span>) and no prima facie formula for calculation (cf <span class="font-italic">Mallone v BPB</span><span class="font-italic"> Industries Ltd</span>) … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is of course the position that the contract in this case leaves at large the amount of such bonus or the rate at which it will be payable; there is no particular formula or point of reference for its calculation. It does however, provide for a process of attempted mutual agreement as between the employee, the chief executive and the president prior to the making of any final decision in the discretion of the president. This provision emphasises the obligation of [the employer] to consider the question of payment of a bonus (and amount) as a <span class="font-weight-bold">rational and bona fide, as opposed to an irrational and arbitrary</span>, exercise when taking into account such criteria as [the employer] adopt[s] for the purpose of arriving at their decision. <span class="font-weight-bold">Failure so to construe it would strip the bonus provision … of any contractual value or content in respect of the employee whom it is designed to benefit and motivate. It would </span><span class="font-weight-bold">fly in the face of the principles of trust and confidence which have been held to underpin the employment relationship.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold and internal citations omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 At first blush, the test of perversity or irrationality of an employer’s exercise of discretion (see [241] above) may seem different from the requirement that the employer exercises its discretion rationally and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> (see [243] above). But I think they are ultimately both sides of the same coin, as evident from the quoted extract from <span class="font-italic">Horkulak</span> where Potter LJ juxtaposed at [47] the “rational and bona fide, as opposed to [the] irrational and arbitrary”. This is also consistent with the UK Supreme Court’s statement in<span class="font-italic"> British Telecommunicat</span><span class="font-italic">ions </span>at [37] that “a contractual discretion must be exercised in good faith and not arbitrarily or capriciously”: see [112] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 I pause to note that in such cases, the requirement to act rationally and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> (as opposed to irrationally, arbitrarily or <span class="font-italic">mala fide</span>) is not an application of any “good faith” doctrine as such. Whilst this is not a point on which the parties raised submissions, I make clear that this Court is aware that the existence of a doctrine of good faith in contract law has long been the subject matter of dispute and discourse. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 518, the Court of Appeal, after reviewing the approaches taken in other common law jurisdictions, concluded at [44] that a duty of good faith could not be implied <span class="font-italic">in law</span> into an agency agreement. On the other hand, as the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (see [81] above) observed at para 6.074, this does not mean that a duty of good faith will never be implied in a contract based on the <span class="font-italic">particular factual matrix</span> of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Indeed, I would add that it is also clear that terms closely related to the concept of good faith may be implied by law in appropriate areas. For example, the well-known and well-established duty of fidelity that is imposed on an employee (subject, of course, to qualification by express terms) has an obvious affinity with the concept of good faith. Nevertheless, as Quentin Loh J in <span class="font-italic">Cheah </span><span class="font-italic">Peng Hock v Luzhou Bio-Chem Technology Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 577 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span>”) observed at [45] and [46], the implied term of mutual trust and confidence or fidelity imposed on the employee and employer should not to be confused with a duty of good faith. As he explained, a duty of good faith was a more far-reaching concept which might impose positive duties, fetter parties’ freedom to contract, and even conflict with written terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 I also note in passing the decision of Lionel Yee JC in <span class="font-italic">Brader Daniel John</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Commerzbank AG</span> [2014] 2 SLR 81 (“<span class="font-italic">Brader</span>”). In that case, the employer had announced that a minimum guaranteed pool had been established from which bonuses for the year 2008 would be paid out to employees. This was followed by a letter to the plaintiffs declaring that the bonus was provisionally awarded to them for 2008 and that the bonus would be reviewed if there were material deviations from the employer’s earnings. Subsequently, the employees were informed that the bonus awards had been reduced by 90% <span class="font-italic">pro rata</span>. The plaintiffs brought an action for the balance 90% or damages. The primary argument was that the earlier announcement amounted to a legally binding contractual promise that there was a bonus pool with a guaranteed minimum that would be paid out regardless of the employer’s financial performance. The alternative argument was that the failure to pay the bonus in full was a breach of the employer’s duty to behave in a way that preserved the trust and confidence that an employee should have in its employer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 As can be seen, <span class="font-italic">Brader</span> concerned a case where the employer had declared a bonus. The main issue was whether this had the effect of being a contractually binding promise that could be enforced by the plaintiffs. Yee JC found that the declaration did amount to a binding contract that the employer would pay all or substantially all of the pool to the employees as bonus. As far as the alternative argument was concerned, the court in <span class="font-italic">Brader</span> found that on the facts there was no breach of the implied term of trust and confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 Whilst the facts in <span class="font-italic">Brader </span>are different from the case at hand, I note that the High Court accepted at [110] the proposition that there is a term implied <span class="font-italic">in law</span> that an employer shall not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee. Yee JC also cited <span class="font-italic">Wong Leong Wei Edward v Acclaim Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd</span> [2010] SGHC 352 and <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> (see [246] above) in support of this proposition (at [111] and [112])<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 The short point is that <span class="font-italic">Brader</span> provides further support for the proposition that where the contract provides or confers on the employer a discretion to award bonus payments, the employee is entitled, at the very least, to be considered by the employer for such an award. Second, whilst the employer may well enjoy a very broad discretion in the decision reached, the decision should be made rationally and not arbitrarily or capriciously. As was said in <span class="font-italic">Horkulak </span>at [30], references to good faith in the context of the contract is as a “requirement necessary to give genuine value, rather than nominal force or mere lip-service, to the obligation of the party required or empowered to exercise the relevant discretion”. The point is that “[w]hile, in any such situation, the parties are likely to have conflicting interests and the provisions of the contract effectively place the resolution of that conflict in the hands of the party exercising the discretion, it is presumed to be the reasonable expectation and therefore the common intention of the parties that there should be a genuine and rational as opposed to an empty or irrational, exercise of discretion.” Indeed, as Potter LJ stated in <span class="font-italic">Horkulak </span>at [47], failure to read in an obligation on the part of the employer to consider the question of an employee’s bonus rationally and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> may very well “fly in the face of the principles of trust and confidence which have been held to underpin the employment relationship”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 To this, I hasten to add that the requirement to act rationally and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> is not to be seen as an invitation for the court to question the employer’s decision at every turn simply because the court would reach a different decision. In cases such as the present, the court is merely charged with enforcing that entitlement and there is little scope for intensive scrutiny of the decision-making process: <span class="font-italic">Braganza</span> at [57].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 I note that in <span class="font-italic">Tan Hup Thye v Refco (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (in members’ voluntary liquidation) </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1069 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Hup Thye</span>”), Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held that the position in Singapore is different from that in the UK in so far as the question of an employer’s duties in exercising its discretion to award bonuses is concerned. Prakash J took the view that whilst the English authorities seemed to be moving in the direction of fettering an employer’s right to exercise its discretion in this regard, the Singapore position favoured the view that the employer’s discretion is unfettered: at [69]–[71]. In particular, Prakash J held that she was bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In that case, the contract stated that a bonus “may be paid” at the end of each calendar year based on profitability and performance (see [236] above). The Court of Appeal held that the employee (who had been dismissed) did not have a legal right to claim a bonus even if he had continued to be employed. The right to a bonus was not guaranteed, and the grant and the quantum of any bonus was held to be entirely a matter of the employer’s discretion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 The High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Hup Thye </span>and the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Latham</span><span class="font-italic"> Scott </span>were not, however, raised in the closing submissions of the parties. Nevertheless, I observe that the question whether the employer might at least be required to make the decision on a rational and non-capricious manner was not a point specifically raised nor ultimately decided in <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott.</span> Further, I note Tan Siong Thye J’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee </span>at [149] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he implied term of mutual trust and confidence in employment contracts was not argued before the court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Hup Thye</span> and since that decision, the implied term of mutual trust and confidence has been accepted in Singapore as an implied term in law subject to express terms stating otherwise or the context implying otherwise (<span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock v Luzhou Bio-Chem Technology Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 577 at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 With due respect to the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Hup Thye </span>and bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> I am of the view that the question, therefore, is not only whether NGL had considered the 2011 Bonus, but whether it had considered the question rationally and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, bearing in mind that the court is not to overturn the employer’s decision just because it disagrees with the outcome reached or the reasons cited for the employer’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 Having considered the plaintiffs’ submissions on this, I conclude that their case fails on this issue. They point to Mr Alam’s evidence that the 2011 Bonus was not considered at the 1 March 2012 or the 27 March 2012 meetings of the R&amp;O Committee.

</div> As for Mr Banga, it is not clear why the fact that he was under a “different scheme” as far as bonuses are concerned should affect the consideration that Noble’s poor quarterly performance ought to result in no bonuses for its top executives.

</div> Indeed, if even one who appears not to be under a discretionary bonus scheme never got a bonus because of Noble’s poor quarterly performance, then I do not see why an employee in the position of Mr Leiman, whose entitlement is to be <span class="font-italic">considered</span> for a <span class="font-italic">discretionary</span> bonus, should be in any better a position. Further, I note that in an e-mail dated 11 May 2012 from Mr Alam to Mr Leiman, the only reason mentioned for not awarding the 2011 Bonus was in relation to Mr Leiman’s alleged breaches of duties.

Mr Elman and Mr Alam’s actions in delaying the exercise of the Share Options was only after they had received preliminary reports from Wolfe Associates and the PI, and it was entirely reasonable for them to have wanted to hold off the exercise until the R&amp;O Committee convened to make a decision regarding Mr Leiman’s entitlements, so as to protect the interests of Noble and its shareholders.

This suggests that Mr Elman and Mr Alam were unduly eager to buttress the case against Mr Leiman before the R&amp;O Committee.

The conduct complained of can, in brief, be organised into the following categories for convenience:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) engaging in acts that amounted to competition with Noble whilst he was still an advisor to NRL;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) approaching and soliciting senior management employees of Noble;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) using and/or disclosing confidential information belonging to Noble; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) failing to disclose (or to disclose adequately) to Noble the issues that had arisen in respect of Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, Eximcoop and the related legal problems.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 It will be recalled that the issue before this Court in respect of the plaintiffs’ claim was whether the defendants were able to show that the R&amp;O Committee had acted properly in exercising the contractual power to deny the exercise of the Share Options and to forfeit the Shares on the basis that Mr Leiman had acted to the detriment of Noble. I note that, strictly speaking, the R&amp;O Committee was <span class="font-italic">not</span> making a decision as a matter of law that Mr Leiman had breached the non-competition obligation, the duty of confidence and duty of fidelity. Instead what was being decided by the R&amp;O Committee was whether Mr Leiman had acted to the detriment of Noble or engaged in conduct inimical to the interests of Noble, even though the matters of concern before the R&amp;O Committee concerned acts of competition and so on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 It follows that the Court, in evaluating whether the R&amp;O Committee decision was valid, was not deciding as such whether Mr Leiman had breached his contractual duty of fidelity, non-compete obligations, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. Whilst his contractual duties were of course relevant to the parameters of the enquiry, the key issue was simply whether the R&amp;O Committee had acted properly (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not arbitrarily, in bad faith or in a capricious manner) in coming to the decisions it did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 On the facts, I found that there was a proper basis for the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions <span class="font-italic">viz </span>the evidence and material showing that Mr Leiman had engaged in acts of competition which exceeded mere preparatory steps. Further, I found in any case that the R&amp;O Committee had further grounds in that Mr Leiman had made unauthorised use of Noble’s confidential information in the course of his acts of competition, even though the R&amp;O Committee did not expressly rely on this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 For the avoidance of doubt, I make clear that I find that Mr Leiman was indeed in breach of his duty of fidelity and the contractual non-compete provisions discussed earlier. Further, I find that Mr Leiman was in breach of his duty not to misuse the confidential information of Noble in his approaches to Summa Capital and BTG Pactual: see [163]–[164] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 The question that now arises for the counterclaim is whether NRL succeeds in its prayer for certain monetary relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 NRL’s case is that Mr Leiman is liable to account for and repay the following sums:

Nevertheless, for completeness, I add that it does not appear that any specific loss was caused by the misuse of the confidential information: see [170] above. Further, there is no evidence at all before the Court as to what losses if any were caused to NRL as a result of Mr Leiman’s acts of competition whilst he was still an advisor of NRL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 NRL submits that an implied term or implied warranty exists in the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement that Mr Leiman had complied with his duties under the Employment Agreement. Its position is that it only entered into these agreements on the premise that Mr Leiman had complied with all the terms of the Employment Agreement.

</div> However, Mr Leiman had in fact instead been in breach of his duty of fidelity and/or fiduciary duties given his failure to disclose to or warn Noble adequately or at all of the problems relating to Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 I am unable to agree with NRL’s submissions. Whilst in hindsight it may have been desirable for NRL to have required such a warranty in the Settlement Agreement and Advisory Agreement, I do not see how the implication of such a term or warranty is “obvious” or necessary to give business efficacy to the agreements. Mr Leiman had been employed by NRL since 31 March 2006. During the course of his employment Mr Leiman had evidently performed well enough that he was chosen to be the new CEO of NGL on 1 January 2010. By this time, it will be recalled that Noble had already received the 2008 Wolfe Memo which indicated problems or issues concerning Messrs Carlier and Ozeias. Noble has internal legal counsel, human resource department managers and so on, and have engaged investigators before. They are clearly aware of the importance of conducting their own due diligence enquiries when engaging senior management level staff including the COO. It is also clear that Mr Elman as Chairman and former CEO was, as he described in his own words, “intimately involved” in the running of Noble even up until the time of the trial,

</div> For example, the Employment Agreement stated that Mr Leiman would report to and be subject to the direction of Mr Elman in the latter’s capacity as CEO (see [12(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 It will be recalled that at the time the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement were being discussed, serious disputes had arisen between Mr Leiman and Mr Elman over management and other matters. Mr Elman was unhappy with Mr Leiman’s conduct or performance as CEO (a position to which the latter had only relatively recently been appointed). In these circumstances, I find there is no implied term or warranty that Mr Leiman had complied with his duties under the Employment Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 It follows that the counterclaim for return of the sums that Mr Leiman received under the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement must fail. It is not NRL’s case that there has been total failure of consideration, and in any case it would be hard to see any basis for such an assertion. Whilst there was some suggestion that Mr Leiman did not perform adequately as an advisor in that he submitted very little by way of reports,

</div>
</div> there is no claim made against Mr Leiman for breach or repudiation on that account. Instead, the claim for return of the sums paid to Mr Leiman appears to be founded simply on the submission that if NRL had known that Mr Leiman had breached his duties under the Employment Agreement, NRL would never have entered into the subsequent Settlement Agreement and Advisory Agreement and/or would have terminated his employment on the grounds of breach of warranty.

</div> With respect, this is a submission I am unable to accept.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285  Given the numerous issues raised by the pleadings and submissions, I set out a summary of the main findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">The locus standi</span> <span class="font-italic">is</span><span class="font-italic">sue</span>. I find that Mr Leiman does have <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to bring this suit for breach of the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement. I also find that Rothschild Trust has <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to bring this suit as NRL had agreed that the Adelaide Trust was entitled under the AIP and the Share Option Rules to the Shares and the Share Options.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">The pleading issue</span>. I find that the plaintiffs’ omission to expressly plead that the R&amp;O Committee is an agent of NRL and/or NGL does not make their cause of action invalid.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">The issue of whether the R&amp;O Committee reached a final determination</span>. I find that the R&amp;O Committee did in fact reach a final determination under the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">Whether the R&amp;O Committee decisions were valid</span>. I find that the decisions were validly made for the reasons that were extensively set out earlier. These include the evidence and material relating to Mr Leiman’s engaging in acts of competition against the interests of Noble as well as misuse of confidential information.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-italic">Whether cl 3(c) of the Settlement Agreement is void as a penalty.</span> I find that the clause is not void as a penalty.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) <span class="font-italic">The 5,652,421 shares not expressly mentioned in the Settlement Agreement</span>. I find that these shares are not covered by the Settlement Agreement. The R&amp;O Committee had a proper basis for forfeiting these shares under cl 5 of the AIP.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) <span class="font-italic">The 2011 Bonus</span>. I find that there was no breach by NRL in respect of the 2011 Bonus. The issue of the 2011 Bonus had been discussed and the decision reached was that none of the senior management would receive a bonus for 2011 because of the poor performance of NGL. Further, in the case of Mr Leiman, there were the problems arising from the perceived acts of competition, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) <span class="font-italic">The economic torts</span>. I find that the claims for conspiracy, inducing breach of contract and unlawful interference fail.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-italic">NRL’s counterclaim</span>. Whilst I find that Mr Leiman is in breach of his non-competition obligations and his duty of fidelity, there is no basis for NRL’s claim to repayment of the retainer fee that was paid to Mr Leiman under the Advisory Agreement and the six months’ base salary as notice period payment under cl 2 of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 For these reasons, I dismiss both the plaintiffs’ claim and NRL’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 Finally, I turn to the issue of costs. It is a well-established principle that costs are generally to follow the event: O 59 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). Order 59 r 6A then provides that “where a party has failed to establish any claim or issue which he has raised in any proceedings, and has thereby unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted, or added to the costs or complexity of those proceedings, the Court may order that the costs of that party shall not be allowed in whole or in part”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 Further, I note that in a situation where both the claim and the counterclaim are dismissed, the court will look to whether the subject matter of the counterclaim was identical to or part of the defence. This will determine whether there should be a substantial costs paid by the defendant in relation to the counterclaim or an apportionment of the costs: <span class="font-italic">Mok Kwong Yue v Ding Leng Kong </span>[2012] 1 SLR 737, citing <span class="font-italic">Medway Oil and Storage Co Ltd v Continental Contractors Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1929] 1 AC 88.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 Whilst the defendants have substantially succeeded in defending the plaintiffs’ claim, they did not succeed on all of the issues and points raised. In particular, I note that the defendants led an extensive amount of evidence relating to Eximcoop and Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, and their cross-examination of the plaintiffs’ witnesses on this issue took up a considerable amount of time at the trial (totalling several days). As I found at [190] above, Mr Leiman’s prior conduct in relation to Messrs Carlier and Ozeias was not a valid ground upon which the R&amp;O Committee could have determined that he had acted in a way detrimental to Noble’s interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 I also note that the counterclaim was dismissed. Although NRL chose to abandon its prayers for an account and repayment of all payments received by Mr Leiman from the date of his breaches of fiduciary and contractual duties and the profits he received from the sale of NGL shares that had been given to him over the years, this was only communicated to the plaintiffs and the Court during closing submissions: see [53] above. I accept that the counterclaim in large part related to the issues in the main claim and evidence regarding Mr Leiman’s conduct and entitlements, but the focus in the main claim was on the evidence before the R&amp;O Committee (to determine whether it had a valid basis to find that Mr Leiman had acted to Noble’s detriment) whilst evidence of Mr Leiman’s conduct subsequent to the R&amp;O Committee’s decisions was more relevant for the purposes of the counterclaim (to determine whether he had in fact breached his contractual and fiduciary duties). I am cognisant of the fact that the counterclaim was brought by NRL alone (having <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> as Mr Leiman’s formal employer and a party to the relevant agreements), but I see no reason to split hairs by making distinct orders as to costs for each of the defendants given their relationship and unified conduct in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 Having considered the overall conduct and outcome of these proceedings, I am of the view that the defendants should be allowed to recover costs from the plaintiffs, but not in full.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">292 I, therefore, order the plaintiffs to pay two-thirds of the defendants’ costs in these proceedings. The quantum of the defendants’ costs in these proceedings is to be agreed upon or taxed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andre Francis Maniam <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Liew Yik Wee, Sim Mei Ling, Joel Quek and Jeremy Tan (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Davinder Singh <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Jaikanth Shankar, Tan Ruoyu and Srruthi Ilankathir (Drew &amp; Napier LLC, instructed) and Kenetth Pereira and Jeremy Bay (Aldgate Chambers LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
