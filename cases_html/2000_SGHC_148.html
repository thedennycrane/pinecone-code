<p align="justify">This was an appeal against the decision of district judge Kathryn Low Lye Fong on

17 February 2000. The learned judge found the appellant guilty of three charges of rape and one

charge of abetment of rape. The charges were as follows:</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2 Initially, the appellant was to be jointly tried with Muhammad Zainudin Bin

Sanwan, PW8 ('Dino'). Dino faced one charge of rape against the same victim, Marzalina Bte Mohammad

Ali, PW3 ('Nana') and one charge of abetting the appellant to commit rape on Nana. With the consent

of the appellant and Dino, the joint trial was held in the district court. On the first day of the

trial, Dino pleaded guilty to the charge of rape and consented that the charge of abetting the

appellant to commit rape be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. Dino was sentenced to

five years' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The prosecution's case</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">3 The case for the prosecution was largely based on the evidence proffered by

Nana and her friend, Nazariah Bte Nazlan, PW4 ('Yana').</p>
<p align="justify">4 According to Nana, she accompanied Yana to Bukit Batok on 13 July 1999 at about

6.00 pm. Yana wanted to collect some belongings from her ex-boyfriend Mohammad Hairil Bin Rosle, DW2

('Hairil'). They reached Bukit Batok at about 8.00 pm and met Hairil at a sepak takraw court. At

that time, Hairil was playing sepak takraw with some boys who were also Yana's friends. Among the

boys was the appellant, whose nickname was 'Boy'. Nana, Yana and Adek (the appellant's girlfriend)

watched the game and chit-chatted while the boys played sepak takraw.</p>
<p align="justify">5 After the game ended at about 10.00 pm, the appellant escorted his girlfriend

to the bus-stop and went home to change his clothes. In the meantime, Nana, Yana, Hairil and his

friends remained at the sepak takraw court and chit-chatted. At about 11.40 pm, they went to

Hairil's two-storey flat at Blk 526 Bukit Batok St 52 #02-90 and watched television. The appellant

joined them at Hairil's flat. Subsequently, the appellant, Yana and a few others went to a 7-Eleven

store to buy coke, stout, Jack Daniel's whisky and some snacks. Thereafter, they proceeded to

'little Guilin' lake, which is in the vicinity of Hairil's flat, and had some drinks there. In the

meantime, Nana, Dino, Hairil and another boy by the name of Romi remained at the flat.</p>
<p align="justify">6 At about 3.00 am, the appellant and Yana went to Hairil's flat and invited Nana

and Dino to join them at the lake for drinks. The four of them then went to the lake. At the lake,

Nana consumed about one-eighth to a quarter of the bottle of Jack Daniel's whisky and became drunk.

She recalled that she was also offered Guiness stout and coke but threw up after consuming them.

Further, she attempted to jump into the lake in her drunken state. She passed out at one point and

found herself lying with her head on Dino's lap when she came to. She then went to a cave with Dino

and vomited there. After that, she asked Dino to bring her back to Hairil's flat. Dino then asked

the appellant to help him bring Nana back to the flat. By this time, Yana had already returned to

the flat on her own.</p>
<p align="justify">7 Nana claimed that, although she was drunk, she was not totally unconscious. She

recalled that Dino and the appellant brought her to Hairil's flat. She recognised them by their

voices. She also recalled that she was carried by either Dino or the appellant at some point along

the way to Hairil's flat. According to Dino, it was almost 5.00 am when he and the appellant reached

Hairil's flat with Nana. Nana stated that she was placed on the sofa in the living room on the lower

floor of the flat. She recalled that she was lying with her head on the left side of the sofa. From

this position, she could see the staircase to the upper floor of the flat. She could also tell that

all the lights on the lower floor of the flat were switched off. When she was about to doze off, she

felt her shorts being pulled down and then felt an object, which she later realised was a penis,

moving in and out of her vagina. Nana claimed that she saw the appellant's face about 2  feet in

front of her as she opened her eyes. She felt pain in her private part and realised that she was

being raped by the appellant. She wanted to put up a struggle but was too exhausted and drunk to do

so.</p>
<p align="justify">8 The appellant's thrusting action lasted about two or three minutes. After that,

Nana heard the appellant ask Dino to help him carry her from the sofa to the floor. Dino then

carried her by her shoulders while the appellant carried her legs. When she was on the floor, Nana

felt the hard object moving in and out of her vagina again. She opened her eyes and saw the

appellant's face before her again. Then, Nana heard the appellant ask Dino, "Din, do you want

to do it or not?". Dino replied, "Alright". At this point, the appellant was still

having sexual intercourse with Nana. The appellant then rose and went into the kitchen. Nana did not

see his face but could see the structure of his body. Dino then started to have sexual intercourse

with Nana for about two or three minutes. Nana thought that everything was over when Dino stopped.

However, she then felt something hard moving in and out of her vagina again. She turned her head and

saw the appellant's face in front of her. The thrusting lasted for two or three minutes. After that,

the appellant pulled up Nana's panties and told Dino to carry her upstairs to Hairil's room. Nana

slept on the floor in Hairil's room until the next day.</p>
<p align="justify">9 Nana woke up the next morning and found Dino sleeping next to her. She told

Yana in private that Dino and the appellant had had sexual intercourse with her and that she felt

pain in her private part. Yana suggested that they talk about it later and told Nana to behave as

though nothing had happened. They both went back to sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">10 When Yana and Nana woke up in the afternoon, Romi, Hairil, Dino and the

appellant were in the room. Nana felt frightened and kept quiet as Dino and the appellant were

Yana's friends. She left Hairil's flat with Yana at about 6.00 pm. On the way home, Nana told Yana

more about the incident. Yana then advised her to lodge a police report. However, Nana was afraid to

do so as she had consumed liquor when she was underage. At home, Yana called Dino and the appellant

on the phone and confronted them about the incident. They both denied that they had had sexual

intercourse with Nana.</p>
<p align="justify">11 Nana told her mother, Mariamah Bte May, PW7 about the incident one week later.

Despite her mother's advice, Nana refused to lodge a police report. On 1 August 1999, she lodged a

police report at 4.00 am at the Marine Parade police post. Subsequently, she was sent for a medical

examination. Dr Lisa Wong, PW6, conducted the examination and concluded on 10 August 1999 that there

were hymenal tears at the 4 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions.</p>
<p align="justify">12 Apart from Nana and Yana's account of the facts, the prosecution relied on the

following evidence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Dino, PW8, testified that he witnessed the appellant having sexual

  intercourse with Nana on three occasions on the morning of 14 July 1999. He also stated that the

  appellant had asked him, while he was having sexual intercourse with Nana on the floor of Hairil's

  flat, if he wanted to 'do it'.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Nana's mother, PW7, testified as to what Nana had told her approximately

  one week after the incident.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The photographs, P7 to P17, showed the vicinity where the flat was located,

  the layout of the corridor and rooms in the flat, the 7-Eleven store and the 'little Guilin' lake.

  In addition, there were sketch plans (P18, P18A and P19) of the lower and upper floors of Hairil's

  flat.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Dr Leow Kee Fong, PW5's medical report at P21 stated that there was no

  indication of impotence in the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) The Investigating Officer, Inspector Soh Kien Peng, PW9 stated that the

  lighting at the scene of the crime (the living room of the flat) was sufficient. He came to this

  conclusion after investigating the flat on 7 August 1999 and surveying the visibility conditions

  of the living room at 2.00 am. Initially, PW9 noted that there was a 24 hour coffee shop (Aliff

  Restaurant) opposite the flat, a mirror in the living room that reflected light from outside the

  flat and lighting from the corridor outside the flat. However, PW9 subsequently corrected his

  earlier position and stated that the coffee shop opposite the flat was no longer operating on a

  24-hour basis. PW9 also revealed later that the purpose of the visit to Hairil's flat on 7 August

  1999 was to ambush and arrest Dino, whom he figured might look for Hairil at the flat. PW9 had

  gone up to the flat with his colleague, Inspector Abdul Halim at about 1.00 am, and had only

  entered the living room 'for a second' to see if Dino was there. PW9 had also walked to the

  balcony to have a quick look. Accordingly, PW9 had only made a brief and casual observation of the

  conditions of the flat at that time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The defence</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">13 The crux of the appellant's defence was that he was not at Hairil's flat at

the time Nana was said to have been raped. He claimed that he was wrongly identified by Nana.</p>
<p align="justify">14 The appellant claimed that he helped Dino bring Nana back to Hairil's flat

from the lake at about 4.50 am to 5.00 am. At first, the appellant and Dino supported Nana by

placing her hands over their shoulders. When Nana became more unsteady, the appellant carried her in

his arms. He later asked Dino to support her as she was getting too heavy. They reached the flat

about half an hour later. At the door, he held Nana while Dino opened the door. He then passed Nana

to Dino and told the latter that he wanted to go home. Accordingly, the appellant left Hairil's flat

at about 5.15 am to 5.30 am and reached home between 5.30 am to 5.45 am. When he reached home, his

mother asked where he and his brother had been. The appellant replied that he had been downstairs.

He then went to his room and slept.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">15 The judge was persuaded that the case against the appellant had been proven

beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, she convicted him on all four charges.</p>
<p align="justify">16 The judge considered the following issues before arriving at her conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) whether Nana correctly identified the appellant as the person who raped her

  on three occasions and who asked Dino if he wanted to 'do it' on the morning of 14 July 1999; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) whether Dino's evidence that he saw the appellant raping Nana on three

  occasions on 14 July 1999 and that he was asked by the appellant to 'do it' could be relied upon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Identification of the appellant</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">17 The judge held the appellant had been correctly identified by Nana. Although

Nana was drunk, she was not completely unaware of what was happening around her. She was able to

tell that she was assisted by Dino and the appellant on the way back to Hairil's flat. She could

also explain how the appellant was positioned when he was having sexual intercourse with her. She

said that the appellant's upper body was at an angle facing her and that he supported himself with

his two arms which were placed by her side. Nana could also hear the words exchanged between the

accused and Dino prior to Dino having sexual intercourse with her. In addition, she saw the

appellant's back as he went to the kitchen after having sexual intercourse with her.</p>
<p align="justify">18 Further, the judge found that Nana's identification of the appellant was

corroborated by Dino. In court, Dino had said that he saw the appellant having sexual intercourse

with Nana on three occasions on the morning of 14 July 1999. As Dino was a co-accused until halfway

through the first day of the trial, the judge felt that there was no question of collaboration

between Nana and Dino. Dino was also no longer in court when Nana gave her identification evidence.

The fact that Dino pleaded guilty to the charge of rape against him and consented to the charge of

abetting the appellant to commit rape being taken into consideration further buttressed the

prosecution's contention that Nana had correctly identified Dino as one of the two persons who had

non-consensual sexual intercourse with her on 14 July 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">19 The judge did not think that the poor lighting in Hairil's flat rendered

Nana's identification of the appellant unreliable. Hairil stated that his living room would not be

in complete darkness even if the lights were switched off. Although Inspector Soh, PW9,

misrepresented the nature of his visit to Hairil's flat, the judge did not doubt that he did in fact

go up to the flat to see if Dino was there at about 2.00 am on 7 August 1999. Inspector Soh had

found that the flat was not in total darkness. He claimed that one could recognise a person who was

standing on one side of the living room from the other side if one knew the person. In this case,

Nana should not have had difficulty identifying the appellant as the person who raped her as his

face could not have been more than 2 to 3 feet from hers. The judge also noted that the appellant

and Dino were not complete strangers to Nana. She had met them earlier in the evening and even knew

them by their nicknames.</p>
<p align="justify">20 The judge also took into account Yana's recollection of what Nana had told her

on the MRT ride home after they left Hairil's flat. Yana's account of the rape incident was

substantially the same as that given by Nana and Dino in court. In essence, she said that Nana told

her that the appellant and Dino had had sexual intercourse with her. Despite the substantial

consistency of Yana's evidence, the judge felt that Yana's evidence was not corroboration by

independent evidence although it fell within s159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) which provides:</p>
<b>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">159</p></blockquote></b>-In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former

  statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation,

  relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority

  legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.



<p align="justify">Applying <i>Tang Kin Seng v Public Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 46</nobr>, the judge was

of the view that Yana's statement was only valuable as evidence of consistency.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Reliability of Dino's evidence</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">21 Counsel for the defence argued that Dino's evidence was unreliable for two

reasons. First, Dino was an accomplice. Thus, his evidence should be treated with caution in

accordance with illustration (b) of s116 of the Evidence Act. Secondly, Dino's evidence was

inconsistent. In court, Dino stated that he saw the appellant having sexual intercourse with Nana on

three occasions on the morning of 14 July 1999. However, he stated in his statement to the police on

7 August 1999 that he did not know if the appellant had had sexual intercourse with Nana. Due to

this inconsistency, counsel for the defence applied to impeach Dino's credit during the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">22 The judge held that the fact that Dino was an accomplice did not render his

evidence unreliable. As stated in <i>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 25</nobr>,

the presumption under illustration (b) to s 116 of the Evidence Act was not mandatory but

permissive. If the court, after examining the circumstances of the case, did not see an attempt by

the accomplice to minimise his own involvement or exaggerate that of the accused there was no reason

to regard his evidence as being unreliable. In this case, there was no reason for Dino to falsely

implicate the appellant. Dino had pleaded guilty and had been convicted and sentenced. Far from

implicating the appellant, Dino had tried to exclude references to the appellant in his statement of

facts in the charge against him. In spite of that, Dino could not avoid making reference to the fact

that the appellant had had sexual intercourse with Nana in the statement of facts. He also had no

choice but to give evidence when required by the prosecution to do so. Accordingly, the judge did

not think that Dino had reason to falsely implicate the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">23 The judge was also of the view that Dino's credit had not been impeached. Dino

felt that he would benefit by saying that he did not see the appellant having sexual intercourse

with Nana in his statement to the police. He was under the impression that, by admitting to the

crime alone, the crime would be viewed as being less severe and he would only be charged under the

Women's Charter (Cap 353). It appeared that Dino was 'advised' by a fellow remandee at the

Queenstown Remand Prison and was unrepresented by counsel throughout. Although there were other

minor inconsistencies between Dino's evidence in court and his statement to the police, the judge

found that his credit had not been impeached.</p>
<p align="justify">24 After considering the evidence before the court, the judge was of the view

that the elements of the three charges of rape against the appellant had been proven beyond a

reasonable doubt. As regards the offence of abetment by instigating Dino to commit rape, the judge

was persuaded that the appellant 'actively suggested' that Dino commit the offence of rape on Nana

by asking Dino if he wanted to 'do it' (see <i>Jimina Jacee d/o Athananasius</i>, MA 120 of 1999).

Thus the offence of abetment of rape had also been made out. Accordingly, the judge convicted the

appellant on all four charges.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Sentences</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">25 The appellant was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and six strokes of

the cane in respect of each of the four charges. As two of the sentences were made to run

consecutively, the appellant was sentenced to a total of 14 years' imprisonment and 24 strokes of

the cane.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">26 The two primary issues that were raised on appeal were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Whether the appellant was correctly identified by Nana; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) If yes, whether Dino's evidence was sufficient corroboration of Nana's

  identification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">I shall address these issues in turn.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Whether the appellant was correctly identified by Nana</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">27 In my opinion, the judge was correct in her finding that the appellant was

properly identified.</p>
<p align="justify">28 It was clear from her grounds of decision that the judge took into account the

fact that Nana was drunk when she saw the appellant. The judge also noted that Nana retained some

measure of alertness despite her drunken state. This was demonstrated by Nana's ability to recollect

that it was Dino and the appellant who brought her back to Hairil's flat.</p>
<p align="justify">29 The judge further acknowledged the fact that the lighting in the living room

was poor when the rape took place. Despite this, the judge concluded that this did not render Nana's

identification of the appellant unreliable. The judge considered the fact that the appellant's face

was not more than a few inches from Nana's face and that the appellant was not a stranger to Nana.

Hairil's testimony that one could tell identify a person at close range in the dark living room was

also considered. Further, the judge considered the Investigation Officer's evidence that the living

room was not in total darkness during the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p align="justify">30 It was against this factual matrix that the judge concluded that Nana's

identification of the appellant was not open to challenge. The judge arrived at this conclusion

after a thorough analysis of the relevant facts. I agreed with her finding and saw no reason for

appellate intervention in this regard.</p>

<p align="justify">Whether Dino's evidence was sufficient corroboration of Nana's identification</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">31 The judge found that Dino's testimony in court amounted to an independent

corroboration of Nana's account of the rape incident.</p>
<p align="justify">32 Although defence counsel had applied to impeach Dino's credit on the basis of

inconsistencies between his statement to the police and his statement in court, the judge found <i>as

a fact</i> that Dino's credit was not impeached. In court, Dino stated that he saw the appellant

having sexual intercourse with Nana three times on the morning of 14 July 1999. In his statement to

the police, Dino claimed that he saw no such thing. Dino later admitted that he had lied in his

statement or was mistaken. He explained that he believed that the crime would be considered less

serious if it was thought that he alone committed the rape. The judge noted that Dino had been

advised by a remandee at Queenstown Remand and was otherwise unrepresented by counsel throughout the

trial. Even though the inconsistencies were material, the judge accepted Dino's explanation in this

respect.</p>
<p align="justify">33 In any event, the judge did not think that Dino's evidence was unreliable

simply because he was an accomplice. Dino had already been convicted on the basis of his guilty

plea. Further, the evidence did not suggest that Dino had any other reason to falsely implicate the

appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">34 I agreed with the judge's finding that Dino's credit had not been impeached. I

further agreed that Dino's testimony amounted to independent corroboration of Nana's testimony as

there was no discernible reason to think that there might have been collaboration of any sort

between Nana and Dino. Accordingly, there was no reason to disturb the judge's finding of fact that

the Dino's credit was not impeached.</p>
