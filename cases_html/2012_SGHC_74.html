        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application for leave under
                    O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”) to apply for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     Declarations
                        (“Declarations”)</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       That the Prime Minister does
                            not have unfettered discretion in deciding whether to announce
                            by-elections in Hougang Single Member Constituency (“SMC”)
                            (“the First Declaration”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       That the Prime Minister does
                            not have unfettered discretion to decide when to announce by-elections
                            in Hougang SMC and must do so within three months or within such
                            reasonable time as this Honourable Court deems fit (“the Second
                            Declaration”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     A Mandatory Order enjoining the Prime Minister to advise
                        the President to issue a Writ of Election mandating by-elections in Hougang
                        SMC pursuant to Article 49(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of
                        Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) and Section 24(1) of
                        the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap 218, 2011 Rev Ed) and to
                        tender such advice within three months or within such reasonable time as the
                        Honourable Court deems fit (“the Mandatory
                    Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I heard parties in chambers on the issue of
                    leave on 30 March 2012. I directed counsel for the applicant to delete two
                    headings in his Originating Summons No 196 of 2012 (“OS”):
                        <em>Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs and others and
                        other appeals</em> [1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 and Article 21
                    of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948, 217A (III)
                    (“UDHR”). Whilst counsel is at liberty to make submissions based
                    on court decisions, the OS title reference to a particular case is unnecessary.
                    The UDHR, not having been enacted as Singapore legislation, is not domestic law
                    to which these proceedings relate. Accordingly such OS title reference is
                    misleading. Counsel for the applicant agreed to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 2 April 2012, I granted leave for a
                    substantive judicial review hearing. On 4 April 2012, the Attorney-General
                    (“AG”) appealed against my decision to grant leave. I now state my
                    reasons for granting leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The applicant avers that she is a resident voter
                    of Hougang SMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       She avers that she had previously sought
                    financial advice and assistance from her then Member of Parliament of Hougang
                    SMC (“MP”), Mr Yaw Shin Leong (“Mr Yaw”)
                    of the Workers’ Party, for whom she had voted in the last general
                    election. He had invited her to follow up with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       She avers that on 15 February 2012, the
                    Workers’ Party declared that Mr Yaw had been expelled from the party.
                    His parliamentary seat was thereafter declared vacant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The applicant avers that she is deprived of an
                    MP and that although she is being assisted by Workers’ Party MPs from the
                    adjacent Aljunied Group Representative Constituency (“GRC”), she
                    avers that they do not represent her vote.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       She avers that she has a right to be represented
                    by an MP whom she had an opportunity of choosing. She has made this application
                    to clarify the law and to seek the Declarations and Mandatory
                Orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The threshold for O 53 leave applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Applications for O 53 prerogative orders
                    require the leave of court. One of the purposes of the requirement of leave is
                    to sieve out groundless applications <em>in limine</em>.
                    The Court of Appeal in <em>Public Service Commission v Lai Swee
                        Lin Linda</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 133 explained that the
                    requirement of seeking the leave of court (at [23]) was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… intended to be a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless
                        cases at an early stage, and its aim is to prevent a wasteful use of
                        judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment (whether
                        intentional or otherwise) that might arise from a need to delay implementing
                        decisions, where the legality of such decisions is being challenged.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Leave is not granted unless the court is
                    satisfied that: (i) the matter complained of is susceptible to judicial
                    review; (ii) the applicant has sufficient interest in the matter; and
                    (iii) the material before the court discloses an arguable or <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of
                    granting leave. Additionally, as these orders are discretionary remedies, the
                    court has a discretion to refuse leave where the circumstances warrant a refusal
                    (see <em>Singapore </em><em>Civil
                        </em><em>Procedure 2007</em>
                    (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at
                    para 53/8/22).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It was not disputed for purposes of the leave
                    application that the matter relates to the performance of powers and duties
                    which involve a public element and thus is susceptible to judicial review. It
                    was also not disputed that the applicant has sufficient interest in the
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The main issue in dispute in this leave
                    application was whether the material before the court disclosed an arguable or
                        <em>prima facie</em> case in favour of granting leave.
                    I noted what the Court of Appeal in <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin and
                        others v Minister for Information and the Arts</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 294 had to say on the meaning and scope of the phrases
                    ‘a <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable
                    suspicion’ and ‘what might on further consideration turn out to be
                    an arguable case’ (at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This pass<em>age appears susceptible to two slightly
                            different interpretations. One is</em> that the court should
                        quickly peruse the material put before it and consid<em>er
                            whether s</em>uch material discloses “what might on further
                        consideration turn out to be an arguable case”. The other is that the
                        applicant had to make out a “<em>prima
                            facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion”. In our view, both
                        tests present a very low threshold and it is questionable whether there is
                        really any difference in substance between the two interpretations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal (at [25]) then ruled that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... What is required is not a <em>prima facie</em>
                        case, but a <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable
                        suspicion. If the latter can be shown, then it cannot be said that the
                        application must necessarily fail, for there would then appear to be an
                        “arguable case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel addressed me primarily on the issue of
                    whether the material before me raised an arguable or a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting
                    leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relationship between O 53 and O 15 r 16</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Pursuant to amendments to O 53 made in
                    May 2011, a public law declaration may now be sought under O 53
                    r 1(1)(a). Previously, public law declarations had to be separately
                    commenced under O 15 r 16.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In these proceedings, the AG’s counsel
                    took the position that while leave is not required for a declaration under
                    O 15 r 16, O 53 does not permit the applicant to pray for a
                    declaration until and unless she has first obtained the Court’s leave to
                    apply for a prerogative order, <em>i</em>.<em>e.</em>, the Mandatory Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Counsel for the applicant did not dispute the
                    AG’s counsel’s position, but gave notice that if the court did not
                    grant leave for the Mandatory Order application to be heard, he would
                    immediately be filing an application under O 15 r 16 for the
                    declarations sought here, for which no leave of court is required. In support he
                    relied on V K Rajah J’s observation (as he then was) in
                        <em>Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs</em>
                    [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [20]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The court rules are designed essentially to facilitate workflow and
                        not to impede legitimate legal grievances. They are the vassals and vessels
                        and not the masters of substantive justice. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At the threshold, it would appear that
                    declarations sought under O 53 are subject to the language of O 53 and
                    require leave of court whilst declarations sought under O 15 r 16 do
                    not require leave of court but are subject to the normal requirements including
                        <em>locus standi</em> and a live dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I have directed parties to prepare further
                    submissions on the above issue at the substantive hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Mandatory Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Counsel for the applicant argued that the
                    court may issue a mandatory order to compel the Prime Minister to exercise his
                    powers in accordance with the law. When a seat in Parliament has become vacant,
                    Article 49(1) of the Constitution states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the vacancy shall be filled by election in the manner provided by
                        or under any law relating to Parliamentary elections for the time being in
                        force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Counsel for the applicant argued, that the
                    word “shall” suggests that it is mandatory for by-elections to be
                    called. If so, he argued that the Prime Minister does not have a discretion as
                    to whether to hold a by-election in Hougang SMC. Counsel for the applicant
                    argued further that the Prime Minister does not have an unfettered discretion as
                    to the timing of the by-election. He submitted that even though there is no
                    constitutional or statutory requirement to call by-elections within a specified
                    time period, s 52 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    suggests that elections should be called within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The AG’s counsel argued that the
                    application for the Mandatory Order is misconceived in law and in fact for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     There is no executive decision that
                        could properly be the subject of the prerogative order as the Prime Minister
                        is presently exercising his discretion to decide when to call the
                        by-election in Hougang SMC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     It directs the Prime Minister on the particular way he is
                        to exercise his discretion thus disregarding the discretion conferred on him
                        by the Constitution to decide when to call the by election;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     It usurps the
                        power of the Prime Minister under the Constitution to decide, in his
                        discretion when to call the by election in Hougang SMC and transgresses the
                        doctrine of separation of powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The AG’s counsel pointed out that on
                    9 March 2012 the Prime Minister had stated in Parliament that he intended
                    to call a by-election and that he is considering the relevant factors in
                    deciding when to call the by-election (“the Prime Minister’s
                    9 March Statement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In reply, counsel for the applicant pointed
                    out that the Prime Minister’s 9 March Statement only spoke of his
                    intention to hold a by-election. Counsel for the applicant observed that that
                    was very different from saying that he was compelled to hold one. In this
                    regard, and citing the case of <em>Padfield v Minister of
                        Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</em> [1968] AC 967 at 1041,
                    counsel for the applicant submitted that the Prime Minister, by stating that he
                    had the power to decide “whether and when” to call an election,
                    had “misinterpreted the law or proceeded on an erroneous view of the
                    law”. He conceded that the Prime Minister has a discretion as to the
                    timing of a by-election and that the applicant is not seeking a specific date
                    for the announcement of a by-election.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Declarations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Counsel for the applicant submitted that
                    public law declarations have “significant legal utility” in that
                    they can conclusively settle the legal boundaries within which administrative
                    determinations would have to proceed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The AG’s counsel submitted that the
                    First and Second Declarations are entirely academic and theoretical in light of
                    the Prime Minister’s 9 March Statement. He argued that courts do not
                    burden themselves by granting declarations which raise theoretical issues or
                    which serve no useful purpose. In addition, if the court were to grant the
                    Second Declaration, it would be substituting its discretion for that of the
                    Prime Minister’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Counsel for the applicant earlier informed the
                    AG’s counsel and the court that he would if necessary immediately apply
                    under O 15 r 16 for the First and Second Declarations to be considered
                    as standalone declarations for which the leave of court is not required. In
                    light of this, the question of whether the quite separate requirements for
                    standalone declarations have been met would have to be determined at a
                    substantive hearing, which this O 53 leave hearing is not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I asked counsel whether this court at this
                    leave stage, is to examine each and every prayer of the OS and consider any
                    severance process. Counsel did not make any submissions on this question. In any
                    event, the applicant would have to establish her case for the First Declaration
                    (whether under O 53 or O 15 r 16), quite apart from and before
                    any consequential Second Declaration and the Mandatory Order are
                    considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The applicant has filed this OS for leave to
                    be heard in court for declarations and a mandatory order relating to the Prime
                    Minister’s powers with respect to elections and the filling of vacancies
                    of seats of MPs under Arts. 12, 39(1) and 49(1) of the Constitution of the
                    Republic of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Based on what was presented and submitted to
                    me for the purposes of the leave application, without making any comment or
                    decision on the merits or the substantive legal issues, I granted leave for a
                    judicial review hearing as I was of the view that the very low threshold for
                    leave has been met.</p>
