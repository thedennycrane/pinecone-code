        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is the developer of Alpha
                    Industrial Building (“the building”) and the owner of, <em>inter alia</em>, unit #05-11 in the building (“the
                    unit”). The defendant was the tenant of the unit under two successive
                    tenancy agreements. The formal terms of both leases have run out. In this
                    action, the plaintiff is claiming for the repossession of the unit, arrears in
                    rent and double rent for holding over. The defendant is resisting the claim on
                    the basis that he is entitled to purchase the unit pursuant to a contractual
                    right or proprietary estoppel. There is also the issue of who should bear the
                    responsibility for the construction of a mezzanine floor in the unit which is
                    irregular under planning regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff was represented by instructed
                    counsel, Mr Thio Shen Yi SC. Its sole witness was Mr Lim Chin Leong,
                    the plaintiff’s managing director. The defendant, Mr Shiok, appeared
                    in person. He gave evidence himself and also called Mr Yeo Hock Chuan who
                    is a property agent who acted for him in his initial dealings with the
                    plaintiff. The evidence is as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first tenancy agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr Lim and Mr Shiok first met sometime
                    in late November or early December 2004. On 9 December 2004 they entered
                    into a tenancy agreement for the unit (“the first tenancy
                    agreement”). The term was for two years, from 1 January 2005 to
                    31 December 2006. Rent was fixed at $3,200 a month. Clause 3(d) of the
                    first tenancy agreement read:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the term of the Tenancy, THE LANDLORD agrees not to sell THE SAID
                        PREMISES to any purchasers other than THE TENANT at the predetermined sale
                        price of <b>Singapore Dollars Four Hundred Sixty Two
                            Thousand And Fifty Four Only (S$462,054.00) or at S$159.00 per
                            sqft</b>, exclusive of GST and stamp duty which are payable by
                        THE TENANT. All rental payable shall be calculated till the date of sale
                        completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mr Lim characterised clause 3(d) as
                    follows in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”)
                    at [10]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The aforesaid Clause 3(d) of the 1st Tenancy Agreement is, as I am
                        advised, a right of pre-emption. While the right was subsisting, the
                        Plaintiffs were not allowed to sell the Premises to anybody except the
                        Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is pertinent to note that Mr Lim, rather artfully, stopped shy
                    of saying that <em>he</em> understood clause 3(d) to
                    be a right of pre-emption. Mr Lim’s evidence on the stand, when he
                    was cross-examined by Mr Shiok, was significantly different. On the second
                    day of the trial, there was this exchange:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">During [our first meeting in December 2004], we
                            conclude the rental of the unit 05-11 and the option to purchase
                            the unit at $159 per square feet. Do you agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, I agree.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">A similar exchange was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I will put it to you, if you have not given me the
                            option to purchase at 159, I would not have invest in this unit, neither
                            would I take up the rental.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I disagree with you. It’s stated very clearly
                            in the tenancy agreement that you have to buy within the tenancy
                            agreement and I’m willing to sell you at $159 per square feet. But
                            it was very unfortunate that you do – that you did not take this
                            opportunity to buy at all.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Look, Mr Lim, I put it you to you at a later
                            stage on this issue, because all this is going to happen in December
                            2006 and I want you to know, do you – and I put it to you that
                            $159 per square feet was to me an option to purchase and
                        –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Def:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your Honour, I – I’ll rephrase it
                            again, correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Do you agree that the discussion ended with $3,200
                            for 2 + 2 rental lease with an option to purchase at $159 per square
                            feet?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, I agree but it was for the first
                            2-year.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Likewise, on the fourth day of the trial:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In December 2004, I came to Alpha Building with my
                            agent Jeffrey Yeo and we met you there. Do you agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mm. Do you agree that during this meeting, we
                            discussed the tenancy agreement and the option to
                        purchase?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">And later on the same day:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[Refers to clause 3(d) of tenancy
                            agreement]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yah, do you agree that, er, I have the first right
                            to buy this unit within the 2 years’ tenancy
                        agreement?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">All these were not changed in re-examination, where Mr Thio
                    sought to establish that there was no option granted between the
                        parties:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now, earlier this morning, you were asked this
                            question, that you agreed – during the meeting on December 04, you
                            discussed the tenancy agreement and option to purchase and you said yes.
                            Now, a lot of terms have been used loosely, so what I want you to do, is
                            go to the plaintiff’s bundle of documents, grey bundle. The
                            tenancy agreement is at page 9. When you say “option to
                            purchase”, what are you referring to in this tenancy
                            agreement?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Actually the word option to purchase is – is
                            the tenancy is given at that point in time within 2 years to
                            purchase and within the 2 year, 3 months before the expiry, he
                            has to make his option to purchase.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, no, sorry. Which part of the tenancy agreement
                            are you referring – does this “option to purchase”
                            refer to? Because just now what you said is the option
                        –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I think it is 3 – 3(d), page
                        12.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">3(g).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">3(d). Denmark.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. [Moves on.]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Shiok and Mr Yeo were also
                    cross-examined on the meaning of clause 3(d). Unsurprisingly, they
                    confirmed that it was a right of pre-emption. However, they were not examined on
                    the actual understanding reached between themselves. This is an issue which was
                    obviously relevant because of Mr Shiok’s insistence that he had an
                    option and Mr Lim’s repeated agreement on the stand with
                    Mr Shiok’s point that an option was in fact the true arrangement
                    between them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Renovations and the construction of the mezzanine floor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After signing the first tenancy agreement,
                    Mr Shiok proceeded to renovate the unit. The renovation took five to six
                    months. The contractor was Heng Loong Construction (“Heng Loong”),
                    of which Mr Lim was a partner. The invoices issued by Heng Loong to
                    Mr Shiok totalled $106,176.63.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The work done
                    included the construction of a mezzanine floor which effectively doubled the
                    floor area of the unit. After the renovations were completed, Mr Shiok
                    began operating his business from the unit. He ran a precision engineering
                    business and his plant included heavy machinery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The mezzanine floor turned out to be irregular
                    and has since been removed pursuant to an order of Judith Prakash J. The
                    issue is who should be responsible for the irregularity. The irregularity, which
                    was pointed out to the plaintiff by the Urban Redevelopment Authority
                    (“URA”) on 18 December 2006 and by the Building and
                    Construction Authority (“BCA”) on 25 January 2007, seemed to
                    arise from the fact that the mezzanine floor area caused the gross floor area of
                    the building to exceed the permitted limit. The precise nature of the
                    irregularity was not clearly explained by either party. But both parties agreed
                    on the fact of the irregularity and it is sufficient for present purposes to
                    proceed on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In his AEIC at [9], Mr Shiok deposed
                    that Mr Lim represented to him during their first meeting that the floor
                    area of the unit could be expanded by constructing a mezzanine floor. At [10],
                    Mr Shiok went on to say that Mr Lim represented to him that
                    “they” would do all the relevant work and take care of obtaining
                    the relevant approvals, <em>etc</em>, from the relevant
                    government bodies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In his AEIC, Mr Yeo Hock Chuan, who was
                    Mr Shiok’s property agent at the time of the first tenancy agreement,
                    deposed that Mr Lim had represented to Mr Shiok that the floor area of
                    the unit could be expanded by the construction of a mezzanine floor, and that
                    Mr Lim could carry out the construction and attend to all approval
                    requirements. He also said that Mr Lim showed Mr Shiok a room where Mr
                    Lim already built a mezzanine floor and told Mr Shiok he could do the same.
                    According to Mr Yeo, all this happened in his presence. During
                    cross-examination, Mr Yeo conceded that he did not hear Mr Lim
                    represent to Mr Shiok that approval of the mezzanine was
                        guaranteed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In his AEIC at [7]–[8], Mr Lim
                    deposed that the plaintiff was prepared to allow Mr Shiok to construct the
                    mezzanine floor, but did not warrant that the structure was or would be
                    approved. At [28], Mr Lim elaborated that neither the plaintiff nor
                    Heng Loong nor himself had ever represented, warranted, promised or agreed that
                    the said works could be used by Mr Shiok as a mezzanine floor – any
                    risk of illegality was assumed solely by Mr Shiok.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     However, Mr Lim took varying positions in
                    cross-examination. At first, he said that, as of November 2004 and for six
                    months thereafter, nobody knew what a mezzanine floor was - it was only in April
                    2007 that the BCA raised the issue with the developer and the
                        proprietors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Shortly after, however, Mr Lim said
                    that, during the same period, all the proprietors of the building, including
                    Mr Shiok, knew that a mezzanine floor was not allowed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> A while
                    later, when confronted with a police report by another proprietor that he was
                    misled as to the legality of building a mezzanine floor, Mr Lim said that
                    he could write off the report, as well as other similar reports by other
                    proprietors, because he had told them that a mezzanine floor was
                        illegal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Finally, when confronted with an invoice dated
                    1 June 2005 which expressly referred to “Partition Work at
                    Mezzanine”, Mr Lim said that the building of mezzanine floors was
                    rampant at that time; he did the work at Mr Shiok’s request; and the
                    issue was not what he knew or did not know.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Mr Shiok’s
                    various and varying positions contradict each other. If no one knew what a
                    mezzanine floor was, they would not have known or been told that it was not
                    allowed. If it was not allowed and they knew that, then why was Mr Lim
                    building a mezzanine floor for Mr Shiok through Heng Loong?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is also pertinent to refer to the following
                    letter dated 27 November 2006 from 3P Architects to the URA on behalf
                    of the plaintiff, where the following passage is found:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would like to seek your advice on payment of differential premium that
                        may be leviable by Commissioner of Lands if we are proposing to increase the
                        gross floor area to 11,602.59 sq m where the plot ratio will be 2.022
                        exceeding the allowable GPR of 2.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was only after the URA refused permission that the plaintiff wrote
                    to the relevant proprietors, including Mr Shiok, to remove their mezzanine
                    floors. Prior to that, there is no evidence of the plaintiff giving any kind of
                    warning to the proprietors. This application by 3P Architects on behalf of the
                    plaintiff is consistent with the plaintiff having represented to Mr Shiok
                    that he could build a mezzanine floor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On balance, therefore, I believe
                    Mr Shiok’s story in this regard. I find that, during their first
                    meeting, Mr Lim must have told Mr Shiok that a mezzanine floor could
                    be built and that he would apply for the necessary approvals for the mezzanine
                    floor. There is also no evidence that Mr Lim warned Mr Shiok that a
                    mezzanine floor would be irregular until approved. Since Heng Loong had not
                    entered the picture at this point, these representations must have been made on
                    behalf of the plaintiff. I also find that these representations must have
                    materially induced Mr Shiok into entering into the first tenancy
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Valuation report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Separately, Mr Shiok also obtained a
                    valuation report from Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants Pte Ltd. The
                    report was dated October 2005. The purpose of the report, as stated therein, was
                    “[t]o determine the open market value of the subject property for
                    financing purposes.” The report determined that the open market value of
                    the unit was $470,000. It noted that the mezzanine floor had not been approved,
                    and therefore excluded it from consideration. It is pertinent to note that the
                    report was given <em>after</em> the renovation works were
                    completed. Thus it cannot be evidence that Mr Shiok proceeded with the
                    construction of the mezzanine floor knowing that it was irregular.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The transition to the second tenancy agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Shiok deposed in his AEIC at [29]
                    –[32] that, after he entered into the first tenancy agreement, he always
                    evinced an intention to purchase the unit. He also deposed that his intention
                    was communicated clearly and unambiguously to the plaintiff. However, he
                    conceded in cross-examination that his alleged intention to buy the unit was
                    never expressed in writing. The earliest document where such an intention was
                    recorded was dated 28 August 2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> when the parties’ relationship
                    had already become acrimonious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As far as the documentary evidence went, there
                    was a letter dated 10 October 2006 by the plaintiff asking Mr Shiok to
                    confirm with the plaintiff by 16 November 2006 whether he wished to renew
                    the tenancy for another two years at a monthly rent of $3,680.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> On 27 November 2006,
                    Mr Shiok replied to request the then-existing rate of rent, $3,200, to
                    remain if he renewed the tenancy. Mr Lim made this note on the
                        letter:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>

                            get the loan; you abandoned the whole purchase. In fact the option to

<p class="Judg-1">There was no re-examination of Mr Lim on this
                point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     There is also some correspondence indicating
                    that Mr Shiok was in arrears of his rent payments at this point in time,
                    although it seemed that he subsequently paid up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In any event, the parties signed a second
                    tenancy agreement sometime in March 2007 (“the second tenancy
                    agreement”) for a two year term. The term began retrospectively from
                    1 January 2007 and continued to 31 December 2008. The rent remained at
                    $3,200 a month. Clause 2(f)(iii) of the second tenancy agreement provided
                    that Mr Shiok shall:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the currency of this tenancy, to allow the Landlord or its
                        representatives at all reasonable times to bring any interested parties to
                        view the said premises in the event of a prospective sale thereof. The said
                        premises shall be sold subject to this tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clause 4(i) of the second tenancy agreement provided
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>

                        will be determined after the CSC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While it is not relevant to any issue before me, I note that the
                    plaintiff appeared to have dated its copy of the second tenancy agreement
                    unilaterally as Mr Shiok’s copy is undated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In his AEIC, Mr Lim deposed that
                    clause 4(i) of the second tenancy agreement (which he also characterised as
                    a right of pre-emption) differed from clause 3(d) of the first tenancy
                    agreement because of worries that the issues surrounding the construction of the
                    mezzanine floor will delay the application for the Certificate of Statutory
                    Completion (“CSC”) and render the plaintiff liable for liquidated
                    damages to a purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is significant to note that Mr Lim
                    claimed that this worry arose on or before November 2006 when the application
                    for the CSC was submitted. This was materially different from his evidence in
                    cross-examination that he only knew about the mezzanine floor in April 2007 (see
                        <em>supra</em><a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>). It is also pertinent to note that
                    Mr Lim’s explanation is not congruent with his position in his AEIC
                    that there was only a right of pre-emption between the parties – if this
                    was so, whether or not the unit was sold would be entirely in the power of the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     For his part, Mr Shiok claimed that he

<p class="Judg-1">It was also suggested to Mr Shiok that he could not have
                    activated the option because he was not able to pay the purchase price. An
                    Enhanced Individual Search was adduced showing a number of bankruptcy
                    applications against him. Mr Thio relied particularly on a suit brought in
                    2007 by Hitachi Capital Singapore Pte Ltd for $168,787.00. The suit has not been
                    discontinued. But the search showed that no action has been taken since 2007. In
                    the circumstances, the Enhanced Individual Search does not establish whether or
                    not he was in a position to pay the purchase price.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Subsequently, matters deteriorated further.
                    Mr Shiok refused to remove the mezzanine floor and to pay rent. The
                    plaintiff sought to evict him and remove the mezzanine floor. As mentioned (see
                        <em>supra</em><a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>), Judith Prakash J allowed the
                    plaintiff to remove the mezzanine floor, and this was accomplished on
                    29-30 January 2010. Mr Shiok was very badly affected by this turn of
                    events. The conduct of his business was substantially impaired with the
                    demolition of the mezzanine floor and has now ceased. He is now in poor
                    financial straits and is facing bankruptcy. During the trial, he was visibly
                    stirred when he cross-examined Mr Lim, and clearly felt himself to have
                    been victimised. In fact, he had to be hospitalised after the second day of the
                    trial, which caused the trial to be delayed for 3 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The formal terms of both tenancy agreements
                    have ended. Hence, unless Mr Shiok is able to establish some other right to
                    possession of the unit, he must surrender possession to the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Shiok’s first argument was
                    founded on contract - specifically, that he had a contractual option to purchase
                    pursuant to clause 3(d) of the first tenancy agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On its face, clause 3(d) only granted a
                    right of pre-emption. For present purposes that is significantly different from
                    an option to purchase because the plaintiff has not made any offer to sell the
                    unit. There was no way in which the words in clause 3(d) could have been
                    construed as amounting to the grant of an option. However, Mr Lim’s
                    evidence on the stand strongly indicated that the parties’ understanding
                    was that an option to purchase was granted. This is fortified by the fact that
                    Mr Shiok spent six months and over $100,000 for Heng Loong to renovate
                    the unit. This amounted to a quarter of the term of the first tenancy agreement
                    and over thirty times the monthly rent, and it is very doubtful that he
                    would have done so if there was not some understanding between the parties that
                    he could purchase the unit. On this basis, I would have granted rectification of
                    clause 3(d) but for the fact that both Mr Shiok and Mr Lim also
                    seem to accept, rather confusingly, that clause 3(d) correctly captured the
                    contractual agreement between them. In the absence of a mistake as to the
                    language used, rectification is not possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proprietary estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Mr Shiok’s next argument was
                    proprietary estoppel. For present purposes, the general elements of proprietary
                    estoppel are sufficiently stated by Sundaresh Menon JC in <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [170]: there must be a
                    representation concerning a right or interest in land by the party against whom
                    the estoppel is sought to be raised, and reliance and detriment on the part of
                    the party seeking to raise the estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The unique feature of this case is that the
                    proprietary estoppel is said to exist <em>alongside</em>
                    formal contractual arrangements, <em>viz</em>, the two
                    tenancy agreements. As a matter of principle, I do not think that proprietary
                    estoppel is necessarily precluded by the existence of a formal contract between
                    the parties, whether the contract was entered into prior to, contemporaneous
                    with, or subsequent to the representation which is said to have given rise to
                    the estoppel. Of course, the existence of a formal contract is an important fact
                    to be considered in determining whether an estoppel has arisen. For example, a
                    prior or contemporaneous contract may give rise to an inference that the
                    representation which was not reduced into contract was not, when objectively
                    viewed, intended to be relied upon. A subsequent contract, where the parties
                    redefine their previously informal relationship, may lead to the conclusion that
                    the equity raised by the estoppel has been displaced by the subsequent agreement
                    of the parties. There are other possibilities, and everything depends on the
                    facts of each case. The overarching inquiry remains, as Oliver J put it in
                    his influential restatement in <em>Taylors Fashions Ltd v
                        Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd</em> [1982] 1 QB 133 at
                    151–152, “whether, in particular individual circumstances, it would
                    be unconscionable for a party to be permitted to deny that which, knowingly, or
                    unknowingly, he has allowed or encouraged another to assume to his
                    detriment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the evidence, I find that Mr Lim must
                    have represented to Mr Shiok, at the time the first tenancy agreement was
                    signed, that he could buy the unit at some point in time. Otherwise
                    Mr Shiok would not have invested so much into the unit. The renovation by
                    Heng Loong alone cost over $100,000 and took six months. This expenditure in
                    terms of money and time could not have been justified on the formal terms of the
                    first tenancy agreement which lasted two years and for which Mr Shiok was
                    willing to pay $3,200 a month. For the same reason, I find that the
                    representation cannot be intended to be subsumed <em>within</em> the first agreement. In particular, the first tenancy
                    agreement’s duration of two years shows that it must have existed as
                    an understanding between the parties <em>alongside</em>
                    their contractual arrangements. I find additional support for this conclusion in
                    the note scribbled by Mr Lim on Mr Shiok’s letter of
                    27 November 2006 (see <em>supra</em><a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>), stating that a sale might be delayed
                    to September 2007 pending the issuance of the CSC. The note may well be an
                    internal note, as Mr Lim claimed. However, its existence indicated that the
                    possibility of a sale to Mr Shiok, albeit outside the terms of the first
                    tenancy agreement, was very much on the mind of Mr Lim. Otherwise, there
                    seemed no reason why the note would be scribbled on Mr Lim’s letter,
                    as opposed to some other place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I therefore find, on the basis of the
                    parties’ dealings during the first tenancy agreement, that Mr Lim had
                    represented to Mr Shiok that he could buy the unit. And in material and
                    detrimental reliance thereon, Mr Shiok entered into the first tenancy
                    agreement, renovated the unit and built the mezzanine floor. Admittedly, the
                        <em>precise</em> terms of the representation cannot be
                    established on the evidence before me. But that in itself is not a problem given
                    that I am satisfied that some representation must have been made. The equity
                    arising from proprietary estoppel “need not fail merely on the ground
                    that the interest to be secured has not been expressly indicated”:
                        <em>Plimmer and another v The Mayor, Councillors, and
                        Citizens of the City of Wellington</em> (1884) 9 App Cas 699
                    at 713. Given my findings, and since Mr Lim was acting on behalf of the
                    plaintiff, a proprietary estoppel was therefore raised against the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The next question is the effect of the second
                    tenancy agreement and the events surrounding it. Here the evidence is rather
                    sketchy and inconclusive. As mentioned, there is no documentary evidence that
                    Mr Shiok attempted to buy the unit. On the other hand, it appears that some
                    parts of the parties’ dealings were undocumented or at least not presented
                    to the court. For example, there is no documentary evidence supporting
                    Mr Lim’s testimony that an option was presented at some point in time
                    to Mr Shiok. There is also no evidence with respect to the parties’
                    discussions on the second tenancy agreement. As for the second tenancy
                    agreement, I do not think that Mr Shiok was compelled by economic duress to
                    enter into it such that it could be set aside. As mentioned (see <em>supra</em><a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>), Mr Shiok showed that he was
                    willing to accept the second tenancy agreement as a substitute for an outright
                    purchase. Also, as Mr Thio pointed out, duress was not pleaded. At the same
                    time, however, it seemed clear that entering into the agreement was not a clear
                    cut decision for both parties, given the three month delay between the expiry of
                    the first tenancy agreement in December 2006 and the signing of the second
                    tenancy agreement in March 2007. I do not think that the difficulties which must
                    have been faced by the parties in negotiating a new agreement were entirely
                    attributable to Mr Shiok’s failure to pay rent in December 2006 ,
                    January and February2007. The arrears seemed to have ceased after that, and I
                    infer that they were a consequence, rather than a cause, of the difficulties
                    faced by the parties going forward. On balance, I would accept
                    Mr Shiok’s evidence that he felt constrained to some extent by the
                    investment he already put into the unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In all these circumstances, I cannot
                    unequivocally conclude that the mere entering into the second tenancy agreement
                    can be regarded as wholly satisfying or displacing the equity raised by the
                    estoppel. The just and correct approach would be to consider all these
                    circumstances in satisfying the equity raised by the initial estoppel, bearing
                    in mind that “[h]ere equity is displayed at its most flexible”:
                        <em>per</em> Lord Denning MR in <em>Crabb v Arun District Council</em> [1976] 1 Ch 179 at
                    189.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On the facts, I think an outright order to
                    sell the unit to Mr Shiok is out of the question. Mr Shiok seemed to
                    be in no position to buy the unit although he gave evidence of unnamed persons
                    who were willing to back him up. In my view, the better and more precise remedy
                    is an award of damages to put into Mr Shiok into the position he would be
                    in had he not entered into the two tenancy agreements. This would reverse any
                    detriment he has suffered, as well as take into account any benefit he had
                    enjoyed as a result of entering into the tenancy agreements. I should add that,
                    on assessment, if Mr Shiok was in fact better off after the two tenancy
                    agreements, then he would have suffered no detriment, and justice would have
                    been served.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As a corollary that damages are the
                    appropriate remedy, Mr Shiok has no right to continue in the premises after
                    the expiry of the second tenancy agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mezzanine floor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The mezzanine floor issue is relevant for
                    deciding whether the second tenancy agreement was rightfully terminated.
                    However, it does not affect the overall proprietary estoppel analysis and it is
                    thus not necessary for me to decide the point. It is sufficient for me to
                    observe that the plaintiff, Heng Loong and Mr Lim (who was the agent of
                    both the plaintiff and Heng Loong) do not seem to have conducted themselves in a
                    way that was beyond reproach in their dealings with Mr Shiok.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I therefore give judgment in the following
                    terms:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If he has not already done so, Mr Shiok is
                            to vacate the unit within six weeks of this judgment, failing which
                            he is to pay the plaintiff rent at the rate of $6,400 a month, pro-rated
                            accordingly.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Shiok is entitled to damages to be
                            assessed to restore him to the position he would be in had he not
                            entered into the two tenancy agreements. The registrar is to assess the
                            totality of rental, renovations and mezzanine floor payments made by him
                            against the totality of benefits received by him in connection with the
                            first tenancy until the date of vacation of the premises. Subject to
                            this overriding aim, the assessing registrar should consider, <em>inter alia</em>, the amount of money Mr Shiok
                            spent on renovating and improving the unit, including the building and
                            removal of the mezzanine floor and the profits from his business
                            conducted therein. I appreciate that a precise measure would not be
                            possible – any evidential difficulties should be resolved in an
                            equitable manner and in the spirit of my judgment.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The parties are at liberty to clarify the terms
                            of my orders above, and to apply for any ancillary order to give effect
                            to my judgment.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Shiok is entitled to his costs of the
                    trial. The costs of the assessment are reserved to the registrar, who will also
                    decide on interest.</p>
