These proceedings largely consisted of a series of events which gave rise to confusion and misunderstanding. At all material times, W was represented by solicitors, although she was represented by one set of solicitors before DJ Toh and Tan JC in the Divorce Suit and a different set of solicitors for OS 1359 and the Present Suit. H was represented by solicitors before DJ Toh and Tan JC in the Divorce Suit, but he represented himself before AR Choo and Lee J. Before us, he was represented by the solicitors who had represented him in the Divorce Suit.

Each of them will get an equal share of the net sale proceeds and W is entitled to deduct further sums ($180K and monies from the parties’ common funds) from H’s proceeds as these were monies owing to her. These were due to H’s mounting debts … The investment property was successfully sold but H refused to transfer his 1/3 share in the matrimonial property to W. W submitted that H is estopped from denying the existence of the oral agreement from the various evidence produced by her – i.e. text messages between the parties, the circumstances that existed including a hand written agreement and supporting evidence from their children, W’s mother, relatives and friend. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. H’s countered that the court should not consider W’s allegations since the court do [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] not recognize pre and post marital agreements.

In any case, I was also not persuaded that the evidence on paper for the proceeding before me could conclusively prove the oral agreement in the exact form that W had pleaded. The text messages were at best indicative of some broad agreement parties had but details were lacking and therefore non-conclusive. As for the hand-written agreement between parties, H explained that it was written by W but not signed by him. He also provided a contemporaneous police report to support his story. Next were affidavit evidence from parties and each had a different interpretation and perspective. The remaining supporting evidence came from third parties who heard “W’s story” from W. Such parties were W’s children, mother, friend and relatives who were W’s supporters.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 We are of the view that the last sentence of [9] of the DJGD was unfortunate as it was not clear what it meant. Also, H’s argument as set out in the preceding paragraph did not make sense. In any event, the question was whether DJ Toh meant that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the validity of the WOA was to be determined by the High Court since the FJC had no power to adjudicate on property disputes (“the first interpretation”); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the validity of the WOA was irrelevant because even if W established the WOA, the FJC would disregard it because it was not an agreement made in contemplation of divorce (“the second interpretation”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The confusion was compounded by the fact that DJ Toh mentioned that W had not <span class="font-italic">conclusively</span> proved the WOA, when the relevant standard of proof was proof on the balance of probabilities and not proof with conclusive evidence. Nevertheless, even if DJ Toh had applied the wrong standard, the question was still what her decision meant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 We are of the view that the second interpretation is the correct one for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 First, DJ Toh had emphasised that the WOA would not have been an agreement made in contemplation of divorce. This suggested that even if W could establish the WOA on the facts, DJ Toh would have disregarded it since it did not come within s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the WC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Secondly, DJ Toh went on to grant W the first right to buy H’s interest in MA and, alternatively, ordered a sale of MA and the distribution of the sale proceeds in accordance with the shares of the owners as stated in the title deed. If DJ Toh was of the view that the existence of the WOA would have to be decided by another court, then she would have adjourned the hearing for that determination to be made first because it would not make sense to make a decision about MA pending that determination. If W then succeeded in establishing the existence of the WOA, that would have meant that MA would no longer be the subject of division by DJ Toh as H had agreed to transfer his interest in it to W in exchange for her consent to the sale of SP. The fact that DJ Toh did not adjourn the hearing and instead made orders in respect of MA was inconsistent with the first interpretation and consistent with the second interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 But that was not all. W then filed the HCF Appeal. Importantly, on 10 August 2018, her counsel informed Tan JC that, “W will not be proceeding with arguments on the [WOA]. She will be seeking to recover the entire amount of the proceeds of sale of [SP] into the pool of matrimonial assets”.

</div>
</div> This, in our view, was critical. Whatever the correct interpretation of the last sentence of [9] of the DJGD, W was no longer pursuing her arguments on the WOA. In other words, W had abandoned the WOA. It was not necessary to establish the existence of the WOA or whether the FJC could have regard to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Realising the importance of this withdrawal, W argued in this appeal that she was doing the right thing by withdrawing the WOA from the FJC “and bringing the claim via civil proceedings”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> There were various difficulties facing this contention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 First, there was no such qualification by W’s counsel when the counsel withdrew her arguments on the WOA before Tan JC on 10 August 2018. The minutes of the hearing as recorded by Tan JC do not reflect this qualification at all. Furthermore, the withdrawal by W’s counsel was not made inadvertently. Indeed, Tan JC had stood down the hearing to give counsel time to reflect on the WOA and how the proceeds of sale were to be dealt with. Thereafter, W’s counsel withdrew her arguments on the WOA.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-9a020373-2711-4b4f-977e-c430d55fa6ef" data-toggle="modal" type="button">42</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Secondly, after W’s counsel said that W would not be proceeding with arguments on the WOA, W’s counsel went on to argue about the proceeds of sale of SP. If W was maintaining her right to rely on the WOA, then her counsel could not be arguing for the sale proceeds of SP to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets, as that would be inconsistent with the terms of the WOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Thirdly, if W really intended for the WOA to be decided by another court, then her counsel would have asked Tan JC to stay the hearing of her appeal pending the outcome of her claim on the WOA. As already mentioned, it would not have made sense to continue with any hearing in the Divorce Suit about MA (much less make a decision about MA) if there was going to be a claim in another court to establish the existence of the WOA. The fact that W’s counsel did not ask for the HCF Appeal to be adjourned pending the outcome of W’s claim based on the WOA also contradicted the Respondent’s Case that W wanted to pursue the WOA in a separate court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Fourthly, it will be remembered that W had discontinued the Previous Suit on 16 March 2018. While we agreed that the mere discontinuance of an existing suit is not necessarily evidence that might be used to support H’s argument about <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, the point was that even after the decision of Tan JC on 8 October 2018, W did not commence a claim based on the WOA. On the contrary, it was H who commenced OS 1359 on 8 November 2018, one month after Tan JC’s decision on 8 October 2018, to seek an order for MA to be sold. It was only in response to this step that W then filed SUM 937 on 22 February 2019 to convert OS 1359 into a writ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 We add that when parties appeared before Tan JC again at the second hearing on 6 September 2018, H’s counsel mentioned that W had abandoned her arguments on the WOA on appeal. Importantly, W’s counsel did not disagree with this, and simply said that there was nothing to add.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The above sequence of events belied W’s submission that when her counsel said that W was not proceeding with arguments on the WOA, W was intending to pursue it separately. This submission was simply a desperate attempt by W to introduce a qualification through her new solicitors to salvage her reliance on the WOA. It was too late.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Thus, when Tan JC gave his decision on 8 October 2018, the WOA was no longer in play. W was precluded by the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, as expressed in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>(1843) 67 ER 313 and followed in <span class="font-italic">Setiadi</span> <span class="font-italic">Hendrawan</span><span class="font-italic"> v OCBC Securities Pte Ltd and others</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 296, from raising the WOA again subsequently. Under this doctrine, a party is precluded from relying on an argument in a subsequent proceeding which should have been made in an earlier proceeding. Here, not only did W withdraw her arguments on the WOA, she then proceeded to argue as though the WOA no longer applied. The decision of Tan JC was made on that basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 However, that was also not the end of the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 After H filed OS 1359, W had filed SUM 937 to convert OS 1359 into a writ.

Quite apart from [H’s] conduct which [W and M’s] Counsel has asked me to focus on (i.e. the fact that [H] was the one who, through his lawyers, argued that the [WOA] should not be considered by the Family Court in view of s 112 of the Women’s Charter), I was also fortified in my view given [W’s] conduct should also be taken into account and I agree with [W and M’s] Counsel that [W] has not abandoned or waived her right to pursue the issue of the [WOA]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. In my respectful view, the threshold for conversion has been crossed in the present case. The OS process, even with limited cross-examination, is not appropriate in the present case. A substantial dispute as to fact, in particular, on the existence of the [WOA], is likely to arise. I took into account the likely number of witnesses and the readily available documentary evidence (the email and WhatsApp exchanges) as stated in the affidavits. All things considered, the writ action would clearly be the more suitable process for this case to continue.

We agree. Lee J could simply have decided to allow the action to continue as a writ because there were substantial disputes of fact over both the question of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> against W and the WOA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, while it is true that it is unclear whether Lee J had decided the point, the same does not apply to AR Choo. It seemed to us that he had decided the point in favour of W (see [30]–[31] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Nevertheless, in our view, AR Choo’s decision did not preclude H from raising <span class="font-italic">res</span> <span class="font-italic">judicata</span> against W for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 First, since it is unclear whether Lee J had decided the point, it is also unclear whether he endorsed that aspect of AR Choo’s decision which decided that W was not precluded from raising the WOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, in order for <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> to apply, AR Choo’s determination that W was not precluded from raising the WOA had to be fundamental to his decision to allow W’s application to convert OS 1359 into a writ action. In <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span><span class="font-italic"> v Goh Lian Teck and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) elaborated at [35] that for issue estoppel to be established, the previous determination on the issue in question must have been fundamental and not merely collateral to the previous decision so that the decision could not stand without that determination. He referred to K R Handley, <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower, Turner</span> <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">Handley</span><span class="font-italic">:</span> <span class="font-italic">The Doctrine</span><span class="font-italic"> of Res Judicata</span> (Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 1996) and <span class="font-italic">Blair</span> <span class="font-italic">v Curran</span> (1939) 62 CLR 464. This proposition was not disputed before us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 AR Choo need not have decided that W was not precluded from raising the WOA in order to allow her application to convert OS 1359 into a writ action. Both the <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> point against W as well as the existence of the WOA could be left to be decided by the trial judge. It would have been different if AR Choo had decided to dismiss W’s application <span class="font-italic">because</span> she was precluded from raising the WOA. In that scenario, there would be no substantial dispute of fact left to be decided.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether W was precluded from relying on the WOA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 We now come back to the decision of Gill J on whether W was precluded from relying on the WOA because of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Gill J was of the view that the decision of DJ Toh did not preclude W from relying on the WOA as there was no final and conclusive decision by DJ Toh on the issue. This was because of the last sentence at [9] of the DJGD. It appears that Gill J favoured the first interpretation (see [15(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The parties did not produce the minute sheet of the hearings on 10 August 2018 and 6 September 2018 before Tan JC to Gill J. However, Gill J was of the view that even assuming that W’s counsel had abandoned the WOA before Tan JC, there was nothing to indicate that Tan JC had reached a final and conclusive decision on the merits of the WOA. Hence, Tan JC’s decision did not meet the first requirement of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or issue estoppel as mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v</span> <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157, at [14]–[15], <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits (see [47] of the Judgment). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 With respect, we are of the view that this is where Gill J erred. The reason why Tan JC did not decide on the merits of the WOA was because W had abandoned it. One would therefore not expect him to rule on it. The real issue was not one of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> in the sense that Tan JC had ruled on the WOA but whether, as we mentioned at [28] above, there was <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> in the wider sense because W had not raised the WOA before Tan JC when she ought to have done so. Indeed, she had in fact deliberately withdrawn it and thereafter proceeded on the basis that the WOA did not apply. She is bound by that election regardless of the earlier decision of DJ Toh, which we need not discuss any further. In other words, whatever the decision of DJ Toh meant, this was academic because W had abandoned the WOA on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the circumstances, it was not open to Gill J to hear evidence and decide on the WOA. Hence, we allowed H’s appeal and set aside Gill J’s decision in respect of W’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">H’s counterclaim for damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As for H’s counterclaim for damages, we agreed with Gill J that W was not obliged to buy H’s interest in MA under the decisions of DJ Toh and Tan JC (see [117] of the Judgment). She had a right but not an obligation to do so. This counterclaim was not the subject of the Appellant’s Case, though H’s notice of appeal specifically stated that he was appealing against Gill J’s dismissal of it.
