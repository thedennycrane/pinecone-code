Arguments over this dispute have encompassed a whole litany of legal contentions, from the various permutations of mistake and estoppel, to considerations of unjust enrichment, and even resulting trust.  However, what remains central is the proper interpretation of the relevant settlement agreement, particularly in the context of the negotiations between the parties.  As I will go on to explain, a proper interpretation of the words in question elides the need for a consideration of the wide-ranging panoply of legal arguments which have been raised in the parties’ closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff is an insurance company regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and in the business of general insurance.

As in the case of any motor insurance policy, the insured is liable to make excess payments, and the insurer is liable only for the amount over and above the excess.  In the Policy, the parties agreed to set the excess at S$5,000 per claim, which meant that the defendant has to bear any claim under the Policy up to the amount of S$5,000.

The defendant submits that the recitals and terms of that agreement are to the effect that the defendant’s total liability for the BCP is in the sum of S$500,000.  Since the defendant had, in the second half of 2014, paid the sum of S$200,000 towards the BCP, it was only required to pay the remaining balance of S$300,000 towards the BCP, and had in fact done so upon the execution of the Settlement Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement binds the parties, and the total amount of BCP payable by the defendant under the Policy is thus S$500,000, and not S$1m as the plaintiff contends.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The defendant submits that the Settlement Agreement cannot be vitiated under the doctrine of unilateral mistake because the requirements for that doctrine to apply are not satisfied.  In particular, the defendant argues that there was no mistake as to the purpose of the S$500,000 paid, that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of any mistake the plaintiff might have been operating under, and that in any event, the alleged mistake was not a mistake as to a term of the Settlement Agreement which entitled the plaintiff to rescission.

Was it a security deposit for potential excess payments for third party claims under the Policy, as alleged by the defendant, or was it, as alleged by the plaintiff, payment by the defendant toward the amount of BCP claimed by the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 A determination as to the nature of the S$500,000 payment will also set the proper context for the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement, which is the next key issue which must be resolved.  The dispute over the issue of interpretation is as follows.  The defendant contends that the Settlement Agreement had the effect of fixing the liability of the defendant for the BCP at the total sum of S$500,000.  By contrast, the plaintiff argues that (a) the Settlement Agreement left untouched the parties’ earlier compromise that the BCP would be settled at the total sum of S$1m, and that (b) the Settlement Agreement was entered into to provide the defendant with a release and discharge upon the payment of the outstanding amount of S$300,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The resolution of the remaining issues as to mistake, resulting trust, unjust enrichment, and estoppel will flow from a determination of the first two issues set out above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Payment of S$500,000 Made In September 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The defendant’s case that the payment of S$500,000 to the plaintiff on 24 September 2013 was for the purpose of providing the plaintiff with a security deposit for potential excess payments rests primarily on two main contentions.  The first is that the payment had been made pursuant to the plaintiff’s oral request, through HP Tan, to which JH had agreed.  The second is that the two payment vouchers issued by the defendant in relation to the cheque payments stated that they were “Deposit[s] to [the plaintiff]”.  The defendant points out that the two payment vouchers were acknowledged by an employee from the plaintiff when the cheques were handed over.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In relation to the submission that HP Tan and JH had an oral discussion about the alleged request for a security deposit, that submission turns largely on my assessment of the credibility of these two gentlemen, both of whom took centre-stage as witnesses at the trial.  In this regard, I found JH’s evidence, taken as a whole, to be seriously lacking in credibility.  Further, as will be explained below, his position on the issue of the deposit fluctuated over time and was inconsistent with not only the events leading to the payment of the S$500,000, but also the communications between the parties that followed that payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There is no dispute between the parties that, in August 2013, the plaintiff was pressing the defendant to make payment of the outstanding excess payments of approximately S$600,000.  This referred to excess payments for third party claims made against the defendant, which the plaintiff had already paid out.  The plaintiff’s solicitors had issued a letter to the defendant dated 16 August 2013 demanding payment of this outstanding amount.

It was intended to be “security for the <span class="font-italic">anticipated Policy excess recovery for … pending claims</span>” (emphasis added).  At that time, there were approximately 575 pending third party claims against the defendant.  The reason given for the request was that there was already approximately S$600,000 in outstanding excess payments owed by the defendant for settled claims (which the plaintiff had already paid out), and the plaintiff wanted an assurance that the defendant would eventually make payment when the excess amounts in relation to the “pending claims” became due from the defendant.  After all, by then, the defendant’s taxi license had not been renewed and its business in that regard was ceasing.  Of course, there was no legal obligation for the defendant to agree to such a request given that, under the Policy, the excess payments were only due in arrears from the defendant to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In JH’s <span class="font-italic">oral</span> evidence, he claimed that he then raised the idea to HP Tan that the plaintiff should take cash as a security deposit instead of the banker’s guarantee.

It was not for the purpose of providing a cash deposit as security for either outstanding excess payments or potential excess payments.  I accept HP Tan’s evidence that he never had any discussion with JH about the amount of S$500,000 being paid as a security deposit of some sort.  JH’s claim that there was such a discussion is not consistent with the correspondence between the parties at the material time.  There was no reference in any of the correspondence to any security deposit being paid by the defendant for excess payments, whether outstanding or potential.  In fact, I note that JH could not even provide any specific particulars as to the alleged discussion he had with HP Tan, for example when, where, and how it took place.  The defendant’s pleadings are deafeningly silent on any such particulars, and even in his oral evidence, JH could only vaguely claim that the discussion occurred “during one of the lunches outside the office” “at the Shenton Way area”.

</div>  This lack of any specificity, coupled with the absence of support for JH’s claim from the contemporaneous correspondence, renders it impossible for me to accept the defendant’s assertion that the S$500,000 had been paid as a security deposit of sorts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I also accept ET Lim’s evidence that the issue of the banker’s guarantee was dropped after the defendant agreed to take over all the third party claims for property damage.  This is commercially logical since the banker’s guarantee was sought by the plaintiff to secure potential excess payments.  If the defendant was going to be “self-insured”, there would no longer be any significant potential excess payments to be claimed from the defendant going forward.  That being the case, it makes no sense for the defendant to have paid a significant sum of S$500,000 as a deposit for <span class="font-italic">potential</span> excess payments.  As such, I cannot accept JH’s evidence as to the alleged purpose of the S$500,000 payment.  I add for completeness that, even if one were to accept that JH had agreed to take over only the third party claims <span class="font-italic">below</span> S$5,000, that would still provide a commercially sensible reason for the plaintiff to dispense with its request for a banker’s guarantee.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The correspondence and events that followed the payment quite unequivocally confirm my view that the S$500,000 was not a security deposit of sorts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On 19 November 2013, HP Tan sent an email to JH chasing for further payments towards the BCP claimed by the plaintiff.

There is no doubt that this is a reference to the S$500,000 dated 23 September 2013 because he specifically referred to the three cheques and the respective amounts given on that day.

Instead, in one email in response dated 27 November 2013, JH questioned why he “still” had to make further payments towards the BCP.

During cross-examination, when he was questioned on this, JH’s rather tenuous explanation for this choice of words was that it was “an early morning 9.04[am]” when he sent that email, and that he might have been thinking of something else.

</div>  I should add that what is obvious from the evidence as to the meetings held and correspondence exchanged is how anxious the plaintiff was to settle the defendant’s liability for the outstanding excess as well.  If it was the case that the parties had agreed that the sum of S$500,000 was a deposit for potential excess payments, as claimed by the defendant, it is highly surprising that the plaintiff would have been so anxious to recover the then-outstanding excess payment amount of approximately S$130,000 from the defendant.

</div>  After all, the defendant’s business had ceased by September 2013 because its taxi license had not been renewed, and at least a significant portion of the third party damage claims had been taken over by the defendant (see [58] above).  That would obviously mean that the potential excess payments of any pending claims handled by the plaintiff would not be a significant amount.  Quite clearly therefore, the figure of S$500,000, if <span class="font-italic">genuinely </span>held as a deposit, would be more than sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s claim to the outstanding excess payments.  Put simply, there would have been little to stop the plaintiff from claiming the outstanding excess payment of approximately S$130,000 from the alleged deposit of $500,000, <span class="font-italic">if</span> it had been paid for the very purpose of meeting such excess payments.  In my judgment, the conduct of both the plaintiff and defendant after the payment of the S$500,000 is completely at odds with that sum being held as a deposit for excess payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The defendant relies heavily on the two payment vouchers for the three cheques adding up to S$500,000 given to the plaintiff on 24 September 2013.

</div>  The defendant points to the fact that it had obtained an acknowledgment by one of the plaintiff’s employees on the payment vouchers, and that the vouchers described the payments as a “Deposit” to the plaintiff.  In my judgment, I do not think that this notation on the two payment vouchers takes the defendant very far.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In the first place, I do not agree that the fact that an unidentified employee of the plaintiff had acknowledged the payment vouchers by initialling on them is an indication that the plaintiff accepted that the sum of S$500,000 was to be held as a deposit.  That is simply reading too much into an acknowledgment, which is an administrative task when one receives cheques.  The defendant’s approach places undue weight on the acknowledgment and elevates form over substance.  In my judgment, it is still incumbent on the defendant to show that parties had discussed and <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> that the payment of S$500,000 was to be held by the plaintiff as a deposit for a specific purpose.  If there is no agreement as to the purpose of that payment, the plaintiff is perfectly entitled to apply that sum towards its claims against the defendant.  As I have already found, the defendant has simply been unable to establish that there was any such discussion or agreement.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Further, I find that the defendant had the practice of describing many of its payments to the plaintiff as “deposits” in its accounting documents.  For example, there were four payments made in the second half of 2014 to the plaintiff of S$50,000 each, where there is no dispute that the payments were made to reduce the BCP payable.

</div>  I am unable to accept either of these explanations – the former does not explain why the payment vouchers, which were prepared in 2014, described the payments as “deposits” when it is not the defendant’s case that they were deposits at all, and the latter is simply all too convenient.  Thus, I find that the fact that the two payment vouchers for the S$500,000 payment in September 2013 described the cheques as “Deposit[s]” is not necessarily indicative of the agreed purpose for the payments.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In any event, what is not disputed by the parties is that, in May 2014, the parties had reached an “in principle” settlement on the issue of the BCP, where the defendant agreed to pay a further S$500,000 in ten equal instalments toward BCP.  This is recorded in an email from HP Tan to JH on 28 May 2014.

</div>  Where the plaintiff’s case differs is that the sum of S$500,000 paid in September 2013 had always been for the purposes of reducing the BCP owed, and as such, there was no question of the parties having agreed only in May 2014 to apply that sum to the payment of the BCP.  In my judgment, for the reasons I have set out in this section, I find that the plaintiff’s version of events is by far more consonant with the correspondence between the parties, and with commercial sense and logic.  As such, I have little hesitation in rejecting JH’s evidence.  Instead, I find that the payment made in September 2013 was quite clearly a payment by the defendant towards the reduction of the BCP. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Interpretation of the Settlement Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The defendant’s case is that, by July 2014, the issue regarding the BCP that it had to pay the plaintiff was resolved.  On 10 July 2014, the plaintiff had prepared a draft deed of undertaking and sent it over to JH because the plaintiff wanted JH to take on the personal obligation of making the payments on behalf of the defendant.

</div>  In that draft deed, apart from the outstanding excess payments due from the defendant, it is also recorded that the defendant still owed approximately S$2.1m in BCP, and would be making payment of another S$500,000 in BCP to the plaintiff in ten equal monthly instalments.  This translated to a total liability of S$1m for BCP, because the S$2.1m figure was one that had been reduced from S$2.6m by reason of the S$500,000 already paid in September 2013 (see [50] to [52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Pursuant to the compromise reached on the issue of the BCP, and as outlined above at [20], the defendant made payment of S$200,000 for the BCP in four S$50,000 instalments over the course of the next few months in the second half of 2014.  However, disputes between the parties continued because of disagreement over which third party claims would be handled by the plaintiff and which would be handled by the defendant.  This was because the defendant appeared to have changed its mind about taking over the handling of all third party claims (see [54] and [55] above).

In <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich</span><span class="font-italic"> Insurance</span>”) at [131], the Court of Appeal accepted a number of “canons and techniques of contractual interpretation”.  Two such canons are particularly pertinent to the present case: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The contextual dimension</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fourthly, the exercise in construction is informed by the <span class="font-italic">surrounding circumstances or external context</span>. Modern judges are prepared to look beyond the four corners of a document, or the bare words of an utterance. It is permissible to have regard to the <span class="font-italic">legal</span>, <span class="font-italic">regulatory</span><span class="font-italic">, and</span> <span class="font-italic">factual matrix</span> which constitutes the background in which the document was drafted or the utterance was made. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Business purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fifthly, within this framework due consideration is given to the <span class="font-italic">commercial purpose</span> of the transaction or provision. The courts have regard to the overall purpose of the parties with respect to a particular transaction, or more narrowly the reason why a particular obligation was undertaken. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These considerations, in particular, will contour the Court’s approach to interpreting the Settlement Agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 On the facts, it is clear that the well-documented correspondence detailing the parties’ discussions satisfies the three well-known <span class="font-italic">Zurich</span><span class="font-italic"> Insurance</span> requirements for admissibility as it is (a) relevant in outlining the parties’ intentions as to the S$500,000 payment, (b) available to both parties given that it was exchanged between them, and (c) relates to the clear and obvious context of the moneys due between the parties and the terms of the Settlement Agreement ultimately reached.  Further, I do not find that the entire agreement clause included at cl 9(iv) of the Settlement Agreement is any impediment to my consideration of the context underpinning the Settlement Agreement.  The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor</span><span class="font-italic"> and others and another appeal</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 held at [41] that entire agreement clauses will usually not prevent a court from adopting a contextual approach in contractual interpretation.  Rather, as emphasised by the Court in <span class="font-italic">Sheng Siong Supermarket Pte Ltd v Carilla Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1094 at [36], the effect of an entire agreement clause is to render inadmissible extrinsic evidence which reveals terms <span class="font-italic">inconsistent</span> with those in the written contract.  On the facts, I do not read cl 9(iv) of the Settlement Agreement as precluding recourse to the relevant context for the purpose of interpreting the text of the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Beyond the abovementioned considerations, the Court of Appeal also made clear in <span class="font-italic">MCH International Pte Ltd and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others and other appeals</span> [2019] 2 SLR 837 at [37] and [38] that the relevant context to the text of an agreement would include the applicable commercial purpose of the document.  The Court of Appeal recognised that due consideration must be given to the commercial purpose underpinning why a particular obligation was undertaken, and cited with approval the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</span> [1997] AC 749 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In determining the meaning of the language of a commercial contract … the law therefore generally favours a commercially sensible construction. The reason for this approach is that a commercial construction is more likely to give effect to the intention of the parties. Words are therefore interpreted in the way which a reasonable commercial person would construe them. And <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the standard of the reasonable commercial person is hostile to technical interpretations</span> and undue emphasis on niceties of language. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal went on to observe at [41] that avoiding an outcome that is not commercially sensible is another factor among others which the court may “give succour to in its task of contractual interpretation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 While I accept the significant role of context in determining the appropriate interpretation of the Settlement Agreement, I am also cognizant of the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd)</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1187 at [32], that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">However, an important caveat</span> is necessary at this particular juncture: there must be a <span class="font-italic">balance</span> between the text and the context. In other words, the context <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be utilised as an excuse by the court concerned to <span class="font-italic">rewrite</span> the terms of the contract according to<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">its </span>(<span class="font-italic">subjective</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>view of what it thinks the result ought to be in the case at hand. To this end, the court must always base its decision on <span class="font-italic">objective</span> evidence. More specifically, whilst there is a need to avoid an absurd result, this aim cannot be pursued at all costs; it must necessarily give way if the objective evidence clearly bears out a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">causative connection</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>between the absurd result or consequences on the one hand and the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the contract on the other … Avoiding an absurd result is thus<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">one factor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(albeit a not unimportant one) which is considered in the entire process of interpretation by the court. Put simply, the court<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">must</span> ascertain, based on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all the relevant objective evidence, the intention of the parties </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">at the time they entered into the contract.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Due attention will therefore also have to be paid to the plain text of the Settlement Agreement, which in any event should be the starting point for contractual interpretation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Bearing the legal principles above in mind, the Court is being asked in this case to interpret what Recitals C and D of the Settlement Agreement mean.  Specifically, the Court has to consider whether those recitals mean, as the defendant contends, that the parties had agreed to settle the plaintiff’s entire claim to the BCP by the defendant paying a settlement sum of S$500,000, and that the previous payment of S$500,000 made in September 2013 must be refunded.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my judgment, the recitals in the Settlement Agreement were simply to record what the parties had <span class="font-italic">already</span> <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> in order to settle the plaintiff’s claim for the BCP.  In that regard, while they are capable of more than one reading, I find that Recitals C and D do in fact capture the essence of what the parties had agreed in relation to the issue of the BCP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Recital C states that that the “actual” BCP owed by the defendant to the plaintiff is about S$2.6m.  This statement accurately records the plaintiff’s position since August 2013 that approximately S$2.6m <span class="font-italic">in toto</span> is owed by the defendant under the Policy as the BCP.  The defendant now appears to accept that this is factually the case.

</div>
</div>  The recital then goes on to state that, as a gesture of goodwill and on a without prejudice basis, the plaintiff has agreed to forgive “the bulk” of the BCP and only require the repayment of the sum of S$500,000.  The defendant argues that this means that the plaintiff has agreed to forgive approximately S$2.1m of BCP, but the plaintiff argues that it means that the plaintiff has agreed to forgive only around S$1.6m because S$500,000 had already been paid in September 2013 to reduce the BCP owed to S$2.1m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In my view, a contextual reading of Recital C shows that the plaintiff’s contention is the right one.  As has already been explained at length (see, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, [66] above), I find that the defendant had paid S$500,000 in September 2013 to reduce the amount of BCP owed from S$2.6m to S$2.1m.  As such, the defendant would know very well that the “bulk” of the BCP being forgiven, bearing in mind its earlier payment in September 2013 of S$500,000, meant the amount of S$1.6m.  This must have been manifestly clear to the defendant given that there was never any suggestion at any point in time up to the execution of the Settlement Agreement that the plaintiff would at some future point in time refund the sum of S$500,000 to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In fact, as one would recall, since May 2014 when the figure of a total sum of S$1m was agreed upon as the settlement amount for the BCP claim, there had never been any discussion between the parties as to a change in that figure of S$1m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As such, the figure of S$500,000 stated in Recital C as the sum of the BCP for which the defendant had to pay must clearly have been intended by the parties as only a reference to the sum of the S$200,000 paid in the second half of 2014 <span class="font-italic">after</span> the “in principle” settlement was reached, <span class="font-italic">and</span> the S$300,000 that the defendant had yet to pay.  In effect, the recital recorded the “in principle” agreement reached by the parties in May 2014 that the defendant only had to pay a <span class="font-italic">further</span> S$500,000 to settle the BCP claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Hence, Recital D goes on to describe S$500,000 as the “without prejudice outstanding [BCP]” and explains that it comprises the S$200,000 already paid and the S$300,000 to be paid upon the signing of the Settlement Agreement.  The earlier S$500,000 paid in September 2013 is not part of the “without prejudice outstanding [BCP]” simply because it was not “outstanding” as at the time the “in principle” agreement was reached.  It had already been paid to reduce the claimed BCP to S$2.1m almost two years prior to the signing of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87  As such, I find that the defendant’s suggested interpretation of the Settlement Agreement cannot be supported by a contextual reading of that document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Quite apart from that, I find that JH himself <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that the Settlement Agreement did not change the “in principle” agreement between the parties since May 2014 regarding the issue of the BCP, and that the defendant had no claim for a refund of the S$500,000 paid in September 2013 arising from the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  I noted that JH’s AEIC does not state his alleged belief that the effect of the Settlement Agreement was in any way different from what the parties had agreed on the issue of the settlement of the BCP claim since May 2014.  The contention by the defendant about the “change” brought about by Victor Tan’s draft of 9 July 2015 was raised only at trial and in JH’s evidence when he was cross-examined.

</div>  Incredibly, he insisted under cross-examination that he was quite willing to pay the already-agreed sum of S$1m to settle the claim for the BCP, but wanted to know why the plaintiff was now asking for <span class="font-italic">less</span> from the defendant to settle the BCP claim.

</div>  But, if it was in fact the case that JH understood the draft settlement agreement sent by the plaintiff as a counter-proposal that the total amount of BCP he would pay be only S$500,000 and not S$1m, and that in effect he would later get a refund of the S$500,000 he had paid in September 2013, I find it patently absurd that he would have thought he was being “bullied”.  In his cross-examination, JH could not give any credible explanation as to why he would be unhappy if he truly thought that the plaintiff was offering to settle the BCP claim for <span class="font-italic">half</span> of what had been originally agreed and would be refunding him S$500,000 later.  The only explanation JH attempted to make was an unconvincing reference to the GST and other tax liabilities which might accrue.  I have considerable difficulty with this explanation.  Rejecting a saving of 50% on the BCP payable for 7% of GST, even at its very highest, appears commercially indefensible to my mind.  When this absurdity was pointed out to JH, all he did was insinuate that “they [referring to the plaintiff] have some motive” and that he did not believe that the plaintiff would in fact refund him the S$500,000 deposit.

</div>  No details were given of any alleged motive, nor do I see any basis for any such allegations.  Accordingly, I reject JH’s evidence in this regard.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I also find the defendant’s case to be quite illogical as a matter of commercial reality.  Given that it is undisputed that there were no discussions whatsoever about any change to the agreed amount of the BCP to be paid, which had been for a total of S$1m since May 2014, it is inherently unlikely that the plaintiff would suddenly decide on 9 July 2015 to unilaterally propose settling the BCP claim at half the previously agreed figure.  JH confirmed that he never asked for any reduction of the BCP settlement sum.  He was also unable to articulate any coherent commercial rationale as to why the plaintiff would reduce the BCP settlement amount of its own accord.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Instead, the truth is that both parties believed, quite correctly, that the effect of the Settlement Agreement was simply that the defendant had to pay a further S$300,000 to make a total amount of S$1m of BCP paid to the plaintiff, and the defendant would thereafter obtain a full and final release from any other claims in relation to the BCP.  That was exactly what the defendant wanted in JH’s email of 1 April 2015.

</div>  That was JH’s only concern as an experienced businessman, in that he did not want to make any more payments for the BCP until he knew that there would be some finality to the plaintiff’s claims.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The parties’ conduct subsequent to the execution of the Settlement Agreement and the payment of the S$300,000 due from the defendant for the BCP is also quite telling.  There was an exchange of emails between the plaintiff’s officers and HL Suntek’s Francis Ng in the days following the execution of the Settlement Agreement where a statement of account sent by the plaintiff stating that the S$1m which was outstanding was matched against corresponding cheques given by the defendant adding up to S$1m, including the three cheques making up the S$500,000 payment in September 2013.

</div>  When asked in cross-examination why he remained silent until October 2017, JH said that he was waiting for the limitation period of six years for third party claims to expire before claiming his refund because the deposit would be held as security for potential excess payments.

</div>  I reject this explanation as lacking in credibility.  First of all, the limitation period of six years for third party claims for property damage would, in theory, not expire until 28 February 2018, which is six years from the time the Policy elapsed, and not in October 2017.  Second, JH’s reason that he was waiting for the limitation period to expire before seeking the return of the deposit is not found anywhere in his AEIC.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The more likely explanation is that the defendant has opportunistically made this claim hoping to capitalise on the ambiguity in the wording of the recitals in the Settlement Agreement and the use of the word “Deposit” in the two payment vouchers dated 23 September 2013.  As I have already explained, neither basis actually supports the defendant’s claim to the return of the sum of S$500,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For the above reasons, I find that the proper interpretation of the Settlement Agreement is simply that the defendant would have to pay the plaintiff a further S$300,000 upon the execution of the agreement, and that the parties would then have fully and finally settled the claims to the BCP.  There is no basis to suggest that the Settlement Agreement reduced the compromised BCP sum to S$500,000 from S$1m, and that the defendant would get a refund of the S$500,000 it paid in September 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Given my findings above, there is no need for me to consider the issues of mistake, estoppel, unjust enrichment, and resulting trust.  Without going into details, the facts do not appear to disclose any mistake by either party, and there is also no clear and unequivocal representation that would give rise to any estoppel.  The wording of the recitals, read in their proper context, simply does not give rise to the representations alleged by the defendant.  Similarly, I do not find that there is any justification for unjust enrichment or a resulting trust arising from the facts because there is no failure of basis.  The S$500,000 paid in September 2013 had been for the specific purpose of reducing the amount of the BCP, and it cannot be said that it had been paid for a purpose which had been thwarted or foiled such that a resulting trust might arise.  In a similar vein, there is no failure of basis because the basis for the payment of the S$500,000 was unambiguously for the BCP owed.  Simply put, several of the legal contentions raised by the defendant do not require my consideration at all given my factual findings.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For the reasons set out in this judgment, I grant the plaintiff a declaration that the sum of S$500,000 paid by the defendant to the plaintiff in September 2013 was paid towards the BCP under the Policy, and that the defendant is accordingly not entitled to any refund of that amount.  I also dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I will deal with the issue of costs separately.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lok Vi Ming SC, Lee Sien Liang Joseph and Yap Pei Yin (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Aqbal Singh a/l Kuldip Singh and Cheng Cui Wen (Pinnacle Law LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
