<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1 This is an appeal against the decision of Assistant Registrar May Loh

who dismissed the application of the Appellant ("Sia") to set aside a statutory demand

dated 1 March 2001 served on him by the Respondent ("HKR"). On 23 October 2001, after

hearing counsel for the parties, I dismissed the appeal. Sia has since appealed and I now give my

grounds of decision.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 By an agreement ("the Loan Agreement") dated 18 November 1997, HKR

lent US$3 million to Murex Co. Ltd ("Murex"), a Thai company that is the developer and

owner of the Blue Canyon Country Club ("BCCC"). Pursuant to clause 7 of the Loan

Agreement, Murex issued to HKR 250 new club memberships in BCCC as security for the loan.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 The US$3 million loan was repayable on 31 March 1998. On 27 March 1998 Murex

requested HKR for an extension of time. HKR agreed to extend it to 30 April 1998 in consideration of

Sia unconditionally guaranteeing payment of all the indebtedness of Murex to HKR. Sia duly executed

this guarantee ("the Guarantee"). However on 30 April 1998 Murex was still unable to make

payment. HKR agreed to a further extension on condition that Sia confirmed in writing that the

Guarantee remained good and valid. This he did on 28 May 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 In the event, Murex was unable to pay HKR and the latter commenced Suit No.

2239/1998 against Sia to recover the debt pursuant to the Guarantee. That action was settled and on

12 January 2000 the parties entered a consent order ("the Consent Order") in the following

terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">THIS ACTION having on 12 January 2000 come on for trial before The Honorable

  Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh,</p>
<p align="justify">AND the parties having agreed terms of settlement,</p>
<u>
<p align="justify">BY CONSENT IT IS ORDERED</p></u> that:

  <p align="justify">1 Judgment be entered against the Defendant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. for the amount set out in the Statement annexed hereto;<br/>

    b. interest at the rate of 15% per annum on the amount outstanding; and<br/>

    c. costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2 The Defendant will make payment of all amounts due and owing to the

  Plaintiffs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. USD500,000 on or before entering of the Consent Judgment;<br/>

    b. USD750,000 on or before 31 January 2000;<br/>

    c. USD1 million on or before 28 February 2000; and<br/>

    d. the balance amounts due  on or before 15 March 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">3 With the receipt of each payment, the Plaintiffs will release to the

  Defendant, the number of memberships based on the amount received, rounded down to the nearest

  number of memberships. The value of each membership to be fixed at USD23,500.</p>
<p align="justify">4 Upon payment of all sums due and owing to the Plaintiffs, all memberships are

  to be released to the Defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">5 Execution proceedings against the Defendant shall be taken out only in the

  event of default of any of the above terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 Sia made some payment pursuant to this consent order but defaulted on the rest.

On 1 March 2001 HKR, through its solicitors, issued a statutory demand ("the Statutory

Demand") pursuant to section 62 of the Bankruptcy Act to Sia to demand the remaining sum, which

was around US$2.2 million. Before the Assistant Registrar below Sia sought to set aside the

Statutory Demand on the following grounds:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) that service of the Statutory Demand was irregular; and</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) that the Statutory Demand failed to state that HKR held new club

  memberships in BCCC as security for the loan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However before me counsel for Sia, Mr Intekhab, said that he was only proceeding

on the second ground, i.e. the failure to state in the Statutory Demand that HKR held the new club

memberships as security for the loan.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 First of all it should be noted that the club memberships were not issued by

Sia, who is the guarantor of the loan. They were issued by Murex. Mr Intekhab, argued that this

became security from Sia pursuant to the Consent Order. I am unable to see how this can be so.

Paragraph 3 is the relevant part of the Consent Order. But that merely states that upon receipt of

each instalment, HKR was to release to Sia a number of memberships depending on the amount repaid.

Mr Intekhab argued that the last sentence, which states: <i>"The value of each membership to be

fixed at USD23,500"</i>, means that the club memberships were held as security with each one

valued at US$23,500. With respect I cannot see how this can be. First of all, I note that it is a

well known fact that club memberships fluctuate in value depending on supply and demand. Although no

evidence was given as to the value of the memberships in question, I note that the number still held

by HKR was in excess of 200 and to dispose of such a large number to realise the security would most

certainly entail a drop in its market price. Mr Intekhab did not dispute that the market value of

the club memberships may very well not be US$23,500. He said that this was what the parties had

agreed was the value. But quite apart from those facts, as a general proposition, I cannot see the

logic in any creditor agreeing with the debtor as to the value of any security he holds. The

usefulness of any security lies in the ability of a creditor to dispose of it and use the proceeds

to repay the debt. If there is a shortfall, the creditor would normally look to other means to

enforce the debt. In certain situations, e.g. where the creditor is prepared to keep the chattel he

holds as security, he might agree with the debtor as to its value and in default of payment, the

creditor would obtain ownership of it with the agreed value accruing to the debtor. However the

present case is clearly not a situation where the creditor had agreed on the value of a security. In

fact the club memberships were not issued by Sia but by Murex. As the guarantor against whom HKR had

proceeded, Sia would be entitled by way of subrogation to the club memberships held by HKR as

security for the loan. The Consent Order clearly recognises this and provides for HKR to release to

Sia the security it holds in proportion to the instalment payments. Hence the fixing of the value of

each club membership at US$23,500 in order to determine the appropriate number to release at each

stage. It would be for Sia to dispose of the memberships and account to Murex for them. In my

opinion, it is not possible to construe paragraph 3 of the Consent Order as providing that the club

memberships constitute security given by Sia.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The second point that Mr Intekhab raised was that even if it was Murex that had

provided the security, it was nevertheless <i>"security for the debt"</i> for the purposes

of rule 94(5) of the Bankruptcy Rules, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(5) If the creditor holds any property of the debtor or any security for the

  debt, there shall be specified in the demand </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the full amount of the debt; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the nature and value of the security or the assets.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Where this rule is breached the statutory demand will be set aside by the court

pursuant to rule 98(2)(c) which states that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(2) The court shall set aside the statutory demand if </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) it appears that the creditor holds assets of the debtor or security in

    respect of the debt claimed by the demand, and either rule 94(5) has not been complied with, or

    the court is satisfied that the value of the assets or security is equivalent to or exceeds the

    full amount of the debt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 In <i>Re Loh Lee Keow &amp; Anor, ex p Keppel TatLee Bank Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 503</nobr>, Woo JC held that on a proper interpretation of the Bankruptcy Rules made under the Bankruptcy

Act, the word "security" in rules 94(5) and 98(2) meant "security on the property of

the debtor". In the present case, the security for the debt was not provided by the debtor,

i.e. Sia, but by Murex. Following <i>Re Loh Lee Keows case</i>, it would not be necessary to

state in the Statutory Demand the fact that HKR held the club memberships as security as they were

not Sias property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 Mr Intekhab sought to persuade me that <i>Re Loh Lee Keows case</i> was

wrongly decided. He submitted that the clear words of rule 94(5), viz. <i>"any security for the

debt"</i> and rule 98(2), viz. <i>"security in respect of the debt claimed"</i> meant

that the club memberships were included notwithstanding that they were not issued by Sia. However in

a very tightly argued judgment, the judge had demonstrated that the construction he held was the

only one possible. Mr Intekhab was not able to say in what manner the judge had erred. Indeed I

would respectfully agree with the reasons given by the judge, the details of which he has, with

respect, ably set out in the judgment and I need not repeat them here.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 Mr Intekhab argued that this would put the principal debtor in a better

position than the guarantor in that the former has the benefit of the security but not the latter.

Woo JC had recognised this and said as follows at 35:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">35 It may seem unfair that where the borrower (assuming an individual) has

  provided, say, a mortgage to secure the debt, the borrower cannot be made a bankrupt unless the

  creditor gives up the mortgage or claims the balance only of the debt after deducting the

  estimated value of the mortgage, whereas a guarantor of the borrowers liability can still be

  made a bankrupt without requiring the creditor to take the same steps. However, that appears

  clearly to be the intention of the legislation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 In the premises, the statutory demand was regular and the Assistant Registrar

was correct in refusing to set it aside. Accordingly I dismissed the appeal with costs fixed at

$1,200.</p>
