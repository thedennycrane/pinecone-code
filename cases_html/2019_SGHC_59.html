</div> Nonetheless, it is undisputed that the Property was registered in the names of R1 and his then-wife as joint tenants. Sometime in 2004, the manner of holding was changed to a tenancy-in-common. In 2008, R1’s then-wife filed for divorce. In the divorce proceedings, R1 took the same position that R2, R3 and R6 take in this application – that the Property had been sold to their parents <span class="font-italic">before</span> completion in 1982, and that although the Property was registered in his and his former wife’s names, it did not actually belong to either of them.

</div> (I should mention that R1’s position in the present proceedings is quite different and I will elaborate on that at a later point in this judgment.) Eventually, the parties reached a settlement as to how to deal with the Property for the purposes of the divorce proceedings. By way of a court order dated 23 July 2010, by consent, R1 was ordered to pay his former wife $1.5m for her 50% share and rights in the Property.

The issue of the Respondents’ entitlements to the net sales proceeds is inextricably linked to the anterior question of the <span class="font-italic">beneficial ownership of</span><span class="font-italic"> the Property</span>. If the Property was (as R1, R4 and R5 contend) <span class="font-italic">wholly owned</span> by R1 at the time of its sale, then it follows that he alone is entitled to the net sales proceeds arising therefrom. If, however, the Property was (as R2, R3 and R6 contend) held <span class="font-italic">on trust </span>by R1 at the time of its sale, the net sales proceeds form part of their parents’ estates, which then fall to be divided in accordance with the rules of distribution in the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed) (“Intestate Succession Act”). In this regard, it is important to note that letters of administration for both parents’ estates have yet to be granted (see [2] above). So my findings on the entitlements of the Respondents do not mean that the moneys can be paid to them yet. Thus, to be clear, I emphasise that any orders made in these proceedings are <span class="font-italic">not</span> to be construed as orders that the net sales proceeds be distributed to the various Respondents forthwith.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Beneficial ownership of the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>I begin by considering whether the Property was wholly owned by R1 or held on trust by R1 for the Respondents’ parents’ estates at the time of its sale. While this issue would ordinarily be resolved by the application of the principles of the law of equity and trusts, the present scenario is somewhat unusual given the existence of the SA and VD. In particular, as set out in cl 2 of the SA, it was <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> between R1 to R6 that R1 held the Property on trust for the Respondents’ parents’ estates (see [18] above). The critical question is this: what is the legal effect of such an agreement? In my judgment, the SA (as varied by the VD) is a compromise agreement by which R1 to R6 agreed that R1 held the Property on trust, and that each of the seven Respondents was beneficially entitled to the Property in equal shares. As R2, R3 and R6 point out, it is evident from para G of the preamble of the SA that the agreement was entered into precisely for the purpose of definitively resolving the dispute regarding the beneficial ownership of the Property, at least as between R1 to R6 (see [18] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>As against this, R1, R4 and R5 submit that the SA and VD are “invalid” because they are premised on a trust which, according to them, does not actually exist (see [20] above). In this regard, they submit at length on the events that allegedly took place between R1 and his parents in 1982.

</div> As earlier foreshadowed, the position which R1 now takes is <span class="font-italic">inconsistent</span> with that taken in the earlier divorce proceedings. To recapitulate, R1 previously maintained that the Property had been sold to his parents <span class="font-italic">before</span> the completion of the sale to him and his then-wife in 1982, and thus although the Property was registered in both his and his then-wife’s names, it did not actually belong to either of them (see [3] above). However, R1 now takes the position that he entered into the agreement to sell and transfer the Property to his parents only <span class="font-italic">after</span> completion, but that this “terminated/fell through” because R1’s parents had stopped making the requisite instalment payments sometime in 1987.

</div> R1 further argues that even if the Respondents’ parents had purchased the Property from R1, no trust could have been created over the Property in his parents’ favour because the statutory requirement that a declaration of trust in respect of any immovable property must be evidenced in writing was not satisfied (see s 7 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 (c 3) (UK), which, according to R1, applies because the trust in question would have been made in or around 1982 and thus predates s 7 of the current Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>In my view, the argument that the SA and VD are “invalid” because they are premised on a trust that does not actually exist fundamentally misapprehends how compromise agreements operate. The relevant principles are comprehensively set out in <span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [54], [56] (“<span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Real Estate Consortium Pte Ltd v East Coast Properties Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2011] 2 SLR 758 (“<span class="font-italic">Real Estate</span>”) at [53]–[61] and may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A settlement agreement to resolve disputes between parties puts an end to all the contested issues covered by the agreement. Thereafter, it is the settlement agreement that governs the parties’ legal relationship.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The claims and counterclaims previously raised need not have any basis in fact or in law. They fall away.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The jurisprudential basis of a settlement agreement lies in contract. Therefore, the prior issues may still be relevant where the settlement agreement is affected by illegality, fraud, duress, undue influence or mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span>In sum, where parties have agreed to a certain factual and/or legal basis in a compromise agreement, that state of affairs <span class="font-italic">takes over as the basis of the parties’ relationship</span>. The argument that the SA and VD are “invalid” because they are premised on the existence of a trust over the Property when there is in fact no such trust flips the point on its head: a compromise agreement is <span class="font-italic">not</span> rendered “invalid” by proving that what is agreed to therein has no foundation in fact or in law. In fact, parties are <span class="font-italic">precluded</span> from reneging on the mutual compromise and re-opening the issues previously raised which led to the formation of the compromise agreement in the first place, except in the limited scenarios mentioned at [26(c)] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>The English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Colchester Borough Council v Smith</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [1992] 1 Ch 421 (“<span class="font-italic">Colchester</span>”) is also instructive as the facts are somewhat analogous. That case involved a dispute between the plaintiff council and the defendant over the latter’s rights, title or interest to a plot of land which he leased from the plaintiff council. The parties resolved this dispute by way of a written agreement for the lease of the land for a fixed term. In particular, cl 4 of this agreement contained an acknowledgment by the defendant that his possession of the land had been as a bare licensee or tenant at will and that he had not obtained any interest in the land by adverse possession. Subsequently, upon expiry of the agreement, the plaintiff council commenced proceedings to regain possession of the land and sought declarations that it was the freehold owner of the land in question, and that the defendant had no estate or interest in the land except as a tenant pursuant to the written agreement. Finding in favour of the plaintiff, Dillon LJ held that the written agreement was “a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>compromise of a dispute and that [the defendant], who had the advice of his solicitors and signed the agreement through them, [was] estopped by the terms of the agreement he made from going behind it and litigating the antecedent dispute” (at 435). The key proposition to be gleaned from <span class="font-italic">Colchester</span> is that parties are free to enter into a compromise agreement to resolve disputes over title or ownership to immovable property but, once that is done, they are precluded from re-opening the issues previously raised. It follows that the substantive merits of those underlying disputes are irrelevant. Rather, the more important question is whether the compromise agreement<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">itself</span> should be upheld. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>Accordingly, applying the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing, Real Estate </span>and <span class="font-italic">Colchester</span> to the present dispute, it does not matter whether R1 actually held the Property on trust for his parents’ estates. Rather, the real inquiry is whether, as a matter of <span class="font-italic">contract law</span>, there are grounds to set aside the SA and VD and re-open the issues which these agreements purportedly resolved, including the issue of whether R1 held the Property on trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>This brings me to the second and more pertinent argument raised by R1, R4 and R5: that the SA and VD are void because R1 had signed them under duress (see [20] above). Specifically, R1 refers to the fact that R2 to R6 had lodged a caveat against the Property just two days prior to the completion date of the sale to a third party (see [5] above). According to R1, the Applicant (which was acting for R2 to R6 at the time) had allegedly told him that this caveat would only be withdrawn if he accepted the terms stipulated by R2 to R6 and signed the SA. R1 thus claims that he signed the SA under the pressure of late completion.

</div>
</div> Accordingly, it could not have been the case that the Applicant had told R1 that R2 to R6 would only withdraw their caveat if he signed the SA. In any event, R1’s argument runs into further difficulties. There are two elements required to establish actionable duress: (a) pressure amounting to compulsion of will of the victim; and (b) illegitimacy of the pressure exerted (see <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners)</span> [2011] 2 SLR 232 (“<span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span>”) at [48] and [51]). In determining whether there is coercion of the will, it is material to consider the following factors (<span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span> at [44], citing <span class="font-italic">Pao</span><span class="font-italic"> On v Lau Yiu Long</span> [1980] AC 614):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the person alleged to have been coerced did or did not protest;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether, at the time he was allegedly coerced into making the contract, he did or did not have an alternative course open to him such as an adequate legal remedy; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether he was independently advised; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether after entering the contract he took steps to avoid it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>Having regard to the factors above, it is evident that the pressure R1 claims to have been under at the material time does not rise to the level of a “coercion of will”. First, and most significantly, R1 was at all material times represented by his conveyancing lawyer from Low Yeap Toh &amp; Goon LLP, Mr Tan Chong Peng Kenneth (“Mr Tan”). As R1 accepted in cross-examination, he had the benefit of Mr Tan’s legal advice at the time when he received the drafts of the SA.

</div> The DFA expressly referred to and was in fact premised on the SA and VD. This email is thus significant because it demonstrates that R1 accepted that the sum held by the Applicant as stakeholder was to be distributed among the Respondents in accordance with the SA and the VD, and was even actively taking steps to carry that distribution into effect. If R1 had truly signed the SA and VD under duress, he would not have acted in this manner. In this connection, it is important to bear in mind that R1 was by no means a naïve, simple-minded or weak-willed person. He had worked with an insurance company for nearly 40 years, where he was an agency manager and a top performer. He also held office as director and secretary in Seo’s &amp; Sons Pte Ltd for six years, and was the sole proprietor of Everton Enterprise for 29 years.

For this reason, I hold that the SA (as varied by the VD) is a <span class="font-italic">valid</span> compromise agreement binding on R1 to R6. R1 is thus precluded from re-opening the dispute as to whether he held the Property on trust for his parents’ estates, that issue having been definitively resolved in the <span class="font-italic">affirmative</span> by cl 2 of the SA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Respondents’ entitlements to the net sales proceeds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>Since the Property was held on trust by R1, it follows that the net sales proceeds form part of the Respondents’ parents’ estates and fall to be divided in accordance with the rules of distribution set out in the Intestate Succession Act. I emphasise that the question of the division of the property (or proceeds thereof) belonging to the Respondents’ parents’ estates – after payment of the expenses of due administration as prescribed by the Probate and Administration Act (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed) – among the persons entitled to succeed beneficially to them under s 5 of the Intestate Succession Act is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> the subject of the present application. Such distribution is to be determined and effected by the administrators of the Respondents’ parents’ estates, if and when the relevant letters of administration are granted. The issue presently before the court is a more specific one, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, how the Respondents’ entitlements to the net sales proceeds of the Property are <span class="font-italic">affected by the SA and VD</span>. This is a matter of <span class="font-italic">contract law</span>, which is a private arrangement between the relevant parties, and <span class="font-italic">overlays</span> the statutory regime. In other words, while the administrators of the Respondents’ parents’ estates are to determine and effect the distribution of the estates according to the rules set out in the Intestate Succession Act, as between the Respondents who are bound<span class="font-italic"> </span>by what has been agreed to in the SA and VD, a subsequent reshuffling of the proceeds which R1 and R7 have received may become necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>I turn now to consider the relevant contractual provisions. The obvious starting point is cl 3 of the SA (see [18] above), by which it was agreed between R1 to R6 that all seven Respondents were entitled to receive an equal share of the Property. It bears reiterating that R1 is precluded from arguing otherwise because the SA (as varied by the VD) is a valid compromise agreement binding upon R1 to R6 (see [27] and [37] above). Following from this, in principle, all seven Respondents should receive an equal share of the net sales proceeds of the Property when the parents’ estates are eventually divided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>However, there is an added complication to this: R1 and R7 each received certain sums out of the sales proceeds of the Property <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> the sum of $2,937,067.69 being deposited with the Applicant as stakeholder. For this reason, there are provisions in the SA and VD which deal <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> with R1’s and R7’s respective entitlements to the sum which the Applicant held as stakeholder. I begin with R1, who received a sum of money to settle and pay off the loan amount outstanding under a mortgage secured on the Property. This is reflected in cll 1 and 4 of the VD (which vary cll 4 and 8 of the SA respectively). In particular, cll 8.3 to 8.5 of the varied SA read as follows:

To put it simply:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to R1, cll 8.4 and 8.5 provide that if the amount he has already received is <span class="font-italic">greater than </span>his total entitlement to his parents’ estates, the amount in excess must be repaid forthwith, on such demand being made by R2 to R6. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In relation to R7, cl 8.2 provides that if his total entitlement to his parents’ estates is <span class="font-italic">greater than</span> the amount he has already received, he is entitled to further payment out of the net sales proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>Since R1 to R6 have agreed to these clauses, they are bound to act in accordance with them. This means that regardless of how the administrators divide the property of the parents’ estates among the Respondents, R1 to R6 are <span class="font-italic">contractually</span> <span class="font-italic">obligated</span> to ensure that the <span class="font-italic">eventual</span> <span class="font-italic">distribution</span> of the net sales proceeds complies with cll 8.2 to 8.5 of the SA (as varied by the VD), as well as all the other clauses set out therein. I emphasise that my holding on this issue is confined to how the provisions of the SA and VD affect the Respondents’ entitlements to the net sales proceeds merely <span class="font-italic">as a matter of contract law</span>, and do not displace the distribution rules set out in the Intestate Succession Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>Unfortunately, that eventual distribution is presently unknown. The letters of administration have yet to be granted and there is no information on the property comprising the Respondents’ parents’ estates before this court. The total amount actually available for distribution to the Respondents under s 5 of the Intestate Succession Act (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Respondents’ parents’ estates less the expenses of due administration) is unknown. Therefore, whether R1’s and R7’s respective total entitlements to their parents’ estates under the Intestate Succession Act are less or greater than the amounts that they have already received also remains unknown. In the premises, it is also not possible to determine the <span class="font-italic">specific quantum</span> <span class="font-italic">of net sales proceeds</span> that R1 and R7 are entitled to receive (if at all) pursuant to cll 8.2 to 8.5 of the varied SA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>There is a further point to be made specifically in respect of R7. As alluded to at [19] above, under the R1–R7 SA, it was agreed that R7’s entitlement would be limited to $430,000. The specific clause in question reads:

How then are these two clauses in the two different agreements to be reconciled? In my view, since R7 agreed that he would receive the sum of $430,000 and pursue “no further claim whatsoever”, for him to actively pursue a claim that he is entitled to more than $430,000 would likely constitute a breach of the R1–R7 SA. However, this is a unique situation where R1 to R6 have <span class="font-italic">separately</span> agreed to distribute the net sales proceeds in a certain way to account for R7 having previously received the sum of $430,000, and the logical consequence of that agreement between R1 to R6 is that R7 <span class="font-italic">may</span> stand to benefit by receiving further payment out of the net sales proceeds such that the total sum he receives exceeds $430,000. In these circumstances, I do not consider that R7’s receipt of more than $430,000 would amount to a breach of the R1–R7 SA, as he is merely the passive beneficiary of a separate contract to which he was not even a party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the SA and VD entered into by R1 to R6). Thus, in my view, cl 3 of the R1–R7 SA does <span class="font-italic">not</span> stand as an obstacle to the performance of cl 8.2 of the varied SA. In other words, although R7 has already received $430,000, he may receive a further payment out of the net sales proceeds so as to make up his total entitlement under the Intestate Succession Act, simply by virtue of R1 to R6 complying with their contractual obligation under cl 8.2 of the varied SA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>I make one final point before leaving this issue.

When the Applicant filed the OS in September 2017, it was the stakeholder of the net sales proceeds. It is therefore understandable why the Applicant thought it was appropriate, at the time, to seek a prayer for sums which it thought had been “illegally” paid out of the net sales proceeds to be refunded, presumably in order that these amounts could be safeguarded by the Applicant together with the rest of the moneys, for the Respondents’ benefit. However, since then, the net sales proceeds have been paid into court and the Applicant is no longer charged with the duty of stakeholding and safeguarding the net sales proceeds of the Property. Additionally, I have found that the Property was held on trust and so the net sales proceeds thereof form part of the Respondents’ parents’ estates. In these circumstances, it seems to me that it is for the administrators – if and when letters of administration are granted – to take the necessary steps to call in all the estate assets, which may include the amounts which were previously paid out to R1 and R7. Conversely, the Applicant no longer has any interest in safeguarding the net sales proceeds, and so it is not for the Applicant to seek a prayer that the amounts “illegally” paid out of the net sales proceeds to R1 and R7 be refunded. I therefore decline to make any order on prayer 4 of the OS.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Applicant’s claim to payment of stakeholding fees and disbursements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span>I turn now to consider the Applicant’s claim in these proceedings. As mentioned at [16] above, the Applicant argues that it is contractually entitled to $37,800 in fees and disbursements for acting as stakeholder from May 2017 to January 2018, and that this amount is to be paid out of the net sales proceeds prior to any distribution of the same to the Respondents. The key question is this: what quantum of fees and disbursements is the Applicant entitled to? In my view, based on an objective construction of the relevant documents, the agreement was for the Applicant to receive a one-off payment of $4,000 in stakeholding fees, plus disbursements incurred in the course of discharging its work, subject to proof. My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>The appropriate starting point is the wording of para 5 of the Letter, which sets out the parameters of the fee arrangement between the Applicant and R2 to R6 (see [12] above). I refer, in particular, to the phrase that the Applicant’s “costs for acting as stakeholder <span class="font-italic">will be S$4,000.00</span>” [emphasis added].

There is no further suggestion in this paragraph, or indeed in any other part of the Letter, that the fee of $4,000 is to be a <span class="font-italic">monthly </span>recurring charge for however long the Applicant acts as stakeholder.

</div> This explanation must be rejected. An objective reading of para 5 or the Letter as a whole clearly does not<span class="font-italic"> </span>support the Applicant’s case that the stakeholding fees quoted are contingent on it only spending 20 hours on the matter. As the drafter of the Letter, it was incumbent on the Applicant to have stated that clearly if that was indeed its position. Having failed to do so, the objective construction of the document – that the Applicant is only entitled to a one-off payment of $4,000 in fees for the entire duration for which it acted as stakeholder – must prevail. I further add that the Applicant only has itself to blame for assuming that the matter would only take 20 hours to resolve, given that this turned out to be a rather significant under-estimation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>As for the SA and VD (see [13] and [14] above), although they contain references to fees payable to the Applicant as stakeholder, these documents do not set out a specific quantum of fees, let alone suggest that such fees are payable on a monthly basis.

</div>
</div>
</div> If the Applicant’s argument here is that R2 to R6 are <span class="font-italic">contractually bound</span> to pay the sums stated in cl 3 of the DFA, then this argument is misconceived because the DFA was <span class="font-italic">never</span> executed by R1 and R7, who were two of the seven intended parties to the agreement. This being the case, the DFA has <span class="font-italic">no</span> legal effect, even on those who <span class="font-italic">had</span> executed the document. If the Applicant’s argument is that R2 to R6’s execution of the DFA (and thus, agreement to cl 3) is <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> of what the parties actually agreed to, then the question is whether such subsequent conduct constitutes cogent evidence of the parties’ agreement at the time when the contract was concluded (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Centre for Laser and Aesthetic Medicine Pte Ltd v GPK Clinic (Orchard) Pte Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 1 SLR 180 at [51]). In my view, R2 to R6’s agreement to cl 3 of the DFA at best demonstrates their assent to three specific outstanding bills being paid out of the net sales proceeds. It does not go so far as to demonstrate that their agreement <span class="font-italic">at the time of contracting</span> was for the Applicant to be paid monthly stakeholding fees of $4,000 (and disbursements of $200) out of the net sales proceeds. Notably, the DFA omits to mention that stakeholding fees for the months ahead would similarly be paid out of the net sales proceeds, as one might expect it to state if that was truly the parties’ intention. Overall, I therefore <span class="font-italic">reject</span> the Applicant’s argument that it is entitled to monthly stakeholding fees of $4,000 (summing up to a total of $36,000 for nine months). Rather, it is evident from an objective construction of the relevant documents (particularly, the Letter) that the Applicant is only entitled to a <span class="font-italic">one-off</span> payment of $4,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>Given my above finding, it is unnecessary to consider R2 to R6’s argument that <span class="font-italic">monthly</span> stakeholding fees of $4,000 amount to overcharging in breach of the LPPCR (see [22(b)]–[22(c)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>Having dealt with the issue of the Applicant’s fees, I turn now to consider the issue of disbursements. The relevant paragraph in the Letter is para 6, which states that the Applicant is entitled to “all disbursements incurred or to be incurred … in discharging the work entrusted to [it]”. It will be recalled that the Applicant claims monthly disbursements of $200 over a period of nine months (see [16] above). However, as disbursements can only be claimed in respect of <span class="font-italic">actual</span> out-of-pocket expenses, it goes without saying that the Applicant is only entitled to disbursements which it can <span class="font-italic">prov</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, to the court’s satisfaction,<span class="font-italic"> </span>to have been incurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>For this purpose, by way of letter dated 19 October 2018, I had directed the Applicant to file an affidavit detailing and exhibiting all documentary evidence to support the claimed disbursements of $200 in each invoice. Pursuant to this direction, the Applicant filed an affidavit on 30 October 2018 (“the Disbursements Affidavit”). This affidavit subsequently became the subject of two striking out applications filed on 13 November 2018 (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Summons No 5436 of 2018 filed by R1, R4 and R5 and Summons No 5437 of 2018 filed by R2, R3 and R6). I heard these applications on 21 February 2019 and agreed with R1 to R6 that the Disbursements Affidavit should be struck out on the basis of it failing to supply any evidence to explain how the monthly disbursements of $200 were arrived at. This being the case, there is thus presently <span class="font-italic">no evidence</span> before this court which proves that the Applicant had incurred monthly disbursements of $200 between May 2017 and January 2018. Accordingly, the Applicant’s claim for monthly disbursements of $200 (summing up to a total of $1,800 for nine months) must fail in its entirety.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">57 </span>To summarise, the Applicant is only entitled to a total of $4,000 in fees in respect of the entire duration for which it acted as stakeholder of the net sales proceeds of the Property. Further, in the absence of any evidence that disbursements of $200 were incurred on a monthly basis, that aspect of the Applicant’s claim must fail. I note that R2, R3 and R6 accept that none of the Applicant’s stakeholding bills have been paid to-date,

</div> and that R1, R4, R5 and R7 have not contended otherwise. This raises two issues. First, which of the Respondents are liable for the Applicant’s fees of $4,000? Secondly, how is the sum of $33,600 in alleged stakeholding fees that the Applicant is currently holding on to pursuant to para (a) of the 12 January Order to be dealt with (see [10] above)? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>On the first issue, given my conclusion that the SA (as varied by the VD) is a valid compromise agreement binding on its signatories (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, R1 to R6) (see [37] above), it follows that pursuant to cll 7 and 8 of the SA, the stakeholding fees payable to the Applicant should be deducted from the net sales proceeds of the Property before distribution of the balance sum to the Respondents. Thus, <span class="font-italic">in effect</span>, the liability of the stakeholding fees will be borne by the seven Respondents equally. This may seem unfair to R7, who was not a party to the SA (and the VD) and therefore did not agree to the payment of $4,000 in stakeholding fees out of the net sales proceeds prior to distribution. However, seeing as R7 also effectively reaps the benefit of the stakeholding services provided by the Applicant (the net sales proceeds forming part of his parents’ estates, to which he is entitled to succeed beneficially), it would only be fair, in the circumstances, that he be made to bear the liability of the stakeholding fees alongside the other Respondents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>Following from the above, on the second issue, the Applicant must repay $29,600 (being $33,600 less $4,000). This brings the total amount paid into court to $2,933,067.69 (being $2,903,467.69 plus $29,600). Then, until administrators are appointed to administer the Respondents’ parents’ estates, no sums shall be paid out to any of the Respondents. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>To conclude, my orders on the OS are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Prayer 1: I note that all parties had agreed that this prayer could be removed in the light of para (a) of the 12 January Order.

</div> While leave was granted for the Applicant to amend the OS, no amendment was actually filed and so prayer 1 as it originally stood is technically still before me. However, since prayer 1 has essentially been rendered moot (see [10] and [11] above), I make no order on this prayer. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Prayer 2: Given that letters of administration for the Respondents’ parents’ estates have not been granted, I make no order for distribution of the net sales proceeds, which form part of their parents’ estates, to the Respondents. However, as a matter of contract law, I hold that R1 to R6 are bound by their agreement in the SA (as varied by the VD) and that R1’s and R7’s respective entitlements to the net sales proceeds must be dealt in accordance with cll 8.2 to 8.5 therein (see [39] and [42]–[43] above). Again, I emphasise that this holding is not intended to displace the rules of distribution set out in the Intestate Succession Act, but merely governs the private contractual arrangement between the parties (see [38] and [43] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Prayer 3: This prayer was essentially also rendered moot by the 12 January Order, which allowed for the Applicant to deduct $33,600 representing its alleged stakeholding fees from the net sales proceeds, prior to paying the balance into court (see [10] and [11] above). However, para (b) of the 12 January Order expressly preserved the Respondents’ rights to dispute, claim and/or claw back any portion of these stakeholding fees (see [10] above). In the light of my finding that the Applicant is only entitled to a one-off payment of $4,000 in stakeholding fees, the Applicant is to repay $29,600 into court (see [57] and [59] above), within seven days of the present judgment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Prayer 4: I make no order on prayer 4 of the OS, for the reasons set out at [49] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>Parties are to file submissions on the appropriate costs orders to be made in relation to this application, limited to 10 pages, within 14 days of the present judgment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Dedar Singh Gill    <br/>Judicial Commissioner    </div><div class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"><br/>Carolyn Tan Beng Hui, Au Thye Chuen and Kelvin Leong (Tan &amp; Au LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Twang Kern Zern and Lam Jianhao Mark (Central Chambers Law Corporation) for the first, fourth and fifth respondents;<br/>Chooi Yue Wai Kenny, Fong Kai Tong Kelvin and Kong Tai Wai David (Yeo-Leong &amp; Peh LLC) for the second, third and sixth respondents; and<br/>the seventh respondent in person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
