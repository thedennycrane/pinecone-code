For this reason, making connections and building friendships are both important for success. This offers a perennial role to the socially adept.

They are especially needed by newly established businesses that do not have much of a record. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff is one such person: good at making friends.

That question is what I must answer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In addition, the defendant argues that if the plaintiff is right about how much was to be paid, part of his claim is premature, because some of the commission had not fallen due as of the date of the writ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiff, Seah Han, is a sole proprietor who provides public relations consultancy services in the media and information technology industries (“Mr Seah”).

The amount paid prior to commencement of these proceedings was only US$1,415,000, and so only US$141,500 would have been due as at the date of the writ. The claim for the balance would therefore be premature.

</div> The dispute concerned the amount of commission agreed. It is a stark dispute, and both counsel have in their submissions effectively contended that the other side was lying rather than being mistaken either in what they heard on the day or what they recalled later. I agree that there is really no room for the difference between them to be explained by faulty perceptions or faulty memory. My assessment of the evidence proceeds on the basis that only one of the two told the truth in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The burden is on Mr Seah to prove his claim of what was agreed at the 14 December 2018 meeting. I must determine which of Mr Seah’s and Mr Hoong’s versions to accept. Mr Seah gave evidence in person, while Mr Hoong gave evidence remotely. I have kept the mode of testifying in mind when assessing demeanour. In this case the quality of the remote video link for Mr Hoong’s testimony was generally good, and I was able to observe him well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Mr Seah gave evidence somewhat impetuously, occasionally rushing and tangling his words. He came across as truthful, and genuinely hurt and indignant by how he felt he had been treated by Mr Hoong. Mr Hoong appeared to think calmly and carefully before each answer, and did not always seem to be speaking from memory of what had happened but at times appeared to proffer a practised story. I tested what they said carefully against the evidence. I considered their respective versions in terms of how well they fit and explain all the circumstances and events in this case, including contemporaneous documents and conduct of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I have concluded that Mr Seah’s version of the meeting on 14 December 2018 is what happened. Commission was agreed at the higher rate of 10% and applied to the entirety of the contract value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I now explain my conclusion. One of the most significant reasons why I believe Mr Seah is that his version is supported by WhatsApp messages sent by him to Mr Hoong. The day after the meeting, he messaged someone known to both himself and Mr Hoong and told him that Mr Hoong was “giving [him] 10% commission from HBO contract”.

On an objective reading, it refers to the HBO contract, not just to the development item under the HBO contract. A reference to a contract includes all its components. If Mr Seah’s message was referring only to the development component, then that limitation would have been specified. This reading is only reinforced upon consideration of the purchase order.

</div> There is a single purchase order. It does not refer to two contracts but only two components of a single project. With that purchase order as the context, the reference to the HBO contract would be to the contract as a whole, and include both components. Subsequently, a single contract was entered into between HBO Asia and Onwards Media, namely a Master Service Agreement dated 15 May 2019.

</div> The fact that there was only one contract does not support Onwards Media’s case that commission was only payable on the development amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 This WhatsApp exchange is significant, because if the agreement two days previously had been for 3% only and only in respect of the development amount, Mr Seah’s WhatsApp message would not have been sent, or if sent would have provoked a protest from Mr Hoong. Mr Seah would not have written to Dennis Teo stating that Mr Hoong had agreed to 10% of the contract (without any limitation), or forwarded a screenshot of this to Mr Hoong. If it wrongly reflected their agreement, Mr Hoong would, upon receipt of Mr Seah’s screenshot, have immediately denied it, and put on record that the agreement was for 3% only, and only for the value of the first item of the contract. Mr Hoong could give no satisfactory explanation for not clarifying or contradicting what Mr Seah wrote. I was not at all convinced by his suggestion that he believed that Mr Seah was just “posturing”.

</div> I do not believe that that was what he thought at the time. Indeed, if Mr Hoong had thought that Mr Seah was posturing, he would have considered it all the more necessary to respond at once to put him straight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Moreover, Mr Hoong did not stay silent. He responded as a friend might, saying that they “help each other”. I interpret Mr Hoong’s statement that they “help each other” as meaning that just as Mr Seah had helped him by introducing and helping to secure the contract with HBO Asia, Mr Hoong was helping him in relation to the commission. This is what friends do. Unfortunately for Mr Seah, Mr Hoong’s actions did not match his words.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 My interpretation of this WhatsApp exchange fits with the flow of events. On 13 December 2018, the day before the two met in person, Mr Hoong assured Mr Seah in a WhatsApp message, “I need to pay you for the HBO contract”.

</div> It is wholly implausible that Mr Hoong would not have corrected him if it did not accord with their agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This conclusion is supported by my observations and inferences concerning their respective characters. Mr Hoong is a calm, careful and methodical person, and not someone who would leave uncorrected a point that would implicate the company of which he was chairman in an unwarranted liability. Mr Seah is more emotional and impulsive. Apart from my observations of their respective characters as they testified, this difference is also reflected in Mr Seah’s rushing to Mr Hoong’s office to get the amount agreed, and in his messaging about what they had agreed in an informal manner, extolling Mr Hoong’s goodness rather than dispassionately recording the amount payable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 This was not the only WhatsApp exchange.

</div> It would have been simple for Mr Hoong to type out a quick response to correct Mr Seah, and the fact that he did not do so confirms that he did not contest Mr Seah’s account of what transpired when they met in person on 14 December 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I have considered Onwards Media’s submission that the commission amount claimed by Mr Seah was too high to have been agreed given his limited role as an introducer. This submission rested on the fact that after the initial introduction there were some meetings between Onwards Media and HBO Asia, especially technical ones, that Mr Seah did not attend. In relation to a three-day workshop held by Onwards Media for HBO Asia that Mr Seah did attend, Onwards Media sought to convince me that his attendance was entirely voluntary and that he was a mere observer.

HBO Asia was of “international standing” and “high quality” whereas their existing clients were “not really established” and gave them “bad debts”.

</div>. I was not able to accept this evidence in the absence of contemporaneous documents. The calculations struck me as vague and self-serving.

</div> Mr Chau’s evidence therefore did not support either case on this point. I do not have to determine definitively whether Mr Seah misremembered that Mr Chau was present at the crucial moment or whether Mr Chau, by averring his absence at that point, took the path of least resistance to not contradicting Mr Hoong, but if I had to make a determination I would be inclined to the latter conclusion. I did note that Mr Chau was not always forthright during his testimony, and in particular I noted that he unfairly downplayed Mr Seah’s role in securing the HBO Asia contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It is clear to me on the totality of the evidence that 10% commission was agreed, applicable to the whole of the HBO Asia contract value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I end this section by observing that <span class="font-italic">Felthouse v Bindley</span> is not relevant. That case concerned the question whether a horse included in an auction lot had instead already been sold separately by the owner. The person who believed he had bought the horse sued the auctioneer. But the court found there had been no concluded contract of sale, for the simple reason that the putative buyer’s offer was not accepted. He had framed his offer presumptively, to the effect that unless he heard to the contrary from the putative seller, he would consider the horse bought at the price he had offered. It was held, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Willes J, that an offeror “had no right to impose … a sale … unless [the offeree] chose to comply with the condition of writing to repudiate the offer”. In short, the well-known sales tactic of the presumptive close does not work in law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 That has nothing whatsoever to do with the question in this case, which is what terms were orally agreed. In relation to that question, a written summary of the oral agreement sent from one of the makers of the agreement to the other shortly after it was made is persuasive evidence of what was orally agreed, even if the other does not respond.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Estoppel </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  Onwards Media also contends that their tender by cheque of what would have been the balance of the commission if it had been agreed at 3% of the development amount, and Mr Seah’s banking in of their cheque, raises an estoppel against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This defence is wholly without merit.

</div> This could not possibly be taken to mean the opposite, namely that he accepted Onwards Media’s position.

In this, they rely on the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Eshelby v Federated European Bank</span><span class="font-italic">, Ltd</span> that a cause of action must be established as at the date when proceedings are instituted. Mr Seah pleaded that it was a term of the agreement that Mr Hoong was to draft a payment schedule and that he was to be paid according to HBO Asia’s payment schedule.

</div> Thus, Onwards Media argues, only US$141,500 was due at the time of the writ, of which US$39,000 had been paid. Mr Seah’s claim, to the extent that it covers payments due after the issue of the writ, is said to be premature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Onwards Media’s argument overlooks two points. One is that, prior to the issue of the writ on 18 September 2019, Onwards Media had clearly and unequivocally renounced the agreement that I have found to exist, by their solicitors’ letter of 13 August 2019.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-93a212a9-1be5-45bd-b87a-bc5a4f8d35a8" data-toggle="modal" type="button">59</button></sup>

</div>
</div> They renounced it by asserting that the agreement was only for 3% commission on part of the HBO contract and denying the agreement for 10% commission on the HBO contract as a whole. The second point is that Mr Seah had already fully earned the commission. There was nothing left for him to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thus, even assuming that payment was to be made only in accordance with a schedule that extended beyond the date of the writ, there was an anticipatory repudiatory breach of the whole agreement that Mr Seah accepted by issuing his writ. He did not have to await the dates stipulated by the schedule before suing, because Mr Seah’s entitlement to the full payment accrued once he secured the HBO Asia contract for Onwards Media, agreed the commission and Onwards Media had made clear that they had no intention to pay. The cause of action in respect of the unpaid balance of the commission arose prior to the date of the writ and this action is not premature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The facts of this case are quite different from those in the case cited by Onwards Media’s counsel, <span class="font-italic">Eshelby v Federated European Bank</span><span class="font-italic">, Ltd</span>. In that case, a builder claimed against the guarantor certain instalments not paid by the owner who had contracted for the building work. It was held that a condition precedent to the guarantor’s liability, namely due execution of the works by the builder, had not been proved. An additional point was taken, and accepted though not necessary to the decision, namely that the claim having been commenced for the first instalment, a claim for the second instalment could not be added by amendment after issue of the writ because under the terms of the contract it did not fall due until after the issue of the writ and upon execution of further work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thus, that case concerned an instalment payment that was neither earned nor due as of the date of the writ. Here, the commission was fully earned by Mr Seah upon the HBO Asia contract being secured for Onwards Media. There was nothing further for him to do. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Moreover, the defence on this point assumes that the effect of the term concerning a payment schedule was to postpone when payments fell due, rather than giving Onwards Media time to pay what was already agreed to be due. I do not consider that that analysis fits what was discussed between Mr Seah and Mr Hoong. I find that it was just a matter of Mr Seah being happy to give Onwards Media time to pay his already earned commission. I interpret this as a simple forbearance to sue so long as the agreement was honoured. Mr Hoong never even provided a payment schedule. Once Onwards Media renounced the agreement, Mr Seah was free to sue for the entire sum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Mr Seah has claimed discretionary interest on the amount awarded to him under the judgment.

</div> Where a plaintiff has been kept out of money, the court should ordinarily exercise its discretion to award prejudgment interest. There is no reason for me not to do so, except that in my view interest should run from the date of the writ and not the date of the demand, as he has sought. I award him prejudgment interest at the rate of 5.33% on a simple basis from the date of the writ to the date of judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Mr Seah has succeeded in his claim.
