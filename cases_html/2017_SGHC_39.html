</div> The other three defendants did not comply with the Varied Disclosure Order. There is nothing in the letter from Wellstead to Lai SJ that suggests why it would have been dangerous to disclose the information contained within it to the plaintiff. What the letter did disclose was that between 29 December 2015 and 5 January 2016, US$191,800 was transferred to Wellstead and £579,420 was transferred to another company called Wellstead Primary Solutions allegedly “in accordance with the existing contracts and agreements (the detailed evidence and explanation of which will be provided in the Affidavits that the Defendants will supply by 13th June)”. I noted that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the transfers started on 29 December 2015 which was the same day that Wellstead told the plaintiff that his token would be deactivated for technical and security reasons (see [10] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the transfers were completed on 5 January 2016, a day before Kashmir informed the plaintiff, on behalf of Nazrad, that the Declaration of Trust was void and the POA was revoked (see [11] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Two affidavits were filed on 13 June 2016 – one by Kashmir (on behalf of Wellstead, as its director, and himself) and the other by one John Tan Kee Eng (as Chief Legal Officer of Wellstead). Both affidavits made numerous allegations of money laundering and various criminal activities against the plaintiff. However, one omission stood out starkly: neither affidavit explained why the Funds were transferred to Wellstead and Wellstead Primary Solutions or who authorised or carried out the transfers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The plaintiff made a further application seeking, among other things, an order that each of the defendants file and serve an affidavit stating whether the Funds remained in the Bank Account and, if not, what had become of them.

</div> According to Kashmir, Wellstead was fully owned by a UK company, Wellstead Business Consultancy Limited (“Wellstead (UK)”) and he was merely a nominee director of Wellstead and a conduit through which instructions from Wellstead (UK) would be passed on. He explained that he had no actual control over the business activities of Wellstead or information regarding the assets of either Wellstead or ECTL because the companies were controlled by a representative of Wellstead (UK).

I heard SUM 3828/2016 on 30 August 2016. I was not prepared to make any orders against Wellstead and Kashmir since they were neither shareholders nor directors of ECTL and therefore had no authority to obtain information relating to ECTL’s bank accounts. As for Nazrad and ECTL, I was informed by their counsel that Nazrad had been removed as a director of ECTL. However, I agreed with the plaintiff that as Nazrad was still the sole shareholder of ECTL, she could take the necessary steps to enable herself to obtain the statements of the Bank Account. Therefore, I ordered Nazrad and ECTL to comply with the orders made by Lai SJ and Ang SJ by 20 September 2016 failing which their defences in the suit were to be struck out (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Unless Order).     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Nazrad filed three affidavits on 7 September 2016 and a fourth affidavit on 21 September 2016 in purported compliance of the Unless Order.

</div> In addition, she submitted that an order for her to transfer the ECTL shares to the plaintiff was unnecessary as she was already prepared to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I was not persuaded by Nazrad’s submissions. It is well established that in the case of property rights, such as the interests of a beneficiary under a trust, a defendant cannot rely on illegality to defeat a plaintiff’s claim based on his legal or equitable title as long as the plaintiff’s title can be asserted without reliance on the illegality (see <span class="font-italic">Chee Jok Heng Stephanie v Chang Yue Shoon</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1131 at [41] and [42] applying <span class="font-italic">Tinsley v Milligan</span> [1994] 1 AC 340). In the present case, the plaintiff’s claim was based on his equitable title to the shares in ECTL which he obtained under the Declaration of Trust and was not in any way dependent on any alleged illegality. It was not disputed that the Declaration of Trust itself was genuine. Nazrad also did not explain how the allegation that her signature had been falsified on ECTL’s contracts and invoices had any bearing on the plaintiff’s undisputed equitable interest in ECTL’s shares. I concluded that there was no reason for me to deny the plaintiff’s application under O 27 r 3 of the Rules of Court given the clear admissions of fact by Nazrad. The argument that she should be allowed to retain the ECTL shares in breach of trust because of the plaintiff’s alleged illegal acts was a <span class="font-italic">non sequitur</span>. I should add for completeness that the Nazrad did not produce credible evidence to substantiate her allegations of illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I also rejected Nazrad’s argument that it was unnecessary to make an order requiring her to transfer the ECTL shares to the plaintiff because she was already prepared to do so. Her offer to transfer the shares to the plaintiff was made in the 26 September Letter but it was subject to the plaintiff waiving her compliance with the Unless Order. This was a condition which the plaintiff was not willing to accept. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Accordingly, I granted the plaintiff’s application against Nazrad under O 27 r 3 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">SUM 5088/2016: Application for judgment against Nazrad and ECTL for failure to comply with the Unless Order  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For the plaintiff to prevail on SUM 5088/2016, I had to be satisfied that (a) Nazrad and ECTL had failed to comply with the Unless Order, and (b) their failure to do so was intentional and contumelious (<span class="font-italic">Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff and another v Arjan Bhisham Chotrani</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 361 at [12]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It was undisputed that there were no affidavits filed on behalf of ECTL to comply with the Unless Order. As for Nazrad, the affidavits that she filed contained some bank statements of the Bank Account.

It appeared from the telegraphic transfer slips that almost all of the US$191,800 was transferred to Wellstead Primary Solutions very soon after being transferred to Wellstead.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The bank statements that Nazrad provided covered only the period from December 2015 to April 2016 and did not include the statements for the months of May, June, July and August 2016 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the months following the worldwide <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunction granted by Lai SJ).

Her case was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From the start, she had merely been a nominee director and was a nominee shareholder of ECTL.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I rejected Nazrad’s explanations. First, the fact that she was a nominee director and shareholder was no excuse. She had agreed to take on these roles and there was no reason why she could not exercise the powers of a director and shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, the Disclosure Order was made on 30 May 2016 and the Varied Disclosure Order was made on 1 June 2016. I heard SUM 5088/2016 on 16 November 2016. Nazrad had more than five months to comply with the order, during which time she and ECTL were given multiple extensions of time. In Nazrad’s intended affidavit, she referred to a meeting with, among others, her solicitor and Katrina on 9 September 2016 during which the possibility of her re-appointment as a director of ECTL was discussed.

</div>
</div>
</div> As it turned out, Nazrad was not re-appointed as a director of ECTL. However, apart from that meeting, there was no evidence that Nazrad had taken any real steps to adequately comply with the court’s orders. In fact, it is not even clear whether Nazrad had requested the meeting on 9 September 2016 or whether she had asked to be re-appointed. Further, although she ceased to be a director at some point in time (it was not clear from the evidence when exactly this happened), she was still<span class="font-italic"> the sole shareholder of ECTL throughout this period</span>. As the plaintiff pointed out, Nazrad merely asserted that she <span class="font-italic">believed </span>that any efforts by her to instruct ECTL’s company secretary to comply with the Unless Order or reinstate her as a director will be stymied. She had not <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>given (or even tried to give) any such instructions to ECTL’s company secretary. In any case, even if it was true that ECTL’s company secretary would not cooperate with Nazrad, she was still empowered as ECTL’s sole shareholder to replace the company secretary and then reinstate herself as a director. She simply chose to do nothing. Nazrad’s nonchalant attitude towards compliance with an order of court cannot be condoned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, it was curious that Nazrad was able to provide some but not all of the relevant bank and documentary statements relating to the Funds. She also stated that these were all the documents that she was able to retrieve from Wellstead.

</div> Nazrad did not explain how she was able to get documents from Wellstead but not from ECTL when she was the sole director (at least until she was removed) and sole shareholder of the latter.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Finally, the arguments based on Nazrad’s impecuniosity were also suspect. In the 26 September Letter to the plaintiff’s solicitors, the position she took was that, because she was not a director of ECTL, it was “not possible for her to obtain any bank statements <span class="font-italic">or to provide them on time, as there is a long application process by the bank in order</span><span class="font-italic"> to extract the same</span>”.
