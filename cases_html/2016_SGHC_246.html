</div> The letter of intent is a brief three-page letter from Newcon to CAA. It is brief because the letter of intent itself enabled the parties to replace its terms with a comprehensive contract setting out their obligations in greater detail in terms to be agreed between the parties. The letter of intent refers to this comprehensive contract as the “letter of acceptance”. Despite this, however, it is common ground that the letter of intent has contractual force in and of itself. It is common ground, in other words, that the letter of intent is not a mere (and unenforceable) agreement to agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The letter of intent begins by informing CAA that Newcon has awarded to CAA the contract to design, produce and deliver slabs for the project as well as to provide ancillary services such as quality assurance and quality control.

</div> It then sets out the breakdown of the total contract value of just over $1.6m. The breakdown is in tabular form, and lists the dimensions of the four thicknesses of the slabs which CAA was to supply, the provisional quantity required of each type, the rate to be applied to each type and the total value of each type. The table also describes certain ancillary supplies and ancillary services and sets out their value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On the second page of the letter of intent, immediately after the table, are the terms and conditions.

CAA asserted that it had received Newcon’s notice of delay only on Monday, 25 March 2013 because it had been sent at 6.16 pm on Saturday, 23 March 2013, while CAA’s office was closed. Second, CAA denied responsibility for the delay on site. CAA reiterated its position that the root cause of the delay was Newcon’s own failure to cast the columns and beams in time in order to be ready to receive and install CAA’s slabs. Finally, CAA informed Newcon that it would stop casting and delivering slabs as a result of Newcon’s purported termination of the parties’ contract.

It is therefore Newcon’s counterclaim which defines all of the issues I have to resolve in order to determine both the claim and the counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Newcon’s counterclaim in this action raises four issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the letter of acceptance formed part of the parties’ contract;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) What were CAA’s contractual obligations, whether express or implied, to produce and deliver slabs; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether CAA breached those contractual obligations; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If so, whether that breach entitled Newcon to terminate the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On these issues, I have held that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The letter of acceptance did not form part of the parties’ contract because CAA did not accept the offer comprised in it, either expressly or by its conduct;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) CAA had an express obligation to follow Newcon’s progress on site in producing and delivering slabs, and to do so in accordance with a delivery schedule which the letter of intent envisaged would be provided, supplemented and revised from time to time. CAA also had an implied obligation to proceed with producing and delivering slabs with due diligence and expedition at all times until completion. In respect of this latter obligation, time was of the essence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) CAA breached both the express and implied terms of the parties’ contract; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) CAA’s breach of contract constituted a repudiatory breach of contract and entitled Newcon to terminate the parties’ contract either pursuant to the common law right to terminate for repudiatory breach or under the implied term making time of the essence in relation to the implied term of due diligence and expedition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I now set out my reasons for my holding on each of these issues. I begin by making some general observations on the credibility of each party’s witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CAA’s witnesses lacked credibility generally </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I had the opportunity of observing both parties’ witnesses under cross-examination across five days of trial. I also reviewed the witnesses’ affidavits of evidence in chief and assessed each witness’s evidence for consistency with the contemporaneous documentary evidence and the inherent probabilities, taking into account that witness’s cross-examination and re-examination at trial and the evidence of the other witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As a result of that review, I find that the account of the facts provided by Newcon’s witnesses is, on the whole, the more coherent and believable. Their evidence was substantially corroborated by the documentary evidence. In contrast, CAA’s witnesses proposed a version of events which frequently raised more questions than it supplied answers. I give examples at [71] – [77] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In particular, I find Dr Chi to be an unreliable witness in virtually every material respect of his evidence on CAA’s case. Under cross-examination, Dr Chi displayed a marked tendency evade difficult questions by providing irrelevant responses. He also prevaricated in his account of events and had a tendency to make bare assertions which were either inconsistent with or contradicted by the contemporaneous documentary evidence and the inherent probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I accept that the evidence of Newcon’s witnesses was also not without its difficulties. But those difficulties related principally to immaterial facts and, even when they did not, were minor in nature compared to the discrepancies in CAA’s witnesses’ evidence. In addition, I do not consider that these difficulties reflected on the general credibility of Newcon’s witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On all disputes of material fact, therefore, I prefer the evidence of Newcon’s witnesses over that of CAA’s witnesses. In my view, both of CAA’s witnesses were more concerned with ensuring that their evidence maximised CAA’s chances of succeeding in this action than with ensuring that their evidence accorded with the truth.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Status of the letter of acceptance</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Newcon’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As I have mentioned, it is common ground that CAA did not sign the acknowledgment attached to the letter of acceptance (see [19] above). Newcon’s case is that the parties’ contract nevertheless comprises both the letter of intent and the letter of acceptance, read together. It advances this case in order to have a legal basis to rely on the express obligations set out in the later of acceptance as to production and delivery (see [21] above), termination for breach (see [22] above) and liquidated damages (see [23] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Newcon’s argument that the letter of acceptance binds CAA rests on two limbs.

Further, their assertions are inconsistent with whatever contemporaneous documentary evidence is available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 If Mr Chen had indeed expressly rejected the letter of acceptance on the first of the three occasions (see [66] above), it appears to me illogical that Newcon’s next communication with him on 18 February 2013 on the same issue would have been simply another routine reminder to sign and return the letter of acceptance (see [62] above). Further, if CAA indeed considered that the letter of acceptance formed no part of its contract with Newcon, it is equally illogical that CAA would have accepted without objection, as it did, Newcon’s express reliance on provisions found only in the letter of acceptance as the legal basis for its notice of delay (see [37] above), its notice of termination (see [39] above) and its letters before action (see [46] and [47] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Second, I reject Dr Chi’s evidence that he expressly informed Newcon at the meeting on 19 March 2013 (see [68] above) that he rejected the letter of acceptance. It is common ground that a meeting did take place on 19 March 2013. But cross-examination showed Dr Chi’s evidence about this meeting to be contradictory. Dr Chi initially claimed that one of the items which the parties discussed at the meeting on 19 March 2013 was Newcon’s proposed delivery schedule (see [33] above). But Newcon did not furnish that proposed delivery schedule to CAA until 21 March 2013, as an attachment to Newcon’s email of that day (see [32] above). Counsel for Newcon put it to Dr Chi specifically that he might be confusing the meeting on 19 March 2013 with the meeting on 22 March 2013 (see [34] and [35] above). Dr Chi was adamant that he was not. Counsel for Newcon then revealed to Dr Chi that the proposed delivery schedule was not available on 19 March 2013. Dr Chi then changed his position diametrically and claimed that he had indeed confused the two meetings.

That was also the reason it did not respond to Newcon’s email requests that it sign and return the acknowledgment page.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 That finding of fact, however, does not suffice to determine the first issue in favour of Newcon. It remains for me to consider whether CAA’s inertia in the face of the letter of acceptance is capable as a matter of law of constituting acceptance of Newcon’s offer set out in that letter. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CAA did not accept the letter of acceptance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The central difficulty with Newcon’s case on the letter of acceptance is that CAA’s response to it was silence. The well-established contractual rule is that silence in response to an offer does not constitute acceptance of that offer because it is equivocal: <span class="font-italic">Felthouse</span><span class="font-italic"> v Bindley </span>(1862) 142 ER 1037; <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Selectmove Ltd </span>[1995] 1 WLR 474.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 To overcome this difficulty on the law, Newcon relies on <span class="font-italic">Midlink</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Midlink</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Midlink</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>V K Rajah JC (as he then was) accepted that silence is ordinarily equivocal and therefore incapable of constituting acceptance. He observed, however, that it is rare for an offeree to respond to an offer with <span class="font-italic">complete</span> silence, at least in the context of a typical bilateral commercial contract. It is therefore a question of fact in every such case whether the offeree’s response was complete silence and, even if so, whether the effect of the silence, objectively ascertained against the factual background, supports the existence of a contract. I accept this proposition to be correct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Newcon submits that CAA is bound by the letter of acceptance because its response to it was not complete silence. CAA in fact acted on the letter of acceptance by adopting the casting sequence set out in cl 7.10 (see [21] above). That conduct prevents CAA’s failure to accept the letter of acceptance expressly from being characterised as equivocal.

Both letters covered the same scope of work. The parties’ common position is that: (i) CAA accepted Newcon’s offer set out in the letter of intent; and (ii) that acceptance gave rise to a contract.

To put it another way, everything which CAA did after receiving the letter of acceptance, when examined objectively, is equivocal: it is as capable of being referable to its intent to perform its existing obligations under the letter of intent as it is capable of being referable to an intent to accept Newcon’s offer set out in the letter of acceptance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Newcon submits that CAA acted on the casting sequence set out in cl 7.10 of the letter of acceptance (see [21] above) and, in that way, manifested an intent, objectively ascertained, to accept the letter of acceptance. I cannot accept that submission for two reasons. First, even if CAA did act on information supplied in one clause of the letter of acceptance, that is not an unequivocal indication of its objective intent to accept as contractually binding every clause of the letter of acceptance. It is equally consistent with a simple desire to perform its obligations under the letter of intent in the light of new information which Newcon had supplied to it. Second, I cannot accept Newcon’s submission that Mr Chen agreed with Mr Lin to adopt this casting sequence during the first casting on 26 February 2013 (see [63] above). But it is Newcon’s own case that there was no such agreement and that CAA’s evidence of this agreement is an afterthought.

</div> Newcon cannot be permitted to rely on Mr Chen’s evidence to support one aspect of its case and then reject the same evidence on another. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I have already accepted that, if CAA’s case that it expressly rejected the letter of acceptance were true, one would have expected CAA to have objected to Newcon’s reliance on the terms of the letter of acceptance in its notice of delay, notice of termination and letters before action (see [71] above). Newcon relies on this failure as further evidence of the objective significance of CAA’s silence in response to the letter of acceptance. But in my view, this failure is simply another consequence of CAA’s inertia. I cannot find that this failure is sufficient to convert CAA’s equivocal silence – which is what I have found it thus far to be – into unequivocal acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In the circumstances, I cannot find that anything which CAA did in the face of the letter of acceptance was sufficiently unequivocal to constitute an intention, objectively ascertained, to accept its terms. I accordingly hold that it is only the letter of intent – and not the letter of acceptance – which governs the parties’ contractual relationship. The consequence of this holding is that the express provisions as to the time and sequence of delivery, as to termination and as to liquidated damages in the letter of acceptance do not form part of the parties’ contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Newcon’s counterclaim therefore stands or falls upon only the express and implied terms of the letter of intent.

First, CAA had to perform all of its design, production and delivery obligations within the 15-month main contract period. Second, and more importantly, CAA was obliged to produce and deliver slabs in order to follow Newcon’s progress on site. Third, while following Newcon’s progress on site, CAA was obliged to adjust performance of its production and delivery obligations to accommodate any revisions to the construction schedule which were relevant to CAA’s scope of work. The letter of intent, by its express terms, thereby obliged CAA to meet a delivery schedule which the letter of intent envisaged would be provided, supplemented and revised from time to time, as Newcon performed its own obligations under the main contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The first time Newcon provided a delivery schedule to CAA was in cl 7.10 of the letter of acceptance. There is no doubt, for the reasons I have found, that the letter of acceptance does not have contractual effect. But that does not mean that the letter of acceptance is a total nullity as far as the parties’ contract is concerned. CAA does not deny that it was aware of the <span class="font-italic">content</span> of this delivery schedule in cl 7.10. This schedule served to convey to CAA, at the very least, the timeline for the first deliveries scheduled for February 2013. It therefore had contractual effect, not as a term of the letter of acceptance, but as a delivery schedule brought to CAA’s attention post-contractually, precisely as the letter of intent envisaged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Newcon revised the delivery schedule on 1 March 2013 (see [27] above) by specifying new dates for CAA to deliver slabs for the second storey structural works. That revision thereafter governed CAA’s contractual obligation under the letter of intent to deliver those slabs. According to the revised schedule, CAA was to deliver slabs for area 2a, as marked in the building plan attached to the schedule, by 8 March 2013 (see [27] and [28] above). The effect was to stipulate 8 March 2013 as the <span class="font-italic">last</span> permitted date for CAA to effect delivery of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the slabs required for work to commence and conclude at area 2a.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I therefore find that CAA had an express obligation to follow Newcon’s progress on site in producing and delivering slabs, and to do so in accordance with a delivery schedule which the letter of intent envisaged would be provided, supplemented and revised from time to time.  In case I am wrong in this finding, I turn now to consider the implied terms of the letter of intent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implied terms</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Newcon submits that the letter of intent contains two implied terms. The first is that time is of the essence. The second is that CAA must proceed with its works with due diligence and expedition at all times until completion.

Its case is that cl 2 of the letter of intent “clearly provides for a schedule that [CAA] has to follow (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the site progress)”. Neither term can therefore be implied in fact because the intention of the parties as to CAA’s obligation to produce and delivery slabs is clear from cl 2. And neither term can be implied in law because each runs contrary to the express words of cl 2. This was the very limited extent of CAA’s entire submission on implied terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I begin with the law on implied terms. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Terms implied in fact</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Giap Hon</span>, the Court of Appeal discussed (at [34] to [40]) the principles on which terms will be implied in fact into a contract, as set out in the cases of <span class="font-italic">Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 and <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769. These principles are now well-established, even if their application is not always without difficulty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In determining whether a contract contains an implied term in fact, the court is concerned only with analysing the specific facts of the specific case before it. That analysis will seek to identify and advance the intention of the actual contracting parties, ascertained objectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The courts have traditionally used two tests to determine whether a contract contains a term implied in fact. The first is the business efficacy test put forward by Bowen LJ in <span class="font-italic">The Moorcock </span>(1889) 14 PD 64. The second is the officious bystander test most famously put forward by MacKinnon LJ in <span class="font-italic">Shirlaw</span><span class="font-italic"> v Southern Foundries (1926) Limited </span>[1939] 2 KB 206 at 227.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Under the business efficacy test, the touchstone is necessity. A term is an implied term of a contract under this test only if implying that term is necessary to give the contract business efficacy. In the words of Bowen LJ in <span class="font-italic">The Moorcock</span> (at [29]), “what the law desires to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are [businessmen]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Under the officious bystander test, the touchstone is obviousness. That test, as framed by MacKinnon LJ, is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span> that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common ‘Oh, of course!’</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The business efficacy test and the officious bystander test are complementary: <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”) at [90]. Thus, the business efficacy test identifies a gap in a contract and the officious bystander test fills the gap with a term reflecting the parties’ presumed intention: <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [91]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> outlines (at [101]) a three-step process for ascertaining whether a contract contains a particular implied term in fact:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Terms implied in law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 On the principles governing implied terms in law, Newcon cites the synthesis in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Cheng </span>(at [68] and [69]). The principles can be stated briefly. Implying a term in law lays down that term as a default provision in all contracts of a definable class, subject of course to contrary agreement. When implying a term in law, the court is concerned with considerations of fairness and policy in a defined class of contracts rather than with ascertaining objectively and advancing the intentions of the parties in the specific contract under consideration. A court should ordinarily exercise considerable restraint in holding a particular term to be one implied in law, given that that term will then be an implied term of all contracts of that class. All terms which are implied in law must be reasonable, but a term will not be implied in law simply because it is reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Newcon argues that the parties’ contract contains terms implied in law: (i) making time of the essence; and (ii) obliging CAA to proceed with its works with due diligence and expedition at all times until completion.

</div>
</div> the view to this effect expressed fairly firmly in <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 1994) (“<span class="font-italic">Hudson (11th Ed)</span>”) at §9-034.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In this passage, which the Court of Appeal cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering </span>(at [51]), <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> expressed the view that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [E]ven in the absence of an express term for due diligence and of any linked termination clause, both such terms <span class="font-italic">require to be implied by law</span>, in construction contracts and subcontracts generally, as a matter of business efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I do not think that this passage supports Newcon’s case on implied terms in law for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 First, <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> is not in this passage suggesting that there is an implied term in law in every construction contract requiring a contractor to proceed with due diligence and expedition, for breach of which the contract may be terminated. Although this passage uses the phrase “implied by law”, it relies on the business efficacy test to justify that implication. But the business efficacy test is the hallmark of a term implied in fact, not of a term implied in law. It appears to me, therefore, that this passage in <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> is in fact considering implied terms in fact, not in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Second, <span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering’s</span> approval of this passage in <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> was <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. As the Court of Appeal noted (at [52]), the contract in <span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span> contained a clause expressly entitling the main contractor to terminate the contract if the sub-contractor failed to proceed with due diligence. <span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span> is therefore no authority that there is a term implied in law in all construction contracts obliging the contractor to proceed with due diligence and entitling the counterparty to terminate the contract for breach of that implied term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Third, <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> no longer holds the view expressed so firmly in the passage on which Newcon relies. The 13th edition of <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span>, published in 2015 (“<span class="font-italic">Hudson (13th Ed)</span>”), now says at §6-021 simply that a term to proceed with due diligence and expedition may <span class="font-italic">in some cases</span> be an implied term of a construction contract:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[6-021] … [E]ven in the absence of an express term for due diligence and of any linked express termination clause, both such terms <span class="font-italic">may in some cases be implied by law</span>, in construction contracts as a matter of business efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The reformulation of this passage makes it even clearer that what <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> is considering is whether an obligation to proceed with due diligence may be  implied in fact in a particular construction contract, not in law in all construction contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Although I was initially attracted to Newcon’s arguments on implied terms in law, I consider them to be contrary to the weight of authority. In any event, it is unnecessary for my decision to come to a conclusion on whether the terms contended for by Newcon are implied in law in all contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I therefore confine the discussion which follows to implied terms in fact.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implied terms in fact and construction contracts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The prime difficulty with concluding that a construction contract contains the implied terms contended for by Newcon is that the usual construction contract will typically contain express clauses which militate against those implied terms. These express clauses are of three types: (i) a liquidated damages clauses; (ii) extension of time clauses; and (iii) termination clauses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The existence of these typical clauses, and the detail in which they are usually spelled out in the usual construction contract, will ordinarily suggest (to paraphrase <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [109] above)) that the parties have not left a gap in their contract which they have failed to contemplate, whether as to the contractor’s obligations to produce and deliver, as to the consequences of the contractor’s breach of those obligations or as to the counterparty’s remedies, including the right to terminate the contract, for the contractor’s breach of those obligations. That is the field covered by the two implied terms contended for by Newcon. It is therefore difficult for a party arguing in favour of these implied terms in the usual construction contract to satisfy even the first step of the three-step test in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Nevertheless, the leading textbooks and authorities which I shall now analyse make clear that there is no absolute rule which excludes either of these implied terms in a particular construction contract. Whether either term is to be implied in fact into a given contract is a question to be decided on the particular facts of each case, applying the usual contractual principles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Hudson and Keating</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction Contracts </span>(S Furst &amp; V Ramsey eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Keating</span>”) takes the view (at §8-004) that a term requiring a contractor to proceed with due diligence and expedition will not ordinarily be an implied term of a construction contract, but may be in some cases:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It has been suggested that, where there is no express provision as to progress, business efficacy requires the implication of a term that the contractor will proceed with reasonable diligence and maintain reasonable progress. <span class="font-italic">It is thought that while such a term may have to be implied in some cases each contract and its surrounding circumstances must be considered, and that there is no such rule of general application.</span> It may well be that in some cases the contractor’s only duty is to complete by the due date. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As for the consequences of a breach of that implied term, <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> takes the view (at §8-008) that it is the normal rule that time is not of the essence in a construction contract:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is possible by express provision in the contract to make time of the essence even if it would not be so otherwise. … In general, time is of the essence in mercantile contracts, although it cannot be so if a date is neither specified nor capable of exact determination by the parties. Construction contracts are not mercantile contracts and <span class="font-italic">the normal rule is that time is not of the essence in construction contracts, unless it is expressly so provided</span>. It seems that <span class="font-italic">ordinarily it is not of the essence where the contract includes provisions for extension of time and the payment of liquidated damages for delay.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 While both passages indicate that it will be unusual to find that either of the two terms which Newcon contends for are implied terms of the typical construction contract, neither passage excludes such a finding in an appropriate case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As I have pointed out (see [115] above), <span class="font-italic">Hudson (1</span><span class="font-italic">3th Ed) </span>now agrees with <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> that a term to proceed with due diligence and expedition may <span class="font-italic">in some cases</span> be an implied term of a construction contract. The difference between <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> and <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> on this particular term is now one of emphasis rather than substance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The English courts have considered the status of an implied term obliging a contractor to proceed with due diligence and expedition in a number of decisions. I consider only two: (i) <span class="font-italic">G</span><span class="font-italic">reater London Council v Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company Ltd </span>(1984) 34 BLR 50 (“<span class="font-italic">Cleveland Bridge</span>”); and (ii) <span class="font-italic">Leander Construction Limited v </span><span class="font-italic">Mulalley and Company Limited</span> [2011] EWHC 3449 (TCC) (“<span class="font-italic">Leander</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cleveland Bridge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In <span class="font-italic">Cleveland Bridge</span>, a contract between an owner and a contractor permitted the owner to terminate the contract if the contractor failed to execute its works with due diligence and expedition. The contract also contained a price-escalation clause which entitled the contractor to enhanced rates if certain price-rises during the contract period triggered its operation and if the contractor was not in breach. The contractor met each milestone date set out in the contract but the price-escalation clause was nevertheless triggered. The contractor claimed the enhanced rates. The owner alleged that the contractor was not entitled to do so because it had failed to complete its works before the contractual milestones so as to avoid triggering the price-escalation clause, and had thereby breached an obligation to execute its works with due diligence and expedition. In the ensuing arbitration, the parties placed before the arbitrator for a preliminary ruling the following question of law: did the contractor have any obligation under the contract to complete its works with due diligence and expedition? The arbitrator held against the owner. The owner appealed to the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Staughton J (as he then was) heard the appeal. He held that the contract contained no such express obligation. The termination clause did not, in terms, impose a positive obligation on the contractor to execute its works with due diligence and expedition; it merely made termination available to the owner as a remedy if the contractor failed to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Staughton J then considered whether there was an implied term to that effect. He noted the difference of opinion which there then was between <span class="font-italic">Hudson </span>and <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> and agreed with <span class="font-italic">Keating</span>, holding that there was no such implied term. His view (at 66) was that there was “a general principle applicable to building and engineering contracts that in the absence of any indication to the contrary, a contractor is entitled to plan and perform the work as he pleases, provided always that he finishes it by the time fixed in the contract”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Staughton J proceeded as follows (at 67):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One’s first impression … is that the contract does, as a matter of construction or by implication, provide that the contractors shall carry out the contract works with due diligence and expedition. But on further consideration, I do not think that that is the right conclusion. The point is very nicely balanced … . I see no sufficient reason to disagree with the answers that [the arbitrator] gave. Accordingly, I conclude that <span class="font-italic">although neglect by the contractors to execute the works with due diligence and expedition would entitle the employers to discharge them </span><span class="font-italic">… it would not by itself be a breach of contract on the part of the contractors</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If I had not reached that conclusion, I would have held, without hesitation, that due diligence and expedition must be interpreted in the light of the other obligations as to time in the contract. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">If there had been a term as to due diligence, I consider that it would have been, when spelt out in full, an obligation on the contractors to execute the works with such diligence and expedition as were reasonably required in order to meet the key dates and completion date in the contract</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The Court of Appeal dismissed the owner’s further appeal. Parker LJ held that it was not an implied term of the contract that the contractor proceed with due diligence and expedition so as to complete its work earlier than the contractual milestones in order to avoid triggering the price-escalation clause. Such a term, he held, failed both the business efficacy test and the officious bystander test (at 77 to 78):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is submitted that if there is no express term such as is contended for by the appellants, there must have been an implied term to that effect. I can for myself see no possible basis upon which it could be said that any such implied term as is contended for is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract on the <span class="font-italic">Moorcock </span>principle, or how any innocent bystander test, if one approaches it in that way, could result in an affirmative answer to the question, “What is to happen if there is more time taken than is strictly necessary if one were proceeding with maximum speed?” Nobody could say that the answer that the innocent bystander would give would be, “He must proceed at such pace as will ensure that the price indices do not rise”. That is an impossible conception. There is no other basis on which I can for myself see that any implied term such as is contended for could be introduced into this contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 <span class="font-italic">Cleveland Bridge</span> has been taken as authority for the proposition that there is no scope for an implied term in a construction contract obliging a contractor to proceed with due diligence and expedition. But that is not the <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> of the case. The facts of <span class="font-italic">Cleveland Bridge</span> were unusual. The contractor performed and completed its works so as to meet every contractual milestone. The owner’s case was, in effect, that the contractor had an obligation to complete its works earlier than those milestones in order to maximise the owner’s financial benefit. Parker LJ (at 77) correctly appreciated that such an implied term was unworkable:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is contended, however, that if a manufacturer who has four years in which to complete a piece of equipment which could take as little as ten months to complete begins to do the job at the beginning of the period, he is obliged, nevertheless, still to complete within the period in which it could have been completed. I ask myself why, and indeed Mr Lloyd was asked why. <span class="font-italic">He conceded that, in taking a longer period, the contractor would not be in any way in breach of his operational obligations, but it was said that he would be in breach of some financial obligation</span>. Then one looks to see what this financial obligation could be. If it was said it was the obligation so to programme his work as to ensure that [the price-escalation clause] provided the least benefit to himself and the maximum benefit to the employer, he would be quite unable to know at any one time … whether it would suit the employer better for him to start late, or whether it would suit the employer better for him to start early, or whether it would suit the employer that he should take a long period or a short period. The suggestion is in my view unworkable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Parker LJ also observed in <span class="font-italic">Cleveland Bridge </span>(at 77) that diligence as a concept does not operate in a vacuum: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The contention which is put forward is that while the contractor is entitled to choose the period at which he will manufacture, once he has started manufacture he must, as Mr Lloyd put it, “get on with it”. I am not wholly surprised that it was put in colloquial terms, because it is very difficult to see how any specified obligation could be spelt out. What is said in the notice of motion is that there should be an obligation to proceed “with due diligence and expedition”, but <span class="font-italic">what is due diligence and expedition depends</span><span class="font-italic">, of course, on the object which is sought to be achieved</span>. If one is obliged to achieve a certain object within twelve weeks, it may be necessary to exercise much more speed than if your only obligation is to produce it in twenty-four weeks or indeed in four years. The same applies to diligence. <span class="font-italic">You cannot have diligence in the abstract.

I also agree with Parker LJ’s observation (cited immediately above) that the content of an implied term to proceed with due diligence and expedition must be assessed in light of the contractor’s obligations as to time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Leander</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The next case I consider is the fairly recent case of <span class="font-italic">Leander Construction Limited v </span><span class="font-italic">Mulalley and Company Limited </span>[2011] EWHC 3449 (TCC) (“<span class="font-italic">Leander</span>”). The main contractor in that case argued that its sub-contractor owed it an implied obligation to proceed regularly and diligently with the sub-contract works. The main contractor argued, further, that the sub-contractor’s compliance with that implied term should be measured against the dates and periods set out in a sub-contract document which did not have contractual effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Coulson J considered <span class="font-italic">Cl</span><span class="font-italic">eveland Bridge</span>, amongst other cases, and held that the comprehensive treatment of time in most construction contracts, and indeed in the contract before him, meant that an implied term to proceed with due diligence and expedition would fail the test of necessity:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39. In short, therefore, all the authorities point the same way: <span class="font-italic">the courts have been very reluctant to imply additional terms as to the timing or regularity of the contractor’s performance prior to the contract completion date</span>. In the case most in point, namely <span class="font-italic">GLC v Cleveland Bridge</span>, both Staughton J and the Court of Appeal refused to imply an obligation to proceed regularly and diligently, notwithstanding the express words of the termination clause. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40. In my judgment, [the main contractor] has failed in the “ambitious undertaking” of demonstrating the need for the alleged implied term as a matter of business efficacy. I have reached that view partly for general reasons (Section 5.2 below); partly as a result of the construction of the sub-contract itself (Section 5.3 below); and partly because of my rejection of [the main contractor’s] specific submissions as to the inferences to be drawn in this case (Section 5.4 below).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41. The cases set out … above demonstrate that the courts are generally slow to imply terms into a contract, particularly where, as here, there are already detailed terms and conditions. The touchstone remains the test of necessity, as Lord Clarke emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Mediterranean Salvage and Towage</span>: is the proposed implied term necessary to make the contract work? Or to put the question another way: in the absence of the implied term, does the contract fail to deliver the bargain which the parties had agreed? In my view, [the main contractor has] <span class="font-italic">not come close to demonstrating that the alleged term is necessary to make the contract work. It operates perfectly satisfactorily without the implied term, and there was really no suggestion to the contrary</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42. The second general reason for my conclusion is based on the review of the authorities set out … above. In all of those cases, in one way or another, <span class="font-italic">the courts declined to imply a term that would have imposed upon the contractor or sub-contractor interim obligations as to rate of progress and detailed performance</span>. In those cases, <span class="font-italic">the court repeatedly gave priority to the principle that, provided that the main contractual obligation was an obligation to complete by a certain date, it was unnecessary and unhelpful to impose other interim progress obligations upon the contractor</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43. Obviously the decision in <span class="font-italic">GLC v Cleveland Bridge</span> is most in point, because, as is the case here, the alleged implication was founded on the termination provisions. Both Staughton J and the Court of Appeal rejected that argument. Whilst that decision is not binding on me, because the terms of the contract under review are different, it seems to me that, unless there is a good reason to distinguish between the relevant terms of the respective contracts, I should follow that decision. In my view, there is no good reason to distinguish between the contracts; indeed, the respective termination provisions are, to all intents and purposes, the same. Therefore I consider that it would be wrong for me to reach a conclusion different to that of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">GLC v Cleveland Bridge</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44. Those general reasons for concluding that no term should be implied are, of course, consistent with the passage in <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> cited … above. It means that I take a different view to that expressed by the learned editors of <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span>, but, as the judgment of Staughton J in <span class="font-italic">GLC v Cleveland Bridge</span> makes plain, <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> has always taken a singular approach to this issue. As yet, although their argument is entirely understandable, and gives rise to what Staughton J called a “nicely balanced” point, the editors have been unable to found their view on any reported authority.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CAA had an implied obligation to proceed with due diligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Applying the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> three-step test (see [109] above), I find that the parties’ contract does contain both implied terms that Newcon argues in favour of: (i) that CAA will produce and deliver the slabs with due diligence and expedition; and (ii) that time is of the essence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">First step: identify the gaps and how they arose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 At the first <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> step, I must consider the gaps in the parties’ contract to which Newcon points and ascertain whether those gaps arose because the parties failed to contemplate them (in which case, I can proceed to the second <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> step) or whether those gaps arose for some other reason (in which the inquiry as to implied terms ends).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The entire commercial purpose of the parties’ contract was for CAA to supply structural elements to Newcon in full, in sequence and in time. Newcon engaged CAA in order to enable Newcon to perform meet its own performance obligations under the main contract. That commercial purpose required CAA to deliver slabs on time, in the proper sequence and in the number required. This was fundamental to the parties’ bargain. A failure to deliver slabs at all, a failure to deliver them in sequence or a failure to deliver them in full all carried serious contractual consequences for Newcon under its main contract. CAA knew that Newcon faced consequences under the main contract if CAA breached its obligations to JTC.

Thus, it contains no express provision setting out in absolute or relative temporal terms a production and delivery schedule for CAA to meet. It contains no procedure for CAA to claim an extension of time to perform its obligations under the contract or obliging Newcon to grant such an extension if certain conditions were satisfied. It contains no express clause – typical in construction contracts – requiring the party delivering party (CAA in this case) to pay liquidated damages for breach to the receiving party (Newcon in this case). It contains no protocol governing the receiving party’s express right to terminate the contract as a whole in the event that the delivering party persists in failing to perform its bargained-for promises.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 These gaps arose because the parties failed to contemplate them. The gaps are the result of the rudimentary form, and perhaps haste, in which the parties reduced their agreement into writing in the letter of intent. From Newcon’s perspective, the rudimentary form of the letter of intent is the result of its expectation that the parties would in due course and by consent replace its abbreviated contractual content with the more comprehensive content set out in the letter of acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I do not accept CAA’s submission that cl 2 of the letter of intent precludes a finding that the parties’ contract contains these gaps. Clause 2 simply identifies the event markers that CAA was to follow in carrying out its sub-contract works, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “site progress” and “any revisions to construction … schedule”. It makes no provision for the manner in which CAA was to carry out its works in order to put itself in the position necessary to meet those event markers. Nor can I, from the existence of cl 2 alone, conclude that the parties contemplated and agreed that CAA would fulfil its obligations under the contract so long as it delivered slabs at any time and in any sequence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 It is true that Newcon’s act in drawing up the letter of acceptance shows that Newcon, at the very least, did contemplate these gaps. That is why Newcon wanted to take the opportunity in the letter of acceptance to introduce express terms which would have addressed each of these gaps. However, the letter of acceptance post-dates the letter of intent and therefore post-dates the meeting of the minds which gave rise to the parties’ contract which the letter of intent records. Indeed, Newcon’s belated attempt to add new terms to the parties’ bargain in the letter of acceptance is the very reason CAA gave for not accepting its terms. To the extent that Newcon did contemplate and fill in the gaps in the letter of intent, it did so after the parties had bound themselves contractually. The existence of the detailed proposed provisions in the letter of acceptance does not preclude a finding that the parties failed to contemplate the gaps in the letter of intent at the time they bound themselves contractually to its terms. Newcon’s contemplation of these gaps when it drew up the letter of acceptance does not, therefore, take the present case outside the first <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> step.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I therefore find that the first <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> step is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second step: apply the business efficacy test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 At the second <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> step, I must consider whether “it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply [each] term in order to give the contract efficacy” (see [109] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I begin the analysis on this step with a passage in <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span><span class="font-italic"> (13th edition)</span>. This passage (also from §6-021) appears immediately after the passage I have set out at [115] above. <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> here posits a contractor who persists in an unreasonable rate of progress despite warning and suggests why that contractor should be vulnerable to having its contract terminated for repudiatory breach: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">[I]</span><span class="font-italic">f a contractor persists in a rate of progress bearing no relation either to a contractually promised or reasonable date of completion, and the Employer accordingly gives notice requiring a reasonable or improved rate of progress but the Contractor then fails to proceed at a reasonable rate, it is submitted that</span> <span class="font-italic">th</span><span class="font-italic">e Contractor will be evincing either inability to complete, or an intention no longer to be bound by the Contract, in either case justifying termination by the Employer</span>. Otherwise, provided the Contractor does not by unequivocal refusal openly evince an intention no longer to be bound (thus exposing itself to the assertion of an anticipatory repudiatory breach), the Employer will, in the absence of such an implied term, be without remedy until the completion date has passed, and in the usual case where time is not of the essence probably not even then, until a still later notice is served. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 What is of especial importance is that <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> follows this submission immediately with a description of the type of construction contract into which these terms will be more easily implied:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This submission can be tested by considering a short and relatively informal construction contract with a stipulated contractual completion date, but with no, or a relatively small liquidated damages provision. If, for example, it is assumed that the Contractor has the opportunity of taking on profitable work elsewhere, and with limited resources reduces its efforts so as to accommodate the other contract …. It would be absurd, it is submitted, if the Employer was to be without remedy until after a perhaps distant completion date, and then only for the perhaps inadequate damages resulting from late completion simpliciter (and by which time, moreover, a failing Contractor might well be in liquidation). Equally, if in the same informal contract the Employer had to the knowledge of the builder entered into the usual commitments with third parties, on the basis of the Contractor proceeding with reasonable diligence in the light of the promised or a reasonable completion date, it would be absurd that it should escape all responsibility for the resulting damage suffered by the Employer. Indeed, it is submitted that the universally accepted term unquestionably implied by law for completion within a reasonable time … can in practice only be given effect … by analysis of the time required by a Contractor of the appropriate class on the assumption that it performs with due diligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 <span class="font-italic">Chow Kok Fong</span>, the leading local treatise on construction contracts, echoes this analysis with express reference to <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">UNSATISFACTORY PROGRESS OF WORKS</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Position under Common Law</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13.69 An owner may seek to terminate a construction contract because the progress of the works is unacceptably slow.

However, in the absence of any express provision on this matter in the contract, the recourse of such an owner under common law is quite limited. He has to basically wait for the original contract date to pass and then for the delay to reach a stage which justifies the formulation of an action for fundamental breach before he could resort to termination of the contract. His recourse to damages, of course, remains but, in many situations, this is poor compensation when the momentum of a commercial opportunity is lost. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Obligation to Proceed “Regularly and Diligently” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13.70 As noted earlier, most modern construction contracts contain provisions which enable an employer to terminate the contract where there are sufficient indications to suggest that the original contractor is unlikely to complete the works within an acceptable time frame.

It was further pointed out that, by that time, a failing contractor might well be in liquidation.

These slabs, being structural elements, were essential for Newcon to perform its time-critical obligations to JTC under the main contract. CAA knew the direct connection between timely performance of its production and delivery obligations to Newcon and Newcon’s timely performance of its obligation to JTC. CAA knew this from the tender discussions and also from the contract period and construction schedule in the letter of intent itself.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Further, CAA’s obligation under the letter of intent was not simply to produce a single finished product to Newcon at the end of a 15-month contract period. CAA undertook a recurring obligation over the course of the contract to produce and deliver slabs to Newcon. Further, the slabs which CAA undertook to deliver required significant lead time to produce, marshal and transport to the construction site. They also had to be delivered in a particular sequence because the main contract, and indeed the laws of physics, required Newcon to perform the superstructure works in a particular sequence. In those circumstances, business efficacy all the more necessitates an implied term as to timeliness in producing and delivering slabs and for a contractual consequence for breach of that implied term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 That finding upon applying the business efficacy test does not necessitate, however, that any of the other gaps which I have found in the parties’ contract (at [139] above) be filled. Thus, for example, the contract’s commercial purpose can be quite easily achieved without implying a provision obliging CAA to pay liquidated damages to Newcon, or without implying a protocol for contractual extensions of time. Likewise, although business efficacy necessitates a contractual consequence for failing to failing to produce and deliver slabs in a timely manner, it does not require that time under the contract be of the essence in all respects and for all reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Given the commercial purpose of the parties’ contract, I accept that their contract would lack business efficacy without an implied term relating to timeliness in producing and delivering slabs and without an implied term relating to termination for breach of that term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 For the actual content of these implied terms, it is necessary to proceed to the third <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> step.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Third step: the content of the terms</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I accept Newcon’s submission that the commercial purpose of the parties’ contract makes it necessary to imply a term CAA to proceed with its works with due diligence and expedition at all times until completion. That term, qualified at it is by a requirement of reasonableness, goes no further than imposing the minimum necessary obligation upon CAA in order to achieve the contract’s commercial purpose. One effect of this implied term is to require CAA to meet the delivery dates which Newcon would make known to CAA from time to time. Another – and perhaps more important – effect is to oblige CAA to arrange its work processes between the delivery dates so that it makes reasonable progress on production and is therefore able to deliver slabs on time, in sequence and in full on the appointed dates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I accept also that it is necessary that time be of the essence, but only with respect to this implied term of due diligence and expedition. The effect of time being of the essence in relation to this term is to give Newcon the right to terminate the contract if CAA were guilty of persistent breach of its obligation of due diligence and expedition which evinces either an inability to perform its contractual obligations or an intention no longer to be bound by the contract. This second implied term is deliberately drawn in narrow terms. It does not entitle Newcon to terminate the contract for any breach of any time provision under the contract. It is confined to a breach of the implied term as to due diligence and expedition. Even then, it does not give Newcon the right to terminate the contract for any breach of the implied term as to due diligence and expedition. It gives Newcon that right only if the breach, taken together with other breaches, goes to the root of the parties’ bargain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Without this implied term making time of the essence, as <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> (see [145] above) and <span class="font-italic">Chow </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Fong</span> (see [147] above) have pointed out, Newcon would have to wait patiently for CAA to miss each delivery date and even then, it would have no right to terminate the contract but a right only to sue for damages. Newcon’s remedy would be limited in this manner even if it knew well in advance of the delivery date for a particular batch that CAA was not making the progress necessary to deliver that batch in full by that date. Newcon’s remedy would be limited in this manner even if CAA had demonstrated clearly on any objective view that it had no ability to produce and deliver a particular batch or all of the slabs on time and in sequence. A term making time of the essence, but only in these circumstances, is necessary in order to give the parties’ contract business efficacy. It also goes no further than necessary to achieve that efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I therefore conclude that the following two terms are necessary to give business efficacy to the parties’ agreement on the facts of this case: (i) a term obliging CAA to proceed with its works with due diligence and expedition at all times until completion; and (ii) a term entitling Newcon to terminate the contract for persistent breach of that obligation in the circumstances I have outlined above at [154].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CAA breached its express and implied obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I find that CAA breached both its express and implied obligations under the parties’ contract to produce and deliver slabs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CAA breached its express obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Newcon submits that CAA breached cl 2 of the letter of intent by failing to meet the delivery schedule in cl 7.10 of the letter of acceptance and the revised delivery schedule of 1 March 2013.

Clause 2 of the letter of intent imposed a contractual obligation on CAA to follow the site progress and the attached construction schedule. The construction schedule indicated that superstructure works involving CAA’s slabs were critical tasks and were to commence on 26 February 2013. Consistent with the indication in the construction schedule, the delivery schedule set out in cl 7.10 of the letter of acceptance required CAA to complete delivery of its first batch of slabs by 18 February 2013. The revised delivery schedule of 1 March 2013 required CAA to deliver slabs for area 2a by 8 March 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 CAA delivered its first batch of slabs only on 16 March 2013 (see [30] above). Even then, the slabs were delivered out of sequence, and were therefore unsuitable for installation at that time. CAA thereby also failed to follow Newcon’s site progress, as cl 2 obliged it to. CAA therefore breached the express terms of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CAA breached its implied obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 CAA also breached its implied term to proceed with its works with due diligence and expedition at all times until completion. CAA failed to plan its production so as to be able to deliver slabs on time, in full and in sequence. As a result, CAA actually did fail to deliver on time, in full and in sequence before Newcon terminated the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Not only did CAA breach its obligations in this respect, it did not even respond to Newcon’s several emails asking CAA to submit certain items and to make arrangements for JTC and Newcon to witness the first casting, as well as Newcon’s various chasers for delivery of slabs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 An overall review of the events that transpired lead me to the conclusion that CAA did not proceed with its sub-contract works with due diligence and expedition.

</div> In any event, CAA never raised this allegation at any time before Newcon issued its notice of termination on 25 March 2013. It made this allegation only in its letter of 26 March 2013. If this were the true reason for CAA’s late delivery and non-delivery of slabs, the inherent probabilities are that it would have raised this point to Newcon much earlier. There was no evidence that Newcon had ever turned away CAA’s delivery of the slabs on the basis that Newcon was not ready to take delivery. I also agree with Newcon’s submission that CAA’s obligation to deliver the slabs in accordance with the delivery schedule was independent of the site progress of the structural works.

</div> None of this provided any credible excuse for CAA’s delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 CAA submits that Newcon again revised the delivery schedule on 21 March 2013 (see [32] – [33] above), when it stipulated 28 March 2013 as the time for CAA to make its initial delivery of slabs. I reject CAA’s submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The delivery schedule attached to the 21 March 2013 email is quite different from the revised delivery schedule of 1 March 2013 (see [27] above. The latter was an unconditional revision of delivery dates which Newcon put unilaterally to CAA. The delivery schedule sent on 21 March 2013 differed from that in two respects. First, it was merely a <span class="font-italic">proposal</span> for a revised delivery schedule. That is set out expressly in the title and in the first sentence of the covering email. Second, the proposed revisions were, by the express terms of this email, subject to discussion and agreement at a future meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 That future meeting took place on 22 March 2013. Although the parties disagree on what occurred at that meeting (see [35] above), it is neither party’s case that the parties agreed at this meeting that the proposed delivery schedule would become an agreed delivery schedule. In fact, it was CAA’s own case that the proposed delivery schedule was not even discussed at this meeting. The condition which Newcon attached to the delivery schedule by qualifying it with the adjective “proposed” was accordingly never met. I therefore hold that the proposed delivery schedule of 21 March 2013 had no contractual effect under the letter of intent. CAA cannot rely on compliance with the delivery schedule in Newcon’s 21 March 2013 email to argue that it was not in breach by reason of delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Consequently, I find that Newcon did not commit any acts of prevention. There is therefore no basis for CAA’s submission that time was set at large. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CAA’s obligation fell on the critical path</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 CAA’s alternative counterargument is that its obligation to deliver the slabs did not fall on the critical path of Newcon’s work.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 I accept Newcon’s submission. I begin with cl 2 of the letter of intent. Clause 2 states that the main contract period lasts 15 months, from 1 November 2012 to 31 January 2014, and requires CAA to follow progress on site, including any revisions to the construction schedule, in producing and delivering slabs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Clause 2 is in my view a condition of the contract. Whether a term is a condition is, of course, to be determined by ascertaining the objective intentions of the parties on the contract’s proper construction in light of all the surrounding circumstances: <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span>”) at [174]. The commercial purpose of the contract was for CAA to deliver slabs to Newcon for installation, on time and in sequence. Both parties knew that timely delivery of the slabs was necessary to ensure that Newcon could adhere to the main contract timeline set out in the construction schedule. This was exactly the subject of cl 2. CAA’s eventual breach of cl 2 resulted precisely in the anticipated consequence – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>delays in Newcon’s performance and completion of the main contract, and Newcon’s liability to pay liquidated damages to JTC in the amount of $407,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The commercial purpose of the contract similarly drives me to conclude that the implied term of due diligence and expedition was a condition of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Even if cl 2 and the implied term of due diligence were not conditions of the parties’ contract, the <span class="font-italic">Hongkong</span><span class="font-italic"> Fir </span>approach (summarised in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span> at [157]) applied to the present facts leads me to conclude that the nature and the consequences of CAA’s breaches of both terms were such as to deprive Newcon of substantially the whole benefit it intended to obtain from the contract. That too suffices to confer upon Newcon a right at common law to terminate the contract upon CAA’s breach. It sufficed also to trigger the implied term I have found which permits Newcon to terminate the contract if CAA were guilty of persistent breach of its obligation of due diligence and expedition which evinces either an inability to perform its contractual obligations or an intention no longer to be bound by the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 For these reasons, I hold that Newcon was entitled to terminate the contract as a result of CAA’s repudiatory breaches of the contract’s express and implied terms. That is so either under the common law right to terminate for repudiatory breach and also pursuant to the implied term making time of the essence in relation to the implied term of due diligence and expedition. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My findings on the claim and counterclaim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 I will now explain my findings on the remaining elements of the claim and counterclaim and my decision on quantum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CAA’s claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Newcon did not wrongfully terminate the parties’ contract.

</div> I agree with Newcon that the documentary evidence produced by CAA in support of this aspect of its claim was wholly insufficient. Further, I do not accept that CAA would not have delivered or attempted to deliver these slabs to Newcon if they had really been produced and were suitable for Newcon’s needs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The remaining component of CAA’s claim is the sum of $28,050 for rental of lifting equipment and I-beams. According to CAA, Newcon failed to return the equipment after 16 May 2013. CAA therefore claims a “rental fee” of $150 per day from 16 May 2013 up to the date of commencement of this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 CAA’s claim lacks a cause of action. The obvious cause of action would be a claim for damages in tort for wrongful detention of property (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">ACES System Development Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Yenty Lily (trading as Access International Services)</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1317). But CAA relies neither on tort nor on contract for Newcon’s liability to pay this “rental fee”. Indeed, during oral closing submissions, counsel for CAA could not articulate a legal basis for the claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 Even on quantum, CAA does not explain how it arrives at the figure of $150 per day. CAA makes no attempt to demonstrate, for instance, that this was the market rent for these items at the material time. The figure appears to be entirely arbitrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 In any event, Newcon never refused to return the I-beams, wrongfully or otherwise. Newcon stored the I-beams on site from the time that CAA ceased to deliver slabs from end March 2013. CAA could have collected them at any time. Indeed, CAA did collect them on 25 February 2014 immediately upon receiving an email reminder from Newcon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 I reject this claim.

</div> Eastern Pretech therefore had some familiarity with the project, the specifications for the slabs and the scope of work generally. Newcon was also able to mitigate its loss, despite its reduced bargaining power arising from the urgency of the situation, by getting Eastern Pretech to agree a discount on its initial quotation in March 2013.

It was reasonably foreseeable that, if CAA failed to perform its contractual obligations to produce and deliver slabs, Newcon would have to engage an alternative contractor to do that work. The additional sum that Newcon had to pay Eastern Pretech, over and above CAA’s contract price, was therefore either loss arising in the ordinary course from CAA’s breach or loss which CAA reasonably foresaw, given its knowledge of Newcon’s obligations as to time to JTC under the main contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 I have found also that Newcon is entitled to $32,093.19 for idling of the crawler crane and associated overtime charges.

</div> As I have found (at [170] above), CAA had only itself to blame for not responding more quickly to Newcon’s repeated instructions for CAA to make arrangements for the first casting. In relation to the idle crawler crane between 1 March 2013 and 31 March 2013, CAA suggests that Newcon impeded CAA’s delivery progress by giving it notice of new delivery timelines, revised zonings and design changes. I have already rejected this aspect of CAA’s case at [171] to [179] above. I have also rejected CAA’s further contention that there was no causative link between CAA’s delay and Newcon’s loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 I have allowed Newcon’s claim for $62,629.40 for renting system formwork. Newcon used the system formwork to cast columns and beams. As a result of CAA’s failure to produce and deliver slabs, Newcon had to rent the system formwork for a longer period of time. CAA’s objection to this claim is based on Newcon’s 21 March 2013 email. CAA suggests that the delivery schedule had been revised following this email.

In its closing submissions, Newcon quantifies this claim against CAA as being for $980,500 for 53 days of delay at $18,500 per day. Liability for 53 days of delay is Newcon’s worst-case scenario under the main contract. Newcon’s alternative quantification of this claim is $407,000, being the actual sum which JTC has so far deducted as liquidated damages. JTC deducted this sum as liquidated damages for 22 days of delay at $18,500 per day under an interim final payment certificate dated 13 April 2015 issued under the main contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 CAA denies that it is liable to Newcon under this head. Its case is that it was Newcon’s other subcontractors, and not CAA, which caused Newcon’s liability to pay liquidated damages to JTC. CAA refers to a sequence in Mr Cao’s cross-examination in which he accepted that there were other sub-contractors involved in Newcon’s main contract works and that following delay caused by one such sub-contractor, JTC awarded Newcon an extension of time of 59 days.

</div>
</div> In my view, this evidence lent no support to CAA’s argument. Mr Cao explained in cross-examination and re-examination that this sub-contractor’s delay had been in respect of installing an additional stair lift, which was a requirement imposed by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Mr Cao also accepted that there was delay caused by an aluminium works sub-contractor. But I accept his evidence that this delay was “very marginal” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, only “[a] couple of days”) and occurred only at the “completion stage of the projects” as the aluminium works concerned the “external façade” of the building. I therefore accept Newcon’s submission that any delay caused by the aluminium works sub-contractor could not have been concurrent with the delay caused by CAA.

</div>
</div> CAA’s delay occurred at the very outset of construction, affected the structural works and was the root cause of Newcon’s overall delay in completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 I therefore accept that CAA is liable to Newcon for damages under this head. Newcon’s loss in paying liquidated damages to JTC either flowed directly from CAA’s breach or was loss which was within the parties’ reasonable contemplation if CAA failed to perform its obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 I have, however, limited Newcon’s recovery to the $407,000 which JTC has actually deducted from the main contract sum. In oral closing submissions, counsel for Newcon confirmed that JTC had not made any attempt since the interim final payment certificate (see [210] above) to recover additional liquidated damages from Newcon. There is therefore no basis on which Newcon can claim that it continues to be exposed to a claim by JTC for additional liquidated damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 In respect of CAA’s claim, I have found that it is entitled to recover $17,790.30 for producing and delivering slabs before Newcon terminated the parties’ contract and $1,500 for the cost of design and shop drawings. I have found that it is not entitled to any other aspects of its claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 As for Newcon’s counterclaim, I have found that it is entitled to be paid $488,166.62 for the additional cost of engaging Eastern Pretech to complete CAA’s scope of works, $32,093.19 for wasted costs incurred by the idle crawler crane, $62,629.40 for renting system formwork and $407,000 for the liquidated damages which JTC deducted. I have rejected Newcon’s claim for $1,321.85 for overtime fees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 As regards costs, I reject Newcon’s submission that CAA should pay indemnity costs. Although I made findings against the credibility of CAA’s two witnesses (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Dr Chi and Mr Chen), I do not think that CAA the manner in which CAA had conducted the litigation warranted an award of indemnity costs. I have therefore ordered CAA to pay costs to Newcon on the standard basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 I accept CAA’s submission that the costs it pays Newcon should be discounted to reflect the fact that CAA succeeded in establishing that the letter of acceptance did not form part of the parties’ contract. Although that argument did not ultimately make a substantial difference to the outcome of this action – as CAA was nevertheless found liable on the counterclaim in large part – that issue of law did take up a significant part of the oral and written closing submissions presented to me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 I have therefore ordered CAA to pay 75% of Newcon’s costs of and incidental to the claim and the counterclaim, such costs to be taxed on the standard basis. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Irving Choh, Lim Bee Li and Melissa Kor (Optimus Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Joseph Lee and Tang Jin Sheng (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
