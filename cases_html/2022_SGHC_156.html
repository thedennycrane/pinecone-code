</div>
</div> I was satisfied that the plaintiff did not give any such instructions to the defendant. For reasons set out below, I found that the plaintiff had disputed the Invoice. Therefore, he would not have consented to the Invoice being paid, and the Invoice could not be said to have been paid for the purpose of s 122 of the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Nevertheless, it was common ground that more than 12 months had expired since the Invoice was delivered to the plaintiff. Although the Invoice was dated 4 June 2018, it was not disputed that the Invoice was in fact prepared in 2019 when the plaintiff visited the defendant at his office (see [13] above). More than 12 months had expired since then and, pursuant to s 122 of the LPA, the plaintiff had to prove special circumstances to justify the making of an order for taxation of the defendant’s bill of costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The relevant legal principles were not disputed. There is no rigid rule as to what kind of circumstances will justify the taxation of a solicitor’s bill and what amounts to special circumstances depends on the facts of each case: <span class="font-italic">Wee Harry Lee v Haw Par Brothers International Ltd</span> [1979-1980] SLR(R) 603 at [15], citing the headnote to <span class="font-italic">Re Cheeseman </span>[1891] 2 Ch 289. It would thus not be expedient to provide an exhaustive list of what could constitute special circumstances under s 122: <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Corp and another </span>[2010] 4 SLR 590 at [31]. What is clear is that the special circumstances must address the fundamental question which s 122 poses, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, why it is right to refer the solicitor’s bill for taxation even though the client has allowed one or both of the disqualifying events under s 122 to be triggered: <span class="font-italic">Kosui Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu</span> [2015] 5 SLR 722 (“<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [62].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I was satisfied that the plaintiff had shown special circumstances in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 First, the fact that a solicitor’s bill of costs does not provide sufficient information to enable the client to take an informed decision on whether or not to seek taxation, is a relevant factor: <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> at [61(d)].

</div> clearly lacked sufficient particulars of the work done. According to the defendant’s affidavit, the work done included filing a claim under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WICA”). However, the Invoice did not refer to any such work. For completeness, the plaintiff eventually withdrew his claim under the WICA and proceeded with his claim under common law.

</div> The Invoice also referred to work done in issuing “Summons in High Court and attending Court on more [than] 17 occasions”. It made no mention of the fact that the proceedings had been transferred to the State Courts or that in fact, 11 attendances were in the State Courts for Court Dispute Resolution, and the last of which was to enter judgment based on the settlement reached. Neither did it state the stage at which the case was settled. The Invoice also did not provide any details of the disbursements. The defendant patently failed to itemise the work done for the plaintiff in respect of the Suit leading up to the settlement and the corresponding cost breakdown for each item. The result was an Invoice containing a list of vaguely described items and unexplained lump sum costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, I rejected the defendant’s allegation that the plaintiff was advised that he had the option to request that the bill of costs be taxed but the plaintiff had agreed with the Invoice.

</div> I accepted the plaintiff’s evidence that he had disputed the Invoice.  The plaintiff’s position was corroborated by the fact that he was so upset by the Invoice (and the sums stated therein) that he had filed a police report on 19 October 2019, two days after he was shown the Invoice (see [16] above) and had filed a complaint to the Law Society on 30 October 2019 (see [17] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In this connection, I accepted the plaintiff’s explanation that he had decided to take the $78,000 that was offered to him because he had known that that sum was part payment of his claim, and his intention was to follow up with the defendant to recover the balance.

</div>
</div>
</div> The plaintiff was in a difficult and vulnerable position. He had had to borrow moneys from the defendant and had been waiting for full payment of his claim. His acceptance of this sum as part payment was therefore not inconsistent with his dispute of the bill. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Further, r 17(5) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (“PCR”) requires a legal practitioner to inform the client of his right to taxation where the client disputes or raises a query about the bill. The defendant had breached his obligations under PCR r 17(5), and this is a relevant factor in finding special circumstances:  <span class="font-italic">Tan Yi Ling Cheryl v Tan Yew Fai (trading as Y F Tan &amp; Co) </span>[2022] SGHC 47 at [53(c)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Third, the defendant did not inform the plaintiff that he received payment of the Judgment Sum by PTCPL’s insurers in June 2018. The request letter signed by the plaintiff in August/September 2019 (see [8(d)] above) stated that his claim had been settled and that the “compensation monies” had been received by M/s Tan &amp; Pillai. However, the request letter did not state what was the amount received by M/s Tan &amp; Pillai or when it was received. The plaintiff acted timeously in seeking help from TWC2/Debbie. Despite numerous attempts by Debbie to follow up with PTCPL’s insurers by way of telephone and/or email, it was not until 6 October 2021 that PTCPL’s insurers informed Debbie that the Judgment Sum had been paid to the defendant on 13 June 2018.

</div>
</div>
</div> It was thus not unreasonable for the plaintiff to file the present application only after learning about this fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Fourth, the defendant had plainly taken advantage of the plaintiff’s circumstances and vulnerability by not informing the plaintiff of the receipt of the Judgment Sum or providing the plaintiff a particularised bill of costs or informing the plaintiff of his right to taxation. This was further supported by the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff had to take loans from the defendant. Clearly, the plaintiff was in need of funds. The defendant should have informed the plaintiff of the receipt of the Judgment Sum, presented his bill of costs within a reasonable time thereafter, settled accounts with the plaintiff (with respect to payment of his bill and the loans), and paid the plaintiff the balance that was due. The defendant did none of these things. Instead, despite having received the Judgment Sum, he had made a loan of $5,000 to the plaintiff on <span class="font-italic">5 March 2019</span> (see [8(c)] above), paid the plaintiff $5,000 as “part-payment” of the plaintiff’s claim on <span class="font-italic">27</span><span class="font-italic"> September 2019</span> (see [8(d)] above) and made another loan of $10,000 to the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">October 2019</span> (see [8(e)] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Deducting $100,000 (the amount of the Invoice) and $40,000 (the loans taken by the plaintiff, including the disputed amount of $8,000) from the amount of $$251,538.70 (the Judgment Sum) leaves a balance of $111,538.70. However, the defendant withheld $40,000 in purported exercise of a lien and paid the plaintiff $78,000.  The defendant did not explain in any of his affidavits how the sum of $78,000 was arrived at. Leaving that aside, the defendant gave conflicting explanations for the lien. The Instructions (see [18] above) stated that M/s Tan &amp; Pillai was holding $40,000 “on lien” pending resolution of “the issue of cost”. The defendant did not offer any explanation as to why there was an outstanding issue of costs when he had invoiced the plaintiff a total sum of $100,000 as costs and disbursements. Before me, the defendant alleged that he held back $40,000 because it was not clear what was the total amount of loans given to the plaintiff. This allegation was not mentioned in any of the defendant’s affidavits. It was also contrary to what was stated in the Instructions. Further, in one of his affidavits, Nazrul said that the disputed amount with respect to the loans was $8,000.
