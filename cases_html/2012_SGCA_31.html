        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court in Registrar’s Appeal No 260 of 2010
                    (“RA 260/2010”), where the judge (“the Judge”)
                    dismissed the appeal by the appellants (“the Appellants”) against
                    the award made by an assistant registrar (“the AR”) following an
                    assessment of damages for the injuries sustained by the respondent (“the
                    Respondent”) as a result of an industrial accident which occurred on
                    21 August 2008 (“the Accident”). For convenience, the
                    assessment of damages before the AR will hereafter be referred to as “the
                    assessment hearing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Respondent, Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin, is a
                    Bangladeshi national.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_0" id="Ftn_0_1"><sup>[note: 0]</sup></a></span> The first appellant, Poh Huat Heng
                    Corporation Pte Ltd, is the Respondent’s employer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    Although the exact relationship between the Respondent and the second and third
                    appellants (Hua Liong Machinery &amp; Trading Pte Ltd and Viscas Engineering
                    Singapore Pte Ltd respectively) is far from clear, it is not material and
                    nothing turns on it as the Appellants consented to an interlocutory judgment in
                    favour of the Respondent for damages to be assessed with liability apportioned
                    at 90% against the Appellants and 10% against the Respondent. Furthermore, the
                    consent interlocutory judgment ordered that the liability of the Appellants was
                    to be joint and several.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 21 August 2008, the Respondent was
                    laying cables at a Mass Rapid Transit worksite at Woodlands Avenue 3,
                    Singapore, when a bag of cement fell on his back. As a result, he suffered an
                    injury to his spine which resulted in paraplegia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> At the time
                    of the Accident, the Respondent was 27 years of age (having been born on
                    2 June 1981).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent now suffers from the following
                    permanent disabilities:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     paralysis of his lower limbs, with
                        the effect that he is permanently wheelchair-bound;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     absence of sensation below the groin
                        and absence of control over his bowels and bladder (which necessitates
                        catheterisation several times a day for urination);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     erectile dysfunction;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     infertility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After a period of hospitalisation and treatment
                    in Singapore, on 17 January 2009, the Respondent returned to
                        Bangladesh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He remained home-bound until 2 November
                    2009, when he enrolled himself in a nursing home in Dhaka,
                        Bangladesh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Respondent’s pleaded claims in damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 19 March 2009, the Respondent commenced
                    an action against the Appellants claiming damages on account of the injuries
                    which he had suffered. In the action, he claimed the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Special damages:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       loss of earnings at $874 per
                            month from 21 August 2008 to 20 December 2008 and continuing
                            thereafter at $874 per month up to the date of the
                        trial;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       cost of wheelchairs and various aids and appliances up to the date of
                            the trial; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       medical and transport expenses up to the date
                            of the trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     General damages:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       damages for pain and
                            suffering and loss of amenities;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       loss of future earnings and/or future earning

                            expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The award made by the AR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As liability was agreed and interlocutory
                    judgment entered (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above), an
                    assessment of damages (<em>viz</em>, the assessment hearing
                    as defined at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) was carried out by
                    the AR, who rendered a total award of $1,001,750.80 (based on 100% liability
                    before apportionment), consisting of the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Special damages (by consent) of
                        $26,268.30 (comprising $10,868.95 for pre-trial medical expenses and
                        $15,399.35 for pre-trial loss of income).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     General damages for the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       $166,000 for pain and
                            suffering and loss of amenities (comprising $160,000 for pain and
                            suffering, and $6,000 for loss of marriage
                        prospects);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       $127,200 for loss of future income;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       $32,400 for future transport
                            costs;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       $212,150.88 for future nursing care and nursing home

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       $47,731.68 for future expenses on diapers and catheters;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       $390,000 for future medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We
                    should add here that the AR’s award for future medical expenses was in
                    respect of the Respondent’s future medical expenses in Bangladesh as the
                    Respondent has returned to that country and is now living there. The references
                    hereafter to the Respondent’s claim for future medical expenses and the
                    award for this item should thus be understood in this light.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Both the Appellants and the Respondent appealed
                    against the AR’s award (via RA 260/2010 and Registrar’s Appeal
                    No 263 of 2010 (“RA 263/2010”)
                        respectively).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Judge dismissed
                    both appeals and did not issue any written grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments raised on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before us now is an appeal by the Appellants
                    against the Judge’s decision in RA 260/2010. The Appellants have
                    essentially raised two main lines of argument. First, they contend that the
                    Judge erred in taking the view that he could only intervene if the AR was shown
                    to have erred in law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Second, the Appellants
                    challenge the general damages assessed by the AR in respect of the following
                    heads of claim (“the disputed heads of claim”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     pain and suffering and loss of
                        amenities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     loss
                        of future earnings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     future medical expenses; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     future transport expenses, future nursing care and nursing
                        home expenses as well as future expenses on diapers and catheters (referred
                        to hereafter as “future transport and care expenses” for
                        short).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Respondent submits that the Judge did not
                    err in his approach.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> He also seeks to support
                    each of the awards made by the AR in respect of the disputed heads of claim. In
                    this regard, the Respondent has highlighted the fact that some of these awards
                    were premised on an agreement between the parties following concessions or
                    suggestions made by the Appellants’ counsel at the assessment
                    hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     We heard oral arguments for the appeal on
                    28 July 2011. The hearing was then adjourned for the parties to file
                    further submissions on various issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 19 September 2011, the Respondent
                    filed Summons No 4149 of 2011 (“SUM 4149/2011”) for
                    leave to bring a cross-appeal out of time against the award made in respect of
                    special damages, which (as noted at [7(a)] above) had been made <em>by consent</em>, and the award made in respect of general
                    damages. We heard SUM 4149/2011 on 16 January 2012 and dismissed it
                    with costs fixed at $500 to be paid by the Respondent to the
                Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the present appeal, the following issues
                    arise for this court’s consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the Judge err in the approach
                        which he adopted in dealing with the Appellants’ appeal in
                        RA 260/2010 (“Issue 1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Can the Appellants make submissions
                        which are inconsistent with an agreement reached before the AR on certain
                        facts which were to be used as the basis for assessing damages
                        (“Issue 2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Should any of the awards made by the AR in respect of the
                        disputed heads of claim (as set out above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>) be varied
                    (“Issue 3”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We will address each of these
                    issues in turn in the discussion which follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Did the Judge err in the approach which he adopted in
                RA 260/2010?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     With regard to Issue 1, the applicable
                    law was pronounced by this court in <em>Chang Ah Lek and others v
                        Lim Ah Koon</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 551 at [14] and [20]–[21], where it
                    held that a High Court judge hearing an appeal against an assistant
                    registrar’s decision on an assessment of damages:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     was not limited by the rule that
                        appellate interference was only warranted where the assistant registrar had
                        erred on a matter of principle, had misapprehended the facts or had, for
                        other reasons, made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     was entitled to
                        vary the assistant registrar’s award as he deemed fair and
                        just.</p>

                    assistant registrar’s award of damages “[was] <em>not</em> like that of an appellate court hearing an appeal from a
                    decision of a trial judge” [emphasis added] (at [14]), in that the High Court
                    judge “deal[t] with [the] appeal from the [assistant] registrar ‘as
                    though the matter came before him for the first time’” (at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As noted above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>, the Judge did not issue any written grounds of decision in

                    transcript of the hearing notes for these two appeals, the Judge merely recorded
                    the Appellants’ counsel as having submitted on two occasions that he was
                    not arguing that the AR had erred in law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> On the face of the
                    certified transcript, the Judge did not indicate that the reason for his

                    certified transcript only attributes the Judge as having said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">No order as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nothing was indicated as to the approach which the
                    Judge took. In the circumstances, it is not possible for this court to determine
                    whether the Judge did in fact adopt an incorrect approach in reaching his
                    decision. Therefore, we are unable to agree with the Appellants that a wrong
                    approach had in fact been taken by the Judge in RA 260/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     We note that this court in <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em> [2012] 1 SLR 676 expounded
                    on the judicial duty to give reasons (reference may also be made to <em>Loh Sioh Hon (administratrix of the estate of Chiam

                        Moey</em> [2012] SGCA 14 at [15]). The Appellants did
                    not, however, argue that the Judge’s decision in RA 260/2010 should
                    be set aside on the ground that the Judge did not provide his reasons for
                    dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Can the Appellants make submissions which are
                inconsistent with an agreement reached before the AR on certain facts which were to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     We turn now to Issue 2. The point which
                    the Respondent seeks to make in this regard is that the Appellants should not be
                    allowed, in this appeal, to take a stand which is inconsistent with their
                    position before the AR. The Respondent has alluded in his written case to the
                    existence of an agreement reached before the AR on certain facts which were to
                    be used as the basis for assessing damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The certified
                    transcript of the assessment hearing appears to support the Respondent’s
                    contention that in some areas, the parties reached or seemed to have reached an
                    agreement which formed the basis upon which the AR was to assess damages in
                    respect of these heads of claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     the cost of future medical
                        expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     loss
                        of future income, in terms of the multiplicand to be used for determining
                        the appropriate amount to award; and</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There are two possible bases upon which the
                    Appellants can be precluded from opening up an issue which they consented or
                    agreed to before the AR. Much would necessarily depend on what exactly was
                    consented to or agreed upon, and its context. <em>First</em>, the agreement between the parties could constitute a
                    consent order. It is well established that a judgment or order obtained by
                    consent is final and can form the basis for the application of the doctrine of
                        <em>res </em><em>judicata</em>
                    (see K R Handley, <em>Spencer Bower and Handley: Res
                        </em><em>Judicata</em> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed,
                    2009) at para 2.16). A consent judgment or consent order is binding and
                    cannot be set aside save for exceptional reasons (see the High Court decision of
                        <em>Wiltopps (Asia) Ltd v Drew &amp; Napier and
                        another</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 252 (“<em>Wiltopps</em>”) at [27] (an appeal to the Court of Appeal
                    against the High Court’s decision was dismissed without any written
                    grounds being issued (see the editorial note to <em>Wiltopps</em>)) and <em>Bakery Mart Pte Ltd v Ng Wei
                        Teck Michael and others</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 28
                        (“<em>Bakery Mart</em>”) at [11]). In
                    this regard, we would make one further observation. To constitute a consent
                    order, there must be a real agreement between the parties, which is to be
                    contrasted with the scenario where a party merely does not object to a course of
                    action (see <em>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Pneupac
                        Ltd</em> [1982] 1 WLR 185 at 189F–189G, which was followed
                    in <em>Wiltopps</em> at [18] and <em>Wellmix
                        Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 117 (“<em>Wellmix</em>”) at
                    [29], and distinguished in <em>Bakery Mart</em> at
                    [13]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The <em>second</em> basis
                    on which the Appellants can be precluded from opening up an issue which they
                    consented or agreed to before the AR is the principle that even if the parties
                    to an action are found not to have reached an agreement, a statement by counsel
                    of one of the parties can constitute an admission. This is provided for in
                    s 18 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”), which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Admissions made by counsel on questions of fact in the course of a

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The cost of future medical expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We now turn to the three areas (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above) in respect of which the Respondent
                    alleges that there was an agreement between the parties as to the basis on which
                    the AR was to assess the quantum of damages. The first area relates to the cost
                    of future medical expenses. In their submissions to this court, the Appellants
                    have not referred to any agreement on this head of claim. Instead, they argue
                    that the award for this head of claim, which the AR assessed at $390,000, ought
                    to be assessed based on a multiplicand of $466.33 per month with a multiplier of
                    14 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> On the Appellants’ submission, the
                    award for future medical expenses would be fixed at a much lower sum of
                    $78,343.44.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is critical to consider what exactly the
                    Appellants agreed to at the assessment hearing. The Respondent was not able to
                    call a doctor from the hospital in Bangladesh at which he had been receiving
                    treatment (“Apollo Hospital”) to testify at the assessment hearing
                    due to the policy considerations of the hospital (apparently, Apollo Hospital
                    has a policy of not permitting its specialists to involve themselves in any
                    legal proceedings concerning its patients).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Instead, two
                    Singapore specialist doctors, Dr Adela Tow (“Dr Tow”)
                    and Dr I Swaminathan (“Dr Swami”), were called to
                    testify. Dr Tow estimated that if the Respondent were to receive treatment
                    in Singapore, his future medical expenses would cost between $500,000 and
                    $600,000. The certified transcript of the assessment hearing shows that the
                    parties agreed that the award for future medical expenses was to be computed
                    based on the estimated figures provided by Dr Tow
                    (“Dr Tow’s Rates”), with a 35% discount (as suggested
                    by Dr Swami) applied to those figures. The following extract of the
                    certified transcript is germane in this regard:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Looking at the evidence adduced, in terms of the medical care rates
                            used in Bangladesh, the hospital in question is Apollo [H]ospital. The
                            evidence from Dr Swami is that Apollo [H]ospital was [a] premier
                            hospital in Bangladesh. It does not approximate to B1 rates. Also, we do
                            not have enough evidence on the rates chargeable in Bangladesh. The main
                            evidence we have in this case is the evidence of Dr Tow and
                            Dr Swami – Dr Tow’s estimation is
                            $500,000–$600,000, and Dr Swami’s evidence for
                            Bangladesh overall, is that a discount of 35% should be given from
                            Singapore rates, generally speaking.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">This extract shows that the Appellants’ counsel (denoted as
                    “D/C” above) proposed to use the evidence of the Singapore doctors
                        (<em>ie</em>, Dr Tow and Dr Swami) to arrive
                    at the figure for the cost of the Respondent’s future medical expenses in
                    view of the lack of evidence on the future medical costs likely to be incurred
                    by the Respondent in Bangladesh. The AR asked the Respondent’s counsel
                    (denoted as “P/C” above) if she agreed, to which she replied in
                    the affirmative. The Respondent’s counsel then stated the range of
                    discounted figures within which the court was to make its decision
                    (incidentally, the Respondent’s counsel made an error in calculating the
                    lower end of the range: the relevant figure should have been $325,000). More
                    importantly, when the AR delivered her oral judgment, she recorded that both the
                    Appellants’ counsel and the Respondent’s counsel were
                    “prepared to go along with Dr Tow[’s] and
                    Dr Swami’s evidence”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The AR then selected the upper end of
                    Dr Tow’s Rates (<em>ie</em>, $600,000) and
                    applied a discount of 35% to that figure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As we see it, the exchange between counsel
                    quoted at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above was, in substance, an
                    agreement between the parties to rely on the Singapore doctors’ evidence
                    instead of having a Bangladeshi doctor testify on the Respondent’s likely
                    future medical expenses. This agreement was recorded by the AR, and therefore
                    amounted to a consent order. It is not open to the Appellants to now challenge
                    that agreement in this appeal. Admittedly, a consent order may be set aside on
                    ordinary contract law principles such as mistake (see <em>Wellmix</em> at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>). However,
                    on the basis of the above extract, there is nothing to suggest that the
                    Appellants’ counsel made a mistake in submitting that the award for future
                    medical expenses should be based on “what Dr Tow … stated,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In respect of his claim for loss of future
                    earnings, the Respondent testified before the AR that if not for the Accident,

                    testified that if he could not work in Singapore, he would have gone to work in
                    Saudi Arabia where, he claimed, there was a high demand for skilled
                        workers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In the worst-case scenario, the Respondent

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In this appeal, the Appellants are arguing
                    that in determining the appropriate multiplicand in respect of each of the above
                    two portions, the expenses which the Respondent would likely have incurred to
                    earn his future income should be subtracted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> On this basis,
                    they submit that the multiplicand for the Singapore portion should be the sum of
                    $650 per month and that for the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia portion should be the
                    sum of $350 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, we note that before the AR, the
                    Appellants’ counsel was recorded as having submitted that he
                    “w[ould] not be disput[ing]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>
                    the multiplicands put forth by the Respondent’s counsel for the loss of
                    future earnings award (<em>viz</em>, $800 per month for the
                    Singapore portion and $500 per month for the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia
                        portion).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Similar to
                    the situation in regard to the cost of future medical expenses, in her oral
                    judgment, the AR stated that “[t]he [Appellants] accepts [<em>sic</em>] the multiplicand[s] submitted by the
                        [Respondent]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     What should be the correct view of the above
                    statement by the Appellants’ counsel before the AR that the Appellants
                    would “not be disput[ing]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>
                    the multiplicands put forth by the Respondent? While the phrase “not
                    … disput[ing]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> is not as
                    positive as “agree” or “accept”, we find that in the
                    present context, its true sense amounts to the Appellants agreeing to the
                    multiplicands proposed by the Respondent, bearing in mind that the Appellants
                    did not adduce any evidence to counter the figures put forth by the Respondent.
                    That was also the understanding of the AR as she recorded that the Appellants
                        <em>accepted</em> the multiplicands submitted by the
                    Respondent. In any event, even assuming that we do not construe the phrase
                    “not … disput[ing]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> as amounting
                    to an agreement, we do not see how the AR’s acceptance of the
                    Respondent’s evidence on the applicable multiplicands can be challenged
                    and held to be wrong when there was no evidence which showed that a different
                    finding should have been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Loss of marriage prospects</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     With regard to the Respondent’s claim
                    for loss of marriage prospects (which the AR dealt with as part of the claim for
                    loss of amenities), the Appellants’ argument in this appeal is that the
                    award of $6,000 for this head of claim should be disallowed because
                    “there is an even chance as to the [Respondent]’s marriage
                        prospect[s]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> We note, however, that
                    before the AR, the Appellants’ counsel had said that it was “fair
                    to have such an award [<em>ie</em>, an award for loss of
                    marriage prospects]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>
                    and had proceeded to submit a figure of $6,000 for this head of
                        claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As the Appellants’ counsel had said at
                    the assessment hearing that it was “fair”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> to make an award for loss of marriage
                    prospects and as the figure of $6,000 for this head of claim came from the
                    Appellants, it would be reasonable to infer that as far as the Appellants were
                    concerned, in the circumstances, it was justifiable for the Respondent to claim
                    for this item and $6,000 was a fair quantum to award for it. In the light of
                    these admissions by the Appellants, we do not think they should now be allowed
                    to re-open issues relating to this head of claim. In passing, we would also add
                    that even if we do not interpret the statement “fair to have such an
                        award”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> to mean what we have just
                    held, on the evidence, it is clear that the AR was correct to have made an award
                    for loss of marriage prospects (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>
                    below).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In summary, in relation to Issue (2), we
                    hold that the Appellants are precluded from challenging: (a) the award for
                    future medical expenses; (b) the multiplicands applied by the AR in
                    determining the award for loss of future income; and (c) the award for loss
                    of marriage prospects. However, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    quantum awarded by the AR for loss of future income, the Appellants are not
                    precluded from arguing how the <em>multiplier</em> should
                    be divided between the Singapore portion and the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia portion
                    of what would have been the remainder of the Respondent’s working life if
                    not for the Accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Should any of the awards for the disputed heads of

                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, the Appellants are challenging
                    the awards made by the AR in respect of the following heads of claim (<em>viz</em>, the disputed heads of claim as defined at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     pain and suffering and loss of

                    made for this item, in the interests of completeness, we will still examine the
                    award (at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>–<a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> below) to show that on the evidence, it is
                    not excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pain and suffering and loss of amenities</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Pain and suffering</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In its recent decision in <em>Koh Chai Kwang v Teo Ai Ling (by her next friend, Chua Wee Bee)</em>
                    [2011] 3 SLR 610 (“<em>Koh Chai
                    Kwang</em>”), this court accepted that there are two approaches to
                    assessing what is a fair and reasonable award for pain and suffering,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     a global approach, which involves
                        making a global award for all the injuries and disabilities suffered by the
                        plaintiff (as in <em>Koh Chai Kwang</em>, where a
                        global award was given for the plaintiff’s head injuries);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     a component
                        approach, which involves making separate awards for different heads of
                        injuries and disabilities (see, for example, <em>Chai Kang
                            Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian</em> [2010] 3 SLR 587
                            (“<em>Shaw Linda
                        Gillian (CA)</em>”) at [44]–[50], where a component
                        approach was adopted in assessing the damages to be awarded for the
                        plaintiff’s head injuries).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the present case, the AR adopted the global
                    approach in assessing damages for pain and suffering because of the nature of
                    the Respondent’s injuries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The
                    Appellants are not arguing that the AR was wrong in adopting that approach.
                    Instead, their contention is that the award of $160,000 for this head of claim
                    is excessive and should be reduced to $130,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The Respondent, on the
                    other hand, points out that the award of $160,000 was in fact on the low side
                    when compared with awards made in other similar cases.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In our view, the Appellants’ arguments
                    against the AR’s award for pain and suffering have no merit. Apart from
                    the authorities referred to by the Respondent, the figure of $160,000 does not
                    appear to be excessive when compared with the awards made in cases adopting the
                    global approach where severe injuries were sustained by the plaintiff. The
                    following extract from <em>Practitioners’ Library –
                        Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2005) (“<em>Practitioners’
                        Library</em>”) at para 5-23 is pertinent in this
                    regard:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The global approach is sometimes used in cases where the
                        accumulated effects of the injuries to the plaintiff are extremely severe,
                        even though the injuries are to different parts or functions of the body.

                    $160,000 and $130,000 respectively. We thus affirm the AR’s award of

                    no admission on the part of the Appellants that it was
                        “fair”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> to make an award for
                    loss of marriage prospects, the AR was justified to award $6,000 for this
                    item.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief dated
                    19 January 2010, the Respondent deposed that prior to the Accident, he had
                    been engaged to be married. After the Accident, his fiancée’s parents
                    decided to call off the marriage even though his fiancée was keen to proceed
                    with the marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Respondent, however, expressed a
                        “hope”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> that his fiancée’s parents would
                    permit the marriage “one day”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> During
                    cross-examination, the Respondent was questioned on the chances of his former
                    fiancée marrying him. He answered that he estimated his chances at
                        50:50.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The AR,
                    having heard his testimony, held that she was
                        “satisfied”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>
                    that the Respondent had proved, on the evidence, that he had lost his marriage
                        prospects.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is true that the Respondent estimated that
                    there was a 50% chance that his ex-fiancée’s parents might well change
                    their minds and agree to his marrying his ex-fiancée. We must bear in mind that
                    the Respondent had been engaged to be married prior to the Accident. Marriage
                    was clearly on the cards and it was just a matter of time. However, according to
                    the Respondent, after the Accident, he heard from his friends that his former
                    fiancée’s parents were adamant that the marriage was not to take
                        place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Having regard to the Respondent’s
                    physical state after the Accident, it is not difficult to understand the
                    position taken by the parents of his ex-fiancée. If the Respondent’s
                    ex-fiancée were to proceed to marry the Respondent, she would, to all intents
                    and purposes, be not a wife, but a lifetime maid to him. In our view, the
                    Respondent’s estimate of a 50% chance of eventually being able to marry
                    his ex-fiancée is no more than wishful thinking on his part. Objectively, we are
                    unable to disagree with the AR’s finding that the Respondent has lost his
                    marriage prospects. In this regard, we draw attention to the Respondent’s
                    uncontradicted oral evidence that his marriage had been well in sight prior to
                    the Accident, but that prospect was lost as a result of the Accident. What the
                    Respondent now has is no more than a hope of eventually marrying his ex-fiancée.
                    To award him nothing for the loss of his marriage prospects just because of the
                    dimness of his hope would be harsh and unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Loss of future earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We now move on to consider the claim relating
                    to loss of future earnings. The method of assessing damages for such loss was
                    recently enunciated by this court in the following manner (see <em>Koh Chai Kwang</em> at [37]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Normally, damages on the basis of LFE [loss of future earnings] are
                        awarded when the injured party is unable to go back to his pre-accident
                        employment and has to take on a lower paying job. <em>In such
                            a case, the loss will be calculated based on a </em><em>multiplier </em><em>and a multiplicand,
                            the multiplicand being the monthly loss in pay and the multiplier
                            </em><em>being the appropriate period over which to
                            compute the loss.</em> In contrast, where the injured party does
                        not suffered [<em>sic</em>] an immediate wage reduction
                            (<em>eg</em>, due to the compassion of the then
                        employer: see [<em>Smith v Manchester Corporation</em>
                        (1974) 17 KIR 1]) but there is a risk that he may lose that employment
                        at some point in the future and he may, as a result of his injury, be at a
                        disadvantage in getting another job or getting an equally well-paid job in
                        the open market, then the LEC [loss of earning capacity] would be the
                        correct basis to compensate him for the loss. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In this case, as the Respondent, due to his
                    injuries, is no longer employable, his loss of future earnings is total. The
                    issues which need to be addressed are the appropriate quantum to adopt as the
                    multiplicand and the appropriate number of years to use as the multiplier. In
                    relation to the multiplicand, as alluded to earlier (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), the Appellants’ contention is
                    that the Respondent’s expenses should be deducted from his likely future
                    income (if not for the Accident) in determining the multiplicand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As regards the multiplier, the Appellants
                    say that the appropriate number of years is 14 and not 17 as applied by the
                        AR.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In their further written submissions dated
                    3 January 2012, the Appellants, after an extensive discussion of various
                    local authorities, submit that the Singapore courts should determine the
                    multiplier for a loss of future earnings award based on the remainder of the
                    plaintiff’s <em>working life</em> (taking into
                    account, <em>inter alia</em>, his age, nationality, nature
                    of occupation, the retirement age and medical evidence), with an appropriate
                    discount for accelerated receipt of a lump sum and the vicissitudes of
                        life.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> The Appellants also argue
                    that based on local case law, other considerations which may be generally
                    relevant in determining the multiplier include the plaintiff’s health and
                    education, the rates of return on investments and employment
                        patterns.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The court may
                    also consider “splitting” the multiplier in the case of plaintiffs
                    who are foreign workers. This involves using one multiplier for the foreign
                    worker’s future income from working in Singapore and another multiplier
                    for his future income from working in his home country.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As far as the multiplicand is concerned, we
                    have at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above highlighted the fact that
                    the Appellants had, at the assessment hearing, agreed to the multiplicands put
                    forward by the Respondent, namely, $800 per month and $500 per month in respect
                    of the Singapore portion and the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia portion respectively of
                    what would have been the Respondent’s remaining working life if not for
                    the Accident (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above). In view of
                    that agreement, we do not think that the Appellants should now be permitted to
                    re-open this issue. In any case, as the Respondent has pointed out, the
                    certified transcript of the assessment hearing reveals that the aforesaid
                    multiplicands were derived <em>after</em> taking into
                    consideration the Respondent’s expenses in addition to the food and
                    transport provided for separately by his employer (<em>viz</em>, the first appellant).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> What remains to be considered is therefore
                    the appropriate multiplier, and how that multiplier should be split between the
                    Singapore portion and the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia portion respectively of the
                    loss of future earnings award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Principles for determining the multiplier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Pursuant to the request of this court, the
                    parties did further research on the approaches taken in other common law
                    jurisdictions (namely, England and Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong
                    Kong and Malaysia) in determining the multiplier to be used for assessing
                    damages in personal injury cases, and have helpfully described these approaches.
                    A comparative analysis of these approaches will be made below (at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>). In summary, the Appellants submit that although the
                    Commonwealth courts take different approaches in determining the appropriate
                    multiplier, they all invariably take into account “the
                    [plaintiff’s] age, health/mortality, education, nature of occupation,
                    retirement ages, rates of return, medical evidence and whether the plaintiff is
                    a local or [a] foreign worker”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Respondent, on his part, submits that the
                    high inflation rate in Bangladesh should also be taken into account in
                    determining the multiplier because inflation affects the real rate of return on
                        investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Respondent also refers to the approach in
                    the UK, where actuarial tables are used in determining multipliers (see below at
                        <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>–<a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> He
                    submits, however, that it is not practical to adopt those tables because they
                    were formulated in the light of the circumstances prevailing in the
                        UK.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Respondent has further referred to the
                    multipliers used in various foreign cases.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> In the light of
                    these foreign precedents as well as local precedents,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> the Respondent
                    submits that the multiplier of 17 years adopted by the AR and approved by the
                    Judge (who dismissed the Appellants’ appeal in RA 260/2010) cannot be
                    regarded as excessive, and that in fact, a multiplier higher than 18 years would
                    be warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Relevant factors in determining the multiplier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is common ground between the parties that
                    the task of the court in assessing damages in personal injury cases is to arrive
                    at a lump sum which represents as nearly as possible full compensation for the
                    injuries which the plaintiff has suffered. This means that an award for loss of
                    future income should, as far as reasonably possible, provide the plaintiff with
                    the income that he would have earned but for the accident which caused his
                    injuries (referred to hereafter as “the accident” for short).
                    Therefore, the starting point for determining the appropriate multiplier must be
                    the likely duration, after the trial, for which the plaintiff would have been
                    expected to earn an income but for the accident (see the decision of the Privy
                    Council in <em>Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978)
                        Ltd</em> [1983–1984] SLR(R) 388 (“<em>Lai
                        Wee Lian</em>”) at [20]). The underlying objective in fixing
                    the multiplier is to derive a final award that provides the plaintiff with
                        <em>full compensation</em> to the nearest extent
                    possible (see the House of Lords decision of <em>Wells v Wells
                        and other appeals</em> [1999] 1 AC 345 (“<em>Wells</em>”) at 363).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The duration for which the plaintiff would
                    have been expected to earn an income if not for the accident must, however, be
                    discounted to account for three contingent factors so that the plaintiff will
                    not be over-compensated (see <em>Wells</em> at
                    364–365 and 372):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>First</em>,
                        the plaintiff might well have stopped working for reasons other than the
                        accident (see also <em>Lai Wee Lian</em> at [20]).
                        Admittedly, where there is an <em>agreed</em> life
                        expectancy, that in itself would take into account some contingencies such
                        as premature death (see <em>Wells</em> at
                        378–379). But, that is not all. A discount may also be appropriate,
                        even in the context of an agreed life expectancy, if there is a need to
                        account for other contingencies such as the possibility that the plaintiff
                        might not have been able to find work despite being physically able to
                        work.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Second</em>, the plaintiff will be receiving a lump sum
                        award in advance of the dates when he would have actually received his
                        future income but for the accident (see <em>Lai Wee
                            Lian</em> at [20] and <em>Wells</em> at
                        364–365). Therefore, the multiplier must be discounted to account for
                        the possible investment gains that the plaintiff would be expected to attain
                        as a result of the accelerated receipt of his future
                    earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>Third</em>, the plaintiff should be protected against the
                        effects of future inflation (see <em>Wells</em> at
                        372–373). The real value of the lump sum awarded to the plaintiff will
                        be reduced with time as a result of inflation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Possible approaches for determining the multiplier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     A variety of approaches may be applied to
                    determine the appropriate multiplier (see Wai-Sum Chan &amp; Felix
                    W H Chan, “<em>Lai Wee Lian</em> Revisited
                    – Should actuarial tables be used for the assessment of damages in
                    personal injury litigation in Singapore?” [2000] SJLS 364
                        (“<em>Lai Wee Lian </em><em>Revisited</em>”), especially at pp 367–371, for a
                    summary of some of the possibilities). The possible approaches include the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     One approach is to fix the
                        multiplier by looking at the multipliers used in comparable cases. This is
                        the approach adopted in some Singapore cases (see, for example, <em>Loh Chia Mei v Koh Kok Han</em> [2009] SGHC 181 at
                            [41]). As the
                        Appellants have pointed out,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> this is also the approach
                        taken by the Hong Kong courts (see, <em>eg</em>, the
                        decision of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <em>Chan Pui-ki
                            v Leung On and Another</em> [1996] 2 HKLR 401 at
                        421C–421I).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     Another approach is to apply a pure arithmetical discount. The
                        multiplier may be determined by discounting the plaintiff’s stream of
                        income over his expected working life by an appropriate rate (see <em>Lai Wee Lian </em><em>Revisited</em>
                        at pp 368–370). A further discount may be applied to account for
                        contingencies, which was the approach taken in the Singapore High Court
                        decision of <em>Shaw Linda Gillian v Chai Kang Wei
                            Samuel</em> [2009] SGHC 187 (“<em>Shaw Linda
                            Gillian (HC)</em>”) at [31]. In that case, the High
                        Court judge applied a further discount for “the vicissitudes of
                        life” (at [31]). The defendant’s appeal against the High
                        Court’s decision was allowed in part, but the High Court’s
                        decision on the loss of future earnings award was not disturbed (see
                            <em>Shaw Linda Gillian (CA)</em> at [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     A third approach is to apply a fixed
                        formula. This is the approach adopted in Malaysia by statute (see s 28A
                        of the Civil Law Act 1956 (Act 67) (M’sia)). The Malaysian courts
                        have held that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> the
                        statutory formula is mandatory due to the imperative language of the statute
                        (see <em>Ibrahim bin Ismail &amp; Anor </em><em>v Hasnah </em><em>bte </em><em>Puteh </em><em>Imat (as beneficiary and
                            legal mother of Bakri bin Yahya and substituting Yahaya bin Ibrahim)
                            &amp; Anor and another appeal</em> [2004] 1 MLJ 525 at
                            [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_d"></a>(d)     Yet another approach is to use actuarial tables, as in the UK. This
                        approach merits further explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The English courts use actuarial tables
                    published by the UK Government Actuary’s Department, commonly known as
                    “the Ogden Tables”, to determine the appropriate multiplier (see
                        <em>Wells</em> at 379F and <em>Lai Wee
                        Lian </em><em>Revisited</em> at p 371). The
                    latest version of these tables are the <em>Actuarial Tables with
                        explanatory notes for use in Personal Injury and Fatal Accident
                        Cases</em> (7th Ed, 2011) (“the Ogden Tables
                    (7th Ed)”). The Ogden Tables are “based on a reasonable
                    estimate of the future mortality likely to be experienced by average members of
                    the population alive and are based on projected mortality rates for the United
                    Kingdom as a whole” (see the explanatory notes to the Ogden Tables
                    (7th Ed) at Section A, para 4). The multipliers in the Ogden
                    Tables are also based on the assumption that the lump sum award given to the
                    plaintiff will be invested at an annual rate of return of 2.5% net of tax (see
                    the explanatory notes to the Ogden Tables (7th Ed) at Section A,
                    paras 8–9). This rate is fixed by the Lord Chancellor pursuant to
                    s 1 of the Damages Act 1996 (c 48) (UK) based on an assumed rate of
                    inflation of 3% (see Lord Irvine of Lairg LC, “Setting the
                    Discount Rate: Lord Chancellor’s Reason” (27 July
                    2001)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It should be noted that the Ogden Tables do
                    not take into account risks other than mortality. However, as the Appellants
                    have pointed out,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> the Ogden Tables
                    have, since the sixth edition of these tables, provided a methodology for
                    reducing the multiplier to take into account other contingencies (see the
                    explanatory notes to the Ogden Tables (7th Ed) at Section B, as well
                    as <em>Kemp &amp; Kemp: The Quantum of Damages in Personal Injury
                        and Fatal Accident Claims</em> (William Norris QC gen ed) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, Looseleaf Ed, 2009, Release 120 (August 2011)) at
                    para 10-014).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Ogden Tables have identified three key
                    factors which affect the determination of the discount for contingencies: the
                    plaintiff’s employment status, disability status and educational
                    attainment (see the explanatory notes to the Ogden Tables (7th Ed) at
                    Section B, para 34).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> There may well be other factors
                    which may affect the discount for contingencies. For example, there may be
                    reason to believe that the plaintiff may not have remained employed until the
                    prevailing retirement age due to the nature of his occupation (see <em>Heil v Rankin</em> [2001] PIQR Q3 (reported at (2001)
                    10 PIQR Q16), where the court applied a discount to account for the fact
                    that the plaintiff police officer might not have remained in the police force
                    until the normal retirement age of 50). The sex of the plaintiff may also
                    require a discount to be applied (see <em>M (A Child) v Leeds
                        Health Authority</em> [2002] PIQR Q4 (reported at (2001) 11 PIQR
                    Q46) at [59]–[62], where a 22.5% discount was applied to account,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, for the prospect that the
                    plaintiff, a young girl, might have had to take time off to raise a family; see
                    also <em>Ingrid van Wees v Z Karkour and
                        A Walsh</em> [2007] EWHC 165 at [139], where the court took
                    into account the fact that the plaintiff, being a woman, was “<em>at present</em>” [emphasis added] less likely to earn
                    the same amount as a man, but that her salary was likely to become equal in the
                    future because the prevailing trends suggested that the gap between the salaries
                    of male employees and those of female employees was narrowing).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     At this juncture, we would briefly refer, by
                    way of comparison, to the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand approaches to
                    assessing loss of future earnings. These jurisdictions either do not apply the
                    multiplier/multiplicand approach or apply a variant of that approach:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     The approach in Canada: The
                        Appellants have submitted that the Canadian courts do not apply the
                        multiplier/multiplicand method to assess loss of future
                            earnings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> This is
                        not strictly accurate. In substance, the Canadian approach to assessing loss
                        of future earnings is similar to the multiplier/multiplicand method, except
                        that the discount is not applied to the multiplier. The approach which the
                        Canadian courts take is to estimate the plaintiff’s level of earnings
                        and the length of his working life. Adjustments are then made to these
                        figures to account for contingencies (see <em>J A Andrews, Dorothy Andrews, Ivan Stefanyk v Grand &amp; Toy
                            Alberta Ltd and Robert G Anderson</em> [1978] 2 SCR 229
                            (“<em>Andrews</em>”) at
                        251–253; see also S M Waddams, <em>The Law of
                            Damages</em> (Canada Law Book, Looseleaf Ed, November 2011
                        release) at para 3.720). The following are relevant points when
                        considering the adjustment to be made for contingencies (see <em>Andrews</em> at 253): (i) care must be taken not to
                        adjust for contingencies that have already been taken into consideration in
                        estimating the plaintiff’s projected average level of earnings;
                        (ii) not all contingencies will result in an adjustment adverse to the
                        plaintiff; and (iii) there may be public and private schemes which
                        cushion the plaintiff against adverse contingencies. The extent of the
                        adjustment will depend on the circumstances of the case, in particular, on
                        the nature of the plaintiff’s occupation (see <em>Andrews</em> at 253).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     The approach in Australia: The Australian approach is
                        also a variant of the multiplier/multiplicand method. As the Appellants have
                        submitted, that approach may be represented by the formula “[(M x T)
                        – V] <em>x</em> n%”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original],
                        where “M” is the multiplicand, “T” is the
                        plaintiff’s expected working life but for the accident,
                        “V” is the factor by which the award should be reduced to
                        account for contingencies and “<em>x</em>” represents the function of discounting the resulting
                        figure by “n”, which is the discount rate to account for
                        accelerated receipt of a lump sum (see Francis Trindade, Peter Cane &amp;
                        Mark Lunney, <em>The Law of Torts in Australia</em>
                        (Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Trindade, Cane &amp; </em><em>Lunney</em>”) at pp 715–716). The discount for
                        contingencies (<em>ie</em>, “V” in the
                        aforesaid formula) is typically applied in the form of a percentage
                        reduction (see <em>Trindade, Cane &amp; </em><em>Lunney</em> at p 716). The typical discount applied
                        by the courts varies from State to State (see <em>Trindade,
                            Cane &amp; </em><em>Lunney</em> at
                        p 716, note 40, which gives the example of the 15% discount
                        typically applied in New South Wales). As the Appellants have
                            stated,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> for the
                        discount to account for accelerated receipt of a lump sum (<em>ie</em>, “n” in the above formula), the
                        High Court of Australia has stipulated that in States where a discount rate
                        is not fixed by statute, a fixed rate of 3% should be used (see <em>Todorovic and another v Waller</em> (1981) 150 CLR
                        402 at 423–424 (<em>per</em> Gibbs CJ and
                        Wilson J), 451 (<em>per</em> Mason J), 460
                            (<em>per</em> Aickin J) and 480–481
                            (<em>per</em> Brennan J)). Most States have
                        fixed a higher rate (see <em>Trindade, Cane &amp;
                            </em><em>Lunney</em> at
                    p 717).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        approach in New Zealand: New Zealand has adopted a no-fault accident
                        compensation scheme which is “markedly different from the way in
                        which damages are awarded in the other [Commonwealth]
                            jurisdictions”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>
                        (see Peter H Schuck, “Tort Reform, Kiwi-Style” (2008)
                        Yale Law &amp; Policy Review 187 at pp 188–191 for a concise
                        description of the scheme and its origins).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The approach that should be adopted in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In a sense, it may be more objective to use
                    actuarial tables because they are based on projections of the mortality rate of
                    the general population. They provide a more scientific basis for discounting a
                    lump sum award to account for premature death. Adjustments may also be made for
                    contingencies by using actuarial data. However, such actuarial tables are not
                    generally available in Singapore. Requiring the preparation of such tables as a
                    matter of practice for every case might inordinately raise costs and prolong the
                    resolution of disputes. What is clear is that it would not be appropriate for
                    our courts to adopt the Ogden Tables because the latter are based on projected
                    mortality rates in the UK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the absence of actuarial tables, it seems
                    to us that the approaches alluded to above at [48(a)]–[48(b)], with
                    adjustments for contingencies (where appropriate) and inflation, are the next
                    most appropriate approaches. A pure arithmetical discount will adjust the lump
                    sum award to account for accelerated receipt. Inflation can be taken into
                    account by using <em>real</em> interest rates (<em>ie</em>, interest rates adjusted for inflation) in the
                    arithmetical discount. Further adjustment may be necessary to account for other
                    contingencies. Any further adjustment of this nature will necessarily be based
                    on the particular facts and circumstances of the case. In order to ensure that
                    awards are consistent, the courts should also consider the multipliers used in
                    comparable cases. That said, a blind adherence to the multipliers in previous
                    cases is not desirable. The court should consider in each case whether the
                    previous cases are truly comparable, and should not hesitate to depart from the
                    multipliers used in previous cases if the circumstances call for
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In this regard, we note that the
                    considerations which feature in the Ogden Tables and/or which are taken into
                    account in Commonwealth cases are not unique to the situations in those
                    jurisdictions and could well, in particular circumstances, be relevant to the
                    Singapore courts. After all, ultimately, the objective of the court in each case
                    is to make an award to the plaintiff which would fairly compensate him for the
                    losses which he has suffered on account of the injuries sustained by him. The
                    considerations which feature in the Ogden Tables and/or in Commonwealth cases
                    include (see generally <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> above and
                        <em>Andrews</em> at 253):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff’s employment
                        status;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        plaintiff’s pre-existing illnesses or disabilities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff’s educational
                        attainment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        plaintiff’s sex; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_e"></a>(e)     the possibility of a depression in the economy,
                        “changes in industrial emphasis” (<em>per</em> the High Court of Australia in <em>Wynn v
                            NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation</em> (1995) 184 CLR 485
                        at 497) and industrial disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Of course, the above considerations are not
                    exhaustive. For example, the need to discount an award to account for
                    accelerated receipt of a lump sum might assume added significance where the
                    plaintiff is a foreigner. This factor was given consideration in <em>Shaw Linda Gillian (HC)</em> at [31], where the court took
                    cognisance of the fact that higher interest rates were available in Australia as
                    compared to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Application to the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It was common ground at the assessment hearing
                    that the Respondent would have worked for a further period of 38 years but for
                    the Accident. This figure was arrived at on the basis that the Appellants
                    accepted that the Respondent, who was aged 27 at the time of the Accident (see
                        <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above), would have worked up to the
                    age of 65.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>
                    This means that at the time of the assessment hearing, the Respondent would have
                    worked for a further 36 years if not for the Accident. An appropriate discount
                    must be made to account for possible investment gains that the Respondent would
                    be expected to make as a result of the accelerated receipt of his lifetime
                    income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Unfortunately, there is no evidence on the
                    record of the deposit interest rates and inflation rates in Bangladesh. Hence,
                    we are unable to assess the correctness of the AR’s choice of the
                    multiplier against the approach of applying an arithmetical discount with
                    further adjustments for other contingencies as well as with reference to
                    comparable case precedents (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In passing, we would observe that assuming we
                    had evidence of the real interest rates in Bangladesh, we would have applied a
                    further discount to account for other contingencies, even though the parties
                    have agreed that the Respondent would, but for the Accident, have worked for a
                    further 36 years at the time of the assessment hearing. Such further discount is
                    appropriate in order to account for other contingencies. In our opinion, those
                    relevant to the present case would have included the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>First</em>,
                        the nature of the Respondent’s job at the time of the Accident should
                        have been considered. As the Respondent was a foreign construction worker,
                        it is not likely that he would have worked as a construction worker in
                        Singapore for the remainder of his working life. As this court stated in
                            <em>Tan Woei Jinn v Thapjang </em><em>Amorthap and another</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 553 at
                            [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… Foreign workers like the plaintiff may not spend their entire
                            working lives in Singapore. They may return home to be with, or start,
                            their families. They may return with their savings from their earnings
                            to start their own businesses. They may also be replaced by cheaper and
                            younger workers, or their work permits may not be renewed. When they
                            leave, they will not continue to get earnings at Singapore levels, and
                            any award for lost future earnings should take this into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Second</em>, the possibility that the Respondent might
                        have lost his job due to changing economic conditions should have been taken
                        into account. For example, the Respondent’s employment could have been
                        terminated due to a downturn in the construction sector. Of course, this is
                        not to say that the Respondent could not, in that scenario, have obtained a
                        lower paying job in another area of work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Given the state of the evidence, we are left
                    with the approach of considering the multipliers used in comparable cases (see
                    [48(a)] above). In this regard, we note that the multiplier of 17 years adopted
                    by the AR is consistent with the multipliers used in the comparable cases
                    outlined below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>Teo Seng Kiat
                            v Goh </em><em>Hwa Teck</em> [2003]
                        1 SLR(R) 333 at [14], a multiplier of 18 years was applied in respect of the
                        plaintiff, who was injured at the age of 28.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>Teo Sing Keng
                            </em><em>and another v Sim Ban Kiat</em>
                        [1994] 1 SLR(R) 340 (cited in <em>Practitioners’
                            Library</em> at p 651), a multiplier of 15 years was applied
                        in respect of the plaintiff, who was injured at the age of 25 and, as a
                        result, permanently disabled (the plaintiff became tetraparetic, and also
                        had bowel as well as urinary problems). It should be noted that the
                        multiplier of 15 years was agreed to by the parties before the assistant
                        registrar hearing the assessment of damages (at [8(d)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>Lim Yee Ming v
                            Ubin Lagoon Resort Pte Ltd and Others (Adventure Training Systems Pty
                            Ltd, Third Party)</em> [2003] SGHC 134 at [80] (cited in
                            <em>Practitioners’ Library</em> at
                        p 653), a multiplier of 15 years was applied in respect of the
                        plaintiff, a female, who was injured at the age of 26 and, consequently,
                        permanently disabled (the plaintiff suffered from paralysis from the waist
                        down, bowel and urinary problems as well as loss of sexual
                    function).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the
                        unreported case of <em>Maung </em><em>Tun </em><em>Aung v Goh </em><em>Beng Hwee</em> Suit No 284 of 2000
                        (Registrar’s Appeal No 175 of 2001) (cited in <em>Practitioners’ Library</em> at p 675), a multiplier of
                        17 years was applied (broken down into nine years for the multiplicand of
                        $2,000 per month, six years for the multiplicand of $3,000 per month and two
                        years for the multiplicand of $2,000 per month) in respect of the plaintiff,
                        who was injured at the age of 24 and became permanently paralysed, resulting
                        in inability to control his urinary and bowel functions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Of course, in considering precedents for the purposes of obtaining assistance
                    to determine the appropriate multiplier in a specific case, noting the age of
                    the plaintiff alone may not be enough. What is perhaps more important is the
                    likely number of remaining working years which the plaintiff would have had but
                    for the accident. In the present case, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above, the Appellants agreed before the AR that if not for
                    the Accident, the Respondent would have worked until the age of 65,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> not unlike the age up to which a
                    Singaporean would normally work. Thus, precedents involving Singaporeans
                    (including permanent residents) would be appropriate comparisons. Accordingly,
                    the multiplier of 17 years adopted by the AR in the present case is clearly not
                    out of line with the relevant precedents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     There remains one consequential issue on this
                    head of claim which we ought to address. On their contention that the
                    appropriate multiplier should only be 14 years, the Appellants have submitted
                    that the multiplier should be split into four years and ten years in respect of
                    the Singapore portion and the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia portion respectively of
                    the loss of future earnings award. Since we have rejected the Appellants’
                    argument that the multiplier should only be 14 years, what remains for us to
                    decide is whether the apportionment made by the AR –
                    <em>viz</em>, seven years for the Singapore portion and ten
                    years for the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia portion<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> – is fair. Here, we would quote what
                    the AR stated to be her basis for making this apportionment:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am mindful that the Plaintiff [<em>viz</em>, the Respondent] has worked without any complaints from
                        his Singapore employers so far. The Plaintiff’s evidence is that he
                        came to work in Singapore because the pay was better here, than in Saudi
                        Arabia where he last worked. The Defendant [<em>viz</em>, the Appellants] has not led any evidence showing any
                        complaint against the Plaintiff’s work performance. In the
                        circumstances, I am prepared to accept that the Plaintiff has satisfied me,
                        on a balance of probabilities, that he would have worked in Singapore for
                        the full 15 years and he would have been allowed to under our employment
                        regulations, had the [A]ccident not happened.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accepting that the Plaintiff would have lost 38 years of working life as a
                        result of the [A]ccident, and if the Plaintiff would have been able to work
                        [for] another 14 years in Singapore if not for the [A]ccident, a fair
                        apportionment in this case will be – 7 years at the Singapore rate
                        … and 10 years at the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia rate …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">No argument has been advanced by the Appellants to show that the above
                    apportionment by the AR of the multiplier of 17 years is in any way improper or
                    unjust. Accordingly, there is no ground for us to interfere with this
                    apportionment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Our ruling on the loss of future earnings award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As the Appellants have accepted that the
                    multiplicands for the Singapore portion and the Bangladesh/Saudi Arabia portion
                    of the loss of future earnings award should be $800 per month and $500 per month
                    respectively, and as the Appellants’ objections to the AR’s award
                    for loss of future earnings relate solely to the appropriate multiplier, which
                    objections we have found to be without merit, we likewise uphold the AR’s
                    award for this head of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Future medical expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     With regard to the award for future medical
                    expenses, we have at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above stated that
                    the Appellants are precluded from challenging this award because they agreed at
                    the assessment hearing to use the evidence of the Singapore doctors (<em>ie</em>, Dr Tow and Dr Swami) as the basis for
                    calculating the appropriate quantum to award the Respondent. However, for
                    completeness and on the basis that the Appellants are not so precluded, we will
                    proceed to examine whether, on the evidence, the award made by the AR for this
                    head of claim is justified. In this regard, for the purposes of determining
                    whether a particular medical expense is reasonable, the court will consider a
                    range of circumstances including, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    whether or not the particular treatment in question is necessary and whether or
                    not it was taken pursuant to a doctor’s advice (see UK Law Commission,
                        <em>Damages for Personal Injury: Medical, Nursing and Other
                        Expenses; Collateral Benefits</em> (Law Com No 262, 1999)
                    (Chairman: Robert Carnwath) at para 2.2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In the present case, the Respondent is a
                    Bangladeshi national who has returned to his home country and is receiving
                    medical treatment there. It follows, as a matter of logic and common sense, that
                    the cost of medical care in his home country should be the basis upon which to
                    calculate the multiplicand to be used in determining the amount to be awarded
                    for future medical expenses. This follows from the principle that a defendant is
                    liable to a plaintiff as he finds the latter (see, for example, <em>Ho Soo Fong and another v Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 181 at [65], where this court referred to “the general tort
                    principle that the tortfeasor must take his victim as he is”).
                    Admittedly, the cost of medical care in the home country of a foreign plaintiff
                    could be either higher or lower than that in Singapore. However, it is clear
                    that a foreign plaintiff would be adequately compensated, and not over- or
                    under-compensated, only when the multiplicand for future medical expenses is
                    calculated on the basis of the likely actual cost of medical care in his own
                    country.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As in the case where the cost of medical
                    treatment in Singapore is being determined, the cost of medical treatment in a
                    foreign country will have to be established by evidence and, in all likelihood,
                    expert evidence may be necessary. Where expert evidence is adduced, the court
                    must not “blindly accept” such evidence simply because it is not
                    contradicted (see <em>Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading
                        as Caesars Palace)</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1129 (“<em>Poh Soon Kiat</em>”) at [22]). The court must evaluate
                    the expert’s evidence in the light of the objective facts and by reference
                    to the usual criteria for assessing evidence. As the High Court stated in
                        <em>Sakthivel </em><em>Punithavathi v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 at [76] (cited by this court
                    in <em>Poh Soon Kiat</em> at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is axiomatic is that a judge is not entitled to substitute his own
                        views for those of an uncontradicted expert’s: <em>Saeng-Un Udom v PP</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 1. Be that as it
                        may, a <em>court must not on the other hand
                            unquestioningly</em><b><em></em></b><em>accept unchallenged evidence</em>.
                        Evidence must invariably be sifted, weighed and evaluated in the context of
                        the factual matrix and in particular, the objective facts. An expert’s
                        opinion <em>“should not fly in the face of proven
                            extrinsic facts relevant to the matter” per</em> Yong Pung
                        How CJ in <em>Khoo James v Gunapathy d/o
                            Muniandy</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 414 at [65]. In reality,
                        substantially the same rules apply to the evaluation of expert testimony as
                        they would to other categories of witness testimony. <em>Content credibility</em>, <em>evidence of
                            partiality</em>, <em>coherence</em> and a
                        need to analyse the evidence <em>in the context of
                            established facts</em> remain vital considerations; <em>demeanour, however, more often than not recedes into the
                            background</em> as a yardstick. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Appellants have made the following points
                    in relation to the award for future medical expenses:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     The best available evidence of the
                        cost of the Respondent’s future medical care is the cost of obtaining
                        such care from medical facilities in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     At the assessment hearing, the
                        Respondent provided evidence of the rates of medical fees in
                            Bangladesh<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> based on
                        the rates of Apollo Hospital (“the Apollo Hospital Rates”),
                        which, according to the evidence of Dr Swami, is a premier

                        there is no need to rely on the rates of medical fees in

                        accelerated receipt of a lump sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The first observation we would make in
                    relation to the above points raised by the Appellants is that it was the
                    Appellants who objected, at a hearing prior to the assessment hearing proper, to
                    the admission of the Apollo Hospital Rates because Dr Waheed Zaman
                    (“Dr Zaman”) of Apollo Hospital, who had provided those rates
                    in a letter, could not testify due to Apollo Hospital’s policy of not
                    allowing its specialists to involve themselves in any legal proceedings
                    concerning its patients (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                        above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>
                    Now, the Appellants are changing their minds and singing a different tune. If
                    the Appellants had not insisted on the personal attendance of Dr Zaman at
                    the assessment hearing, the Apollo Hospital Rates would have been admitted into
                    evidence, and those rates would have been relied upon by the AR to determine the
                    quantum to be awarded for future medical expenses. It is too late now for the
                    Appellants to ask this court to apply the Apollo Hospital Rates. Our second
                    observation is that it was precisely because of the Appellants’ objection
                    to the admission of the Apollo Hospital Rates without Dr Zaman personally
                    giving evidence at the assessment hearing that the Respondent called Dr Tow
                    and Dr Swami to testify. Dr Tow gave evidence on what would be the
                    likely medical costs if the Respondent were to be treated in Singapore.
                    Dr Swami testified that in his view, if Dr Tow’s Rates were
                    reduced by two-thirds, that would represent the likely costs of medical
                    treatment in Bangladesh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> No contrary
                    evidence was presented to the AR by the Appellants. To put it at the lowest, no
                    objection was made by the Appellants to what Dr Tow and Dr Swami
                    testified. We quote again the relevant portion of the evidence recorded by the
                    AR (reproduced earlier at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Looking at the evidence adduced, in terms of the medical care rates
                            used in Bangladesh, the hospital in question is Apollo [H]ospital. The
                            evidence from Dr Swami is that Apollo [H]ospital was [a] premier
                            hospital in Bangladesh. It does not approximate to B1 rates. Also, we do
                            not have enough evidence on the rates chargeable in Bangladesh. The main
                            evidence we have in this case is the evidence of Dr Tow and
                            Dr Swami – Dr Tow’s estimation is
                            $500,000–$600,000, and Dr Swami’s evidence for
                            Bangladesh overall, is that a discount of 35% should be given from
                            Singapore rates, generally speaking.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To reiterate what we pointed out at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above, the above extract shows that it was the <em>Appellants’ counsel</em> (denoted as
                    “D/C” above) who proposed to use the evidence of the Singapore
                    doctors (<em>ie</em>, Dr Tow and Dr Swami) to
                    arrive at the figure for the cost of future medical expenses in view of the lack
                    of evidence of the future medical costs likely to be incurred by the Respondent
                    in Bangladesh. The AR asked the Respondent’s counsel (denoted as
                    “P/C” above) if she agreed to this proposal. The
                    Respondent’s counsel replied in the affirmative. After ascertaining that
                    both the Appellants’ counsel and the Respondent’s counsel were
                    “prepared to go along with Dr Tow[’s] and
                    Dr Swami’s evidence”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> the AR selected the upper end of
                    Dr Tow’s Rates (<em>ie</em>, $600,000) and
                    applied the discount of 35% to that figure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Now, what the Appellants are arguing (in their
                    alternative argument set out at [66(d)] above) is that before applying the
                    discount of 35% (as testified by Dr Swami) to Dr Tow’s Rates,
                    there should be a prior discount of Dr Tow’s Rates by 50% to account
                    for the vicissitudes of life and accelerated receipt of a lump sum. We note,
                    however, that this prior discount of 50% was never put to either Dr Tow or
                    Dr Swami. Moreover, it is unclear whether or not Dr Tow incorporated a
                    discount for accelerated receipt of a lump sum and contingencies in coming up
                    with her estimate of the Respondent’s likely future medical costs if he
                    were to be treated in Singapore. The fact is that Dr Tow was not asked
                    specifically if her figures took into account accelerated receipt of a lump sum
                    and contingencies. Thus, Dr Tow was never given an opportunity to explain
                    how she had derived her figures. All we have on the record is that both the
                    Appellants and the Respondent were comfortable with Dr Tow’s Rates
                    and the 35% discount suggested by Dr Swami. In the light of this state of
                    the evidence, the AR was certainly entitled to rule in the way that she did and
                    we are unable to say that the award which she made for future medical expenses
                    is manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Future transport and care expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     We now move on to consider the last of the
                    disputed heads of claim, namely, the claim for future transport and care
                    expenses (as defined at [9(d)] above). The only issue which the Appellants are
                    raising on these items relates to the multiplier used by the AR, which was 18
                    years; there is no dispute as to the multiplicands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The contention of the Appellants is that
                    instead of 18 years, the multiplier should only be 14 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent’s answer to this is that a multiplier of 18 years is not
                    inordinately high, given that the Respondent was only 29 years of age at the
                    time of the assessment hearing and bearing in mind that the normal lifespan of a
                    male is 70 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It might <em>prima
                        facie</em> appear that the multiplier used to determine the
                    appropriate award for future transport and care expenses should, as a matter of
                    logic, be higher than the multiplier used to determine the appropriate award for
                    loss of future earnings, given that the multiplier for the former award is based
                    on the plaintiff’s life expectancy (see <em>Ang Leng Hock v
                        Leo Ee Ah</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 361 at [59]), whereas the
                    multiplier for the latter award is based on the plaintiff’s remaining
                    working life if not for the accident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> However, it should be noted that
                    the multiplier for future transport and care expenses is determined on the basis
                    of the plaintiff’s current life expectancy <em>in the light
                        of his injuries</em>. In contrast, the multiplier for loss of future
                    earnings is determined on the basis of the plaintiff’s working life
                        <em>before his injuries</em>. A plaintiff who has
                    sustained serious injuries, such as the Respondent in the present appeal, may
                    well have expected to have had a working life longer than his <em>current</em> life expectancy. In fact, as will be seen, the evidence
                    at the assessment hearing was that the Respondent’s life expectancy is now
                    shorter than the duration of his expected remaining working life if not for the
                    Accident. Before the AR, the Appellants agreed that the Respondent would have
                    worked until the age of 65 if not for the Accident, giving the Respondent a
                    remaining working life of 36 years at the time of the assessment hearing (see
                        <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above). Dr Tow’s
                    evidence was that an average Singaporean male would live until the age of
                        70,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> and that a paraplegic would have 90%
                    of that life expectancy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> The
                    Appellants accepted Dr Tow’s evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> In doing so, they appeared to have assumed
                    that an average Bangladeshi male has the same life expectancy as an average
                    Singaporean male, and that the same 10% reduction in life expectancy as a result
                    of paraplegia is applicable to a Bangladeshi male paraplegic. Applying a
                    discount of 10% to 70 years, the Respondent would at present be expected to live
                    to the age of 63.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>
                    This means that at the time of the assessment hearing, the Respondent was
                    expected to live for a further 34 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     We note that it might appear to be incongruous
                    for the AR to have used a multiplier of only 17 years for the loss of future
                    earnings award, but a <em>higher</em> multiplier of 18
                    years for the future transport and care expenses award when, at the time of the
                    assessment hearing, the Respondent’s life expectancy (<em>viz</em>, 34 years) was <em>shorter</em> than
                    the duration of his expected remaining working life if not for the Accident
                        (<em>viz</em>, 36 years). One would have expected that
                    a higher multiplier should have been used for the loss of future earnings award
                    since the Respondent was expected to have worked for a longer duration (but for
                    the Accident) than the duration for which he is now expected to live. However,
                    nothing turns on the incongruity. At best, it would suggest that perhaps, an
                    even higher multiplier should have been used for the loss of future earnings
                    award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As was the case <em>vis-à-vis</em> the loss of future earnings award, we are constrained
                    by the evidence to adopt the approach of considering the multipliers used in
                    comparable cases (see <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> above) as we do
                    not have evidence of the real interest rates in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In our view, the multiplier that the AR
                    adopted (<em>viz</em>, 18 years) is in line with the
                    multipliers used in comparable cases. This can be seen from, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea
                        Heidi and another appeal</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 543, where this
                    court used a multiplier of 17 years for the future medical expenses to be
                    awarded to a plaintiff who was 27 years old at the time of her injury. The court
                    reached this decision by examining the multipliers used for awards for future
                    medical expenses in analogous cases. In particular, the focus of the court
                    appeared to be on the age of the plaintiff in each of the analogous cases, as
                    can be seen from the following extract:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">182    The [High Court] judge provided for a multiplier

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">183    The appellants [<em>ie</em>,

                            similar multipliers were given. The first of these is a case which we
                            have referred to earlier in this judgment, <em>Lim Yee
                                Ming v Ubin Lagoon Resort Pte Ltd</em> ([[2003] SGHC 134]).
                            The judge provided for a multiplier of <em>15
                                years</em> for the <em>26-year-old
                                plaintiff</em>. In the second case, <em>Ng Song
                                Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd</em>
                            [1997] SGHC 289, the judge awarded the <em>29-year-old</em> plaintiff a multiplier of <em>17 years</em>. In yet another case, <em>Teo
                                Seng Kiat v Goh </em><em>Hwa Teck</em>
                            [2003] 1 SLR(R) 333, the judge determined that a multiplier of
                                <em>18 years</em> was appropriate for the
                            plaintiff, who was <em>28 years old</em> at the
                            time of the accident. We also had regard to the case of <em>Chen Qingrui v Phua </em><em>Geok
                                Leng</em> ([[2001] SGHC 64]), wherein the female plaintiff
                            aged <em>18 years</em> was awarded a multiplier of
                                <em>18 years</em> for nursing
                        care.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">184    We have not come across a case where a multiplier
                            as high as 34 has been awarded, and Andrea was not able to cite even one
                            instance of such a case. She attempted to argue that this present case
                            presents a unique factual matrix, thus justifying the award of a
                            particularly high multiplier. We are not in the least convinced by this
                            argument since the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs in the cases
                            mentioned above are, at the very least, comparable to
                            Andrea’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">185    
              <em>Considering that Andrea was 27
                                years old when her liver failed, and that the plaintiffs in the
                                cases we have just detailed were also in the same age
                                range</em>, we think that a multiplier of 17 years is more
                            appropriate and order accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     There are also unreported cases which adopted
                    similar multipliers for future medical expenses. In <em>Chin Swey
                        Min (a patient suing by his wife and next friend Lim Siew Lee)
                        </em><em>v Nor Nizar </em><em>Bin
                        Mohamed</em> [2004] SGHC 27, where the plaintiff was 42 years of age
                    at the time of the assessment of damages, a multiplier of 16 years was applied
                    in respect of future medical expenses. Similarly, in <em>Ng Song
                        Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd and Bayer (Singapore)
                        Private Limited</em> [1997] SGHC 289, where the plaintiff was 32 years
                    of age at the time of the assessment of damages, a multiplier of 17 years was
                    adopted for future medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     All said, the determination of the appropriate
                    multiplier for future transport and care expenses (and, for that matter, the
                    appropriate multiplier for future medical expenses) is not a science. It is not
                    something that can be reflected in a mathematical formula. In a worst-case
                    scenario where the plaintiff will require lifelong medical and/or nursing care,
                    precedents show that there is a range as to the appropriate multiplier,
                    depending on the age of the plaintiff at the time of the assessment of damages.
                    In the present case, a multiplier of 18 years in respect of a plaintiff aged 29
                    at the time of the assessment of damages cannot be said to be
                excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     For the above reasons, <em>vis-à-vis</em> Issue 3, the Appellants have not persuaded us
                    that any of the awards for the disputed heads of claim should be varied. As we
