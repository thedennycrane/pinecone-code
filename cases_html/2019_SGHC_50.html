The joint venture, POC-CT JV, was awarded the sub-contract to carry out such works by the main contractor, which was said to be Penta-Ocean itself.

</div>
</div>  The defendant believed that it was entitled to take such action on behalf of the POC-CT JV.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendant expected that the payment claim would be disputed by Penta-Ocean, which would then necessitate the commencement of adjudication proceedings under the provisions of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SOPA”).  It was estimated that this would take a few months to be resolved.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Hence, the applications filed on 7 February 2019 seek to stay all further proceedings in the CWU applications until “after POC-CT JV’s claim made by way of Payment Claim No. 44 dated 5 February 2019 has been resolved either by agreement between the [d]efendant and [Penta-Ocean] or by an adjudication determination under the [SOPA]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 On this basis, Mr Rai asked me to adjourn the CWU 270/2018 until the end of April 2019, when the court could then take stock of the situation and decide whether a further adjournment was necessary and, if so, for how long.  This is because, it was argued, the court would probably be in a better position at that time to decide when it was likely that payment would be made by Penta-Ocean to the POC-CT JV and then to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I was unpersuaded that this was a sufficient reason to grant an adjournment of CWU 270/2018.  First of all, it was not disputed that the defendant was in dire financial straits.  It was facing multiple claims and five other winding-up applications.  Mr Ng informed me that there were more than 20 lawsuits pending against the defendant.  Any delay in the winding-up of the defendant would permit it to continue incurring debts in the course of its business when it was already clearly insolvent.  I also noted the point made by Mr Ng, on behalf of the plaintiff, that the defendant had not made any proposals for payment of its debts to its creditors, which were found to be acceptable.  Nor had the defendant offered to provide any security to its creditors.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22  As for the dispute between the defendant and Penta-Ocean, no reason was furnished on affidavit as to why adjudication proceedings were only now being contemplated when the defendant was already in serious financial trouble since October 2018, if not earlier.  I only have Mr Rai’s explanation from the bar that the defendant had been trying to resolve its issues with Penta-Ocean amicably.  He also could not provide any clarity as to when the dispute was likely to be resolved and payment received by the POC-CT JV.  Even if payment is received by the POC-CT JV, there is the additional issue of when the defendant would receive its share of the payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I could not agree to adjourn CWU 270/2018 on an indefinite basis.  That was effectively what the defendant wanted me to do since the request for an adjournment to the end of April 2019 was not expected to be the final one.  Instead, as Mr Rai accepted, a further adjournment would in all likelihood be needed if Penta-Ocean protracted its payment dispute with the POC-CT JV through the court process after the adjudication determination is obtained.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Further, I had doubts as to the correctness of the approach taken by the defendant in unilaterally purporting to serve a payment claim on behalf of the POC-CT JV.  Mr Rai informed me that the JV was not an incorporated entity but an arrangement between the defendant and Penta-Ocean that was governed by a Joint Venture Agreement dated 25 April 2015 (“JVA”).

</div>  When I queried Mr Rai whether the terms of the JVA permitted the defendant to serve payment claims on behalf of both parties to the joint venture, he was not able to provide me with any satisfactory answer, other than to assert that the defendant would be taking the position that it could do so if its authority to act on behalf of the other joint venture party was challenged in the adjudication proceedings.  Given this, I was concerned that it would not be a straightforward process at all for the defendant to be able to recover what was due to it from the joint venture with Penta-Ocean.  From what I was being told, it was obvious that the relationship between the defendant and Penta-Ocean had soured and, in this regard, I noted that disputes under the JVA are to be referred to arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I asked Mr Rai whether the defendant had considered other statutory remedies available to insolvent companies in the situation that the defendant has found itself in.  I had in mind the judicial management regime.  That could be appropriate for a company that might be successfully rehabilitated whether through the infusion of new capital or otherwise, even though it is presently unable to pay its debts as they fell due.  Surprisingly, Mr Rai informed me that the defendant had already considered and dismissed the possibility of applying for judicial management.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Finally, Mr Rai also argued that the defendant should be given an opportunity to fend off a winding-up order because it has an established track record as a contractor in Singapore, having worked on several large projects in the past.  He submitted that this was a public policy consideration that the court should take into account.  I was unable to accept this submission.  Quite to the contrary, it would not be in the public interest for the court to permit a heavily insolvent company to carry on its business operations and keep its debtors waiting indefinitely for any prospect of recovery.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the circumstances, I was not satisfied that sufficient grounds had been furnished by the defendant for the court to exercise its discretion to adjourn CWU 270/2018 until the end of April 2019.  As there was no dispute at all that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff for the amount claimed, I ordered that the defendant be wound-up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The other winding-up applications referred to at [9] to [13] were subsequently adjourned on 13 February 2019, at the request of the applying creditors, until the determination of the appeal against my orders made in CWU 270/2018.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"><br/>John Ng (AsiaLegal LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Ashok Kumar Rai (Eversheds Harry Elias LLP) for the defendant;<br/>Beverly Wee (Insolvency &amp; Public Trustee’s Office) for the official receiver;<br/>Assomull Madan (Assomull &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff in HC/CWU 242/2018;<br/>Alvin Sia (LIMN Law Corporation) for the plaintiff in HC/CWU 269/2018;<br/>Adly Rizal (Tito Isaac &amp; Co LLP) for the plaintiff in HC/CWU 273/2018;<br/>Chua Cheng Yew (Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim LLC) for the plaintiff in HC/CWU 275/2018;<br/>Rachel Tan (Clasis LLC) for the plaintiff in HC/CWU 276/2018;<br/>Tan Yew Teck (TYT Law Practice) for the supporting creditor, Fine Build (E&amp;C) Pte Ltd, in HC/CWU 269/2018 and HC/CWU 270/2018;<br/>Lim Bee Li (Optimus Chambers LLC) for the supporting creditor, Buildo Engineering Pte Ltd in HC/CWU 242/2018, HC/CWU 269/2018, HC/CWU 270/2018, HC/CWU 273/2018, HC/CWU 275/2018 and HC/CWU 276/2018;<br/>Grismond Tien (Infinitus Law Corporation) for the supporting creditor, NSL Fuel Management Services Pte Ltd, in HC/CWU 242/2018, HC/CWU 269/2018 and HC/CWU 270/2018;<br/>Charlene Cheam (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the supporting creditors, Eng Lee Equipment Pte Ltd and P-Four (2007) Pte Ltd in HC/CWU 269/2018 and HC/CWU 270/2018. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
