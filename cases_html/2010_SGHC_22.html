        Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerned the recovery of sums already
                    paid under a contract, and a counterclaim to recover further sums due under the
                    same contract. On 10 December 2009, I delivered oral judgment dismissing
                    both the main action and the defendant’s counterclaim. This written
                    judgment sets out the detailed reasons for my decision. It will also revisit the
                    legal principles governing an action for an agreed sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Indulge Food Pte Ltd
                    (“Indulge”), is a holding company. The defendant, Torabi Marashi
                    Bahram (“Marashi”), a businessman, was the founder and managing
                    director of Euoro International Pte Ltd (“Euoro”), a company that
                    was, at the material time, in the business of selling herbal products and fruit
                    and floral teas. On 2 November 2006, Indulge, Marashi and Euoro entered
                    into a tripartite share subscription agreement (“the Subscription
                    Agreement”). In the Subscription Agreement, Indulge agreed to invest $1m
                    in Euoro in return for 50% of Euoro’s shares plus one share. The
                    investment was to be made in four tranches of $250,000 each. Notably, the
                    business aspect of the agreement envisaged joint efforts by Indulge, Marashi and
                    Euoro to expand Euoro’s business, both within and outside
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Indulge paid the first two tranches totalling
                    $500,000 to Euoro but did not pay the third and fourth tranches. Both before
                    litigation and during the trial, Indulge justified its refusal to pay on the
                    ground of Marashi and Euoro’s non-compliance with the conditions precedent
                    to the payment of the third tranche set out in cl 3.4 of the Subscription
                    Agreement. A failure to satisfy the conditions precedent in cl 3.4 would
                    not only entitle Indulge to refuse to pay the third and fourth tranches to
                    Euoro, it would also allow Indulge to terminate the Subscription Agreement and
                    recover from Marashi the first two tranches already paid out to Euoro. Marashi
                    denied that he was in breach of cl 3.4 of the Subscription Agreement, and
                    in further response, Marashi brought a counterclaim against Indulge for payment
                    to Euoro of the third and fourth tranches totalling $500,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the course of the trial, it became apparent
                    that Indulge’s true grievance was with Marashi’s management of
                    Euoro. It was alleged, amongst other things, that Marashi was contractually
                    obliged to apply Indulge’s cash injection towards the opening of new
                    herbal stores and stores-in-stores, but had instead wrongly used the first and
                    second tranches to pay Euoro’s existing creditors. It was obvious from the
                    management accounts for the financial year 2007 that not much of the $500,000
                    paid to Euoro was left by end April 2007. It was not surprising that Indulge
                    attempted to negotiate a Supplemental Deed with Marashi and Euoro to, <em>inter alia</em>, protect the second half a million dollars of
                    its investment. The Supplemental Deed was never signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the witness box, Marashi confirmed that Euoro
                    had, in fact, ceased business in August 2008, less than two years after the
                    conclusion of the Subscription Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> After closing
                    submissions were tendered, both sides were directed to submit on the relevance
                    of Euoro’s cessation of business on the counterclaim and Euoro’s
                    consequent inability to implement (through Marashi) its obligation under
                    cl 7.2 to, <em>inter alia</em>, use its best
                    endeavours to grow its revenues by implementing the business plan in Annex A of
                    the Subscription Agreement (which principally entailed the opening of more
                    stores). In the same correspondence, the parties were also directed to explain
                    the absence of Euoro as a party in the present proceedings. Essentially, counsel
                    for Marashi, Mr Harish Kumar, submitted that Euoro was entitled to recover
                    the third and fourth tranches upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
                    to payment of the third tranche and then the fourth tranche which would follow
                    from the payment of the third tranche. Euoro’s cessation of the business,
                    Mr Kumar argued, was attributed to Indulge’s failure to pay the third
                    and fourth tranches. In response, counsel for Indulge, Ms Sugidha Nithi,
                    submitted that since Euoro had ceased business, and there was nothing left to
                    invest in, the appropriate remedy should be damages, and not the specific
                    recovery of the third and fourth tranches.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Indulge’s claim for the return of the first and second
                tranches</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I begin with cl 3.4 of the Subscription
                    Agreement which was central to Indulge’s case. Clause 3.4 is a long
                        paragraph.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> For
                    ease of reading and expediency, the material portions are set out in three
                    separate parts as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nate Corporation Inc is a company incorporated in California, United
                        States of America with Marashi holding 70% of the shares thereof and Sutti
                        Corporation holding 30% of the shares thereof…Marashi…shall
                        transfer all his shares in Nate Corporation…to [Euoro] by or before
                        10 Business Days prior to the Third Payment Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Euoro] and Marashi shall give the [Indulge] evidence of the fulfilment of
                        the condition as set out in this Clause and Clause 3.1(g), such
                        evidence to be to the satisfaction of the [Indulge], no later than 10
                        Business Days prior to the Third Payment Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If [Euoro] and/or Marashi fail to satisfy this Clause and
                        Clause 3.1(g), [Indulge] has the option, upon giving written notice of
                        the exercise thereof to [Euoro] and Marashi, to terminate this Agreement
                        whereupon [Indulge] shall transfer all the Subscription Shares to Marashi
                        and Marashi shall pay $500,000 to [Indulge]…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first part of cl 3.4 concerns Marashi’s obligations to
                    transfer certain shares in a Californian corporation known as Nate Corporation
                    (“Nate Corp”) to Euoro. The second part concerns Marashi’s
                    obligation to provide satisfactory evidence of the transfer. The third part
                    concerns Indulge’s power to terminate the Subscription Agreement. Notably,
                    Indulge is entitled under the termination provision in cl 3.4 to refuse to
                    pay the third and fourth tranches; it also enables Indulge to recover the first
                    and second tranches (totalling $500,000) already paid, from Marashi (as opposed
                    to Euoro, who had, as mentioned, ceased business). It is therefore not difficult
                    to see why Indulge founded its claim on cl 3.4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Ms Nithi argued in her closing submissions
                    that the termination provision in cl 3.4 was triggered because of three
                    alternative reasons, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Marashi had not transferred his Nate
                        Corp shares to Euoro;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Marashi had not provided satisfactory evidence of the share transfer;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was a
                        failure of an implied condition that Sutti Corporation (“Sutti
                        Corp”) was to remain a 30% shareholder of Nate
                    Corp.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Her arguments were addressed and rejected on 10
                    December 2009 for the reasons stated below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The transfer of Marashi’s Nate Corp shares to Euoro</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It was not disputed that (i) Marashi and Sutti
                    Corp’s shares in Nate Corp were cancelled, and (ii) new Nate Corp shares
                    were issued to Euoro, with the result that Euoro was, at the relevant time, the
                    owner of 100% of Nate Corp’s shares. I must mention here that Sutti Corp
                    had voluntarily returned for cancellation its shares in Nate Corp before the
                    third tranche fell due. Indulge’s objection was that the issue of Nate
                    shares to Euoro in the manner described was not tantamount to compliance with
                    Marashi’s obligation under cl 3.4. Ms Nithi argued, in essence,
                    that Marashi was not only legally obliged to put Euoro in ownership of the
                    requisite percentage of Nate Corp’s shares; he was, in addition, bound
                    contractually to achieve that by way of a share transfer, and not through the
                    issuance of new shares to Euoro and the cancellation of his own shares. The
                    position adopted by Indulge was the result of its strict and literal reading of
                    Marashi’s obligation under cl 3.4 to “transfer all his shares
                    in Nate Corp” to Euoro.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Undeniably the literal terms of cl 3.4
                    provided for the “transfer” of Nate Corp shares. However, such a
                    literal reading of cl 3.4 was incompatible with the commercial purpose
                    underlying cl 3.4 itself and the Subscription Agreement as a whole (see
                    generally <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold
                        Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<em>Zurich
                    Insurance</em>”) at [131]). The plain purpose of cl 3.4 was to
                    place Euoro in control of Nate Corp. Accordingly, it would not be an abuse of
                    language to construe Marashi’s obligation to “transfer all his
                    shares” to Euoro as requiring Marashi to put Euoro in the position of
                    control it would be in if Marashi were to transfer all his shares to Euoro. By
                    contrast, an interpretation that insisted on a direct transfer of shares would
                    mean that the Subscription Agreement could be terminated even though Euoro was
                    put in the same position of control by other means. Such a result would be
                    implausible since the obvious purpose of the share transfer was, I repeat,
                    simply to make Euoro the controlling shareholder of Nate Corp which,
                    incidentally, was a shell company at all material times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In my judgment, the use of the words
                    “transfer of all his shares” in cl 3.4 was not, when read in
                    context, meant to prescribe the method of making Euoro the controlling
                    shareholder of Nate Corp. Clause 3.4 required Marashi to put Euoro in
                    ownership of Nate Corp shares, and was indifferent to whether Marashi did so
                    through a direct transfer, or through the issuance of Nate Corp shares to Euoro
                    and the cancellation of his own shares. Accordingly, and since Euoro was in fact
                    put in ownership of 100% of Nate Corp’s shares (Sutti Corp had as
                    mentioned in <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> exited the company), I held
                    that Marashi was not in breach of his obligation to transfer shares to Euoro. As
                    an aside, I noted that while Ms Nithi highlighted the different procedures
                    involved in a direct transfer of share and an issuance of new shares, she
                    rightly did not argue that the procedural differences resulted in any material
                    difference in Euoro’s acquiring control of Nate Corp.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In order to avoid any misimpression, I must
                    emphasise that my conclusion rested on the true construction of cl 3.4, and
                    not because it was sufficient for parties to broadly achieve the essence of the
                    underlying purpose of their contractual obligations. In that connection, I
                    rejected any suggestion by Mr Kumar, if that was his intention, that such a
                    rule existed. Contractual clauses must be construed with their underlying
                    purpose in mind, but ultimately parties must comply fully with their contractual
                    obligations as properly construed. Anything less would be a
                breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     There was some argument over whether
                    cl 3.4 wrongly described Marashi’s shareholding, and whether Marashi
                    was required to transfer all his Nate Corp shareholding to Euoro even after
                    Euoro had become a 70% shareholder of Nate Corp. It was not necessary for me to
                    make a finding on those matters, since the parties did not ask for
                    rectification, and there was equally no disagreement that Euoro was in fact a
                    100% shareholder of Nate Corp by the relevant time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Satisfactory evidence of the share transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Ms Nithi next argued that Marashi did not
                    provide evidence of the share transfer “to the satisfaction of
                    Indulge”, and that default constituted an independent ground triggering
                    the termination provision in cl 3.4. Before addressing the argument, I
                    pause to make two preliminary observations. First, in light of my finding on the
                    first ground in favour of Marashi, the latter need only provide satisfactory
                    evidence of the share cancellation and issuance which was carried out, and not
                    of a share transfer which never occurred. Second, I discerned some confusion in
                    the arguments on the evidential burden of proof. It must be remembered that
                    Marashi’s contractual obligation to provide satisfactory evidence was
                    entirely distinct from the legal burden of proof which in this case fell on
                    Indulge, who asserted and therefore had to prove that Marashi was in breach of
                    cl 3.4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I began the discussion in my oral judgment
                    with the scope of Indulge’s alleged discretion to reject the evidence that
                    Marashi provided to prove the occurrence of the transfer of Nate Corp shares. By
                    requiring Marashi to provide evidence “to the satisfaction of
                    Indulge”, cl 3.4 clearly conferred a discretion on Indulge’s
                    part in deciding whether or not to accept Marashi’s evidence. At the same
                    time, it was also clear that Indulge’s discretion was not so unfettered as
                    to allow it to arbitrarily change or determine the parties’ contractual
                    relations at will by the mere expedient of rejecting Marashi’s evidence,
                    and in the absence of explicit language to that effect, I was reluctant to find
                    that the parties intended to create such an outcome. The contractual discretion
                    in cl 3.4 was conferred for a specific purpose, <em>viz</em> to satisfy Indulge that the transfer of Nate Corp shares had
                    taken place, and in the absence of any contrary language it must be the
                    parties’ intention, and I so held, that the discretion ought to be
                    exercised in <em>good faith</em> for this purpose and this
                    purpose only (see <em>Straits Advisors Pte Ltd v Behringer
                        Holdings (Pte) Ltd</em> [2009] SGCA 55 at [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In addition, as the contractual discretion was
                        <em>ancillary to a defined and objective purpose</em>,
                    it must also be exercised <em>reasonably</em>. Accordingly,
                    Indulge’s discretion to reject Marashi’s evidence of the share
                    transfer, which was ancillary to the objective purpose of making Euoro the
                    controlling shareholder of Nate Corp, must be exercised <em>in
                        good faith</em> and <em>reasonably</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I turn now to Ms Nithi’s criticisms
                    of the evidence provided by Marashi. The bulk of her arguments focussed on the
                    documentary evidence provided by Marashi to Indulge, which included copies of
                    documents purporting to be Nate Corp’s share certificates, minutes of Nate
                    Corp’s board meetings, and a record of shares issued by Nate Corp. I
                    agreed with Ms Nithi that the quality of those documents was sloppy. Key
                    information, such as parties’ names, was recorded in almost illegible
                    handwriting. Furthermore, the quality of photocopying was poor, and it was
                    impossible to say with any degree of confidence that the documents were what
                    they purported to be. However, besides objecting to the quality of the documents
                    and their reproductions, Ms Nithi did not explain what other documents
                    could Marashi have provided to show that the relevant transactions had taken
                    place. Her omission was not surprising since the same question was earlier asked
                    by Marashi’s then solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In any case, I was of the view that, on the
                    facts, it was neither necessary nor sufficient for Marashi to provide the
                    documentary evidence in question. This was because the matter sought to be
                    proven under cl 3.4 was the legal efficacy of a transaction, <em>viz</em> the share transfer, which was obviously governed by
                    Californian law. The production of documentary evidence itself without a legal
                    opinion would not be sufficient assurance that the documents provided were
                    legally efficacious. What was needed was a legal opinion on the matter by a
                    qualified person. In that connection, the material evidence produced were two
                    emails from one Robert L Shepard, which Marashi forwarded to Indulge. In the
                    first email, Mr Shepard wrote, in response to an email query by
                    Panchatsharam Elumalai (“Panju”), who was appointed by Indulge to
                    deal with matters of finance and administration in Euoro, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The United States, loving to be different from the rest of the world, does
                        not really have an equivalent to a Registry of Companies. Unless a US

                        private information. <em>So there is no government official

                        cardboard sleeve. That ledger is maintained by the corporate chief financial
                        officer to track the shares, etc. If this document is lost it is something I

<p class="Judg-1">The second email did not include any history. In that email,
                    Mr Shepard wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Marashi, I received your faxed signature, so yes, that completes
                        the transaction [<em>ie</em> the cancellation of
                        Marashi’s Nate Corp shares] and <em>as of this moment
                            all outstanding shares of Nate Corporation are owned by EUORO

                        indicated to me that you needed a statement that the transfer was complete,
                            <em>so you or any third party may rely on my statement
                            that under California law Nate Corporation is wholly owned by EUORO

                        not hesitate to call or email.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The signature line in both emails included the phrase “The Law
                    Office of Robert L. Shepard”, a Californian address, and a website. The
                    website stated that Mr Shepard was licensed to practise before the
                    Californian Supreme Court, among other jurisdictions, and that his areas of
                    practice included, among other things, business entities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Read together, Mr Shepard’s emails
                    confirmed that (i) there were no official records of Nate Corp’s
                    shareholding, and (ii) Euoro was the sole shareholder of Nate Corp. In my
                    judgment, in the absence of any contrary evidence, Mr Shepard’s
                    emails represented reliable legal opinions and, as such, obviated the need to
                    depend on the primary documents as effecting and evidencing the share
                    transactions. In my view, Mr Shepard’s two emails formed the crucial
                    part of the evidence provided by Marashi, and consequently Indulge’s
                    reasons for being dissatisfied with Mr Shepard’s emails must now be
                    examined. As an aside, Mr Shepard was also the company secretary of Nate
                    Corp and he was someone Panju on behalf of Euoro had communicated
                with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     First, Ms Nithi argued that the emails
                    were hearsay evidence. That contention was misconceived. On the facts, the
                    hearsay rule would operate if Mr Shepard’s emails were adduced as
                    evidence of the share transactions; but they were not. The issue was not whether
                    the share transactions occurred but whether the documents provided by Marashi,
                    including Mr Shepard’s emails, were sufficient to meet
                    Marashi’s contractual obligation to provide satisfactory evidence of the
                    share transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Second, Indulge further complained that the
                    emails were sent from a Yahoo email account and the website in the signature
                    line appeared to be that of an estate planner. I did not think the objection
                    could be taken seriously. There was no reason why legal opinions or advice could
                    not be rendered by email if the author chose that mode of communication. The
                    domain of the email account was clearly irrelevant. What was relevant was the
                    language used by Mr Shepard and the fact that he signed off in his
                    professional capacity as a qualified lawyer, both of which left no doubt as to
                    the seriousness with which he communicated the advice. The objection based on
                    the name of the webpage was clearly frivolous – a quick perusal of the
                    webpage disclosed Mr Shepard’s legal qualifications. In fact, I
                    regarded as telling the fact that Indulge did not make any sustained attack as
                    to the existence or professional qualifications of Mr Shepard. Indeed, I
                    did not think that it could have credibly done so – there were emails
                    showing that Panju, who as mentioned was installed by Indulge in Euoro, dealt
                    with Mr Shepard in his professional capacity as a lawyer on the Nate Corp
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Third, Indulge argued that the emails did not
                    confirm that the issuance of new shares to Euoro and/or the cancellation of
                    Marashi’s shares were validly carried out. The objection was misconceived
                    since the second email did confirm that Euoro was the <em>sole</em> shareholder of Nate Corp, which by any measure achieved the
                    result required by cl 3.4 on its true construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Four, Indulge made the point that the emails
                    did not constitute legal opinion or advice directed to it. There was no merit in
                    the contention. Either Euoro was the sole shareholder of Nate Corp, or it was
                    not – the answer could not be dependent on the intended recipient. In any
                    case, Mr Shepard’s second email made clear that he gave his opinion
                    intending that a third party such as Indulge could rely on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Five, Indulge took issue with
                    Mr Shepard’s statement that he would be able to recreate the stock
                    ledger and other corporate documents, arguing that this proposed course of
                    action threw doubts on the authenticity of the Nate Corp documents. Since I did
                    not take into account the documentary evidence provided by Marashi, the
                    objection was irrelevant. In the absence of cogent evidence on the impropriety
                    of Mr Shepard’s proposed course of action it was also inappropriate
                    to entertain any discussion of Mr Shepard’s <em>bona
                        fides</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Finally, Indulge did not provide Marashi with
                    any indication of what evidence would satisfy it that the relevant share
                    transactions were carried out. As far as I could see, Indulge’s
                    objections, discussed above, were nothing more than <em>ex post
                        facto</em> justifications advanced for the purposes of litigation.
                    There was no contemporaneous evidence that the objections were contemplated, let
                    alone communicated to Marashi at the time the evidence was tendered to
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the reasons stated, I concluded that
                    Indulge’s grounds for rejecting Mr. Shepard’s emails were
                    unreasonable and hence invalid for the purposes of cl 3.4. Separately, and
                    although it was not raised by Mr Kumar, it was also arguable, as a matter
                    of construction, that Marashi’s failure to provide satisfactory evidence
                    of the share transfer would not have triggered the termination provision in
                    cl 3.4. To recapitulate, Marashi was obligated to provide satisfactory
                    evidence of “the fulfilment of the condition as set out in this
                    Clause and Clause 3.1(g)”, where “the condition as set
                    out in this Clause” must necessarily refer to the obligation to transfer
                    shares. The trigger for the termination provision was similarly worded –
                    the provision was triggered if Euoro and/or Marashi “fail to satisfy this
                    Clause and Clause 3.1(g)”. Reference to “this
                    Clause” in the termination provision ought to be read <em>ejusdem generis</em> with the further reference to
                    “Clause 3.1(g)”, which was a purely substantive condition
                    that Euoro, amongst other things, was to own 70% of Nate Corp’s shares.
                    The obligation to provide satisfactory evidence of the fulfilment of
                    cl 3.1(g) was separately set out in cl 3.2, which was not referred to
                    in the termination provision. In addition, the share transfer was not an urgent
                    or otherwise time-sensitive transaction, a fact which might have supported an
                    interpretation requiring the timely provision of evidence on pain of
                    termination. In fact, cl 7.2 made it clear that the global expansion plans
                    of the parties, for which foreign subsidiaries such as Nate Corp, a shell
                    company, would be needed, would only kick in later in the process. At the very
                    least, the text of cl 3.4 was sufficiently ambiguous and ought therefore to
                    be construed <em>contra proferentum</em> which in this case
                    meant against Indulge since its own solicitors prepared the draft on which the
                    final form of the Subscription Agreement was based.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Before moving on, I should comment on
                    Ms Nithi’s cross-examination of Marashi on various allegations of
                    mismanagement by Marashi, in an apparent attempt to show that Indulge was not
                    acting in bad faith when it raised these allegations with him in the course of
                    the parties’ dealings and, by an apparently logical extension, that
                    Indulge was also acting in good faith when it rejected Marashi’s evidence
                    of the share transfer. I did not think that that line of cross-examination was
                    relevant at all – Indulge could not reject Marashi’s evidence of the
                    share transfer for extraneous reasons, and that included even legitimate
                    concerns about Marashi’s management of the business, which would give rise
                    to separate causes of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sutti Corp’s cancellation of its Nate Corp shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I now turn to Ms Nithi’s third
                    argument that there was a failure of an implied condition that Sutti Corp was to
                    remain as a 30% shareholder of Nate Corp, and that failure entitled Indulge to
                    terminate the Subscription Agreement pursuant to the termination provision in
                    cl 3.4. As mentioned, it was not disputed that Sutti Corp had voluntarily
                    returned for cancellation its shares in Nate Corp before the third tranche fell
                    due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The test for implying a term in fact was
                    rationalised in <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v
                        Modern Pak Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927. In that case,
                    Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) concluded after a review of the
                    authorities that a term would be implied in fact if it satisfied the business
                    efficacy test, applied through the mode of the officious bystander test. Phang
                    J’s rationalisation was approved by the Court of Appeal in Ng Giap Hon v
                    Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd [2009] 3 SLR(R) 518.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Indulge had not persuaded me, on the evidence,
                    that Sutti’s continued involvement as a shareholder in Nate Corp was so
                    obviously necessary for the business efficacy of the Subscription Agreement that
                    such a term would be implied as a fact. From a textual point of view, the
                    Subscription Agreement referred to and imposed obligations in relation to the
                    existing and desired shareholding in Nate Corp at several points (see <em>eg</em> cll 3.1(g), 3.4, and 5.2(a)). That indicated
                    that the issue of Nate Corp’s shareholding was consciously within the
                    parties’ contemplation when they entered into the Subscription Agreement,
                    and that the parties considered it necessary to express their intentions in that
                    regard. In the circumstances, it was difficult to imagine that the parties would
                    fail to expressly provide for Sutti Corp’s continued involvement as a
                    shareholder in Nate Corp, if indeed they felt that such involvement was
                    necessary for the business efficacy of the Subscription Agreement. This was
                    Mr Kumar’s point which I accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The textual analysis of the parties’
                    intention was fortified by a consideration of the parties’ commercial
                    objectives and the role Sutti Corp could have played in achieving these
                    objectives. From the evidence, it seemed that Sutti Corp, with its extensive
                    health food distribution network in the United States of America
                    (“USA”), was viewed as playing an important role in the
                    contemplated introduction of Euoro’s products into the USA. However, while
                    it was arguably <em>desirable</em> and <em>convenient</em> for Euoro to have a USA partner such as Sutti Corp in
                    the future, that argument did not show that Sutti Corp’s continued
                    involvement in a shell company was a <em>necessary</em>
                    term of the investment, and there was no contemporaneous evidence of that. It
                    must be remembered that Nate Corp was a shell company and the indefinite
                    involvement of Sutti Corp in a dormant shell company was something that ought to
                    have been (but was not) discussed and agreed upon if it was important to the
                    investment for Euoro to break into the USA market (or any subset thereof) with
                    Sutti Corp’s involvement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     There was one other point. Clause 3.4
                    expressly provided for the termination of the tripartite agreement in specific
                    situations. Any other situation that could have triggered the termination
                    provision that was not expressly spelled out by the parties must, as a matter of
                    construction, fall outside of the scope of the right to terminate. Even if the
                    failure of Sutti Corp to remain a 30% shareholder of Nate Corp was an implied
                    term, it could not trigger the <em>express</em> termination
                    provision in cl 3.4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In conclusion, for the reasons given, I found
                    and held that Marashi was not in breach of the conditions precedent to the
                    payment of the third tranche. Accordingly, I dismissed Indulge’s claim
                    against Marashi as pleaded in the Statement of Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Marashi’s counterclaim for the payment of the third and fourth
                tranches</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I now come to Marashi’s counterclaim for
                    the third and fourth tranches. It was pointed out in my oral judgment that a
                    dismissal of Indulge’s claim did not automatically lead to judgment in
                    Marashi’s favour on his counterclaim. It would have been evident from the
                    various issues raised by this court after the trial that there were pertinent
                    and difficult obstacles to overcome, both in procedural and substantive
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The most immediate procedural problem faced by
                    Marashi in his counterclaim was that Euoro, to whom the third and fourth
                    tranches were to be paid, was not made a party to the present proceedings. Euoro
                    was a party to the Subscription Agreement and would have <em>locus standi</em> to sue to enforce its own rights. I noticed that
                    there was an early application by Marashi to join Euoro, pursuant to directions
                    given by the Assistant Registrar. The application to join Euoro was heard
                    together with applications filed by both parties for summary judgment. The
                    Assistant Registrar hearing the applications allowed Indulge’s application
                    for summary judgment, dismissed Marashi’s application for summary
                    judgment, and made no order on Marashi’s application to join Euoro.
                    Marashi appealed to Choo Han Teck J and successfully obtained unconditional
                    leave to defend Indulge’s action. However, Marashi did not appeal against
                    the “no order” made on its earlier application to join Euoro. In
                    short, there was no subsequent attempt to join Euoro. Mr Kumar did not
                    provide any explanation as to that state of affairs when I directed parties to
                    explain and submit on the absence of Euoro in these proceedings.
                    Mr Kumar’s stance was that there was no need to join Euoro and, if
                    anything, it was for Indulge to take the initiative to do so. That last
                    contention was misplaced: it was Marashi and not Euoro who had to return the
                    first $500,000 to Indulge under cl 3.4, while the next $500,000 was to be
                    paid to Euoro and not Marashi. Mr Kumar also argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_i"></a>(i)     Marashi had the standing to claim
                        against Indulge for the payment of the third and fourth
                    tranches;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the
                        court could revive Marashi’s original application to join Euoro,
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the
                        court could exercise its discretion under O 15 r 6(2)(b) of the Rules of
                        Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) to join
                    Euoro.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">His arguments were addressed and rejected on 10
                    December 2009 for the reasons stated below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Specific performance in favour of third party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Kumar’s first argument that
                    Marashi could claim specific performance for a third party like Euoro was a
                    short point that could be dealt with quickly. Marashi confirmed that he had not
                    suffered any loss from the non-payment of the third and fourth tranches and he
                    was not seeking any damages from Indulge on the usual principles. It was
                    therefore necessary for him to proceed on other bases. Mr Kumar’s
                    argument that Marashi had the proper standing to claim specific performance
                    against Indulge for Euoro’s benefit was based on cases such as <em>Beswick v Beswick</em> [1968] AC 58 and <em>Family Food Court v Seah Boon Lock</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 272
                    at [34] (“<em>Family Food Court</em>”), which
                    operated to alleviate the difficulties caused by the doctrine of privity of
                    contract. Those decisions were plainly distinguishable from the present case,
                    where Euoro was privy to the Subscription Agreement and could sue in its own
                    right, and was unable to do so only because of Marashi’s procedural
                    omission to join it as a party to the proceedings. I was therefore of the
                    opinion that Marashi’s counterclaim for specific performance which was
                    made <em>on behalf of Euoro</em> was legally unsustainable
                    and must fail. If Euoro were to recover, it must claim <em>in its
                        own right</em>. I would add, for completeness, that the same reasons
                    would also apply to a claim by Marashi for substantial damages on the
                    “board ground” based on <em>Family Food
                        Court</em> and <em>Chia Kok Leong v Prosperland Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 484 (“<em>Chia Kok Leong v Prosperland</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In addition, for the reasons that I will
                    elaborate when discussing the result of a claim brought directly by Euoro,
                    Marashi’s claim for specific performance must also fail because the
                    requirement of reciprocity needed for such an order was not met (see below,
                        <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>). In determining this requirement
                    of reciprocity, I considered and concluded that the commercial purpose of the
                    $1m investment was to expand the business by opening more stores and that
                    Marashi, as the party seeking specific performance, was himself unable to
                    perform the terms of the contract on his part – principally his obligation
                    to use his best endeavours to achieve the business plan of opening more stores
                    agreed to by the parties- because of the cessation of the floral and herbal tea
                    business in August 2008. It followed that since Marashi was not able to perform
                    his part of the contract, he would not be able to obtain specific performance of
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-joinder of Euoro</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In relation to Mr Kumar’s second
                    argument, I was in entire agreement with Ms Nithi that Marashi’s
                    original application to join Euoro was determined when the Assistant Registrar
                    made no order upon it: see <em>Ho Kian Cheong v Ho Kian
                        Guan</em> [2004] SGHC 104 at [7]. It was for Marashi to
                    raise the issue on appeal, which he failed to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In relation to Mr Kumar’s third
                    argument, I was not persuaded that the court’s discretion to join Euoro
                    should be exercised. First, this case was not one where no attempt at all to
                    join Euoro was made. Marashi was aware of the need to join Euoro and indeed an
                    application was filed on his behalf. Second, there was no appeal against the
                    Assistant Registrar’s “no order” on the joinder application.
                    Third, Mr Kumar did not explain, even though he was specifically asked, why
                    nothing was done after the Assistant Registrar made no order upon
                    Marashi’s application to join Euoro and following Choo J’s
                    order granting Marashi unconditional leave to defend Indulge’s claim.
                    Without any explanation, despite being specifically asked to explain, the court
                    was left with the impression that the absence of an appeal on joinder was by
                    choice or an oversight. In the premises, nothing of an extenuating nature and
                    circumstance was proffered to enable the court to assess whether this was a
                    proper case to exercise its discretion. I noted Indulge’s objection to the
                    late joinder for the reason that the conduct of Indulge’s litigation would
                    have been different with Euoro in the proceedings. Indulge would have pursued
                    separate claims against Euoro. It would be prejudiced if Euoro were to be joined
                    at this late stage as Indulge would not have the opportunity to include and
                    prosecute its separate claims against Euoro.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For the reasons stated on the non-joinder as
                    well as the ruling on the claim for specific performance for a third party like
                    Euoro, the counterclaim was not sustainable and it was accordingly
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The action for an agreed sum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Even if Euoro had been joined in the
                    proceedings before me, the outcome would still have been the same in that Euoro
                    would have been unable to recover the third and fourth tranches. If Euoro were
                    to sue, the claim would be brought in an action for an agreed sum, and not for
                    specific performance. As mentioned, the parties were directed to submit on the
                    relevance of Euoro’s cessation of business and its consequent inability to
                    perform its obligations to expand the business as required under the
                    Subscription Agreement. The parties’ submissions were outlined at the
                    beginning of this judgment (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mr Kumar submitted that a party could
                    always recover a contractually agreed sum once the condition precedent for its
                    payment had been met. I noted in my oral judgment that this proposition was
                    incongruent with the more principled position for the specific performance of
                    non-monetary obligations, and also with the concept of the performance interest,
                    as applied to the interest of the party liable to pay coupled with his
                    reasonable expectation of the counterparty’s performance. I also alluded
                    to the fact that the historical bases for the action for an agreed sum were not
                    entirely satisfactory, and further doubted that, on the facts, the parties
                    intended the $1m to be payable independent of the rest of the obligations in the
                    Subscription Agreement. I now elaborate on those reasons. For the avoidance of
                    doubt, the modern formulation is referred to in this judgment as an action for
                    an agreed sum to distinguish it, for the purposes of discussion, from the
                    ancient action of debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The modern formulation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The clearest judicial statement of the action
                    for an agreed sum in modern times is that of Millett LJ in <em>Jervis v Harris</em> [1996] 1 Ch 195 at
                    202–203:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a debt is a definite sum of money fixed by the agreement of the
                        parties as payable by one party to the other in return for the performance
                        of a specified obligation by the other party or <em>on the
                            occurrence of some specified event or condition</em>; whereas
                        damages may be claimed from a party who has broken his primary contractual
                        obligation in some way other than by failure to pay such a debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The plaintiff who claims payment of a debt need not
                            prove anything beyond the occurrence of the event or condition on the
                            occurrence of which the debt became due. He need prove no loss; the
                            rules as to remoteness of damage and mitigation of loss are
                            irrelevant</em>; and unless the event on which the payment is due
                        is a breach of some other contractual obligation owed by the one party to
                        the other the law on penalties does not apply to the agreed sum. It is not
                        necessary that the amount of the debt should be ascertained at the date of
                        the contract; it is sufficient if it is ascertainable when payment is
                        due.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Millett LJ did not cite any case law (he
                    cited the learned authors of <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>,
                    Vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 27<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1994), at
                    para 21-031), and the quoted passage was strictly speaking <em>obiter dicta</em>. However, the essence of the <em>general</em> formulation is well recognised (see <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, Vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        30<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008), at paras 21-040 and 26-009

                    in <em>Mattock, Executor of Southwood v Kinglake</em>
                    (1839) 10 Ad &amp; E 50. In that case, K agreed to pay S on a fixed
                    day, and in exchange S agreed to convey certain properties to K. In the event, S
                    did not convey and K did not pay, and S’s executor M brought an action of
                    debt to recover the payment. All four judges of the Queen’s Bench allowed
                    the action. The judgment of Littledale J (at 56) is particularly relevant
                    for present purposes. The learned judge held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A time being fixed for payment, and none for doing that which was the
                        consideration for the payment, an action lies for the purchase-money without
                        averring performance of the consideration. An action for not executing a
                        conveyance of the premises might have been maintained by the defendant
                        before the day of payment and in such action no allegation of payment would
                        have been necessary. The covenants are independent, and each party has
                        relied upon his remedy by action against the other.</p>

                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Furthermore, if the payment has fallen due, it
                    is an accrued right which survives a termination of the contract as a result of
                    an accepted repudiation (see <em>Chitty</em>, <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above at para 24-051; <em>Halsbury’s</em>, <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>,

                        Australia</em>, <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above at
                    paras 2225–2226.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The historical bases of the action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     From a necessarily rough survey of the
                    histories and historical sources, set out below, it seems that the present form
                    of the action for an agreed sum is most clearly correlated with three historical
                    doctrines: (i) the proprietary conceptions underlying the ancient action of
                    debt; (ii) the juristic basis of the <em>indebitatus
                        assumpsit</em> action as an action on a separate undertaking; and
                    (iii) the doctrine of independent promises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I begin with the action of debt. The wrong
                    complained of in an action of debt was the defendant’s misfeasance of
                    wrongfully detaining something which he owed to the plaintiff (<em>debet et detinet</em>), and not, as we would nowadays think
                    of it, the nonfeasance of breaching an obligation to do something. In other
                    words, the action was tied to quasi-proprietary concepts. It was not restricted
                    to moneys owed, or to contractual obligations; it could be brought for chattels
                    wrongfully detained, and for non-contractual obligations to pay money. In time,
                    debt for chattels evolved into the separate action of detinue, while debt for
                    non-contractual obligations to pay money continued to be available even today,
                    where we speak of debts created by deed, by statute, by judgment, and so on. For
                    the history of the action of debt, see generally, Oliver Wendell Holmes,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The notion of an action of debt as involving
                    the recovery of something owed by the defendant to the plaintiff explains
                    several characteristics of the action. It explains why debt laid only for a sum
                    certain. It explains why a debt is recoverable in full without the need to prove
                    and quantify loss. It explains why an accrued debt is recoverable
                    notwithstanding the termination of the contract. As Dixon and Evatt JJ
                    explained in <em>Westralian Farmers Ltd v Commonwealth
                        Agricultural Service Engineers Ltd</em> (1936) 54 CLR 361 at
                    379–80, the action is brought upon “a debt, a distinct chose in
                    action which for many purposes is conceived as possessing proprietary
                    characteristics.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In time, the action of <em>assumpsit</em>, specifically <em>indebitatus
                        assumpsit</em> came to overshadow the action of debt. The expansion of
                        <em>indebitatus assumpsit</em> culminated in <em>Slade’s Case</em> (1602) 4 Co Rep 92b, where
                    it was resolved by all the Justices of England and the Barons of the Exchequer
                    that <em>indebitatus assumpsit</em> laid concurrently with
                    debt (with a few exceptions that are immaterial for present purposes). That
                    resolution, together with other developments, established a general promissory
                    action which was eventually to give rise to the modern law of contract. It was
                    also resolved in the same case (at 94b) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the plaintiff in [an] action on the case on assumpsit should not recover
                        only damages for the special loss (if any be) which he had, but also
                            <em>for the whole debt, so that a recovery in this action
                            should be a good bar in an action of debt brought upon the same
                            contract. So vice versa ..     </em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The passage above made clear that a debt continued to be recoverable
                    as such, notwithstanding that the action was brought in <em>assumpsit</em>, which generally sounded in damages to be assessed
                    (see Simpson, above <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> at p 309; and
                    DJ Ibbetson, <em>A Historical Introduction to the Law of
                        Obligations</em> (Oxford University Press, 1999) at
                    pp 132–133, 147–149, and 151).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     A claim in <em>indebitatus
                        assumpsit</em> basically alleged that the defendant, being indebted
                        (<em>indebitatus</em>), undertook to pay (<em>assumpsit solvere</em>) (see Simpson, above <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> at p 309). The action was thus based on
                    an undertaking separate from the promise which created the debt, and this
                    remained so even after <em>Slade’s Case</em> –
                    the third resolution in that case (at 94a–94b) was that “that every
                    contract executory imports in itself an <em>assumpsit</em>”, a formulation which made clear that the <em>assumpsit</em> was distinct from the contract. Consequently,
                    the <em>assumpsit</em> or undertaking could be sued upon
                    separately from the rest of the agreement. Thus, in <em>Turner v
                        Bladin</em> (1951) 82 CLR 463 (“<em>Turner v Bladin</em>”) at [14], the High Court of Australia
                    held that an action to recover sums due under an agreement to sell land was not
                    an action on the agreement but an action of <em>indebitatus
                        assumpsit</em>, and was therefore not caught by the New South Wales
                    equivalent of s 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 (c 3) (our equivalent is
                    contained in s 5(d) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)). In
                    this connection, the <em>assumpsit</em> regime was
                    diametrically different from an action of debt on a simple contract (as opposed
                    to a specialty contract), which laid only upon a <em>quid pro
                        quo</em>, <em>viz</em> an agreed benefit actually
                    conferred by the plaintiff (see SJ Stoljar, <em>A History of
                        Contract at Common Law</em> (Australian National University Press,
                    1975) at p 11; <em>Young v Queensland Trustees
                        Ltd</em> (1956) 99 CLR 560 at [11]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I come finally to the doctrine of independent
                    promises. It is unnecessary to trace the development of the doctrine here (for
                    an account see SJ Stoljar, “Dependent and Independent Promises: A Study
                    in the History of Contract” (1956–1958) 2(2) Syd L Rev 217). The
                    doctrine was distilled into five separate rules by Sergeant-at-law John Williams
                    in his notes to <em>Pordage v Cole</em> (1669) 85 ER 449
                        (“<em>Pordage v Cole</em>”) at
                    450–454, which were in turn treated extensively by Sir Thomas Willes
                    Chitty KC, Alfred Thompson Denning (as he then was) and Cyril Pearce Harvey, the
                    editors of <em>Smith, A Selection of Leading Cases on Various
                        Branches of the Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        13<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1929) at p 10. For present purposes
                    it is sufficient to set out Professor Stoljar’s summary (at
                    pp 245–246) of the Sergeant’s five rules:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) if the date of payment is to, or may, happen before the other’s
                        performance, the payor’s promise is independent, i.e. [the] actor can
                        claim payment without having to aver performance; (2) if such payment is
                        appointed after performance, the payor’s promise is subject to a
                        condition whose fulfilment [the] actor has to aver; (3) if a covenant goes
                        only to part of the consideration, it is independent so that [the] plaintiff
                        may maintain an action without, averring performance, but (4) if mutual
                        covenants go to the whole consideration, they are mutual conditions and must
                        be averred, and (5) if two acts are to be done at the same time, neither
                        party can maintain an action without showing performance or an offer to
                        perform.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is readily apparent that a strict application of Sergeant
                    Williams’ rule (1) will yield the result that obligations which arise at
                    different times or on different conditions will be actionable independently of
                    each other. <em>Pordage v Cole</em>, on which rule (1) is
                    based, is still regarded as good law by <em>Chitty</em>,
                    above, <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> at paras 24-035 to
                    24-037.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rationalising the action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It is plain that these historical doctrines
                    cannot stand today as convincing rationales for the action for an agreed sum. An
                    action for an agreed sum is an action to directly enforce a contractual promise.
                    It is not an action to assert or protect property in a thing. It is not an
                    action on a fictional undertaking subsequent to, or otherwise distinct from, the
                    contract which contains the promise to pay. And while the doctrine of
                    independent promises as restated in Sergeant Williams’ rule (1) may have,
                    in its time, played an important role in expanding the scope of <em>assumpsit</em> into executory contracts (which were not
                    actionable in debt because of the requirement for <em>quid pro
                        quo</em>), it is an anachronistic exception to the modern law of
                    contract, which no longer views a contractual term literally and in isolation,
                    but rather approaches it in light of the contract as a whole and the underlying
                    commercial and business purpose of the parties in entering into the contract
                    (see <em>Zurich Insurance</em> (above <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>) at [131], followed in <em>Tiger
                        Airways Pte Ltd v Swissport Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 992 at [25]). As <em>Chitty</em>
                    remarked (above, <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> at para 24-036),
                    cases involving independent promises are “exceptional”. I agree,
                    and add that Sergeant Williams’ rule (1), if it continues to be a rule at
                    all, cannot be immutable, but must instead yield to an approach which better
                    reflects the parties’ commercial intentions and expectations as
                    objectively expressed or ascertained in the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Specifically, it is far from obvious to me
                    that a contractual promise to pay money is necessarily enforceable once its
                    conditions precedent have been met, without regard to the rest of the contract.
                    Certainly, such an approach would not be congruent with the position in relation
                    to the grant of specific performance of non-monetary obligations, which is
                    subject to the condition described as follows in G R Northcote, <em>Fry on Specific Performance</em>, (Stevan &amp; Sons,
                        6<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1921), Chapter XX at p 435,
                    §922:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to the matters to be done by the plaintiff according to the
                        terms of the contract, it is, from obvious principles of justice, incumbent
                        on him, when he seeks the performance of the contract, to show, first, that
                        he has performed or been ready and willing to perform, the terms of the
                        contract on his part to be then performed; and secondly, that he is ready
                        and willing to do all matters and things on his part thereafter to be done;
                        and a default on his part in either of these respects furnishes a ground
                        upon which the action may be resisted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sir Edward Fry refers to this requirement by the unwieldy name of
                    “default on the part of the plaintiff”; I prefer the label
                    “reciprocity”, which more aptly captures the mutual and dependent
                    nature of the several obligations which constitutes a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The requirement as stated by Sir Edward Fry is
                    commonly viewed as a specific expression of the related equitable doctrines that
                    he who comes to equity must come with clean hands, and must also do equity. But
                    it seems to me that the requirement of reciprocity can – and should
                    – be divorced from the equitable concepts of conscience and discretion and
                    rationalised in accordance with the principles of contract. Specifically, the
                    requirement of reciprocity as a principle of contract law recognises that, when
                    the several obligations of a contract are <em>on their true
                        construction</em> part of one indivisible bargain, a party cannot
                    expect to enforce his counterparty’s obligations when he himself did not,
                    cannot, or is unwilling or able to, perform his own obligations. In other words,
                    it prevents the plaintiff from recovering the covenanted benefit free from the
                    covenanted burden. It ensures that the whole bargain is recovered, the good with
                    the bad, no less, and certainly no more. This is certainly a principle that
                    applies with equal force to the enforcement of monetary as well as non-monetary
                    primary obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In my view, the requirement of reciprocity can
                    also be said to be consistent with, and in fact to flow from, the modern and
                    developing concept of the performance interest. As recently defined by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Family Food Court</em> (above, <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> at [34] of the report), the performance
                    interest is “the plaintiff/promisee’s interest in the contract
                    being performed and (consequently) his receiving the benefit which he had
                    contracted for”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The concept of the performance interest has
                    been applied to found the “broad ground” on which a party can
                    recover substantial damages for a breach of contract notwithstanding the fact
                    that he has not thereby suffered actual loss (see <em>Chia Kok
                        Leong v Prosperland</em> (above, <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>) and the English authorities reviewed there). While this
                    application of the concept is not pertinent to the present case, it must be
                    borne in mind that the <em>concept</em> of the performance
                    interest is a wide one: the Court of Appeal in <em>Family Food
                        Court</em> (above, <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> at [34]
                    and [48]) described it as “<em>an integral part of the
                        common law of contract</em>” (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In my judgment, the most fundamental sense in
                    which a party is interested in the performance of his counterparty is that such
                    performance constitutes the <em>quid</em> in return for
                    which he undertook to render the <em>quo</em>. To enforce
                    the <em>quo</em> when the <em>quid</em> has not or will not be rendered is to ignore the <em>quid pro quo</em> basis on which the parties assumed their
                    mutual obligations. Therefore, in order for the performance interest to be fully
                    protected, it cannot only operate as a sword to found a claim for specific
                    performance or substantial damages against a party in breach – it must be
                    capable of operating as a shield for a party to resist performance when the
                    counterparty did not, cannot, or will not, render performance, <em>ie</em> when there is a lack of reciprocity. Once again, this
                    applies equally to the enforcement of non-monetary primary obligations, where
                    reciprocity already applies, as well as to monetary primary obligations, where
                    reciprocity should also be applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Put in another way, the rationale underlying
                    the requirement of reciprocity can be met by two possible remedial responses.
                    Where there exists an effective and adequate counterclaim, it is for the party
                    to bring a counterclaim against his counterparty for the appropriate remedy.
                    Such a counterclaim may take the form of specific performance, which is,
                    provided that any loss caused by the delayed performance is adequately
                    remediable by damages, a perfect substitute for the counterparty’s failure
                    to perform in the past or unwillingness or inability to perform in the future.
                    It may also take the form of substantive damages, if such damages are an
                    adequate substitute for the counterparty’s performance. The requirement to
                    bring a counterclaim in such situations strikes an appropriate balance between
                    the performance interests of the party and the counterparty – the party
                    will not be deprived of the counterparty’s performance if he (the party)
                    is susceptible to a counterclaim that will adequately meet the
                    counterparty’s performance interest. This is, to my mind, the better
                    justification for the result in <em>Mattock v Kinglake</em>
                    (above, <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>) – K, who was liable to
                    pay, could bring an action against S for the conveyance which was promised in
                    return. However, it is not in every case that a party’s performance
                    interest can be adequately vindicated by a counterclaim, and in such cases the
                    law ought to afford him a full defence against performing. This defence
                    recognises that a party should not be liable to perform when he has not received
                    what he has bargained for or an adequate substitute. The converse result –
                    requiring a party to perform when he has not received what he has bargained for
                    or an adequate substitute – would be entirely inconsistent with the
                    parties’ reasonable commercial expectations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Here it is apposite to note that the concept
                    that a party can refuse to perform on the grounds that the other party has not
                    performed, or is unwilling or unable to perform, is hardly novel to the law of
                    contract. It is the basis of the related common law doctrines of repudiatory
                    breach and anticipatory breach, the origins of which can be traced back to Lord
                    Mansfield’s judgment in <em>Boone v Eyre</em> (1789)
                    1 H Bl 273 (see the references to that case in <em>Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd</em> [1962]
                    2 QB 26, which is the modern point of departure) and Lord Campbell
                    CJ’s judgment in <em>Hochster v De La Tour</em>
                    (1853) 118 ER 922 respectively. The requirement of reciprocity as it
                    applies to specific performance in equity is equally venerable (see the
                    authorities collected in <em>Fry on Specific
                        Performance</em>, above, <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> at
                    §922ff). While each doctrine has its distinct scope of application, they all
                    spring from the commonsensical recognition, mentioned earlier at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> and <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>,
                    that when the several obligations of a contract are <em>on their
                        true construction</em> part of one indivisible bargain, it is
                    inconsistent both with principle and with the parties’ intentions to
                    insist that one party perform when the other did not, cannot or will not do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I now come to the scope of, and the exceptions
                    to, the reciprocity requirement. No question of reciprocity will arise in cases
                    where the contract has been fully executed on one side – the requirement
                    is necessarily satisfied in such cases. An example is a simple credit
                    relationship where the creditor has fully executed his obligation to extend the
                    credit, with the debtor’s obligation to repay being the only obligation
                    outstanding in the contract. The requirement of reciprocity is in practice
                    concerned with situations where each side has breached the contract and/or has
                    obligations to perform in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     There are two commonsensical exceptions to the
                    requirement of reciprocity. The first exception is that a defendant cannot
                    insist on reciprocity to the extent that the lack of it is caused by him (see
                        <em>Fry on Specific Performance</em>, above, [53] at
                    p 442, §941). In other words, a defendant cannot insist on his performance
                    interest when he has himself defeated it. The second exception is that a breach
                    which does not go to the root of the contract <em>may</em>
                    not constitute sufficient grounds for resisting performance or payment. This is
                    consistent with the position for the specific performance of non-monetary
                    remedies (see Spry, <em>The Principles of Equitable
                        Remedies</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    2007) at 213–214). The second exception essentially balances the gravity
                    of the performance interests at stake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Before turning to the facts, I must add, for
                    the avoidance of doubt, that everything I have said above is directed at the
                    direct enforcement, at common law, of primary contractual obligations to pay
                    money. It is not directed at non-contractual obligations to pay money, secondary
                    obligations to pay damages, and statutes such as the Sale of Goods Act
                    (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed). In those cases it might well be appropriate
                    for the action of debt to apply strictly. In the case of statutory provisions,
                    it should also be borne in mind that they might have been enacted with reference
                    to the common law as it stood at the time of enactment, and might need to be
                    interpreted in like manner (see <em>eg</em> the
                    interpretation of the New South Wales equivalent of the Statute of Frauds in
                        <em>Turner v Bladin</em>, discussed at above, <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>). Separately, given my view of the facts, I
                    have not found it necessary to decide whether the right to sue on a primary
                    obligation to pay an agreed sum survives a termination of the contract. Suffice
                    it to say that the juridical basis of that rule merits serious reconsideration
                    in an appropriate case in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I turn now to the facts in evidence.
                    Indulge’s attempt to terminate the Subscription Agreement was held to be
                    without justification. It was a view which Marashi and Euoro correctly
                    maintained in their solicitors’ letter of 4 May 2007 which expressly
                    held Indulge to its (Indulge’s) obligations under the Subscription
                        Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> At all
                    material times, the Subscription Agreement remained fully in
                force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The relevant provision is cl 7.2 of the
                    Subscription Agreement and the material part of cl 7.2 provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties agree that each of them will use their best endeavours to
                        ensure the continued growth of revenues of [Euoro] in Singapore in the first
                        phase in accordance with the business plan in Annex A ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Marketing Plan in Annex A contained a projected schedule for the
                    opening of new stores and stores-in-stores.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> One store-in-store and four herbal
                    stores were to be opened in the second half of 2006; three stores-in-stores and
                    five herbal stores in 2007; and four stores-in-stores and ten herbal stores in
                    2008. As cl 7.2 was a “best endeavours” clause, Marashi had
                    to show that he had taken all reasonable steps which a prudent and determined
                    person acting in his own interests and anxious to perform cl 7.2 would have
                    taken (see <em>Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee
                        Augustine and others</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at [22]).
                    Notably Marashi admitted during cross-examination that Euoro and he were bound
                    to open new herbal stores and stores-in-stores under the Subscription
                        Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> There was also the unchallenged
                    evidence of Sajen G Aswani, a director of Indulge, who was also appointed to
                    Euoro’s board pursuant to cl 8(b), that the money invested in Euoro
                    was to be used to fund its expansion to create sales.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The parties thus accepted that the $1m
                    was earmarked for the envisaged expansion and specifically that Euoro through
                    Marashi had to take reasonable steps to open within the time frame the number of
                    stores that were to be opened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     There was no evidence to show that Euoro
                    through Marashi had used its best endeavours. In fact, it was clear on the
                    evidence that the first two tranches were not being applied towards the opening
                    of new stores. In fact, no new stores were opened – Marashi contended that
                    two or three stores-in-stores were in fact opened,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    but that contention was contradicted by Marashi’s admission that there was
                    one store and five stores-in-stores when the Subscription Agreement was signed
                    read with a sales report dated 2 April 2007 that referred also to one store
                    and five stores-in-stores.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This evidence was corroborated by the
                    accounts in evidence,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> which only showed sales for one herbal store and
                    five stores-in-stores. A profit and loss statement dated 7 May 2007 had
                    entries for three new outlets,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> but the sales figures for each of those
                    outlets was zero, and in the absence of any further evidence, it was
                    questionable whether those outlets were in fact opened and operational. In any
                    case, even if Marashi was right Euoro would still have fallen far short of the
                    targets set in Annex A. It particularly failed to open any new stores,
                    which would have been of a bigger scale and required more capital than
                    stores-in-stores. Certainly, with Euoro’s cessation of business, Euoro and
                    Marashi would no longer be able to meaningfully fulfil their continuing
                    obligation under cl 7.2 to expand the business in accordance with the
                    Marketing Plan in Annex A. That constituted a clear failure of
                    reciprocity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In addition, Euoro’s inability to expand
                    the business in accordance with cl 7.2 certainly went to the root of the
                    Subscription Agreement. I also rejected the plea in the Defence that
                    Indulge’s non-payment had caused Euoro to suffer loss and
                        damage,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and more specifically the
                    allegation in Marashi’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief that Euoro’s
                    financial difficulties (and by implication its inability to perform cl 7.2)
                    were partially caused by Indulge’s non-payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> In reality, it was obvious that Euoro could not,
                    even with Indulge’s investment, fund its existing business, let alone at
                    the same time expand the business as required under the Subscription Agreement.
                    The evidence pointed to Euoro’s inability to continue to perform
                    cl 7.2 and its other obligations under the Subscription Agreement was not
                    attributable to Indulge’s non-payment of the third and fourth tranches,
                    but were instead a result of Euoro’s inherent business and financial
                    weaknesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Euoro’s audited accounts for the
                    financial year 2006 showed that the company suffered a net loss for the year of
                    $392,703 as compared to a smaller loss of $20,095 in 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> From the financial year
                    2006 Cash Flow Statement, net cash used in operating activities rose sharply to
                    $180,429 from a mere $6,622 in the previous year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> That was significant as it meant that
                    Euoro’s existing operations were not cash generative enough to cover its
                    own operating expenses but instead was consuming cash at an alarming rate. The
                    financial year 2005 comparatives also showed a smaller cash consumption of
                    $6,622 by Euoro’s operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Even with the
                    injection of $250,000 by Indulge in 2006, the company was in a serious cashflow
                    problem – the financial year 2006 balance sheet<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> showed that Euoro’s
                    current assets of $192,616 were insufficient to meet current liabilities of
                    $234,319, indicating that the company was technically insolvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The situation continued to worsen in the
                    following first quarter of 2007 to 31 March 2007 as reflected in
                    Euoro’s management accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Sales, which were already in a declining
                    trend since 2006, fell sharply further to $298,493 as compared to a budgeted
                    sales of $531,000 for the first quarter of 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> That had the effect of exacerbating the
                    already strained cashflow position as could be gleaned from the first quarter
                    2007 Cash Flow Statement with cash used up in operating activities amounting to
                        $174,924<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. If
                    not for the injection of the second tranche of $250,000 in February 2007,
                    Euoro’s state of affairs would have been worse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     A reasonable observation of the events during
                    the above period from the financial year 2006 to 31 March 2007, was that
                    Euoro’s operations were not generating sufficient sales to cover its
                    expenses even as far back as 2005. This was exacerbated by its inability to
                    collect previous debts, resulting in a bad debt write-off of $271,368 in
                        2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> In the three-month
                    period to 31 March 2007, the downward trend deteriorated further with
                    actual sales significantly below its target sales in order for the operation to
                    survive. In other words, Euoro’s operations were not able to sustain its
                    own existence let alone expand in accordance with the Subscription Agreement.
                    The trend evinced in the events from the financial year 2006 to 31 March
                    2007 here is reinforced in Euoro’s April 2007 management accounts, where
                    actual sales of $102,337 were down 58.4% compared to the month’s budgeted
                    sales of $246,000, resulting in a loss of $62,464 when a profit of $23,000 was
                        expected.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>
                    Instead of generating cash, Euoro’s April 2007 operations consumed
                    $27,682, and that further depleted its cash balance from $28,611 in the previous
                    month to $929 at the end of April 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Here it will be recalled that there was
                    no reliable evidence that new stores were in fact opened. There were pressing
                    creditors to be paid, and the funds were used to meet current expenses and pay
                    Euoro’s creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Euoro’s finances were plainly such that,
                    had the third and fourth tranches been paid and used to keep the business
                    afloat, it still would not have the resources needed to fulfil the business
                    plan. Marashi testified that Euoro did not close any of the outlets (meaning to
                    trim expenses) as the company was obliged to expand under the business
                        plan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> That evidence would exacerbate the
                    company’s financial position as explained above. I also did not think that
                    Euoro could validly claim that it would have expended money from the third and
                    fourth tranches on opening new stores and fulfilling its obligations under the
                    Subscription Agreement. From Euoro’s past conduct in its utilisation of
                    the funds from the first and second tranches, and bearing in mind the state of
                    the business as explained earlier, Euoro would probably have used the moneys
                    from the third and fourth tranches to repay the demands of creditors instead of
                    opening new stores to maintain its existing operations. There was nothing in the
                    evidence to suggest that it would change its approach in respect of the third
                    and fourth tranches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     On a related point, I also rejected
                    Ms Nithi’s submission that Indulge did not have a chance to lead
                    evidence to challenge the allegation made in Mr Kumar’s further
                    submissions that Indulge’s non-payment caused Euoro’s cessation of
                    business. That allegation was clearly encompassed in the pleading in the Defence
                    and the allegation made in Marashi’s evidence which I have referred to (at
                        <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above), and Indulge was fully able,
                    if it had so wished, to challenge them in the course of the trial. In any case,
                    since I have concluded that the allegation has not been proven, the issue is
                    academic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Indulge would not have a counterclaim that
                    could adequately remedy Euoro’s breach. It would be unable to obtain
                    specific performance of Euoro’s cl 7.2 obligation to expand the
                    business for any number of reasons, including the impossibility of performance
                    now that Euoro had ceased business. Indulge would also be unable to obtain
                    substantive damages – the success of Euoro’s business was at best a
                    matter of speculation. <em>Yet, and this must be emphasised, it
                        could not be denied that Indulge’s bargain with Euoro involved Euoro
                        performing its obligations to take reasonable steps to implement the agreed
                        business plan, and that Euoro would not be able to do so</em>. Here I
                    must reject Mr Kumar’s contention that Indulge’s obligation to
                    pay the investment sum, including the third and fourth tranches, related only to
                    the issuance and purchase of shares in Euoro, and that that exchange was
                    severable from the rest of the Subscription Agreement. Indulge plainly did not
                    agree to invest $1m just for the sake of being issued shares in Euoro. It did so
                    in the overall context of an agreement with Euoro and Marashi to expand and
                    develop the business of Euoro. It was entirely inconsistent with the
                    parties’ commercial purposes to treat the investment sum as payment for
                    Euoro’s shares alone, divorced from the parties’ agreement to expand
                    the business using the investment money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Given the circumstances – a failure of
                    reciprocity by Euoro which cannot be adequately remedied by a counterclaim,
                    which went to the root of the Subscription Agreement, and which was not caused
                    by Indulge’s failure to pay the third and fourth tranches – I was of
                    the opinion that an action for an agreed sum to recover the third and fourth
                    tranches, if brought by Euoro, would not be sustainable. I would add, for the
                    avoidance of doubt, that it was not Euoro’s cessation of business
                        <em>per se</em> which precluded its recovery of the
                    third and fourth tranches. By the same token, Indulge was not relieved of
                    payment simply because it entered into what seems like a bad bargain. Quite the
                    contrary. Euoro was precluded from recovery, and Indulge was relieved from
                    paying, because of Euoro’s inability to fulfil its continuing obligations
                    under the Subscription Agreement. If, hypothetically, Euoro had fully executed
                    all its obligations under the Subscription Agreement, the fact that it had
                        <em>subsequently</em> ceased business would not be a
                    bar at all to its recovery of the third and fourth tranches. The requirement of
                    reciprocity protected the sanctity of the exchange agreed to by the parties; it
                    does not allow a party to escape from a bad bargain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Since cl 7.2 applied equally to Marashi
                    and he would similarly be unable to fulfil it, he would also be prevented, as I
                    had earlier mentioned at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above, from
                    directly enforcing Indulge’s obligation to pay the third and fourth
                    tranches. Separately, Indulge would also be able to set up Euoro’s
                    non-performance as a defence against Marashi’s counterclaim for payment to
                    Euoro.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Consequently, if Euoro had brought a claim, it
                    would be reduced to its remedy in damages. The quantum of damages would be
                    assessed in order to put Euoro in the position it would be in had the
                    Subscription Agreement been fully performed by all sides, <em>ie</em> the position Euoro would be in had Indulge paid the third and
                    fourth tranches and Euoro performed its obligation to open new herbal stores and
                    stores-in-stores as set out in Annex A to the Subscription Agreement. In my
                    judgment, since the original chain of stores had failed without the third and
                    fourth tranches, the infusion of the third and fourth tranches for the purpose
                    of opening new stores would in all likelihood have also ended in failure. In
                    other words, Euoro would be in the same position it was in at the time of the
                    trial had the third and fourth tranches been paid. It would therefore only be
                    entitled to nominal damages, had it been a party to the current
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     For the reasons stated, both Indulge’s
                    claim against Marashi and Marashi’s counterclaim against Indulge on behalf
                    of Euoro were dismissed. Since both parties had failed in their respective
                    claims, I made no order as to costs on the main action and the
                    counterclaim.</p>
