The funds might be collected on the online crowd-funding platform itself, or through a special bank account set up specifically for the funds to be held. Over time, various sums of monies might be collected online or transferred into the special bank account by anonymous donors who were unidentified or chose not to be identified. However, one would agree that even if these donors could not be identified, there was nevertheless an entrustment of monies to the fundraiser. There was no rational basis to find that entrustment could not be made out simply because the donors chose to remain anonymous, or that no records of the donors’ particulars were kept. Monies were given and collected for a specific cause or purpose as stated by the fundraiser, and if they were to be subsequently dishonestly misappropriated, that would, in my view, constitute an offence of CBT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The other legal issue which the DJ considered was whether the entrusting party must have legal ownership of the property entrusted. The DJ answered this question in the negative, and held that it was sufficient for the entrusting party to have some right (including a bare possessory right) which was then conferred on the accused person.

</div> However, given that the appellant has confined the scope of the appeal in his written and oral submissions, I have summarised below only the relevant portions of the respondent’s submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 First, the respondent submits that the identity of the entrusting party is not an element of the offence under s 406 of the Penal Code. Recognising the entrusting party’s identity to be an element of the offence of CBT would result in an absurd outcome where offenders are permitted to escape criminal liability solely because the source of the entrusted property cannot be traced to a specific person. Such an outcome cannot have been intended by parliament.

</div> Instead, if an accused person receives property from a third party on the latter’s instructions to deal with the property in a particular manner, entrustment under s 405 is made out; whether the identity of the third party was portrayed fictitiously to the accused person or not is irrelevant.

In this regard, the court should principally consider the general legislative purpose of the enactment by reference to any mischief that Parliament was seeking to address by it. In addition, the court should be mindful of the possibility that the specific provision that is being interpreted may have been enacted by reason of some specific mischief or object that may be distinct from, but not inconsistent with, the general legislative purpose underlying the written law as a whole.

The basis for such a requirement is that a trust which is created as a result of the entrusting party’s “fraud and deceit, particularly if the deceit touches on the trustor’s own identity”, is neither legitimate nor genuine. Consequently, no “valid or legally recognisable trust” is created.

In doing so, <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span><span class="font-italic"> v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bo</span><span class="font-italic">ck</span>”) at [42] makes clear that courts may have regard to: (i) the text of the relevant legislative provision and its statutory context; and (ii) extraneous material, subject to the guidance in ss 9A(2) and 9A(3) of the Interpretation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I turn first to examine the text of s 405 of the Penal Code. From the elements of CBT disclosed in s 405, it becomes clear that its object is to criminalise the dishonest abuse of trust reposed in a person in relation to property. Crucially, the accused must be “entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property”, but subsequently deals with the property in a dishonest manner. It is this knowing or intentional betrayal of an initial trust placed in the accused person which the law does not condone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The High Court’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other appeals</span> [2017] 4 SLR 474 (“<span class="font-italic">Lam Leng Hung</span>”) at [71] are instructive for confirming the purpose or object of CBT offences in the Penal Code: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is therefore clear that the conduct which the offence of CBT prohibits is a situation where a person who lawfully possesses property belonging to another, in breach of directions or without authorisation, dishonestly misappropriates, converts to his own use, uses or disposes of that property.

In that case, various authorities were also taken into account, including Yong Pung How CJ’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Hon Chi Wan</span><span class="font-italic"> Colman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [54] that “the essence of the offence [of CBT] lies in the entrustment of property to an employee and his subsequent betrayal of that trust”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative history of s 405 of the Penal Code</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I now turn to the extraneous material on the legislative history and background to s 405 of the Penal Code. While parties did not address me on the legislative history of s 405 of the Penal Code, such extraneous material may further elucidate the provision’s purpose or object.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The salient points on the legislative history of s 405 are as follows. s 405 of the Penal Code was first enacted as a provision within the Indian Penal Code in 1860 (“the 1860 IPC”), which was thereafter brought into force in Singapore by the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements in 1872 as Ordinance 4 of 1871 (Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <span class="font-italic">The Development of Singapore Law: Historical and Socio-legal Perspectives</span> (Butterworths, 1990) at p 180). As the current wording of s 405 of the Penal Code is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>with s 405 of the 1860 IPC, materials which illuminate the object and purpose of the latter are relevant to my decision. For reference, I set out the wording of s 405 of the 1860 IPC (Sir Walter Morgan and Arthur George Macpherson, <span class="font-italic">The Indian Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860): with Notes</span> (G. C. Hay, 1863) at p 365): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property, in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits “criminal breach of trust.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 While the 1860 IPC was being drafted, a similar codification effort of the criminal law was underway in England. The Commissioners on the Criminal Law of England (“the ELC”) released reports in 1839 and 1843 containing a draft digest of proposed criminal laws (“the Digest”) (<span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2019] 1 SLR 567 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>”) at [78(c)]). The Digest was never enacted into law. However, the Law Commission of India tasked with drafting the 1860 IPC (“the ILC”), was asked to review the draft IPC against the Digest in 1846 (<span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> at [78(d)]). Accordingly, in 1847, the ILC noted that the offence of “criminal breach of trust” in the draft IPC was the equivalent of “embezzlement” in the Digest (Indian Law Commission, <span class="font-italic">Copies of the Special Reports of the Indian Law Commissioners</span> (East India House, 19 November 1847) (“ILC 1847 Report”) at [553]). As such, materials which flesh out the scope of “embezzlement” in the Digest are relevant to the inquiry before me. For reference, I set out the Digest’s definition of the offence of embezzlement (Seventh Report of Her Majesty’s Commissioners on Criminal Law (Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1843) at p 257, Section 6 Art 1): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whosoever, being intrusted with the possession of any moveable property or fixture, being of the property of any other person, on any contract of hiring, or as a deposit, pledge or security, or for the purpose of keeping, carrying or repairing, or other purpose whatsoever, under an obligation to return, deliver up, or specifically apply the same, shall, with intent to defraud the owner, and in violation of such trust, embezzle such property or fixture, or any part thereof, shall incur the penalties of the 26th class; (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and in case the value of the property or fixture so embezzled shall amount to the sum of 1<span class="font-italic">l</span>., shall incur the penalties of the 17th class.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In particular, I find that the materials from the ILC and ELC speak with one voice: the object of the offence of criminal breach of trust and embezzlement is to punish persons who <span class="font-italic">dishonestly</span> abuse a trust reposed in them. The ILC, in 1847, said that CBT is “committed by a person who <span class="font-italic">intending</span> <span class="font-italic">fraudulently</span> to cause wrongful loss, or risk of wrongful loss, to <span class="font-italic">any</span> party for whom he is in trust…” [emphasis added] (ILC 1847 Report at [556]). The ELC said, in respect of embezzlement, that “the object of [embezzlement] is to punish carriers, and others, in respect of actual <span class="font-italic">fraudulent</span> appropriations, where the offenders, by reason of distinct possession, are not guilty of theft in taking the property” [emphasis added] (Seventh Report of Her Majesty’s Commissioners on Criminal Law (Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1843) at p 257, Section 6 Art 1 Notes). No mention was made of the need to prove the identity of the entrusting party or the victim of embezzlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As such, the views of the ILC and ELC support my articulation of the object of s 405 (at [29] above), which I derived from the text of the provision  itself. The gravamen of CBT and embezzlement, in the IPC and Digest respectively, is the accused person’s dishonesty in betraying the terms of entrustment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For completeness, I note that neither the ILC’s “Notes on the Indian Penal Code” in 1837 (see Thomas Babington Macaulay, <span class="font-italic">The Works of Lord Macaulay: Speeches</span><span class="font-italic"> – Poems &amp; Miscellaneous</span>, vol II (Longmans Green &amp; Co, Albany Edition, 1898) at pp 144–167), nor the Third Report of the ELC (Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1847) at p 24, which dealt with offences relating to “Fraudulent Appropriations” (at p 7), required the identity of the entrusting party to be proven for the offence of CBT or embezzlement. Finally, while the ILC, then led by Sir Barnes Peacock, published a final report on the draft IPC in 1856, there does not appear to be a surviving copy of this report (<span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> at [78(e)]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Broad or narrow view?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It bears emphasising that the interpretation which furthers the purpose of the written text should be preferred over the interpretation which does not (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bo</span><span class="font-italic">ck</span> at [54(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For the following reasons, I find that the broad view adopted by the DJ and the respondent better furthers the purpose of s 405 of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, the appellant’s narrow interpretation does not comport with the plain language of s 405. It is trite that there are limits to the purposive interpretation of statutes, as described in unequivocal terms in <span class="font-italic">Nation Fittings (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Oystertec plc and another suit</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 712 at [27]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I should reiterate that the court’s interpretation should be consistent with, and <span class="font-italic">should not either add to or take away from</span>, or stretch unreasonably, the literal language of the statutory provision concerned. In other words, the literal statutory language constitutes the broad framework within which the purpose and intent of the provision concerned is achieved. It is imperative, to underscore the point just made, that this framework is not distorted as the ends do not justify the means. Where, for example, it is crystal clear that the statutory language utilised does not capture the true intention and meaning of the provision concerned, any reform cannot come from “legal gymnastics” on the part of the court but, rather, must come from the Legislature itself.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, from the plain language of s 405, the identity of the entrusting party is not an element of the offence. Further, it is a rule of statutory construction that “[p]arliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain”. Courts should therefore “endeavour to give significance to every word in an enactment” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bo</span><span class="font-italic">ck</span> at [38]). I am therefore of the view that the words “in any manner” preceding the word “entrusted” support a wide reading of entrustment. With this in mind, it becomes clear that the appellant’s suggestion for the identity of the entrusting party to form an element of CBT is an unprincipled addition to literal language of s 405 of the Penal Code.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This leads me to my second reason for preferring the broad view. I regard adding the ingredient of proving the identity of the entrusting party as an unreasonable and unprincipled stretch on the language of s 405 because it stifles, rather than promotes, the object of s 405 of the Penal Code. Namely, bearing in mind the object of s 405 (see [29] above) I am satisfied that a person can be entrusted with property, within the meaning of s 405, even if she/he has been deceived as to the true identity of the entrusting party. In my view, entrustment is established if the appellant received possession of the property with the knowledge that: (i) the entrusting party had, at least, possessory rights to the property; and (ii) that he was to deal with the property in the manner instructed by the entrusting party (“the terms of the entrustment”). Even if the appellant was misled as to the entrusting party’s true identity, I fail to see how this renders the foundations of the entrustment, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the terms of the entrustment and the appellant’s knowledge of such terms, “imaginary” or “fictious”.  For instance, in the DJ’s online fundraiser example (see [12] above), just because donors choose to remain anonymous does not render the terms of the entrustment illusory. The fundraiser has still received monies on the promise to donors that their donations will be applied for a specific cause or purpose. In these premises, the anonymous donors have entrusted their moneys to the fundraiser within the meaning of s 405 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The corollary of an accused person’s cognisance of the terms of the entrustment is that once he deals with the property inconsistently with said terms, he has acted dishonestly by: (i) doing an act “<span class="font-italic">with the intention of causing wrongful gain to</span> [himself] or another person, or wrongful loss to another person, regardless of whether such gain or loss is temporary or permanent”; or (ii) doing an act which is dishonest “by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest persons and [knowing] that that act is dishonest by such standards” (s 24 of the Penal Code). A finding of such dishonesty is not predicated on the appellant knowing the true identity of the entrusting party. Accordingly, it would promote the object of s 405 (see [29] above) to adopt the broad view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Contrastingly, adopting the narrow view undermines the object of s 405. Regardless of whether the true identity of the entrusting party is proven, an accused person may dishonestly contravene the terms of the entrustment and perform the very mischief which s 405 of the Penal Code legislates against. The narrow view is an unjustified fetter on the scope of s 405.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  The appellant contends that the narrow view avoids “the absurd conclusion of the law validating the trustor’s fraud, while in the same breath, condemning the trustee’s breach of trust”.

</div>
</div> With respect, I am unable to agree with this argument for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The broad view does not condone or validate the trustor’s fraud. Assume that a thief, who conceals his identity, and the accused entered into an agreement for the latter to deliver a stolen artefact to the thief’s associate. The accused person subsequently applies the stolen artefact for his personal use. Under the broad view, the elements of entrustment are made out and CBT has been committed. However, this does not mean that the thief’s “fraud” has been validated. This becomes clear when we consider the thief’s rights, if any, against the accused in civil law. Depending on the precise circumstances (which I do not propose to hypothesise here), the agreement between the thief and the accused could be vitiated for a host of reasons including the doctrines of unilateral mistake, misrepresentation and illegality. In essence, punishing the accused person’s dishonest breach of trust in criminal law does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that the trustor’s fraud is otherwise validated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Third, the weight of authority lies in favour of adopting the broad view. I agree with the DJ that the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pittis Stavros </span>is instructive. In that case, the appellant faced a charge under s 408 of the Penal Code for dishonest misappropriation of 200 metric tonnes (“mt”) of marine fuel oil (“MFO”). The appellant was a chief engineer employed by a ship manager. At the material time, he was deployed on a large cargo ship (“the Vessel”) which was time chartered by V8 Pool Inc. (“the charterers”). The Vessel was to receive 500mt of MFO from a company called Costank Singapore Pte Ltd (“Costank”) (<span class="font-italic">Pittis</span><span class="font-italic"> Stavros</span> at [4]–[6]). The appellant initiated an arrangement in which the Vessel would only receive 300mt of MFO, and the remaining 200mt would be kept by Costank. The appellant would then receive a cut of the money overpaid by the charterers to Costank (<span class="font-italic">Pittis</span><span class="font-italic"> Stavros </span>at [2]). The appellant’s appeal succeeded in part, as his earlier conviction under s 408 of the Penal Code was substituted for a conviction under s 406 of the Penal Code given that the appellant was not a servant of the charterer (<span class="font-italic">Pittis Stavros</span> at [58]). However, what is relevant for our purposes is the court’s decision to amend the charge as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Prosecution’s case was that the charterers had entrusted the MFO, which they were purchasing from Costank, to the appellant. Accordingly, the original charge in <span class="font-italic">Pittis Stavros</span> read as follows (<span class="font-italic">Pittis Stavros</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [1]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You, [the appellant], are charged that you, on 10 January 2013, in Singapore, being a servant of V8 Pool Inc., to wit, the Chief Engineer of MV Sakura Princess, a marine vessel chartered by V8 Pool Inc., and in such capacity being <span class="font-italic">entrusted with dominion over property </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">belonging to V8 Pool Inc</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span>, namely Marine Fuel Oil, did dishonestly misappropriate about 200 metric tonnes of Marine Fuel Oil by engaging in a buy-back scheme, and in so doing you did commit criminal breach of trust in respect of such property, and as such you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The original charge thus identified V8 Pool Inc., the charterers, as the entrusting party. However, the court decided to amend the charge by deleting the words “belonging to V8 Pool Inc.”. Even though it found that V8 Pool Inc. was the entrusting party, the court remained unsure of whether the MFO truly belonged to the charterer at the time it was being transferred to the Vessel because the charterer had yet to pay for the MFO (<span class="font-italic">Pittis</span><span class="font-italic"> Stavros</span> at [41]–[45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Given that all essential ingredients of the offence must be reflected in the charge (<span class="font-italic">Assathamby</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Karupiah v Public Prosecutor</span> <br/>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 1030 at [9]), See JC’s willingness to remove the identity of the entrusting party from the charge shows that such identity is not an element of CBT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Indian case of <span class="font-italic">Som</span><span class="font-italic"> Narth Puri </span>relied on by the DJ also fortifies my conclusion above at [42] that entrustment may be established even if the identity of the entrusting party is unknown. In that case, an employee of the Indian Airlines Corporation was convicted under s 409 of the IPC for dishonest misappropriation of moneys from his employer. As regards the term “entrusted” in s 405 and 409 of the IPC, the Supreme Court of India held as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 405 merely provides, whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over the property, as the first ingredient of the criminal breach of trust. The words 'in any manner' in the context are significant. The section does not provide that the entrustment of property should be by someone or the amount [received] must be the property of the person on whose behalf it is received. <span class="font-italic">As long as the accused is given possession of property for a specific purpose or to, deal with it in a particular manner, the ownership being in some person other than the accused, he can be said to be entrusted with that property to be applied in accordance with the terms of entrustment and for the benefit of the owner</span>. The expression 'entrusted' in section 409 is used in a wide sense and includes all cases in which property is voluntarily handed over for a specific purpose and is dishonestly disposed of contrary to the terms on which possession has been handed over.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 From the above, it is apparent that the Supreme Court of India regarded the appellant’s receipt of property on specific terms to deal with it in a particular manner to be sufficient to establish entrustment; ascertaining the true identity of the entrusting party is unnecessary. The Supreme Court of India intimated that this conclusion flows from, among other factors, the words “in any manner”, as they supported construing “entrusted” in a wide sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Finally, the leading Indian text of Justice H K Sema and Justice O P Garg (eds), <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Dhirajlal: The Indian Penal Code</span> vol 2 (34th Edition, LexisNexis, 2018) at p 2820 also confirms the correctness of the broad view: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The word “entrusted” is not a term of law. In its most general significance, all it imports is a handing over of the possession for <span class="font-italic">some purpose</span> which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary right at all. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Fourth, I am unable to agree with the appellant that the illustrations to <br/>s 405 of the Penal Code exclude the possibility of entrustment being established if the identity of the entrusting party is unknown. The appellant suggests that two conclusions should be drawn from the illustrations to s 405 of the Penal Code:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) None of the illustrations “involve a trust created as a result of a trustor’s fraud or deceit.

However, I am unpersuaded by the appellant’s reliance on the illustrations because s 7A(a) of the Interpretation Act makes clear that illustrations are not exhaustive of a provision’s scope of operation. Instead, I give primacy to the plain language and object of s 405 of the Penal Code, which, as I have reasoned above, support the broad view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Fifth, I reject the appellant’s suggestion that the principle of <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> in civil law should be imported into criminal law in this case.

</div> Based on how the charge is presently framed (see [6] above), the court is not concerned with whether a valid and binding contract is formed between the appellant and the entrusting party. Having regard to the object of s 405 (see [29] above), I am concerned with whether the appellant misappropriated the money in a dishonest manner, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in contravention of the terms of the entrustment. For the avoidance of doubt, my remarks on this point have no bearing on the situation where the <span class="font-italic">actus </span><span class="font-italic">reus</span> of CBT is framed as a dishonest use or disposal of the entrusted property in violation of “any <span class="font-italic">legal</span> <span class="font-italic">contract</span>, express or implied, which [the accused] has made touching the discharge of such trust” [emphasis added] <br/>(s 405 of the Penal Code).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In addition, neither of the authorities cited by the appellant supports the importation of <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> into s 405 of the Penal Code for the purposes of this case.

</div> The appellant cites [2] of the grounds of decision in <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng </span><span class="font-italic">Kwan</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is important to recognise that civil liability for property claims has a direct bearing on criminal liability in respect of offences under Ch XVII of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), collectively known as “Offences Against Property”. Therefore, an understanding of the scope and content of property rights in civil law is essential for a proper interpretation of criminal law provisions relating to property offences. As fittingly observed by Lord Macaulay in his book, <span class="font-italic">Speeches and Poems, with the Report and Notes on the Indian Penal Code</span> (Riverside Press, 1867) at p 432:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is such a mutual relation between the different parts of the law that those parts must all attain perfection together. That portion, be it what it may, which is selected to be first put into the form of a code, with whatever clearness and precision it may be expressed and arranged, must necessarily partake to a considerable extent of the uncertainty and obscurity in which other portions are still left.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This observation applies with peculiar force to that important portion of the penal code which we now propose to consider. <span class="font-italic">The offences defined in this chapter are made punishable on the ground that they are violations of the right of property; but the right of property is itself the creature of the law. It is evident, therefore, that if the substantive civil law touching this right be imperfect or obscure, the penal law which is auxiliary to that substantive law, and of which the object is to add a sanction to that substantive law, must partake of the imperfection or obscurity. It is impossible for us to be certain that we have made proper penal provisions for violations of civil rights till we have a complete knowledge of all civil rights; and this we cannot have while the law respecting those rights is either obscure or unsettled.</span> As the present state of the civil law causes perplexity to the legislator in framing the penal code, so it will occasionally cause perplexity to the judges in administering that code. If it be matter of doubt what things are the subjects of a certain right, in whom that right resides, and to what that right extends, it must also be matter of doubt whether that right has or has not been violated.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[High Court’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Seng Kwan </span>in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, Steven Chong J’s (as he then was) remarks must be understood in the context of the question which arose in that appeal – whether a person can dishonestly misappropriate a piece of property which he had innocently found (<span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span> at [1] and [13]). To answer this question, Chong J had regard to common law principles, including personal property law and tort law, to determine what rights, if any, the innocent finder had in relation to the property he had found (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span> at [25] and [31]). In this regard, Chong J finally concluded (at [32]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since the finder has good title to the lost chattel as against the whole world except the <span class="font-italic">true owner</span>, criminal liability, if any, of the finder would depend on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whether the true owner can be ascertained and/or identified by the finder.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As such, it is clear that Chong J was considering civil law principles in relation to <span class="font-italic">title</span> to property and did not address his mind to the question of whether contractual principles like <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> have any place in the criminal law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Further, the article which the appellant cites, John G. Love, “Effect of Mistake of Person, Misrepresentation of Person and Impersonation in Crimes, Contracts and Negotiable Instruments” (1920) 68(4) University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register 387 (“Effect of Mistake”) does not advance its case. The appellant drew my attention to the following passage (Effect of Mistake at 387–388): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the law of crimes when A, who wants to kill B, mistakes X for B and wounds him, the courts have uniformly held A guilty on an indictment for assault and battery with intent to kill X. A wounded X because he believed him to be B whom he wanted to kill. He did not want to kill X, but he did intend to kill the person physically present before him. Since the person wounded was the person physically present before him, it follows that A intended to commit an assault and battery on X with intent to kill him. By this reasoning the intent, to which the courts give effect, is based on the facts of the assault and not on A's belief. Thus, the specific intent necessary for the crime was present.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question arises in the law governing the formation of executory contracts in the following type of case: A writes to B, using the name of X and represents himself to be X; B is induced to enter into negotiations with A on the faith of this representation with the view of forming a contract. There must be a meeting of the minds of the parties to make a valid contract. Therefore, the courts have held that the completion of the negotiations so entered into will not effect a contract. B did not know A, and X was the only person with whom he believed he was negotiating. B's mind never for an instant rested on A, and X was a stranger to the negotiations. There was no <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> between the parties to the negotiations. The effect of B's intention in this situation, based on the facts of the transaction, render the completed negotiations void as a contract. By the same reasoning, there is no contract effected when A represents himself to B, in person or by letter, to be the agent of X, a person of good repute, when in fact A is not the agent of X. On the strength of this representation B is induced to enter into negotiations with A as such agent. Here, again, B did not intend to contract with A, but entered into the negotiations relying on the reputation of X and intended to contract with X only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, as I have explained above at [56], based on how the offence of CBT was framed in the charge, the court is not concerned with whether a valid contract has been formed between the entrusting party and the appellant. The appellant may still have acted dishonestly, in contravention of the terms of the entrustment, even if he was misled as to the entrusting party’s identity. Subjecting the ambit of entrustment to principles like <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span> and doctrines like mistake and misrepresentation will undermine the object of the provision (see [44] above) and run contrary to the guidance in <span class="font-italic">Go</span><span class="font-italic">palakrishnan</span> not to treat “entrusted” as a term of law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the law to the present facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Applying the test for entrustment which I have set out at [42] above, I see no reason to disturb the DJ’s finding that the appellant was entrusted with $81,000 by Maria when he received the money from Melody.

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the General Division of the High Court (delivered by Vincent Hoong J):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome: The High Court dismissed the appeal against the appellant’s conviction and sentence for committing criminal breach of trust in respect of moneys he had received from an online persona.<em> </em></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For offences under s 406 of the Penal Code, the actual identity of the party entrusting the property in question to the accused (“the entrusting party”) need not be proven and/or known to the accused. To establish entrustment, is sufficient that the appellant received possession of the property with the knowledge that: (i) the entrusting party had, at least, possessory rights to the property; and (ii) that he was to deal with the property in the manner instructed by the entrusting party (“the terms of the entrustment”) (at <strong>[42]</strong>).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For offences under s 406 of the Penal Code, the entrusting party need not legally own the property, so long as the entrusting party had some right to the property, including a bare possessory right (at <strong>[66]</strong>–<strong>[67]</strong>).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background to the appeal</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In the court below, the appellant, Raj Kumar s/o Brisa Besnath, claimed trial to a charge of criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) under s 406 of the Penal Code involving the dishonest misappropriation of $81,000. The District Judge (“DJ”) convicted the accused and sentenced him to 13 months’ imprisonment. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. </p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Sometime in 2012, while using an online platform which he referred to as an “adult finder”, the appellant came across a persona called “Maria Lloyd” (“Maria”). The respondent accepted that Maria’s actual identity remains unknown. The appellant and Maria began chatting via email. Subsequently, the appellant agreed to receive $89,000 on Maria’s behalf in Singapore and to hand it over to a man in Malaysia. The appellant was informed by Maria that someone would call him and pass him the money. About two days later, the appellant received a phone call from a lady named Melody Choong (“Melody”), who told him that she would be passing the money to him.</p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Pursuant to their arrangement over the phone, the appellant and Melody met at the NEX shopping mall in Serangoon on 9 March 2013. There, the appellant received an envelope containing $81,000 from Melody. When contacted by Melody on 10 March 2013, the appellant informed her that he “[had] a problem in checkpoint [<em>sic</em>]” and was “coming on bail soon when [his] Friend bail [him] out …”. However, the appellant did not subsequently bring the money to Malaysia as instructed by Maria and pocketed it for himself.</p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant only made submissions against his conviction. The appellant challenged his conviction by arguing that there can be no “entrustment” under s 405 of the Penal Code unless the actual identity of the entrusting party is proven and known to the appellant (“the narrow view”). This is because the relationship of trust under s 405 of the Penal Code (“the trust relationship”) has to be legitimate or genuine. A trust relationship which is created as a result of the entrusting party’s fraud and deceit is not valid or legally recognisable. The appellant also argued that the principle of <em>consensus ad idem</em> applied, and that in the absence of <em>consensus ad idem</em> on the present facts, no trust had arisen under s 405 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In response, the respondent argued that the identity of the entrusting party is not an element of the offence under s 406 of the Penal Code. Recognising the entrusting party’s identity to be an element of the offence of CBT would result in an absurd outcome where offenders are permitted to escape criminal liability solely because the source of the entrusted property cannot be traced to a specific person. The interpretation advanced by the respondent was that “entrusted” refers to the transference of possession of property, or some proprietary interest therein, for some purpose (“the broad view”). On this view, the focus of the element of entrustment is whether the manner and the circumstances in which possession, or some other proprietary interest, was transferred to the accused disclose an identifiable purpose for the said transfer which the accused then dishonestly violates. This does not require ascertaining the actual identity of the entrusting party.</p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The respondent also addressed the court on a separate legal issue that the appellant did not address at the hearing. Namely, the respondent argued that the property in question need not be legally owned by the entrusting party. However, the entrusting party must have some sort of right to the property; a mere possessory right would suffice.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Court's decision</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Whether actual identity of entrusting party must be proven and known by appellant </span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>On a purposive reading of s 405 of the Penal Code, the court adopted the broad view of “entrusted” advanced by the respondent. The following outlines the court’s reasons for adopting the broad view (at <strong>[39]</strong>–<strong>[61]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>First, the appellant’s narrow interpretation did not comport with the plain language of s 405. From the plain language of s 405, the identity of the entrusting party is not an element of the offence. Additionally, the words “in any manner” preceding the word “entrusted” in s 405 support a wide reading of entrustment. With this in mind, it becomes clear that the appellant’s suggestion for the identity of the entrusting party to form an element of CBT is an unprincipled addition to literal language of s 405 of the Penal Code (at <strong>[41]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Second, the narrow view stifles, rather than promotes, the object of s 405 of the Penal Code (at <strong>[42]</strong>). From the elements of CBT disclosed in the text of s 405 itself, the provision’s object is to criminalise the dishonest abuse of trust reposed in a person in relation to property. It is this knowing or intentional betrayal of an initial trust placed in the accused person which the law does not condone (at <strong>[29]</strong>). Extraneous materials originating from the Law Commission of India tasked with drafting the Indian Penal Code and the Commissioners on the Criminal Law of England who drafted a digest of proposed criminal laws (“Digest”) also confirm that the <span>gravamen of CBT and embezzlement (offences which are equivalent to each other), in the IPC and Digest respectively, is the accused person’s dishonesty in betraying the terms of entrustment (at <strong>[32]</strong>–<strong>[37]</strong>).</span></p>
<p><span>10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Given the object of CBT is to punish an accused person’s dishonest betrayal of the terms of entrustment, entrustment is established if the appellant received possession of the property with the knowledge that: (i) the entrusting party had, at least, possessory rights to the property; and (ii) that he was to deal with the property in accordance with the terms of the entrustment (at <strong>[42]</strong>). </p>
<p><span>11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Third, the weight of authority lies in favour of adopting the broad view. The court agreed with the DJ that the High Court’s decision in <em>Pittis Stavros v Public Prosecutor </em><span>[2015] 3 SLR 181 </span>is instructive. See Kee Oon JC’s (as he then was) willingness to remove the identity of the entrusting party from the charge concerning s 406 of the Penal Code shows that such identity is not an element of CBT (at <strong>[47]</strong>–<strong>[50]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Fourth, the court was unable to agree with the appellant that the illustrations to s 405 of the Penal Code exclude the possibility of entrustment being established if the identity of the entrusting party is unknown. This is because s 7A(a) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) makes clear that illustrations are not exhaustive of a provision’s scope of operation. Instead, primacy is given to the plain language and object of s 405 of the Penal Code, which, as reasoned above, support the broad view (at <strong>[55]</strong>). </p>
<p><span>13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Fifth, the court rejected the appellant’s suggestion that the principle of <em>consensus ad idem</em> in civil law should be imported into criminal law in this case. Based on how the charge was framed (<em>ie</em>, as a dishonest misappropriation of property), the court was not concerned with whether a valid and binding contract was formed between the appellant and the entrusting party. Having regard to the object of s 405, the court was concerned with whether the appellant misappropriated the money in a dishonest manner, <em>ie</em>, in contravention of the terms of the entrustment. The appellant may still have acted dishonestly, in contravention of the terms of the entrustment, even if he was misled as to the entrusting party’s identity. Subjecting the ambit of entrustment to principles like <em>consensus ad idem</em> and doctrines like mistake and misrepresentation will undermine the object of the provision (at <strong>[56]</strong>). </p>
<p><span>14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In addition, neither of the authorities cited by the appellant supported the importation of <em>consensus ad idem</em> into s 405 of the Penal Code for the purposes of this case. In particular, <em>Wong Seng Kwan v Public Prosecutor </em>[2012] 3 SLR 12 (“<em>Wong Seng Kwan</em>”) was a case where Steven Chong J (as he then was) had regard to common law principles, including personal property law and tort law, to determine what rights, if any, the innocent finder had in relation to the property he had found (see <em>Wong Seng Kwan</em> at [25] and [31]). As such, it is clear that Chong J was considering civil law principles in relation to title to property and did not address his mind to the question of whether contractual principles like consensus ad idem have any place in the criminal law (at <strong>[57]</strong>–<strong>[61]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Applying the test for entrustment which </span>the court set out (see [10] above)<span>, there was no reason to disturb the DJ’s finding that the appellant was entrusted with $81,000 by Maria when he received the money from Melody. The appellant’s testimony at the trial below showed that he knew he was to deal with the $81,000 in accordance with Maria’s instructions (<em>ie</em>, the terms of the entrustment) and that Maria minimally had possessory rights to the money and therefore the authority to impose the terms of the entrustment on him (at <strong>[62]</strong>–<strong>[65]</strong>).</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Whether entrusting party must be legal owner of the property entrusted </span></em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>While the appellant did not make submissions on this issue, the court addressed it briefly as the respondent has addressed it in its written and oral submissions. Having considered the plain language and the object of s 405 of the Penal Code, there was no reason to depart from See JC’s holding in <em>Pittis Stavros</em> that the entrusting party need not legally own the property, so long as the entrusting party had some right to the property, including a bare possessory right (at <strong>[66]</strong>–<strong>[67]</strong>).</span></p>
<p><span>17<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>In the present case, even in the absence of evidence that the $81,000 was legally owned by Maria, the court was satisfied that Maria minimally had possessory rights to the money which she delegated to the appellant. The court agreed with the respondent that Maria’s right to possession is evidenced by “how Maria instructed the Appellant to meet Melody to receive the cash on her behalf, and what to do with the cash once he collected it…”. Accordingly, Maria had the authority to entrust the $81,000 to the appellant (at <strong>[68]</strong>).</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Appeal against sentence</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p>18<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Although the appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence, his counsel did not address the court on the issue of sentencing at the hearing. Nevertheless, the court dealt with the issue of sentencing briefly.</p>
<p><span>19<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Having considered the DJ’s reasons for the sentence, the court was satisfied that the DJ had duly considered the relevant sentencing precedents and arrived at an appropriate sentence after accounting for the differences in the aggravating and mitigating factors when exercising her sentencing discretion and that the sentence imposed is not manifestly excessive. The court was also satisfied that the DJ did not fail to consider any relevant legal principles when sentencing the appellant (at <strong>[69]</strong>–<strong>[75]</strong>).</span></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></font></p>
<p><span>20<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>For the reasons above, the court dismissed the appellant’s appeal against his conviction and sentence.</span></p>
