class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Justin Yeo AR:</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 This judgment concerns four applications for further and better particulars and the withdrawal of interrogatories, brought in two related patent infringement suits, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Suit No 1229 of 2016 (“Suit 1229”) and Suit No 190 of 2018 (“Suit 190”). In essence, the alleged patent infringers claim that the patent proprietor had failed to sufficiently particularise certain aspects of its infringement claims; the patent proprietor has denied this and further contended that, in any event, any further and better particulars can only be provided after the alleged infringers have responded to certain interrogatories. This has led to a procedural impasse, resulting in the four applications being taken out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I heard the four applications together on 19 August 2019 and now render my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Sun Electric Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”) is the registered proprietor of two Singapore patents (collectively, “the Patents”), namely: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Singapore Patent Application No 10201405341Y (“the 341 Patent”), in respect of a power grid system and method of determining power consumption at one or more building connections in the power grid system. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Singapore Patent Application No 10201406883U (“the 883 Patent”), in respect of a power grid system and method of consolidating power injection and consumption in a power grid system. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Sunseap Group Pte Ltd (“the 1st Defendant”), Sunseap Energy Pte Ltd (“the 2nd Defendant”) and Sunseap Leasing Pte Ltd (“the 3rd Defendant”) (collectively, “the Defendants”) offer electricity products via off-site power purchase agreements (“PPA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Plaintiff brought Suit 1229 and Suit 190 against the Defendants for alleged infringement of system and process claims in the 341 Patent and the 883 Patent, respectively. The common subject matter in both suits relates to the PPA between Apple Inc (“Apple”) and the Defendants, pursuant to which the Defendants would generate electricity from various solar-powered generation facilities and supply the electricity to Apple.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In Suit 190, the Defendants applied for further and better particulars of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “What each Defendant allegedly relies on that constitutes a ‘consolidation unit’”. This was the subject matter of my earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Sun </span><span class="font-italic">Electric Pte Ltd v Sunseap Group Pte Ltd and others </span>[2019] SGHCR 4 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>”). The Plaintiff objected to these requests on the basis that they required the Plaintiff to prematurely construe the term “consolidation unit”, and effectively sought evidence rather than material facts. In response, the Defendants contended that the requests were simply for the Plaintiff to provide at least one instance of each type of infringement alleged, as required by O 87A r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, Rev Ed 2014). In addition, Defendants’ counsel argued that the Plaintiff ought to further particularise the allegations concerning reliance on a “consolidation unit”, because the term had no obvious meaning in the English language and the Defendants were otherwise unable to identify which of their acts or operations were allegedly infringing in nature. For the reasons elaborated upon in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> at [17]–[25], I ordered that the Plaintiff provide the further and better particulars referred to at the outset of this paragraph. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Defendants subsequently sought, by way of a letter, further and better particulars in Suit 1229 that mirrored the particulars ordered in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>. The Plaintiff provided further particulars in Suit 1229, and filed further particulars in Suit 190 pursuant to the order in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>. The Plaintiff essentially particularised the Defendants’ alleged reliance on a “consolidation unit” in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Defendants collectively rely on one or more devices configured to process power metering data. Said device(s) may be relied on either alone or in combination with each other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 For certain other particulars, the Plaintiff repeated the above but with an additional sentence, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Defendants collectively rely on one or more devices configured to process power metering data. Said device(s) may be relied on either alone or in combination with each other. <span class="font-italic">Said device(s) can include but are not limited to the device(s) stated in the answers [above].</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(emphasis added)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In an exchange of letters, the Defendants objected to the sufficiency of the particulars provided, and the Plaintiff indicated a willingness to provide further particulars after the Defendants provide sufficient answers to certain interrogatories that were served without order of court (“the Interrogatories”). The Interrogatories are set out in an annex to this judgment (“the Annex”, which includes blackline edits to reflect the orders made at [34(a)(i)] below).   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Applications </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Dissatisfied with these developments, the Defendants filed the four applications that are the subject of the present judgment: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Summons No 2902 of 2019 (“SUM 2902”) in Suit 190, seeking a striking out of references to “consolidation unit” in the Plaintiff’s pleadings, or alternatively, for further and better particulars to be provided on pain of an unless order.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Summons No 2901 of 2019 (“SUM 2901”) in Suit 1229, seeking further and better particulars of references to “consolidation unit” in the Plaintiff’s pleadings, or alternatively, for the striking out of these references. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Summons No 2921 of 2019 (“SUM 2921”) in Suit 190 and Summons No 2922 of 2019 (“SUM 2922”) in Suit 1229, seeking the withdrawal of the Interrogatories and an order that the Plaintiff shall not serve further interrogatories without the leave of court. </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ arguments in SUM 2901 and SUM 2902</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In relation to SUM 2901 and SUM 2902, counsel for the Defendants, Mr Nicholas Lauw (“Mr Lauw”), contended that the particulars provided thus far left the Defendants none the wiser as to what they were using that allegedly constituted reliance on a “consolidation unit”. Given that the Plaintiff had failed to give at least one instance of each type of infringement alleged as required by O 87A r 2(2) of the Rules of Court, the references to “consolidation unit” in the Plaintiff’s pleadings ought to be struck out. In addition, Mr Lauw argued that the Plaintiff’s attempt to defer the provision of further and better particulars until after the Interrogatories were answered sought to “put the cart before the horse”. He emphasised that the Plaintiff ought not to be allowed to interrogate without first furnishing the requisite particulars (citing <span class="font-italic">Wright Norman and </span><span class="font-italic">anor v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and anor</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 452 at [16]–[17], where the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that interrogatories could only be raised on specific particulars of negligence). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Chan Wenqiang (“Mr Chan”), raised two main arguments:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, the Defendants ought to be able to identify the aspects of their operations which constitute reliance on a “consolidation unit”, if they obtain the assistance of a person skilled in the art. In this regard, Mr Chan pointed out that there was no evidence that the Defendants had consulted with experts on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, even if further and better particulars were warranted, the provision of such particulars should be deferred pending the Defendants’ response to the Interrogatories (citing <span class="font-italic">Prima </span><span class="font-italic">Bulkship Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation) and another v Lim Say Wan and another </span>[2015] SGHCR 10 (“<span class="font-italic">Prima </span><span class="font-italic">Bulkship</span>”)). </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ arguments in SUM 2921 and SUM 2922</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In relation to SUM 2921 and SUM 2922, there was no dispute over the general principles governing interrogatories as set out in <span class="font-italic">Prudential Assurance Co Singapore Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Tan Shou Yi Peter </span>[2018] SGHCR 4 (“<span class="font-italic">Prudential Assurance</span>”). The dispute focused on whether the Interrogatories were relevant and necessary in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Mr Chan submitted that the Interrogatories were relevant and necessary, given that they were specifically targeted towards parts of the relevant patent specifications (citing <span class="font-italic">Rockwell International Corporation and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Serck Industries Limited </span>[1988] FSR 187 at 205, which states that a plaintiff “may administer interrogatories framed on parts of the specification and ask the defendant whether he used the processes described therein and forming part of his invention, taking them step by step”). He emphasised that the Plaintiff had identified how each interrogatory correlated to a specified feature of the “consolidation unit”,

</div>
</div> and that the answers given would provide useful confirmation as to whether the Defendants had performed these functions by “manual” or “automated” means, in “hardware” or “software” format. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Mr Lauw argued that the Interrogatories ought to be withdrawn, for three reasons: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, the Plaintiff was using the Interrogatories to blatantly fish for particulars to support its alleged claim, in the hope that it would stumble upon something enabling it to plead what the “consolidation unit” is. It would not be fair for the Plaintiff to make its allegations first, and hope to subsequently substantiate its allegations through discovery or interrogatories (citing <span class="font-italic">Thomas &amp; Betts </span><span class="font-italic">(S E Asia) Pte Ltd v Ou Tin Joan and anor </span>[1998] SGHC 57 (“<span class="font-italic">Thomas &amp; Betts</span>”) at [22]–[24]). Specifically in relation to patent actions, Mr Lauw emphasised that it is “not the practice… to allow interrogatories to travel outside the particulars, and to embrace questions generally of a roving and fishing character” (citing <span class="font-italic">Aktiengesellschaft</span><span class="font-italic"> Für Autogene Aluminium Schweissung v London Aluminium Company, Limited </span>[1919] 2 Ch 67 at 75). </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, the Plaintiff was attempting to get the Defendants to answer the particulars that the Plaintiff had itself been ordered to provide in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>. The Plaintiff was in effect requiring the Defendants to define the Plaintiff’s case, and this ought not to be permitted.  </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Third, the Interrogatories were, in any event, irrelevant and unnecessary. In relation to the interrogatories in Suit 1229, interrogatories 1 and 2 pertained to an unasserted claim, while interrogatory 3 did not relate to material facts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In relation to the interrogatories in Suit 190, interrogatories 1 and 2 pertained to the Defendants’ denials of the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, rather than the Plaintiff’s pleaded case itself. In addition, interrogatory 1(b) in Suit 190 was irrelevant because the data in question was obtained from third parties rather than the Defendants. Interrogatories 2(a) and 3(a) were unnecessary because answers and documents have already been provided in Suit 1229 and the suits will be consolidated in due course. Interrogatory 3(b) was also unnecessary because the Defendants had previously responded to a similar request in the context of further and better particulars in Suit 190.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The four applications call for a determination of two broad issues: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the particulars provided by the Plaintiff were sufficient; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) if not, whether the Plaintiff’s provision of further and better particulars should be deferred pending the Defendants’ responses to the Interrogatories.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the particulars provided were sufficient </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The general principles regarding the provision of particulars in a patent infringement claim are well established. In gist, a plaintiff does not generally have to construe the terms and claims of his patent at an early stage of infringement proceedings, but is obliged to inform the defendant of sufficient particulars to enable the defendant to know the case to be met (see <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>at [17]–[21], and <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca AB (SE) v Sanofi-Aventis Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2013] SGHCR 7 (“<span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span>”) at [17]–[48], [58] and [61]). It is insufficient for a plaintiff to simply state that the defendant has infringed the claims of his patent; instead, the plaintiff ought to “condescend to describe the manner in which the acts which he alleges to be infringement were carried out” (see <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca </span>at [21]). The precise level and nature of detail that must be pleaded depends, of course, on the circumstances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In relation to the present case, I have already determined in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>that the Plaintiff ought to provide further and better particulars in Suit 190, in relation to what the Plaintiff says the Defendants rely on that constitutes a “consolidation unit”. From this decision there has been no appeal. The particulars sought in Suit 1229 by way of SUM 2901 are similar to those ordered in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>. In this regard, the Plaintiff has already provided particulars in Suit 1229 without an order of court to this effect, thus implicitly acknowledging that such particulars ought to be provided in the light of <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The question before me is whether the particulars provided thus far are sufficient. In my view, they are not. The particulars are furnished in the form of open-ended formulations that add little, if any, clarity to the understanding of the alleged “consolidation unit”. Indeed, the responses appear to introduce further ambiguity because the “device(s)” referred to in one set of particulars (see [7] above) may potentially be different from the “device(s)” referred to in another set of particulars (see [8] above). Overall, the particulars do not sufficiently particularise the manner in which the Defendants allegedly rely on a “consolidation unit”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I disagree with Mr Chan’s contention that with the help of experts, the Defendants would be in a position to identify how they (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the Defendants) may have relied on a “consolidation unit”. Quite clearly, the particulars are intended to facilitate an understanding of the <span class="font-italic">Plaintiff’s</span> claim; the <span class="font-italic">Defendants’ interpretation</span> of the Plaintiff’s claim is not of direct relevance. Even if the Defendants were to engage experts to determine what aspects of their acts and operations may<span class="font-italic"> </span>possibly constitute reliance on a “consolidation unit”, this would not be conclusive of what the Plaintiff’s claim really is. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [23]), albeit in a slightly different context, the Defendants’ experts may well be labouring under the impression that a “consolidation unit” comprises components A, B and C, while the Plaintiff may be proceeding with components X, Y and Z in mind. As such, there does not appear to be any useful purpose in requiring the Defendants or their experts to second-guess the ambit of the Plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I therefore find that the particulars provided by the Plaintiff thus far are insufficient, and that further and better particulars are necessary. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether particulars should be deferred pending the responses to the Interrogatories</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I turn now to consider whether the Plaintiff’s provision of further and better particulars should be deferred pending the Defendants’ responses to the Interrogatories. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is trite that a plaintiff should have adequate knowledge of his case before commencing a suit, and must plead his claim with sufficient particularity. His pleading should inform the defendant of the nature of the case to be met and enable the defendant to properly prepare for trial. A plaintiff should not usually be allowed to put forward vague and sweeping claims in the hope of particularising and substantiating his allegations through discovery or interrogatories (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Thomas &amp; Betts </span>at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 However, a court may allow a plaintiff to seek discovery or interrogatories before particularising his claims in certain circumstances (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Prima </span><span class="font-italic">Bulkship</span> at [34]–[47], where the court considered numerous English and Australian case authorities on this point). In particular, a plaintiff may seek discovery or interrogatories before particularising his claim where:  </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) pending discovery or interrogatories, the plaintiff has no knowledge of the particulars sought or has given the best particulars available to him; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the material facts in question are entirely within the knowledge of the defendant; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) despite the plaintiff’s lack of knowledge of the particulars pending discovery or interrogatories, there is nonetheless a “substantial foundation” for his claim.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In relation to interrogatories, the touchstone is whether they are “necessary” for disposing fairly of a matter or for saving costs (see O 26 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court). A summary of the instances where interrogatories may more readily be allowed or refused is found in <span class="font-italic">Prudential Assurance </span>at [13] and [14], of which the following are of particular relevance in the present case: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Interrogatories are more readily allowed where they have a direct bearing on the issues in dispute, delineate the precise matters in contention, can be answered without difficulty and can potentially dispose of entire lines of questioning (see <span class="font-italic">Prudential Assurance </span>at [13(b)] and [13(d)]). </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Interrogatories are more readily refused if they are oppressive in nature (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>they exceed the legitimate requirements of the circumstances at hand, or impose a burden on the interrogated party that is disproportionate to the benefit to be gained by the interrogating party), or amount to an attempt to fish for information in the hope of stumbling upon something that will support the interrogating party’s case (see <span class="font-italic">Prudential Assurance </span>at [14(a)] and [14(b)]). </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the present case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In the present case, the requirements set out at [24(a)] and [24(c)] above are met.

</div> This is not altogether unexpected or surprising, given that such information relates to the processes and systems used by the Defendants in relation to the electrical metering data. On the other hand, while such information may well be entirely within the Defendants’ knowledge, the Defendants themselves do not know what aspects of their operations are alleged to amount to reliance on a “consolidation unit”; indeed, it is precisely in relation to this issue that further and better particulars were ordered in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>. As such, the Defendants contended that unless the Plaintiff first particularises its reference to a “consolidation unit”, the Defendants are “in no position” to answer the Interrogatories because the Defendants would otherwise be forced to “describe every computer, device, computer program or ‘any other means’ used by the Defendants”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  18th Affidavit of Phuan Ling Fong (12 June 2019) at paragraph 28.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The complication just mentioned is perhaps unavoidable in certain patent disputes, particularly because the construction of patent claims is a matter to be left for determination at trial. This means that even though a defendant’s processes are entirely within his knowledge, he may not be in a position to provide the requisite information in the absence of sufficient particulars of the claim against him. At the same time, the plaintiff may well be unable to further particularise his claim, precisely because he does not have sufficient knowledge of the defendant’s processes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 A simple illustration may be useful. Party X (the patent proprietor) claims that Party Y (the alleged infringer) has infringed a claim in Party X’s patent. Party Y seeks further and better particulars of the asserted patent claim. Party X contends that he is unable to provide further particulars pending interrogatories, because he is otherwise unaware of the details relating to Party Y’s processes (which are entirely within Party Y’s own knowledge). Party Y argues that while he does have knowledge of his own processes, he is unaware of the ambit of the claim that Party X has brought against him, and therefore is unable to answer interrogatories relating to the claim. This results in an apparent impasse somewhat akin to the proverbial “chicken and egg” dilemma: with both parties operating under informational deficiencies, neither party unilaterally has all the information required to move the matter forward in a manner that will ensure the fair and effective resolution of the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 A practical approach for overcoming this apparent impasse is for the plaintiff to serve interrogatories that are narrowly and precisely framed, co-relating to specific aspects and features of the asserted claim in question. The interrogatories should neither require the defendant to perform a construction of the plaintiff’s claim, nor be of a broad, roving and fishing character going beyond the legitimate requirements of the circumstances at hand. With the information obtained, the plaintiff would then be in a position to further particularise his claim as set against the actual processes used by the defendant (which hitherto were solely in the defendant’s knowledge), thus enabling the defendant to understand more completely the case to be met and to better prepare for trial. This approach, properly applied, enables navigation of the impasse while achieving a balance that takes into consideration the various principles touched upon in [14], [15(a)] and [23]–[25] above; and in so doing, facilitates the fair disposal of the matter and the saving of time and costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The approach I have just outlined is directly applicable to the present case. Here, because the Plaintiff has already served the Interrogatories, the court is in a position to make a holistic assessment of whether it would be appropriate to order that further and better particulars be deferred pending the responses to the Interrogatories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I turn now to assess the Interrogatories themselves. The parts of the Interrogatories seeking information on whether various tasks are performed by “manual” or “automated” means, whether certain parameters are captured in a “Unit” (which is defined to include “system / apparatus / device / module / computer program / any other means”), and whether any such “Unit” exists in a “hardware” or “software” format, are relevant and necessary for moving the matter forward. However, some of the interrogatories have open-ended aspects (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>requests for the “manner or mode by which [a certain process is done]”, to “give a description of the said Unit(s), such as its technical attributes…”, or to “state exactly how and where…”), while others are not directly related to the features of a “consolidation unit” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>requests to “state where the said Unit(s) is located / situated / stored”). These aspects ought to be circumscribed or withdrawn, as marked in the blackline version in the Annex. In their modified form, the Interrogatories would pass muster based on the guidelines in [30] above.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Finally, I recognise that interrogatories 2(a), 3(a) and 3(b) in Suit 190 were not requested for the purpose of enabling the Plaintiff to provide the further and better particulars sought.

</div> Having considered the arguments on both sides, I allow these interrogatories to stand, for the following reasons: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, the Defendants have not justified why the impending consolidation of the two suits renders answers to interrogatories 2(a) and 3(a) in Suit 190 unnecessary. At present, both suits remain separate suits; furthermore, even if they are consolidated in due course, the answers furnished or documents disclosed in one suit may not automatically apply to specific questions raised in the other. If anything, the fact that the Defendants have taken the position that answers and documents have previously been provided in Suit 1229 suggests that the Defendants can furnish answers to interrogatories 2(a) and 3(a) in Suit 190 without much difficulty. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, in relation to interrogatory 3(b) in Suit 190, while the Defendants have objected on the basis that they had previously responded to a similar request in the context of further and better particulars in Suit 190, this appears to be based on a misunderstanding of interrogatory 3(b). </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In view of the foregoing, my orders are as follows: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) In relation to SUM 2921 and SUM 2922: </div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) I decline to order the withdrawal of the Interrogatories, save that: </div><div class="Judg-List-3 text-justify">(A) interrogatories 1(a), 1(c), 1(d)(i), 2(c)(i) and 3(c)(i) in Suit 1229 and interrogatories 1(a), 1(d), 1(e)(i), 2(b), 2(c)(i), 2(d) and 2(e)(i) in Suit 190 are to be amended by removing the open-ended aspects as identified in [32] above;
