In reply, the claimant and HK Tiger disputed that an agreement had been reached and cautioned the defendant against proceeding with the “sneak” sessions. They also, through their lawyers, demanded that the defendant cease any exhibition or exploitation of the film until a written agreement was entered into.

This turned on whether the conditions set out in r 4(1) of the SCJ(IP)R were made out. Before I address the applicability of these conditions to the present facts, I pause to consider the origins of the simplified process and how it could come into play for certain intellectual property claims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The history and objective of the simplified process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In 2015, the Ministry of Law appointed a committee (“the Committee”) to review the intellectual property dispute resolution system in Singapore in a bid to make this system more accessible, in particular for parties with fewer resources such as small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”).  Having reviewed the intellectual property dispute resolution systems in other major jurisdictions, the Committee recommended, among other things, the establishment of a dual-track intellectual property division within the High Court. This would comprise a “normal track” and a “fast track”. According to a final report published by the Committee, cases on the “normal track” would proceed with the rigour of a full trial, whilst cases on the “fast track” would prioritise speed and cost-proportionality: see <span class="font-italic">Final Report: Review of Singapore’s IP Dispute Resolution Framework</span> (20 July 2016) (Chairperson: George Wei J) (“the Final Report”) at para 2.3.3. This meant that cases on the “fast track” would be subject to more rigorous court control, with stricter limitations on the length of proceedings and caps on the costs and damages recoverable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 These proposed reforms to Singapore’s intellectual property dispute resolution system were made the subject of a public consultation held by the Ministry of Law in 2018. These reforms were well-received. The feedback received from practitioners revealed that intellectual property litigation tended to be more expensive than other forms of litigation, given its specialised and highly technical nature. This meant that the option of litigation could well remain out of reach for certain (smaller) enterprises which might need to turn to the courts to protect their intellectual property rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 These ideas regarding the “fast track” eventually took the form of the simplified process in Part 2 of the SCJ(IP)R, which came into force on 1 April 2022. Cases which are found suitable for resolution under the simplified process will receive all directions, as far as practicable, at a single case conference and be subject to fixed and capped costs. The rationale behind the simplified process has not changed since its conception in 2015. It is to ensure that “parties may continue to access the courts in a cost-effective and expeditious manner”, which “will be especially useful for less well-resourced parties such as individuals and SMEs, who may otherwise be unable to enforce their valid [intellectual property] rights”: see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 August 2019) vol 94 (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It should be noted that the simplified process bears much similarity with the function of the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (“the IPEC”) in the UK. As observed by the Committee in the Final Report, the IPEC is a specialised court within the Chancery Division of the High Court of England and Wales. It imposes limits on costs, damages and the length of proceedings, and ensures that cases benefit from early and active case management. Pertinently, the IPEC also takes into account similar factors in deciding if a case should be transferred to or from the IPEC: see <span class="font-italic">77M Limited v Ordnance Survey Limited</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2017] EWHC 1501 (IPEC) at [1]–[3] citing the UK Civil Procedure Rules, Practice Direction 30 at paras 9.1 and 9.2. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicability of the simplified process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The simplified process under Part 2 of the SCJ(IP)R may be triggered in one of two ways. The first is set out in r 5 of the SCJ(IP)R. This rule states that a claimant may trigger the application of the simplified process by filing and serving a form electing for the application of Part 2 and a form to abandon any claim for monetary relief in excess of $500,000. Once these forms have been filed, a defendant who intends to make a counterclaim must respond in one of the ways set out in r 5(2) to indicate whether it agrees or disagrees to the application of the simplified process. In any case, despite the election by the claimant for the simplified process to apply, the court may make an order otherwise. In deciding whether to do so, the court must invariably consider the factors listed in r 4 of the SCJ(IP)R which determine the suitability of a case for the simplified process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The second way to trigger the simplified process is set out in r 6(2) of the SCJ(IP)R. This rule provides that the court may, on its own motion or on the application of a party, order a case to be resolved pursuant to the simplified process. It follows that the court should only make such an order when the relevant conditions under r 4(1) are satisfied. Given that claimants may unilaterally trigger the application of the simplified process through the first method above, it is more likely that defendants<span class="font-italic"> </span>will be the primary parties availing themselves of the process in r 6(2) of the SCJ(IP)R. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The claimant in this case invoked the simplified process by serving the relevant forms stipulated in r 5(1). The defendant then made the present application for an order that the simplified process does not apply to OC 466. As mentioned above, the court will assess the suitability of a case for the simplified process pursuant to the conditions listed in r 4(1). This rule lists three cumulative conditions which must be fulfilled:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the dispute must involve an intellectual property right; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the monetary relief claimed by each party (whether in relation to an intellectual property right or otherwise) in the action does not or is not likely to exceed $500,000 <span class="font-italic">or </span>all parties agree to the application of Part 2; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  the suitability of the case for the simplified process having regard to the following factors:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) whether a party can only afford to bring or defend the claim under the simplified process; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the complexity of the issues; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) whether the estimated length of the trial is likely to exceed two days; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) any other relevant matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Having applied my mind to these conditions, I took the view that OC 466 was, indeed, a suitable case. I shall address each of the three cumulative conditions in r 4(1) in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 First, OC 466 involves an intellectual property right, as it is a claim for copyright infringement brought by the claimant against the defendant. The first condition was thus fulfilled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, while the defendant disagreed as to the applicability of the simplified process to OC 466, I was satisfied that the monetary relief claimed by each party in the action would not or was not likely to exceed $500,000. On the claimant’s end, it had filed and served the form to abandon any claim for monetary relief above $500,000. On the defendant’s end, I found that it was not likely that the monetary relief claimed for the counterclaims would exceed $500,000 as the defendant had failed to particularise its purported losses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In any case, I took the view that the defendant had no standing to bring its second counterclaim regarding the alleged infringement of copyright in “Hi! Mom”. This was because the defendant was not an exclusive licensee within the meaning of s 103 of the Copyright Act 2021. Under this provision, an exclusive licence is a licence granted “by the <span class="font-italic">owner or prospective owner of the </span><span class="font-italic">copyright</span>” [emphasis added] authorising the licensee, to the exclusion of any other person, to do an act that the copyright owner would have the exclusive right to do. Here, the defendant was not an “exclusive licensee” as it had obtained its licence from Passion, which had in turn obtained its licence from HK Tiger, the original exclusive licensee.

</div> it was clear that these threats did not cause the defendant to change its conduct or suffer loss in any way. The second condition was therefore satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Third, I found OC 466 suitable for the simplified process having regard to the relevant factors listed in r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SCJ(IP)R. The analysis under the third condition necessitates a consideration of all the factors in totality. In particular, the court should, in my view, place greater emphasis on the factors which are expressly highlighted in rr 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) to 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii). On the first factor set out in r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i), the fact that a party can only afford to bring or defend a claim under the simplified process will very much favour the application of the simplified process. The converse, however, is not true – the mere fact that one or both parties can afford to litigate a claim through the normal route does not necessarily mean that the simplified process should <span class="font-italic">not </span>apply: see Angela Fox, <span class="font-italic">Intellectual Property Enterprise Court: Practice and Procedure</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2021) at para 3-005. In any event, most cases will likely turn on the two related factors set out in rr 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) and 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) – the complexity of the issues and the estimated length of the trial. If either of these factors points away from the suitability of a case for the simplified process, that should be a strong indication that such a case is indeed unsuitable. On the present facts, three interconnected factors were at play – the complexity of the issues, the estimated length of the trial and the quantum of the parties’ claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The issues in OC 466 are neither legally nor factually complex. The claimant’s case turns on a single question: whether there is a legally binding agreement between the claimant and the defendant which permitted the defendant to distribute “Moon Man” in Singapore. The facts which affect the court’s determination of this question are limited to the communications between Mr Young and Ms Lee, which are largely confined to the relevant WeChat messages and e-mails. On the other hand, the defendant’s counterclaims, as noted at [28]–[30] above, bore no merit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The estimated length of the trial for OC 466 would also not exceed two days. This issue formed the main bone of contention between the parties. The claimant stated that it intended to call Mr Young as its sole witness and that Mr Young was willing to travel to Singapore to attend the trial in person.

</div>
</div> The defendant indicated its intention to call four witnesses – Ms Lee, Ms Shelin Ng (who is an employee of Passion), a representative from Kaixin and an expert witness. According to the defendant, at least four days were required for trial given that there was a need for interpretation for Mr Young and Kaixin’s representative, which would require additional time. Ms Lee, Ms Ng and the expert witness would also be required to testify on a wide range of factual issues. I disagreed with the defendant’s contentions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I indicated at the hearing that I was not inclined to permit the defendant to call its expert witness. The defendant argued that this witness, who was a third party experienced in the relevant trade custom, could testify that the sharing of the DKDM indicated that the licensor had already agreed for the relevant content to be distributed. I did not think that such testimony would be helpful in resolving the central legal question in this case. The existence of a trade custom pertaining to acts which are typically done <span class="font-italic">after </span>a particular type of contract has been entered into cannot be determinative of whether parties had indeed entered into such a contract in a specific case. To hold otherwise would be to fall victim to a logical fallacy. More importantly, it was clear that parties were still in the process of negotiating the key terms of a potential agreement at the point that the DKDM was sent to the defendant. This was evident from the fact that drafts of the distribution agreement were still being exchanged between the parties. I was therefore of the opinion that such expert evidence would not contribute to the central issue here. In any case, even if I was minded to allow the expert witness, the narrow point which he was called for was unlikely to take a substantial amount of time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I was also not persuaded that the cross-examination of the remaining four witnesses would last more than two days. Mr Young was prepared to travel to Singapore to testify, thereby eliminating delays caused by the giving of evidence through video-link. The cross-examination of Ms Lee and Ms Ng would unlikely be lengthy as nearly all communications between Mr Young and Ms Lee took place over WeChat text messages and e-mails.

</div> The defendant had also failed, in its submissions and in Ms Lee’s affidavit, to explain the relevance of Ms Ng’s testimony, given that the negotiations were primarily between Mr Young and Ms Lee. Similarly, Kaixin’s representative would only give evidence on the narrow point of whether Kaixin consented to the screening of “Moon Man” in Singapore or not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Finally, I took the view that the quantum of the claimant’s claim in this case rendered it a suitable case for the simplified process. The claimant asserted that the total gross box office revenue for “Moon Man”, which the defendant reaped as a result of its infringing acts, amounted to at least $153,905.54.

</div> The claimant’s damages are likely to be less than this sum. To my mind, the claimant’s legal fees and the time it expends on this matter would be disproportionate to the value of its claim if OC 466 was not heard on the simplified process. In general, the lower the quantum of the claims involved, the more likely a case will be suitable for the simplified process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Taking these factors in totality, I had no doubt that this was an appropriate case to be heard under the simplified process. As all three cumulative conditions in r 4(1) were fulfilled, I declined to make an order that the simplified process did not apply to OC 466. In other words, the case would proceed under Part 2 of the SCJ(IP)R. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It bears repeating that the ultimate purpose behind the simplified process is to increase access to justice by ensuring that costs and time spent are kept proportionate to the complexity and value of a claim. This ensures that the resources of the judiciary and the parties are appropriately allocated. It also encourages intellectual property right holders to defend their intellectual property rights without the attendant fear of facing a long-drawn trial and a disproportionately large sum of costs (especially in the event they lose). In my view, the courts play a crucial role in facilitating this process. This involves actively identifying and moving suitable cases under the simplified process. To this end, I emphasise that parties should not be allowed to hold the courts hostage by insisting on dragging a relatively simple matter through the normal route. The courts should therefore be assiduous in examining and, necessarily, estimating the means of the parties, the complexity of the parties’ respective claims and the time required for their resolution, even at an early stage of proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Finally, as I allowed OC 466 to proceed under the simplified process, I made no order for costs at this stage of the proceedings pursuant to r 9(2) of the SCJ(IP)R. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Dedar Singh Gill<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Toh Jia Yi (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the claimant and defendant in counterclaim;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Siew Hong (Eldan Law LLP) for the defendant and claimant in counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

The claimant, Tiger Picture Entertainment Ltd, was the exclusive licensee of the distribution rights, reproduction rights and publicity rights of “Moon Man”. In August 2022, it began negotiations with the defendant, Encore Films Pte Ltd, to discuss the possibility of entering into a distribution agreement in respect of “Moon Man” in Singapore. These negotiations occurred over the social media platform, WeChat, and e-mail. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">2 The parties disagreed on whether a binding agreement was reached. The claimant took the position that no contract was formed. The defendant, on the other hand, insisted that an agreement was entered into pursuant to the parties’ correspondence over WeChat and e-mail. It therefore proceeded to screen “Moon Man” in Singapore from 15 September 2022. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">3 The claimant then brought a claim against the defendant for copyright infringement in December 2022. The defendant denied liability and raised two counterclaims against the claimant for making groundless threats and for infringing the defendant’s copyright in another film. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">4 The court dismissed the defendant’s application and allowed the claimant’s claim to proceed under the simplified process: at<span class="font-weight-bold"> [37]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Overview of the simplified process</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">5 Cases which are found suitable for resolution under the simplified process will receive all directions, as far as practicable, at a single case conference and be subject to fixed and capped costs. The rationale behind the simplified process has not changed since its conception in 2015. It is to ensure that “parties may continue to access the courts in a cost-effective and expeditious manner”, which “will be especially useful for less well-resourced parties such as individuals and SMEs, who may otherwise be unable to enforce their valid [intellectual property] rights”: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[22]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicability of the simplified process</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 The simplified process may be triggered in two ways. The first is by a claimant filing and serving a form electing for the application of Part 2 and a form to abandon any claim for monetary relief in excess of $500,000. Despite the election by the claimant for the simplified process to apply, the court may make an order otherwise, having regard to the factors listed in r 4 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Intellectual Property) Rules: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[24]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 The second way to trigger the simplified process is where the court may, on its own motion or on the application of a party, order a case to be resolved pursuant to the simplified process. It follows that the court should only make such an order when the relevant conditions under r 4(1) are satisfied: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[25]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Considerations of the court in determining if the claimant’s claim was suitable for determination under the simplified process</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 There are three cumulative conditions which must be fulfilled before a claim is deemed suitable for resolution under the simplified process: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[26]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 The first condition is that the dispute must involve an intellectual property right. This was fulfilled here as the claimant is bringing a copyright infringement suit: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[27]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 The second condition is that the monetary relief claimed by each party (whether in relation to an intellectual property right or otherwise) in the action does not or is not likely to exceed $500,000 or all parties agree to the application of Part 2. The court held that this was satisfied. The claimant had filed and served a form to abandon any claim for monetary relief above $500,000. The quantum of the defendant’s counterclaims was unlikely to exceed $500,000. Not only had the defendant failed to particularise the losses sustained, it also had no standing to bring one of its counterclaims: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[28]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> – [30]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">11 The third condition requires the court to make a determination on the suitability of a claim for the simplified process based on all the factors in totality. The court held that greater emphasis should be placed on the three factors listed in rr 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) to 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Intellectual Property) Rules: whether a party can only afford to bring or defend a claim under the simplified process, the complexity of the issues and the estimated length of the trial. The fact that a party can only afford to bring or defend a claim under the simplified process will favour the application of the simplified process. That being said, most cases will likely turn on the complexity of the issues and the estimated length of the trial: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[31]</span>. On the facts, the issues in the claim were “neither legally nor factually complex”: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[32]</span>. The estimated length of the trial was also not expected to exceed two days: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[33]</span>. Most communications between the parties had taken place through WeChat messages and e-mail, which meant that the parties’ witnesses were not required to testify on a wide range of factual issues. Finally, the quantum of the claimant’s claim rendered it suitable for the simplified process: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[33] – [36]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 Taking the factors in totality, the court had no doubt that this was an appropriate case for the simplified process: at<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[37]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Concluding observations </span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 The ultimate purpose behind the simplified process is to increase access to justice by ensuring that costs and time spent are kept proportionate to the complexity and value of a claim.
