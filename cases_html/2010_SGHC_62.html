<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Sui Southern Gas Company Limited
                    (“SSGC”), is a public sector limited company incorporated under
                    the laws of Pakistan, whose principal business is that of a supplier of gas
                    throughout the South Pakistan provinces of Sindh and Balochistan. The defendant,
                    Habibullah Coastal Power Company (Private) Limited (“HCPC”), is a
                    corporation organised under the laws of Pakistan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By an Amended and Restated Gas Supply Agreement
                    dated 31 March 1996 (“the Agreement”) between SSGC and HCPC
                    (collectively “the parties”), relating to a power generation
                    complex (“the Plant”) in Skeikh Manda near Quetta, in the
                    Balochistan province of Pakistan, SSGC agreed to supply natural gas to HCPC in
                    order to allow HCPC to generate electricity at the Plant. Pursuant to a Power
                    Purchase Agreement with the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority
                    (“the Authority”), HCPC agreed to supply all the electricity
                    produced at the Plant to the Authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Unfortunately, a dispute arose between SSGC and
                    HCPC which they referred to arbitration, as required by the Agreement.
                    Essentially, HCPC claimed that SSGC had breached the terms of the Agreement by
                    failing to supply sufficient quantities of gas, causing HCPC to suffer a loss
                    and thereby entitling it to damages under the Agreement. SSGC disputed this
                    claim and averred that it had at all times complied with its obligations under
                    the Agreement, and thus it had incurred no liability thereunder. Under the
                    Agreement, the seat of arbitration was to be in Singapore and English law
                    governed the conduct of the arbitration. The three-member Arbitral Tribunal
                    (“the Tribunal”) rendered its award (“the Award”) on
                    1 December 2008. The Award was in all material respects in HCPC’s
                    favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       This originating summons was taken out by SSGC
                    in March 2009, SSGC sought an order that the Award be set aside pursuant to
                        s 24(<em>b</em>) of the International Arbitration
                    Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Ed) (“the Act”) and art 34 of the
                    UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model
                    Law”) which is set out in the First Schedule to the Act (which by virtue
                    of s 3 of the Act has the force of law in Singapore). It did so on the
                    grounds that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Award dealt with disputes or
                        issues not contemplated by or, alternatively, not falling within, the terms
                        of the submission to arbitration and/or contained decision on matters or
                        issues beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, in breach of
                            art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), Sch 1 of the
                        Act (“the scope of submission argument”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Award was in conflict with the
                        public policy of Singapore, in breach of art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii), Sch 1 of the Act (“the public policy
                        argument”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     a breach of natural justice had occurred in connection with the
                        making of the Award by which the rights of SSGC had been prejudiced, in
                        violation of s 24(<em>b</em>) of the Act
                        (“the natural justice argument”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       However, in written and oral submissions,
                    counsel for SSGC rightly chose not to rely on the natural justice argument, and
                    I shall say no more about that aspect of the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       HCPC contested the application. After hearing
                    the parties, I held that the application was to be dismissed, with costs as
                    taxed or agreed to be paid by SSGC to HCPC, and the Award upheld because SSGC
                    had not convinced me that any of its complaints was well-founded. I now set out
                    the grounds of my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In December 1995, the Government of Pakistan
                    increased the gas allocation to HCPC (“Gas Allocation”) for the
                    purposes of allowing HCPC to generate electricity at the Plant, which HCPC would
                    then supply to the Authority. The Gas Allocation was to be 21 million standard
                    cubic feet (“MMCF”) of natural gas on a “firm basis”
                    and an additional 4 MMCF on an “as and when available
                    basis”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Agreement was the means by which the Gas
                    Allocation was to be implemented. Pursuant to arts 3.1 and 3.2 of the Agreement,
                    SSGC was obliged to supply all of the Plant’s requirements for natural
                    gas, to the extent of the “Daily Contract Quantity”. Pursuant to
                    art 1.23 of the Agreement, the “Daily Contract Quantity” was
                    21 MMCF of natural gas per day, plus the “Additional Allocation
                    Gas”, subject to availability, of 4 MMCF per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The delivery of all such quantities of natural
                    gas was pursuant to the “Delivery Priority”, which was defined in
                    art 1.25 as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[HCPC’s] right to receive and [SSGC’s] obligation to deliver
                        Gas on a priority basis, consistent with [HCPC’s] Gas Allocation, such
                        that deliveries to the [Plant] will be the last non-residential deliveries
                        on [SSGC’s] pipeline system to be curtailed or reduced in the event of
                        a reduction or curtailment of deliveries on [SSGC’s] pipeline system;
                        provided, further, [HCPC] will be the first non-residential customer to have
                        deliveries restored when the conditions which caused the reduction or
                        curtailment are abated or remedied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The term “pipeline system” was not, however, defined in
                    the Agreement, and was one of the disputed matters before the
                Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Since 2000, SSGC had on a number of occasions
                    limited (or “curtailed”) the amount of gas supplied to the Plant,
                    which caused HCPC to have to burn alternative fuel in order to meet its
                    obligations to the Authority and, on occasion, to pay liquidated damages to the
                    Authority. It was as a result of these events that HCPC had claimed damages for
                    breach of contract against SSGC in the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Tribunal, in para 4.6 of the Award,
                    set out a list of 8 issues which it had to determine:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SSGC’s obligation to provide gas, on a true
                            construction of the Agreement;</div>

                        curtailment;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To the extent that SSGC had not met its
                            obligation to provide gas or honour its Delivery Priority, whether such
                            failure was excused by the practical limitation imposed by the pipelines
                            and equipment SSGC had employed;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To the extent that SSGC had not met its
                            obligation to provide gas, and had no contractually permitted excuse,

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To the extent that SSGC was in breach of its
                            obligations under the Agreement, whether HCPC was entitled to a defence
                            of set-off;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If SSGC was not in breach of the Agreement,
                            whether HCPC was in breach of the Agreement by effecting a
                            set-off;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(h)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the Tribunal should grant the damages and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Tribunal ruled in favour of HCPC, and it
                    is necessary to set out a summary of the material aspects of the Award which
                    SSGC sought to impugn. In para 12 of the Award, the Tribunal declared
                    that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SSGC had breached its obligations to supply the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SSGC was obliged to deliver 21 MMCF per day to

                            defined in para (e) below) to provide the additional 4 MMCF per

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the Award, the Tribunal expressed a view as
                    to whether the practical limitations imposed by the pipelines and equipment SSGC
                    had chosen to employ excused its failure to meet its obligations under the
                    Agreement (as interpreted by the Tribunal). The Tribunal was satisfied that no
                    practical limitations excused such failure, and at para 7.3 of the Award,
                    the Tribunal declared that:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     SSGC contended that the Award, and in
                    particular the declaration set out in <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above, was perverse, as it contained manifestly gross errors of law and imposed
                    impossible obligations on SSGC. As such, SSGC submitted, the Award should be set
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Perversity and irrationality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In its submissions, SSGC relied heavily on the
                    contention that the Award was perverse, manifestly unreasonable and irrational,
                    and should therefore be set aside. SSGC deployed this argument in two
                    ways.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In oral arguments before me, SSGC relied on it
                    as an independent ground on which the Award could be challenged: counsel for
                    SSGC submitted that the various circuits of the United States courts of appeal
                    had recognised that a “manifest disregard of the law” could
                    justify vacating an arbitration award. In support of the submission, counsel
                    cited <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v Jack
                        Bobker</em> 808 F 2d, 930 (2<sup>nd</sup> Cir, 1986)
                    at 933 and <em>Arthur H. Williams v Cigna Financial Advisors
                        Incorporated</em> 197 F 3d, 752
                        (5<sup>th</sup> Cir, 1999) at 757. Counsel for SSGC urged me
                    to recognise that, while mere errors of law committed by an arbitral tribunal in
                    the course of rendering an award could not invite the court’s
                    intervention, the court could nonetheless exercise a supervisory power when the
                    award was so manifestly unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so
                    decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In essence, counsel for SSGC was asking me to
                    recognise that the court could, independently of the Act, set aside arbitral
                    awards which were “<em>Wednesbury</em>
                    unreasonable” (see <em>Associated Provincial Picture
                        Houses v Wednesbury Corporation</em> [1948]
                    1 KB 223).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This contention was untenable as a matter of
                    principle and authority. Although the court undoubtedly has, on judicial review,
                    a power to quash an administrative decision when its substantive merits are so
                    absurd that no sensible person could have made that decision, I was of the view
                    that no such power is available where the decision in question is made by an
                    arbitral tribunal. This is because there is no appropriate analogy between
                    administrative and arbitral decisions. Review for <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness or irrationality exists because it
                    is presumed that, when Parliament gives an administrative decision-maker a
                    discretion, that discretion is not unfettered; rather, Parliament intends that
                    that discretion be exercised reasonably: see HWR Wade and CF Forsyth, <em>Administrative Law</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        9<sup>th</sup> ed, 2004), pp 349 – 365. This
                    presumption of rationality, however, finds no purchase in the context of private
                    arbitrations, where parties have contractually agreed to abide by the decision
                    of the arbitral tribunal. Parties must therefore be held to that agreement, in
                    the absence of any of the specific grounds for challenging an award set out by
                    Parliament in the Act. The ability to challenge an award for unreasonableness or
                    irrationality is not a ground set out in the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is settled law that in Singapore, the Act
                    provides the exclusive means by which a disappointed party to the arbitration
                    may challenge the eventual award: <em>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia
                        (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] SLR(R) 513

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter, <em>Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2004) point out at
                    9-35:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…there is no provision in the Model Law for any form of appeal from
                        an arbitral award, on the law or on the facts, or <em>for any
                            judicial review of the award on its merits</em>. If the tribunal
                        has jurisdiction, the correct procedures are followed and the correct
                        formalities are observed, the award – good, bad or indifferent –
                        is final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As the Model Law has the force of law in
                    Singapore (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>), it was not open to me to
                    set aside the Award on the freestanding ground that its substantive decision on
                    the merits was outrageous or irrational. The position of the courts in the
                    United States was adopted against a different legislative and legal background
                    and could not influence the decision here. Although counsel for SSGC submitted
                    that a perverse award went beyond a mere mistake of fact or law (against which
                    there is no right of appeal under the Act), I was of the view that any alleged
                    perversity of the Award was nonetheless ultimately a question of whether the
                    Tribunal had committed an error of law (e.g. by subjecting the Agreement to an
                    irrational construction) and/or an error of fact (e.g. by ignoring or
                    misunderstanding the factual matrix surrounding the dispute). Such an error of
                    law or fact, if indeed committed, did not cease to be such even if the error was
                    gross and manifest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Since any alleged perversity or irrationality
                    of the Award would still, in the final analysis, have involved errors of law or
                    fact, on the plain wording of the Act and on the authorities cited in <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> and <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above, there could be no right of appeal against such errors, independent of
                    s 24 and art 34 of Sch 1 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The main thrust of SSGC’s submissions,
                    however, was that <em>because</em> the Award was perverse
                    or irrational, it was <em>for that reason</em> outside the
                    scope of submission to arbitration and contrary to public policy and therefore
                    subject to challenge under art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii)
                    and 34(<em>b</em>)(ii) of Sch 1 of the Act. My reasons
                    for rejecting this contention are set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As I explained in <em>ABC Co v
                        XYZ Co Ltd</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 546 at [3], art 34,
                    Sch 1 of the Act deals with the recourse that a party to an arbitration has
                    when he is not satisfied with an arbitral award. Article 34(1) makes it clear
                    that recourse to a court against an arbitral award may be made <em>only</em> by an application for setting aside in accordance
                    with para (2) and para (3) of the article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The provisions which SSGC relied on
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    An arbitral award
                            may be set aside by the court specified in Article 6 only
                        if:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the party making the application furnishes
                                proof that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iii)   the award deals with a dispute not
                                    contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the
                                    submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters
                                    beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided
                                    that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can
                                    be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the
                                    award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to
                                    arbitration may be set aside; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the court finds
                                that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   the award is in conflict with the public
                                    policy of this State.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The scope of submission argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     SSGC submitted that in reaching the
                    conclusions that it did in the Award, the Tribunal construed the Agreement so as
                    to impose impossible obligations on SSGC which could not fit into any possible
                    and rational interpretation of the Agreement. Consequently, SSGC submitted, the
                    Award perversely went beyond the Agreement, and dealt with “a dispute not
                    contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to
                    arbitration”, or contained “decisions on matters beyond the scope
                    of the submission to arbitration”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     SSGC’s complaint was that the Award, by
                    construing the term “pipeline system” as meaning the entirety of
                    SSGC’s network of pipes, rather than restricting it by geographical
                    locality to the Quetta pipeline, imposed an obligation on SSGC to upgrade its
                    pipeline system by, <em>inter alia</em>, expanding the
                    pipelines, laying new pipes, diverting additional supplies of gas from
                    alternative gas fields and reconfiguring the flow of gas supplied by SSGC to
                    other regions in Pakistan. These, contended SSGC, amounted to “impossible
                    obligations” as it was physically, administratively and/or economically
                    impossible for SSGC to carry out these tasks, due to a variety of constraints
                    including: strict oversight by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority of Pakistan
                    (which would not approve the requisite capital expenditure); the impossibility
                    of reversing gas flowing southwards to Karachi so as to supply gas northwards to
                    Quetta; and the physical inability, due to the limited capacity of the existing
                    pipes, of SSGC to cope with additional demand due to long-term unforeseeable
                    population growth and short-term spikes in gas consumption by residential users
                    in the winter months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In addition, SSGC contended that the Award was
                    made in manifest disregard of the applicable principles of English law, insofar
                    as the Award stated correct principles of English law but did not apply them. In
                    particular, despite acknowledging that the Agreement had to be construed in the
                    context of the matrix of facts (including background knowledge available to the
                    parties at the time of contracting) and business common sense, the Award
                    allegedly ignored these matters in construing the term “pipeline
                    system” to mean SSGC’s entire network of pipes, rather than the
                    Quetta pipeline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I did not agree with SSGC that the Award was
                    outside the scope of the submission to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The law in this area was examined by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>PT Asuransi</em>, where the appellant
                    sought to set aside an arbitral award on the ground that it dealt with disputes
                    or issues not falling within the terms of submission to arbitration, in breach
                    of art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), Sch 1 of the Act.
                    In particular, the appellant contended that three critical findings made during
                    the arbitration proceedings (“the Second Arbitration”) were
                    inconsistent with the findings of an earlier arbitration (“the First
                    Arbitration”) between the same parties, and therefore went beyond the
                    scope of submission to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At [37] of the Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment, Chan Sek Keong CJ noted that art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), Sch 1 of the Act “merely reflects the basic
                    principle that an arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide any issue not
                    referred to it for determination by the parties”. Chan CJ then
                    quoted <em>London and North Western and Great Western Joint
                        Railway Companies v JH Billington, Limited</em>
                    [1899] AC 79, where Lord Halsbury stated at 81 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think any lawyer could reasonably contend that, when parties are
                        referring differences to arbitration, under whatever authority that
                        reference is made, you could for the first time introduce <em>a new difference after the order of arbitration was made</em>
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">[emphasis by Chan CJ]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the course of its judgment, the Court of
                    Appeal had to consider whether a particular issue (“the June 2001
                    meeting”) was within the jurisdiction of the tribunal presiding over the
                    First Arbitration (“the First Tribunal”). Chan CJ applied
                    Lord Halsbury’s test at [40] of the judgment to hold that the June 2001
                    meeting, being “<em>a new difference</em> arising
                    after the First Tribunal had been constituted” (original emphasis), was
                    not an issue within the original submission to arbitration, as such a new
                    difference would have been “outside the scope of the submission to
                    arbitration and accordingly would have been <em>irrelevant to the
                        issues requiring determination</em> in the First Arbitration.”
                    (original emphasis)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     After holding at [26] of the judgment that the
                    first critical finding made by the subsequent tribunal (“the Second
                    Tribunal”) in the course of the Second Arbitration was irrelevant to the
                    appeal, the Court of Appeal then had to consider whether the second and third
                    critical findings were within the scope of submission to arbitration of the
                    Second Tribunal. This, Chan CJ held at [44] of the judgment, required the
                    court to enter two separate but related enquiries:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…first, the ascertainment of the matters that were within the scope
                        of submission to the Second Tribunal; and second, whether the second and
                        third critical findings involved such matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Cumulatively, these passages from <em>PT Asuransi</em> make it clear that the correct approach to
                    be adopted, in response to a claim that an arbitral award (or part thereof) was
                    not within the scope of submission to arbitration, is for the court to
                    ascertain:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     the matters which were within the
                        scope of submission to the arbitral tribunal; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the arbitral award (or the
                        part being impugned) involved such matters, or whether it was a “new
                        difference” which would have been “irrelevant to the issues
                        requiring determination” by the arbitral
                tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The matters within the scope of submission
                    were set out in <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above, and one such
                    matter was whether SSGC’s breach of its obligations under the Agreement
                    was excused by reason of the practical constraints imposed by the equipment SSGC
                    was utilising.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Consequently, the Award clearly involved that
                    matter. As HCPC submitted, the <em>issue</em> of whether
                    SSGC was required by the Agreement to upgrade or reconfigure its pipeline system
                    in order to maintain sufficient gas supplies to HCPC, as well as the very
                    definition of the term “pipeline system”, was well within the
                    scope of submission to the Tribunal. It could not be said that this issue was a
                        <em>new difference irrelevant to the issues requiring
                        determination</em> by the Tribunal, when it was precisely one of the
                    issues the Tribunal had to, and did, consider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     SSGC’s argument was not strengthened by
                    its contention that the Tribunal’s pronouncements on this issue involved a
                    perverse and irrational construction of the Agreement, and resulted in
                    impossible obligations being imposed on SSGC. Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), Sch 1 of the Act, as Chan CJ explained in
                        <em>PT Asuransi</em>, is concerned with the
                    jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal to decide certain matters – it is not
                    concerned with the substantive correctness of the arbitral tribunal’s
                    subsequent decision on a matter that was properly within its jurisdiction. If an
                    issue is firmly within the scope of submission to arbitration, I fail to see how
                    it can be taken outside the scope of submission to arbitration simply because
                    the arbitral tribunal comes to a wrong, even manifestly wrong, conclusion on it.
                    As I emphasised to counsel during the oral argument, the setting aside
                    provisions of the Model Law relate primarily to ensuring that the process of the
                    arbitration is fair. They are not concerned with the substantive
                outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As for SSGC’s complaint that the Award
                    was made in manifest disregard of the applicable principles of English law, this
                    too was unsuccessful. Where an arbitral tribunal correctly states but misapplies
                    the law, this is an error of law (and does not cease to be such even if the
                    error is gross or egregious), in respect of which no challenge lies under the
                    Act: <em>PT Asuransi</em> at [57]. Insofar as SSGC alleged
                    that the Tribunal ignored “the matrix of facts”, this was an
                    allegation that the Tribunal committed an error of fact, in respect of which
                    there is also no remedy under the Act: <em>PT Asuransi</em>
                    at [57]. Neither contention has any effect on the scope of submission to
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In any event, I should emphasise that I was
                    not at all convinced that the Tribunal had construed the Agreement irrationally
                    or disregarded the applicable principles of English law. The Tribunal was fully
                    entitled to prefer HCPC’s contentions to SSGC’s after having had the
                    benefit of extensive submissions and expert evidence with regard to whether it
                    was necessary to limit the meaning of the term “pipeline system”
                    to a particular geographical location, and whether it was possible or feasible
                    to upgrade and/or reconfigure SSGC’s pipeline system, and it did not
                    thereby act irrationally, or erroneously disregard the factual matrix
                    surrounding the dispute. Even assuming, however, that this had been the case, as
                    I have explained in <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> - <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above, an irrational decision would not have
                    deprived the Tribunal of the jurisdiction it plainly had to make that decision,
                    and <em>a fortiori</em> a merely erroneous
                one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It also appeared to me what SSGC was asking me
                    to do was to delve into the facts and the evidence and the submissions in order
                    to conclude that the Tribunal had erred in both law and fact. I was not only
                    disinclined to pursue such a course; I was not empowered to do so. The Act does
                    not allow appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For these reasons, I was not persuaded that
                    the Award was outside the scope of submission to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The public policy argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     SSGC canvassed the same arguments in
                    submitting that the Award contained decisions on matters which were in conflict
                    with the public policy of Singapore, in breach of art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii), Sch 1 of the Act. In short, SSGC contended
                    that public policy required that arbitral awards could not be so perverse and
                    manifestly unreasonable that no reasonable tribunal could conclude that
                    way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I did not accept that the Award could be set
                    aside on the basis of art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii),
                    Sch 1 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As I stated in <em>VV v
                        VW</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 929 at [17], assertions of breach of
                    public policy cannot be vague and generalised. It is incumbent on a party
                    seeking to challenge an award on this ground to identify the public policy which
                    the award allegedly breaches and to show which part of the award conflicts with
                    that public policy: <em>John Holland Pty Ltd (formerly known as
                        John Holland Construction &amp; Engineering Pty Ltd) v Toyo Engineering Corp
                        (Japan)</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 443 at [25].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     No particular public policy of Singapore was
                    identified by SSGC as having been embarrassed by the Award, and in my judgment,
                    the public policy argument failed on this threshold point. Indeed, even on the
                    assumption that SSGC’s criticisms of the Award were well-founded, it is
                    difficult to see what particular public policy could be so
                identified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Counsel for SSGC submitted that, following the
                    Court of Appeal’s statements in <em>PT Asuransi</em>
                    at [59], public policy would operate when upholding an arbitral award would
                    “shock the conscience”, and that it would “shock the
                    conscience” that the Award required HCPC to be supplied with gas for its
                    commercial purposes when SSGC lacked sufficient gas to supply to residential
                    users in order that they could keep themselves warm in winter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This contention was misconceived. Paragraphs
                    5.25 and 5.26 of the Award clearly stated that under the Agreement, residential
                    users were to have priority over HCPC’s Gas Allocation. Further, a fuller
                    citation of the relevant paragraphs of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in
                        <em>PT Asuransi</em> will reveal that the public policy
                    argument could not succeed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    …The legislative policy under the Act is to
                            minimise curial intervention in international arbitrations. Errors of
                            law or fact made in an arbitral decision, <em>per
                                se</em>, are final and binding on the parties and may not be
                            appealed against or set aside by a court except in the situations
                            prescribed under s 24 of the Act and Art 34 of the Model Law.
                            While we accept that an arbitral award is final and binding on the
                            parties under s 19B of the Act, we are of the view that the Act
                            will be internally inconsistent if the public policy provision in
                            Art 34 of the Model Law is construed to enlarge the scope of curial
                            intervention to set aside errors of law or fact. For consistency, such
                            errors may be set aside only if they are outside the scope of submission
                            to arbitration. In the present context, <b>errors of law
                                or fact</b>, <b><em>per se</em></b><b>, do not engage the public policy of Singapore under
                                Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law when they cannot be set aside
                                under Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model
                        Law</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">59    Although the concept
                            of public policy of the State is not defined in the Act or the Model
                            Law, the general consensus of judicial and expert opinion is that public
                            policy under the Act encompasses a narrow scope. In our view, it should
                            only operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award would
                            “shock the conscience” (see <em>Downer
                                Connect</em> ([58] <em>supra</em>) at
                            [136]), or is “clearly injurious to the public good or …
                            wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of
                            the public” (see <em>Deutsche Schachbau v Shell
                                International Petroleum Co Ltd</em> [1987] 2 Lloyds’ Rep
                            246 at 254, <em>per</em> Sir John Donaldson MR), or
                            where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and
                            justice: see <em>Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co Inc
                                v Societe Generale de L’Industrie du Papier (RAKTA)</em>
                            508 F 2d, 969 (2<sup>nd</sup> Cir, 1974) at 974. This
                            would be consistent with the concept of public policy that can be
                            ascertained from the preparatory materials to the Model Law. As was
                            highlighted in the Commission Report (A/40/17), at para 297
                            (referred to in <em>A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on
                                International Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and
                                Commentary</em> by Howard M Holtzmann and Joseph E Neuhaus
                            (Kluwer, 1989) at 914):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In discussing the term ‘public policy’, it was understood
                            that it was not equivalent to the political stance or international
                            policies of a State but comprised the <em>fundamental
                                notions and principles of justice</em>… It was
                            understood that the term ‘public policy’, which was used in
                            the 1958 New York Convention and many other treaties, covered
                            fundamental principles of law and justice in substantive as well as
                            procedural respects. Thus, instances such as <em>corruption</em>, <em>bribery or
                                fraud</em> and similar serious cases would constitute a ground
                            for setting aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">[Original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in
                    bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is clear, therefore, that in order for SSGC
                    to have succeeded on the public policy argument, it had to cross a very high
                    threshold and demonstrate egregious circumstances such as corruption, bribery or
                    fraud, which would violate the most basic notions of morality and justice.
                    Nothing of the sort had been pleaded or proved by SSGC, and its ambiguous
                    contention that the Award was “perverse” or
                    “irrational” could not, of itself, amount to a breach of public
                    policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Further, as I have held in <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above that the Award could not be set aside
                    under art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), Sch 1 of the
                    Act, it follows from [57] of <em>PT Asuransi</em> that the
                    Award could not be set aside under art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii), Sch 1 of the Act either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Therefore, I did not accept the public policy
                    argument advanced by SSGC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In sum, I dismissed SSGC’s application
                    to set aside the Award because I did not think the Award was perverse and
                    manifestly unreasonable, and even if it was, there was no provision in the Act
                    which enabled me to set aside the Award on that ground <em>per
                        se</em>. Further, I was not convinced that, even if it could be said
                    that the Award was perverse, SSGC had demonstrated that the Award was outside
                    the scope of submission to arbitration (and therefore in breach of
                        art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), Sch 1 of the Act)
                    and/or that the Award was in conflict with the public policy of Singapore (and
                    therefore in breach of art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii),
                    Sch 1 of the Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In view of my conclusion, since SSGC had
                    failed in its application, I ordered that it should pay costs to HCPC as taxed
                    or agreed.</p>
