<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal involved one of the largest cases of
                    private sector corruption in terms of the total amount of gratification paid.
                    The respondent paid bribes totalling S$2,389,322.47 in 80 separate payments
                    between January 2003 and July 2009. The District Judge imposed a sentence of one
                    month’s imprisonment and a fine of S$15,000 (in default, one month’s
                    imprisonment) for each of the charges. Four of the imprisonment sentences were
                    ordered to run consecutively with the remaining sentences to run concurrently.
                    In total, the respondent was therefore sentenced to serve four months’
                    imprisonment (<em>ie</em>, 16 weeks imprisonment) and was
                    ordered to pay a total fine of S$180,000 (in default, 12 months’
                    imprisonment). The prosecution appealed on the ground that the District Judge
                    had erred in principle, in determining the factual matrix for sentencing, in
                    appreciating the material before him and in ordering a manifestly inadequate
                    sentence. Although this case involved one of the largest sums of bribes paid in
                    recent times, it was accepted by both counsel that the custodial sentence of one
                    month’s imprisonment per charge was perhaps the lowest to their knowledge.
                    At the end of the hearing, I allowed the appeal and enhanced the
                    respondent’s sentence to 40 weeks’ imprisonment in aggregate (10
                    weeks’ imprisonment per charge), with the fine remaining unchanged at
                    S$180,000. I had provided brief oral grounds when I allowed the appeal. These
                    are my detailed grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The respondent was the sole proprietor of AT35
                    Services, which was registered as a scrap metal and waste disposal business. The
                    respondent was acquainted with one Lim Kim Seng Gary (“Lim”). Lim
                    operated a company which provided cleaning services to IKEA’s restaurant
                    outlet located at Alexandra Road in Singapore (“the IKEA Store”).
                    IKANO Pte Ltd (“IKANO”), the local franchisee of INTER IKEA
                    SYSTEMS BV, owns and operates the IKEA Store.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In early October 2002, Lim made a proposition to
                    the respondent to enter into a business to provide food supplies to IKANO. At
                    the time, IKANO obtained its food supplies from a business known as
                    “Wholesale Food Trader”, which was operated by Lim’s
                    brother. Lim wanted to replace Wholesale Food Trader but he did not want to
                    appear to have an interest in the entity providing food supply services to IKANO
                    because Lim was already providing it with cleaning services. The plan,
                    therefore, was for the respondent to take over Wholesale Food Trader’s
                    business through AT35 Services. Lim and the respondent would each contribute
                    S$30,000 as working capital for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Some time thereafter, Lim introduced the
                    respondent to one Leng Kah Poh Chris (“Leng”) who was the Food
                    Services Manager of IKANO. The precise date when this meeting occurred was not
                    stated in the Statement of Facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It was then “<em>subsequently</em>” agreed that should Leng select
                    AT35 Services as IKANO’s food supplier, Lim and the respondent would
                    reward Leng with one-third of all profits earned by AT35 Services from its
                    business with IKANO. Again, the Statement of Facts did not indicate the precise
                    date when this agreement was reached. However, it was clear from the Statement
                    of Facts that IKANO selected AT35 Services as its food supplier <em>after</em> the corrupt scheme between Leng, Lim and the
                    respondent was hatched.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       From November 2002, AT35 Services supplied food
                    to IKANO. Initially, AT35 Services priced its food supplies competitively to the
                    price offered by Wholesale Food Trader. As time went on, AT35 Services began to
                    charge prices significantly higher than the market rate. From August 2005
                    onwards, a new business by the name of “Food Royal Trading”
                    (“FRT”) was set up to take over the supply of dry food items and
                    sauces to IKANO from AT35 Services. The same agreement of splitting profits
                    three-ways between Lim, Leng and the respondent applied to FRT’s
                    profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As was agreed (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>–<a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above),
                    one-third of the profits of AT35 Services and FRT were paid to Leng.
                    Between January 2003 and July 2009, a total of 80 such payments were made.
                    As mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above), the
                    total amount of the payments was S$2,389,322.47. Leng obtained his share of
                    profits in cash from Lim who, in turn, obtained the cash from the respondent.
                    The respondent obtained the cash by encashing cheques drawn on the accounts of
                    AT35 Services and/or FRT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The respondent was charged with 80 counts of
                    corrupt gratification of an agent in furtherance of a common intention with Lim
                    in contravention of s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act
                    (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”) read with s 34 of
                    the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The prosecution proceeded on 12 charges. The
                    total amount of gratification provided on the 12 charges was S$761,019.64. The
                    respondent pleaded guilty to the 12 charges and consented to the remaining
                    charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of
                    sentencing.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     IKANO brought a civil claim against the
                    respondent and others for unlawful conspiracy to injure IKANO. The respondent
                    has since paid a sum of S$1,000,000 to settle IKANO’s claim (part of the
                    payment was in cash and the remainder was set-off against sums owed by IKANO to
                    AT35 Services).</p>

<b>The District Judge’s
                        decision</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The District Judge sentenced the respondent to
                    one month’s imprisonment and a fine of S$15,000 (in default, one
                    month’s imprisonment) for each of the charges. The imprisonment terms on
                    four of the charges were ordered to run consecutively with the remaining
                    sentences to run concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The District Judge considered the prosecution
                    and the respondent’s submissions on the aggravating and mitigating factors
                    in considerable detail. The factors he considered were as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the need for general deterrence in corruption
                            cases;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the role and culpability of the
                            respondent;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the mischief caused by the respondent’s
                            payment of gratification;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the amount of gratification paid;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the degree of planning involved;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the duration of the offences;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the benefit acquired by the
                        respondent;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(h)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the fact that the respondent had made
                            restitution;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the personal hardship that might be caused to the
                            respondent as a result of his sentence (this did not carry much weight);
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(j)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the respondent’s good character, as
                            demonstrated by his charity work and testimonials on his character (this
                            did not carry much weight).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After considering these factors, the District
                    Judge decided that a short custodial sentence was warranted because of the need
                    for general deterrence and the large amount of gratification involved. However,
                    the District Judge was of the view that since the respondent was a first
                    offender, the length of the sentence was to be determined by considerations of
                    individual deterrence. These considerations would, however, in his view, have to
                    be balanced against considerations of general deterrence which apply in
                    corruption cases. A long custodial sentence was not justified because the
                    respondent was of good character and was genuinely remorseful as evidenced by
                    his cooperation with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau
                    (“CPIB”), his guilty plea and his making of
                restitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The District Judge then reached his decision
                    on the length of the sentence after considering the sentencing precedents. The
                    District Judge approached the sentencing precedents by comparing the culpability
                    of the respondent with the culpability of the defendants in the
                    precedents.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     For the appeal, the prosecution raised the
                    following arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The District Judge failed to give

                        intervention in sentencing</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It would be useful to briefly consider the law
                    on appellate intervention in sentencing. The Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 684 (“<em>Kwong Kok
                    Hing</em>”) reiterated (at [14]) that appellate intervention is
                    warranted in only the following four instances:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the trial judge had made the wrong decision as to
                            the proper factual matrix for sentence;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the trial judge had erred in appreciating the
                            material before him;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the sentence was wrong in principle;
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, or
                            manifestly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As to the fourth ground of intervention,
                        <em>viz</em>, the manifest inadequacy of the sentence,
                    the Court of Appeal noted that what is required is an “unjustly
                    lenient” sentence which would require “substantial alterations
                    rather than minute corrections to remedy the injustice” (see <em>Kwong Kok Hing</em> at [15] citing <em>PP v
                        Siew Boon Loong</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at
                    [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I considered the following issues:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The reasons for my decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentencing principles for private sector corruption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     V K Rajah JA in <em>Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng Thor</em> [2011] SGHC 134
                        (“<em>Ang Seng Thor</em>”) recently
                    reviewed the principles which should be applied in sentencing for private sector
                    corruption. I do not propose to restate the principles set out in <em>Ang Seng Thor</em>. It is sufficient for present purposes to
                    note the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     The main sentencing considerations
                        in corruption cases are deterrence and punishment (<em>Ang
                            Seng Thor</em> at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     The seriousness of the offence would increase
                        considerably in cases involving corruption of managers, particularly senior
                        managers (<em>Ang Seng Thor</em> at
                    [42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     The giver of
                        a bribe is generally as culpable as the receiver (<em>Ang
                            Seng Thor</em> at [45]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     The size of the bribe has a bearing on both the
                        culpability of the offender and the harm occasioned by the offence. The
                        larger the amount of the bribe, the greater is the corrupt influence on the
                        recipient and, hence, the greater is the subversion of the public interest
                        in ensuring fairness in transactions and decisions. The size of the bribe is
                        also a good indicator of the culpability of the offender. In the case of the
                        giver of the bribe, the size of the bribe demonstrates the amount of
                        influence that the giver wanted to exert on the recipient. Hence, in
                        general, the greater the bribe, the greater is the culpability of the giver
                            (<em>Ang Seng Thor</em> at
                    [46]–[47]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b><em>Did the District Judge
                        err in principle?</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The prosecution raised a number of arguments
                    which were, in essence, arguments that the District Judge had erred in
                    principle. The prosecution claimed that the District Judge failed to accord
                    sufficient weight to the following factors:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the need for general deterrence;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the fact that the respondent gave bribes on 80
                            occasions;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the fact that the total amount of bribes paid was
                            substantial; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the fact that the corruption spanned 6.5
                            years.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     My view was that the District Judge cannot be
                    said to have erred <em>in principle</em> by reason of the
                    weight that he accorded to the relevant factors. The District Judge did, in
                    fact, take into account the considerations referred to above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     First, the District Judge did not ignore the
                    need for general deterrence. He recognised that general deterrence was the
                    primary sentencing consideration in corruption cases. General deterrence was
                    also the reason why the District Judge decided that a custodial sentence was
                    warranted. He also took general deterrence into account in determining the
                    length of the custodial sentence (<em>PP v Andrew Tee Fook
                        Boon</em> [2011] SGDC 211 at [68]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    Given that the defendant was a first offender, the
                            length of the sentence would generally be determined by considerations
                            of individual deterrence (<em>although this would have to
                                be balanced against considerations of general deterrence</em>
                            in corruption cases)…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Second, the District Judge took into account
                    the duration and frequency of the offences although he did not consider this to
                    be a “significant aggravating factor” because of what he
                    considered to be the respondent’s “peripheral role” in the
                    corrupt scheme. I considered that his understanding of the respondent’s
                    role was not supported by the evidence before him. This is a matter that I have
                    dealt with in greater detail below (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>). For now, it is sufficient to note that the District Judge did
                    not err as a matter of principle. His error was in his appreciation of the
                    factual matrix for sentencing. This, in turn, meant that his <em>application</em> of the relevant principles was erroneous. However,
                    it cannot be said that the District Judge had erred in principle as a result. He
                    identified the correct principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Third, the District Judge took the amount of
                    the bribe and the fact that it was paid over an extended period into
                    consideration. However, he took the view that the amount of gratification could
                    not be viewed in isolation. He reasoned that the amount of gratification was
                    large because of the amount of profits earned by the business and the duration
                    over which the offences took place. Again, the District Judge did not err in
                    principle in taking this approach. He did not consider the amount of
                    gratification paid to be an irrelevant consideration. If he had done so, he
                    would have certainly erred in principle because it is well accepted that the
                    amount of gratification paid is a relevant sentencing consideration in
                    corruption cases (see [20(d)] above). Having taken the amount of gratification
                    paid into consideration, it was open to the District Judge to hold that this
                    factor should not be given much significance or weight <em>provided</em> that such holding was justified by other relevant
                    factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the District Judge err in appreciating the proper factual matrix
                for sentencing or in appreciating the material placed before him?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     My view was that the District Judge made three
                    significant factual errors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     First, the District Judge was not justified in
                    concluding that the respondent played a peripheral role in the scheme. While it
                    is true that the respondent was not the initiator of the corrupt scheme, he was
                    nonetheless the person who managed AT35 Services and FRT. He also monitored
                    their finances and periodically drew out cash to pay the bribes which were
                    transmitted, through Lim, to Leng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Second, the District Judge erred in taking the
                    view that the respondent was not as culpable as Lim and Leng. Even though the
                    respondent was not the person who initiated the plan to corrupt Leng, he was
                    very much a part of the corrupt scheme from its genesis. The Statement of Facts
                    reveals that the corrupt scheme was hatched between the respondent, Leng and Lim
                        <em>prior</em> to the selection of AT35 Services as the
                    food supplier for IKANO. Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Facts makes this
                    clear:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Shortly thereafter, Gary introduced the accused to Chris at a coffee shop
                        in Bishan. Gary informed Chris that AT35 Services was interested in becoming
                        IKEA's food supplier. Subsequently, it was agreed that <b><em>should</em></b> Chris select AT35 Services as the food supplier for
                        IKEA, Gary and the accused would reward Chris with one-third of any profits
                        earned by AT35 Services from their dealings with IKEA. The accused was aware
                        that it was necessary for Gary and him to reward Chris with one-third of the
                        profits as he was the one in charge of selecting IKEA's food supplier, and
                        that if they did not get Chris involved, they would not have been able to
                        obtain the deal with IKEA. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Furthermore, the Statement of Facts showed that the corrupt scheme was
                    an <em>agreement</em> reached between Leng, Lim and the
                    respondent. The respondent was a willing and active participant in the agreement
                    and was not merely acquiescent in a bilateral corrupt agreement between Leng and
                    Lim. Even if the respondent merely acquiesced in the scheme, the fact is that he
                    did so over a very substantial period. It was therefore erroneous for the
                    District Judge to have taken the view that the respondent was not as culpable as
                    Lim or Leng. This case undoubtedly fell within the general position that the
                    giver is typically as culpable as the recipient (see [20(c)] above). There were
                    no exceptional circumstances to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Third, the District Judge was wrong to have
                    found that there was no evidence that the respondent had corrupted anyone. This
                    was a curious finding particularly since every charge to which the respondent
                    pleaded guilty expressly stated that the respondent “did corruptly
                    give…[Leng]…a gratification”. The fact that the bribes
                    corrupted Leng is beyond doubt because it was an ingredient of the charges that
                    the respondent pleaded guilty to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Since the District Judge made factual errors
                    material to sentencing, it was open to me to intervene and determine whether the
                    sentence he awarded was appropriate in the circumstances. For the reasons given
                    below, I considered that the sentence ordered below was manifestly inadequate
                    and thus not appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the sentence manifestly inadequate?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I agreed with the District Judge that a
                    custodial sentence was warranted in view of the size of the bribe and the need
                    for general deterrence. Indeed, the respondent did not appeal against the
                    District Judge’s imposition of a custodial sentence even though his
                    primary argument below was that a fine should be imposed. Thus, the issue that I
                    had to consider was whether the length of the custodial sentence and the fine
                    imposed by the District Judge was manifestly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For convictions under s 6(b) of the PCA
                    where custodial sentences were imposed, the duration of the custodial sentences
                    range from six weeks’ imprisonment per charge in <em>Ang
                        Seng Thor</em> to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge in
                        <em>PP v Kang Hwi Wah</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 47
                        (“<em>Kang Hwi Wah</em>”). Before me, the
                    prosecution pressed for three to four months’ imprisonment for each charge
                    with an aggregate sentence of between 12 and 18 months’ imprisonment.
                    However, in the proceedings below, the prosecution pressed for a deterrent
                    sentence of between nine and 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge with
                    at least four sentences to run concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I agreed with the prosecution that the facts
                    before me were more serious than that in <em>Ang Seng
                        Thor</em>. Like the present case, the accused in <em>Ang Seng Thor</em> was not the initiator. Rajah JA nevertheless
                    disagreed with the District Judge that the accused was less culpable merely
                    because he was not the initiator (<em>Ang Seng Thor</em> at
                    [51]). Second, Rajah JA also held, contrary to the District Judge, that the
                    degree of culpability of the giver corresponds to the size of the bribes
                        (<em>Ang Seng Thor</em> at [47]). In <em>Ang Seng Thor</em>, the total bribe was about S$205,000 which was
                    less than 10% of the total bribes in the present case. Third, the bribes in the
                    present case took place on 80 occasions while in <em>Ang Seng
                        Thor</em>, there was a total of only four bribes. Fourth, in <em>Ang Seng Thor</em> the bribes were made to secure contracts
                    for the company and it was the company which directly benefitted from the
                    contracts. Here as a result of the corrupt scheme, the respondent benefitted
                    directly. He made a profit of at least S$2,389,322.47 (excluding allowances) for
                    which he made restitution of S$1,000,000 to IKANO. Admittedly, even in <em>Ang Seng Thor</em>, Rajah JA considered that the accused
                    stood to personally benefit from the corruption because he was entitled to a
                    maximum of 15% of a certain percentage of the company’s net profit before
                    tax (<em>Ang Seng Thor</em> at [53]). Nevertheless, I
                    considered it to be a point of distinction that the benefit to the respondent
                    was more directly linked to the corrupt scheme than was the case in <em>Ang Seng Thor</em>. Furthermore, the entire business of AT35
                    Services and FRT resulted from the corrupt scheme. The respondent was in the
                    waste management business prior to the corrupt scheme. It was clear to me that
                    but for the corrupt scheme, he would not have been awarded the contract to
                    provide food supplies to IKANO. For these reasons, it was plain and obvious that
                    the respondent’s culpability could not therefore be any less than that in
                        <em>Ang Seng Thor</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I also considered the following sentencing
                    precedents in the context of private sector corruption which were referred to me
                    by the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Public Prosecutor
                            v Lim Niann Tsyr</em> [2007] SGDC 38: The accused
                        pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly accepting gratification. Four
                        other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The bribes
                        received totaled S$27,000 and US$96,000. The accused had received the bribes
                        from contractors in exchange for awarding part of the work for a project to
                        construct a research and development complex located at North Buona Vista
                        Road which is known as the “Biopolis”. The accused was the
                        operations manager of one of the sub-contractors involved in the project.
                        The accused also faced one charge of cheating. The District Judge sentenced
                        the accused to three months’ imprisonment for one charge and six
                        months’ imprisonment for the other charge. In aggregate, he was
                        sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment (his sentence of four
                        months’ imprisonment for the cheating charge was ordered to run
                        consecutively with his sentence of six months’ imprisonment for one of
                        the corruption charges). The accused appealed against his sentence in
                        Magistrate’s Appeal No 10 of 2007. Rajah JA dismissed the appeal
                        without issuing any written grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Lim Teck Chye v
                            Public Prosecutor</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 525
                            (“<em>Lim Teck Chye</em>”): The
                        accused <em>claimed trial</em> to six charges of
                        abetment by conspiracy to corruptly pay gratification in contravention of
                        s 6(b) read with s 29 of the PCA. The bribes totaled S$6,300. The
                        accused was a director of a company supplying bunkers to vessels. He had
                        provided gratification to marine surveyors in relation to six bunkering
                        transactions. Yong Pung How CJ upheld the sentence of two months’
                        imprisonment per charge with the sentence on three charges running
                        consecutively (in aggregate, six months’ imprisonment) and a fine of
                        S$240,000. Yong CJ agreed with the District Judge that a custodial
                        sentence was warranted because the accused’s actions had adversely
                        affected public confidence in the independence of marine surveyors
                            (<em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at [68]). There were also
                        several aggravating factors (<em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at
                        [55], [61] and [73]). The aggravating factors included the fact that the
                        accused was a senior executive and had not shown remorse (<em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>Kang Hwi Wah</em>: The
                        accused faced one charge of corruptly receiving gratification in
                        contravention of s 5(a)(i) of the PCA. The bribe was in the amount of
                        S$1,500,000. The accused received the bribe in exchange for influencing the
                        reduction of the sale price of a warehouse sold by a bank to a joint venture
                        in which the accused had an interest. The accused was acquitted at the
                        District Court but was convicted on appeal by Yong CJ. I have already
                        noted that the accused in this case received a sentence of 12 months’
                        imprisonment (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above). I should
                        add that the accused also received a fine of S$100,000 and a penalty of
                        S$1,500,000. Incidentally, the written judgment of the High Court does not
                        specifically deal with the issue of sentencing. The sentence is noted in
                            <em>Practitioners’ Library: Sentencing Practice in
                            the Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p
                        820.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I should also refer to <em>Public Prosecutor v Eng Heng Chiaw</em> [2005] SGDC 98
                        (<em>“Eng Heng Chiaw”</em>), a public
                    sector corruption case referred to me by the respondent’s counsel. In that
                    case, the sentence for merely <em>offering</em> a bribe of
                    $500,000 to an officer of the Defence Science and Technology Agency was eight
                    weeks’ imprisonment. The bribe was rejected. My view was that the
                    respondent in the present appeal was clearly more culpable than the accused in
                        <em>Eng Heng Chiaw</em> for the reason that the bribe
                    in <em>Eng Heng Chiaw</em> was actually rejected. In other
                    words, the bribe did not in fact corrupt anyone. In contrast, the bribes in the
                    present appeal were paid and were paid over a considerable period. It should be
                    noted that the District Judge in <em>Eng Heng Chiaw</em>
                    did not consider it to be relevant that the accused had only made an offer
                    because he considered that the offence was fully constituted by the offer (see
                        <em>Eng Heng Chiaw</em> at [21]–[22]). While it
                    is true that the offence is constituted by the offer, in my view, it was
                    relevant to consider the culpability of the accused for the purpose of <em>sentencing</em>. All things being equal, a person who merely
                    makes an offer to gratify is less culpable than a person who actually pays the
                    gratification. The degree of public harm is also greater in a situation where
                    the gratification is actually paid as it would have the effect of corrupting the
                    receiver.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I also considered the mitigating factors
                    raised by the respondent. As is apparent from <em>Lim Teck
                        Chye</em> and <em>Kang Hwi Wah</em>, the
                    custodial sentences are typically higher when the accused claimed trial. Here, I
                    have noted that the respondent pleaded guilty at an early stage. He also
                    cooperated with the authorities after he was placed under investigation. It was
                    also relevant that he made restitution <em>to the satisfaction
                        of</em> IKANO. I should emphasise that it is not clear if the
                    respondent’s payment of S$1,000,000 was <em>full</em>
                    restitution. The respondent reaped profits equivalent to the gratification paid
                    to Leng (this was because the corrupt scheme envisaged profits being equally
                    split three-ways between the respondent, Lim and Leng – see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). The respondent also drew a monthly
                    allowance of S$2,000 from the retained earnings. However, it is fair to say that
                    these profits and allowances were earned, at least in part, by the provision of
                    food supplies by AT35 Services and FRT. On the other hand, it may be said that
                    the profits and allowances were inextricably linked to the corrupt scheme
                    because AT35 Services and FRT would not have obtained the deals to supply IKANO
                    with food supplies but for the corrupt scheme (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above). What was clear to me, however, was that IKANO was
                    satisfied with the S$1,000,000 paid by the respondent and had considered the
                    payment as a full and final settlement of its claims against the respondent (see
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). I considered this to be a
                    relevant mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As the sentence in <em>Ang Seng
                        Thor</em> was six weeks’ imprisonment per charge, as a starting
                    point, I considered that the sentence per charge in the present case could not
                    be less than six weeks’ imprisonment given my view that the respondent was
                    more culpable than the accused in <em>Ang Seng Thor</em>
                    (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above). I also took into account
                    that the respondent faced a total of 12 charges. The respondent’s
                    counsel accepted that it was not unfair for the sentences of four of the
                    charges to run consecutively. I agreed. I should note that since the sentences
                    for four of the charges would run consecutively, it may well be the case that
                    the individual sentences for each of the charges may fall below the <em>prima facie</em> benchmark. In <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v AOM</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1057, a case concerning rape,
                    I found from an examination of the sentencing precedents that where consecutive
                    imprisonment sentences were imposed, the individual imprisonment sentence for
                    each charge of rape fell below the <em>prima facie</em>
                    benchmark of 15 years’ imprisonment. I saw no reason why this observation
                    should not apply to offences under the PCA. After all, the underlying sentencing
                    principle in all cases is that the totality of the sentence imposed must fit the
                    overall gravity of the offences committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Having considered all the relevant sentencing
                    precedents cited to me by the parties and the relevant mitigating factors, I
                    reached the view that an appropriate sentence to impose per charge was 10
                    weeks’ imprisonment, with the sentence for four charges to run
                    consecutively and the remaining sentences to run concurrently. I saw no reason
                    to disturb the fines imposed below. In my view, the total sentence of 40
                    weeks’ imprisonment with an aggregate fine of $180,000 would adequately
                    reflect the gravity of the offences committed by the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It followed that the aggregate sentence of
                    four months’ imprisonment ordered below was manifestly inadequate. In any
                    case, appellate intervention was warranted on the ground that the District Judge
                    had erred in his appreciation of the material before him and in the proper
                    factual matrix for sentencing (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>–<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>,
                    above).</p>
