This includes considerations of the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) The circumstances of the offence. These include considerations of: (A) the presence of premeditation; (B) the use of force or violence; (C) the abuse of a position of trust; (D) the use of deception; (E) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (F) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) The harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological, which would usually be set out in a victim impact statement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Based on the consideration of the foregoing offence-specific factors, the court should ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place the offence within any of the following three bands of imprisonment (at [31]–[38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Band 1</span>: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts. Less than one year’s imprisonment should be imposed and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">caning is generally not imposed</span>, although this depends on the precise facts and circumstances of each case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Band 2</span>: This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves.

The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">higher end</span> of the band involves cases where there is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts</span>. It would also involve cases where there was the use of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">deception</span>. One to three years’ imprisonment, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">at least three strokes of the cane, should be imposed</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Band 3</span>: This includes cases where <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">numerous offence-specific factors</span> present themselves, especially factors such as the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust</span>, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.

Aggravating factors include the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, and relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance. Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused that relates to the offence (at [39]). The court should also consider whether there are grounds to enhance the sentence by way of the imposition of imprisonment in lieu of caning if the accused is certified to be unfit for caning because he is above 50 years of age at the time of caning (s 325(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC), or is certified to be medically unfit for caning (s 331 of the CPC) (at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 Accordingly, while the framework in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span> was proposed by See J in the context of offences of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code, I take the view that it should similarly be applicable to offences of outrage of modesty <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> under s 354(1). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 … the sentencing bands that would take into account the full spectrum of sentences that may be imposed for s 354(1) offences should be as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Band 1</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">: less than five months’ </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">imprisonment</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Band 2</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">: five to 15 months’ imprisonment</span>; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Band 3</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">: 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Attempted rape </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Section 376(2) of the Penal Code reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Whoever, in order to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence of rape against any woman —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) voluntarily causes hurt to her or to any other person; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) puts her in fear of death or hurt to herself or any other person,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and whoever commits rape by having sexual intercourse with a woman under 14 years of age without her consent, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 8 years and not more than 20 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Section 511 of the Penal Code reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever attempts to commit an offence punishable by this Code or by any other written law with imprisonment or fine or with a combination of such punishments, or attempts to cause such an offence to be committed, and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of the offence, shall, where no express provision is made by this Code or by such other written law, as the case may be, for the punishment of such attempt, be punished with such punishment as is provided for the offence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Provided that any term of imprisonment imposed shall not exceed one-half of the longest term provided for the offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Notwithstanding that the third charge is an <span class="font-italic">attempted</span> rape offence, the mandatory minimum of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane applies. The prescribed punishment for this offence is, therefore, imprisonment for a term of between eight and ten years with caning of not less than 12 strokes (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Shamsul bin </span><span class="font-italic">Sa’at </span>[2010] 3 SLR 900 at [1(a)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The prescribed punishment for rape under s 375(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) is the same as that under s 376(2) of the Penal Code at [6] above. Thus, the sentencing framework for rape offences laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”) at [39]–[74] is instructive. Briefly, the framework requires the sentencing court to first consider the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific </span>aggravating factors, including the accused’s abuse of position of authority and breach of trust, premeditation and vulnerability of the victim, in order to identify the appropriate sentencing band the offence falls within: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Band 1</span> (ten to 13 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane): These are for cases of rape which are at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness and feature no offence-specific aggravating factors or where the factor(s) are only present to a very limited extent and therefore have a limited impact on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Band 2</span> (13 to 17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane): These are for cases of rape which are properly described as being of a higher level of seriousness. Such cases would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors. A paradigmatic example of a Band 2 case would be the rape of a particularly vulnerable victim coupled with evidence of an abuse of position of authority (such as where the rape took place in a familial context).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">Band 3</span> (17 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane): These are for cases which, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors, present themselves as extremely serious cases of rape. They often feature victims with particularly high degrees of vulnerability and/or serious levels of violence attended with perversities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 After identifying the relevant sentencing band, the court should then have regard to the <span class="font-italic">offender-specific</span> aggravating and mitigating factors, such as offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, the offender’s remorse or his relevant antecedents (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>explained further at [53] that offences of rape disclosing any of the statutory aggravating factors in s 375(3) of the Penal Code will almost invariably fall within Band 2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri and others </span>[2020] 4 SLR 790, the High Court held at [102] that the sentencing framework for rape in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>could be adapted to attempted rape by halving the sentences in each band. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unnatural carnal intercourse</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Section 377 of the Penal Code reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> The Prosecution’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Prosecution proposes the following sentences for each of the eight proceeded charges as well as the global sentences:

Not least of these are the fear of confronting the offender, the humiliation and the destabilising emotional conflict and turmoil that keep relentlessly swirling in a victim’s mind. Others, as Judith Lewis Herman in <span class="font-italic">Trauma and Recovery</span> (Basic Books, 1997) points out, simply cope with the trauma by “walling off” the incident and choosing to ignore that it happened, or preferring to view the incident as their fault: see [49] and [50] below. In cases of incest, the victim may face additional pressure from other family members not to expose the rapist out of an instinctive albeit misguided reaction to preserve the unity of the family and to avoid the publicity and shame that inevitably ensues from such a conviction. A victim of incest may herself wish to avoid these consequences and therefore choose not to report the matter. That such pressures are real and palpable are more than amply borne out in many of the cases examined earlier where the perpetrators have repeatedly, remorselessly and brazenly satisfied their perverse and predatory sexual inclinations and lust: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">PP v MU</span> ([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where the perpetrator tragically raped his daughter over a period of ten years.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 That instances of rape should justly cause judicial disquiet is borne out by the fact that while current statistics show that crime has broadly fallen, the number of reported rapes for the months of January to June 2006 has not abated. More significantly, 95% of the reported rape cases involved rapists who were known to their victims. In my view, our courts would be grievously remiss if they did not send an unequivocal and uncompromising message to all would-be sex offenders that <span class="font-italic">abusing a relationship or a position of authority </span><span class="font-italic">in order to gratify sexual impulse will inevitably be met with the harshest penal consequences</span>. In such cases, the <span class="font-italic">sentencing principle of general deterrence must figure prominently</span> and be unmistakably reflected in the sentencing equation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It is well-known that it is difficult to prosecute sexual abuse in the family and often the offence is not exposed till after a long period. In this case the dark secret of the accused’s sexual assault remained dormant for more than 10 years. Even when the offences came to light on 12 December 2016, the Victims remained hesitant and reluctant to report the accused to the police. If it were not for PW1’s persistence, it is likely that the accused’s offences would never have been reported. I agree with the Prosecution that the accused’s abuse of trust in this particular case is especially grave. The accused capitalised on PW1’s and the Victims’ trust in him as the Victims’ father figure to sexually exploit the Victims while they were left in his sole care.

</div> The accused boldly exploited the trust reposed in him and sexually assaulted the Victims within the sanctity of their home over a number of years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I have already highlighted the need for deterrent sentences in cases of familial sexual assault at [32]–[34] above. The case authorities are also clear that the abuse of a position of authority and breach of trust are aggravating factors that warrant a deterrent sentence and pushes the offence in question to a higher band (<span class="font-italic">NF </span>at [39]–[40]; <span class="font-italic">GBR</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1048<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29(c)]; <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(b)]). As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [25], “those who have charge of children cannot abuse their positions for the sake of gratifying their sexual urges”. Thus, the accused’s abuse of trust justifies a deterrent punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Therefore, the accused had gravely abused the trust and authority reposed in him as the Victims’ “father figure” when he committed the sexual offences against the Victims in the safe sanctuary of their home.

When the victims are especially vulnerable because of their age, as is the case here, “[c]oncerns of general deterrence weigh heavily in favour of the imposition of a more severe sentence to deter would-be offenders from preying on such victims” (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(e)] citing <span class="font-italic">Law</span><span class="font-italic"> Aik Meng </span>at [24(b)]). Both the Victims were in primary school when the accused committed the most egregious sexual assaults against them. V1 was between seven and nine years old when the accused attempted to rape her, while V2 was 11 years old when the accused committed unnatural carnal intercourse in respect of V2. The accused started sexually abusing V1 when she was seven to nine years old and persisted in his assaults until she was 13 years old. Similarly, V2 was 11 years old when the accused started sexually assaulting him, and the abuse continued until V2 was 13 years old.

In <span class="font-italic">Kelvin </span><span class="font-italic">Lim</span> at [31], the Court of Appeal dismissed the notion that pedophilia ought to be a mitigating factor:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There were no significant mitigating factors in this case. The learned judge had found, rightly in our opinion, that paedophilia is not a disease or a physical illness but is a disorder. … <span class="font-italic">Even if paedophilia is an illness, we reject any suggestion that the sufferer cannot help it and therefore carries only a diminished responsibility for his actions. There is no evidence that paedophiles cannot exercise a high degree of responsibility and self-control.</span> The learned judge found that the appellant had a choice of whether to commit paedophilic offences against the victims, and chose to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I completely agree with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that pedophilia is not a mitigating factor. To suggest that the court should show leniency to an accused person who has pedophilia is profoundly incorrect and morally wrong. If pedophilia were a mitigating factor, it would have been an unfortunate misplaced sympathy which unduly condones such conduct and encourages pedophilic sexual offenders to commit sexual assaults in future. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I am unable to find any relevant offender-specific mitigating factors in the present case. The accused claimed trial and did not spare the Victims the ordeal of testifying in court. Thus, the sentencing discount which would otherwise be accorded to an accused person on account of his plea of guilt is inapplicable in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I shall turn to consider the appropriate sentence for each charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentences for charges involving V1</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Outrage of modesty</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The first and second charges</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The first and second charges involve the accused rubbing his penis against V1’s vaginal area skin-to-skin. This act involves a high degree of sexual exploitation. Having regard to the offence-specific aggravating factors set out at [42]–[47] above, I agree with the Prosecution that the first and second charges fall within the high end of Band 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework, with an indicative sentence of one year and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane each.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The fifth charge</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The degree of sexual exploitation in the fifth charge is moderate as the fifth charge involves the accused grinding his penis against V1’s vagina over her clothes. According to V1, the accused smelled of alcohol at the time. Given the offence-specific aggravating factors set out at [42]–[47] above, I find that the fifth charge falls within the lower end of Band 3, with an indicative sentence of  one year’s imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The sixth charge</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The sixth charge involves the accused inserting a cotton bud into V1’s anus, informing her that it was because he wanted to see if her anus was dirty. This was a form of deception, an aggravating factor on top of those set out at [42]–[47] above. There was also penetration of V1’s anus with the cotton bud. I find that the sixth charge falls within the lower to middle end of Band 3, with an indicative sentence of one year’s imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Sentencing precedents</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The above sentences are consistent with sentencing precedents.

The offender was the employer of the victim, a 19-year-old domestic helper. For the first charge, the offender used his right hand to grab the victim’s buttocks over her clothes. For the second charge, the offender first caressed the victim’s right leg and right hand, before he then caressed the victim’s breasts and vagina over her clothes. For the third charge, the offender caressed the victim’s breasts under her shirt and kissed her lips. The offences occurred over a period of three months. The offender was sentenced to a fine of $4000 for the first charge, and nine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for each of the second and third charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The outrage of modesty in the present case is more egregious, given the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused’s assaults, some of which were skin-to-skin, involve a higher degree of bodily intrusion than in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Chiew Kiat</span>.

Importantly, the accused was often left at home alone with V1 when PW1 was out of the home working for long hours. The accused’s outrage of V1’s modesty in the sanctity of the home is a grave abuse of the trust and authority reposed in him. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The period of abuse in the present case is around four to five years (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 2000 or 2001 in the first charge to 2005 in the sixth charge).

V1 testified during the trial that the accused had given her a glass of water to drink, which V1 described as tasting “off” and “more bitter than usual” (see the Main Judgment at [87]). This suggests that the accused had spiked the glass of water. V1 then fell asleep. When she woke up, she found herself naked and lying face-down on the bed with her legs tucked under her, like the Muslim prayer position, with her buttocks in the air. The accused then went on top of V1 and attempted to penetrate her (see the Main Judgment at [87]–[88]). It is clear from V1’s testimony that the accused had specifically premeditated this offence and taken steps to render V1 defenceless and in an especially vulnerable position. This is an aggravating factor. Coupled with the aggravating factors identified at [42]–[47] above, I find that the third charge falls within the middle to high end of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework. A sentence of eight years and six months’ imprisonment and the mandatory 12 strokes of the cane is appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentences for charges involving V2</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Unnatural carnal intercourse (the ninth charge)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The ninth charge is a composite charge encapsulating multiple penetrative offences committed against V2, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, penile-oral and penile-anal penetration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The accused attempted to hypnotise V2 before sexually assaulting V2.

The offender had fellated eight victims aged between 12 and 15 years old over a period of 12 months. The Court of Appeal at [23] sentenced the offender to five years’ imprisonment per charge, observing at [21] that an offender performing fellatio on his victims “stands at the bottom of the scale” of gravity as compared to anal intercourse or where the offender coerced a young victim to perform fellatio on him. The Court of Appeal ordered four sentences to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The facts in the present case are more aggravated than those in <span class="font-italic">Adam</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused in the present case claimed trial as opposed to the offender in <span class="font-italic">Adam </span>who pleaded guilty.

The case was adjourned for the accused to be medically examined on whether he is fit for caning. I was informed that the accused had refused to be medically examined. Accordingly, I shall proceed to impose caning as I know that the accused will have to be medically examined before caning is executed. If, by then, he is found to be medically unfit for caning, the case will be brought to my attention for further directions regarding the order of caning on the accused. Accordingly, I impose the statutory maximum of 24 strokes of the cane although the aggregate number of strokes of the cane for the eight proceeded charges is 27.
