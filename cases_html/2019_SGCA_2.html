Indeed, it was her contention that she ought to have been acquitted of the charge precisely because she was dishonest at such time of initial possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The person in question, Ho Man Yuk (“the Applicant”), was convicted in the State Courts on one count of abetment by conspiracy to dishonestly misappropriate monies under s 403 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Code”). On the premise of this conviction, she was also convicted on several counts under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”) for money laundering in respect of the monies which had been misappropriated. On her appeal to the High Court, the convictions were upheld. She thereafter applied for leave to refer certain questions of law to this Court. At the conclusion of the leave hearing, she was given leave to refer the following question for determination:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether a conviction for dishonest misappropriation under s 403 of the [Code] can be made out only if the accused person had an innocent or neutral state of mind when he first came into possession of the property in question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We will refer to this question as the “innocent possession question” or the “question referred” as the context may require and to the offence itself as “dishonest misappropriation”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the leave hearing, we also directed the parties to address five ancillary questions concerning the consequences that might ensue if the question referred was answered in the affirmative. These consequences included the possibility of alternative charges based on the same facts and an exploration of the Court’s powers and conduct in that regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In this reference, the Applicant argued that the question referred should be answered in the affirmative. According to her, an essential element of the offence of dishonest misappropriation was that the misappropriating person had to have come into possession of the relevant property in an innocent or neutral manner. In her case, however, she had known from the outset that she was not entitled to receive the monies. She was therefore dishonest, rather than innocent or neutral, at the time of initial possession. Accordingly, the convictions under the Code and the CDSA should be set aside. The Prosecution took the opposing position and argued that the question referred should be answered in the negative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the end of the hearing of this reference on 14 August 2018, we answered the question referred in the negative. In our judgment, it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> necessary, in order to make out a conviction under s 403 of the Code, to establish that the accused person had an innocent or neutral state of mind when he or she first came into possession of the property in question. Accordingly, we affirmed the convictions. We now provide our full grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Applicant is a Chinese national. She committed the offences with two co-offenders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Shaikh Farid, a male Indian national, who was convicted of one similar charge under s 403 of the Code and 26 counts of money laundering under the CDSA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Shaikh Shabana Bi, a female Indian national, who was convicted of one similar charge under s 403 of the Code and three counts of money laundering under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 We will refer to the two co-offenders as the “Co-Offenders”, and the three offenders collectively as “the Offenders”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Offenders were members of a rewards programme at the Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) casino. As members, they were eligible to participate in MBS’ marketing promotions. One such promotion was the “Sands Bonus Dollars Rewards” promotion, under which eligible members were entitled to a limited number of Sands Bonus Dollars (“SBDs”) that could be redeemed for an equivalent number of Free Play Credits (“FPCs”) at electronic kiosks situated in the casino. The FPCs had no monetary value in themselves, but could be used for gambling at the gaming machines located in the premises. For this purpose, each EPC was credited with a value of $1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 13 April 2014, the Applicant swiped her membership card at a kiosk in the casino and selected the “Sands Bonus Dollars Rewards” icon. The kiosk screen showed “You are eligible for $100 of Free Play Offer! Redeem offer now?” The Applicant selected “Yes, Redeem Now” and entered her personal identification number. An error message appeared which showed: “Sorry, service seems to be unavailable. Please try after sometime”. She exited the screen showing the error message, and tried to swipe her card several more times, but the same error message continued to appear. Thereafter, she left the casino.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The next day, 14 April 2014, the Applicant returned to the casino. She swiped her card at a kiosk and discovered that $800 worth of FPCs had been credited into her account. Apparently, on the previous day, even though an error message had showed each time the Applicant tried to redeem her FPCs, 100 FPCs were in fact credited to her account on every such occasion. Using these FPCs, the Applicant gambled at electronic roulette machines in the MBS casino. At the end of each game, she was given a paper slip stating her winnings which she then encashed at “Ticket In, Ticket Out” (“TITO”) machines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Later that same day, the Applicant called the Co-Offenders and asked them to join her at the casino. On their arrival, the Applicant told them about what she had done that afternoon. The Offenders then repeated numerous cycles of swiping, gambling, and encashing their winnings using the Applicant’s membership card.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In total, the Applicant’s membership card was swiped 10,293 times during the seven-day period from 14 to 20 April 2014 leading to 1,029,300 FPCs being credited to the card. These FPCs were utilised for games at various electronic roulette machines at the casino, netting the Offenders winnings which they were able to encash at the TITO machines. In total, the Offenders obtained $875,133.56 (“the Monies”) from the TITO machines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 20 April 2014, the Applicant was detained by the police. She managed to message the Co-Offenders that the “police [were] coming”. The Co-Offenders then, on their own accord, took $500,000 of the Monies to the casino at Resorts World Sentosa (“RWS”) where they converted the sum into casino gambling chips and expended them on table games. The winnings from these plays were then transferred to a third party. The Co-Offenders were subsequently arrested at RWS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Based on evidence given in the trial, the precise number of FPCs that a member was eligible to redeem depended on various factors such as the frequency of his casino visits and his value to the MBS casino, and it was to be solely<span class="font-italic"> </span>determined by MBS. The Applicant was supposed to be given only 100 FPCs. The Applicant obtained more FPCs than were due because of a system error at the kiosks which went undetected by MBS until 20 April 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Arising from the facts above, one charge for abetment by conspiracy to commit dishonest misappropriation, under s 403 read with s 109 of the Code, was brought against each of the Offenders. The charges were worded similarly as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… you, sometime in April 2014, at [MBS] Casino located at No. 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with [the Co-Offenders] to commit dishonest misappropriation of property, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, between 14 April 2014 and 20 April 2014, you, together with [the Co-Offenders] did dishonestly misappropriate cash from [MBS] Casino amounting to S$875,133.56 using [FPCs] which [the Applicant] was not entitled to obtain, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 403 read with Section 109 of the [Code].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Furthermore, as the Offenders had remitted part of the Monies overseas, transferred some to third parties, and converted some into gambling chips and credits at MBS and RWS, several charges of conversion of property representing the benefits of criminal conduct under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA, punishable under s 47(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the same Act, were also brought against each of them. These charges broadly read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… you, on or about 14 April 2014, in Singapore, did convert property, namely cash sum of S$3,500, which property in whole directly represented your benefits from criminal conduct, namely, Dishonest Misappropriation of Property under Section 403 read with Section 109 of the [Code] committed between 14 and 20 April 2014, in Singapore, to wit, by converting the aforesaid property into gambling chips at the [MBS] Casino, Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the [CDSA], and punishable under s 47(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the [CDSA].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In summary, the Applicant was convicted on a total of 21 charges and sentenced to a 21-month aggregate imprisonment term, the details of which may be tabulated as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Charges</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Counts</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Abbreviation</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence </span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Abetment by conspiracy to dishonestly misappropriate the Monies under s 403 read with s 109 of the Code</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">1</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">“the DM Charge” </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">13 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Money laundering under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">16</div></td><td rowspan="3"><div class="Table-Text text-left">“the CDSA Charges”</div></td><td rowspan="3"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Ranging from two weeks to eight months depending on the amount stated in the relevant charge.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Money laundering with common intention under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA read with s 34 of the Code</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Attempted money laundering with common intention under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA read with ss 511 and 34 of the Code</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Global sentence for </span><div class="font-weight-bold"><br/>21 charges</div></div></td><td colspan="3"><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">21 months’ imprisonment</span>, </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">(the sentences for the DM Charge and one of the CDSA Charges to run consecutively) </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Offenders were jointly tried, convicted, and sentenced in the State Courts by the learned District Judge, whose decision was reported in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ho Mun Yuk and others </span>[2017] SGDC 23 (“SC GD”). In regard to the DM Charges, the District Judge relied on <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan v Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 12 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span>”) at [19] for the proposition that the three elements of a dishonest misappropriation charge under s 403 of the Code are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the movable property must belong to some person other than the accused person;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there must be an act of misappropriation or conversion to the accused’s own use; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the accused person must possess a dishonest intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On the facts, the elements of dishonest misappropriation were found to have been made out. The subject matter of the charges was the Monies and not the disputed FPCs (SC GD at [45]). Since the Applicant was not entitled to more than 100 FPCs, the Offenders had no entitlement to the Monies which belonged to MBS at all times (SC GD at [49]). Through “a whole series of detailed and calculated steps, an astronomical number of FPCs were downloaded into [the Applicant’s] membership card” which the Offenders then encashed (SC GD at [52]). Each of the Offenders possessed the requisite dishonest intention as each had knowingly exploited a system error and used the electronic roulette machines to convert FPCs to which they were not entitled into “winnings” which they could encash (SC GD at [54]). Further, the evidence also showed that the Offenders had committed dishonest misappropriation pursuant to a plan or agreement between them (SC GD at [68]). Thus, the District Judge found “abundant evidence … which established the guilt of the [Offenders] in a conspiracy to commit [dishonest] misappropriation” (SC GD at [71]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The CDSA Charges were also found to have been made out, with the DM Charge forming the predicate charge since one requirement under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA is that the property in question must “directly or indirectly, represent[] his benefits from criminal conduct” (SC GD at [74]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Magistrate’s Appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Each of the Offenders appealed against both conviction and sentence in respect of all the charges. The matter was heard by the learned High Court judge (“the Judge”). On 29 September 2017, the Judge dismissed the appeals in their entirety. His judgment is published as <span class="font-italic">Shaikh </span><span class="font-italic">Farid v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2017] 5 SLR 1081 (“HC GD”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In relation to the DM Charge, the Defence raised several arguments, one of which was that innocent possession is a requirement for a conviction under s 403 of the Code. The Defence argued that even if the District Judge’s findings of fact were accepted, the DM Charge could not be made out because the Monies did not come into the Offenders’ possession innocently or in a neutral manner – the Applicant had swiped her membership card at the redemption kiosks at MBS <span class="font-italic">with the knowledge</span> that there was a system error.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Judge considered the argument on the merits even though it was being raised for the first time on appeal, and held that there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> rule, in order to fall within the scope of s 403 of the Code, that a dishonest intention must come into existence only <span class="font-italic">after</span> (but not before or at the time) the accused came into possession of the property in question. For this and other reasons, the Judge affirmed the convictions on the DM and the CDSA Charges, as well as the sentences imposed by the District Judge (see HC GD at [47]–[53]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The criminal motions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24  The Offenders applied to this Court by three separate criminal motions for leave to refer a total of 16 purported questions of law of public interest for determination. At the initial hearing on 6 March 2018, the Co-Offenders sought and obtained leave to withdraw their applications. After some consideration the Applicant decided to proceed with her criminal motion. Subsequently, we dismissed the Applicant’s application except in so far as it related to the issue of innocent possession under s 403 of the Code. We also directed the parties to address the Court on five ancillary questions which related to consequential matters that would follow if the Court returned an affirmative answer to the question referred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 On 24 May 2018, the Applicant filed this application, seeking our determination of the question referred and the five ancillary questions. At the hearing on 14 August 2018, we were much assisted by the submissions of counsel for the Applicant and the Public Prosecutor. At the end of the hearing, we gave a brief oral judgment in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This is our decision. Insofar as the main question before us is concerned, we answer that in the negative. In other words, to make out a conviction under s 403 of the [Code], it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> necessary to establish that the accused person had an innocent or neutral state of mind when he or she first came into possession of the property in question. It is clear to us from the drafting history that the drafters set out to cover a particular category of property offences. But even if that category was not specifically the felonious taking of the property in the possession of another, which would typically be covered by the offence of theft, the drafters chose to frame the offence in general terms. Those general terms simply did not require proof that the offender did not have a guilty mind at the time the property was taken into possession. As we put it to [counsel for the Applicant] in the course of the arguments, in our judgment, the real point of s 403 of the [Code] is to make it an offence <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the offender took the property innocently and only subsequently formed a guilty intention. But this simply does not mean that the offence is made out <span class="font-italic">only if</span> the property was taken innocently. This view is also reflected in the Sri Lankan case of <span class="font-italic">Walgamage</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Attorney General</span> [2000] 3 Sri LR 1 which we find persuasive, and it is more in keeping with the plain language of s 403 of the [Code].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The analysis </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The proper interpretive approach </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 We were faced with the question of the proper interpretation of s 403 of the Code. Before we go into the discussion it might be helpful if we set out how we approached this issue. We followed the principles laid down in the minority judgment in <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ting Choon </span><span class="font-italic">Meng and another appeal</span> [2017] 1 SLR 373 at [59] and affirmed by a 5-judge coram of this Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bo</span><span class="font-italic">ck v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37] which guide the court in its task of giving a purposive interpretation to legislation as required by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IA”).

It relied on the following authorities and arguments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a textual reading of s 403;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the explanations and illustrations of s 403 are <span class="font-italic">not</span> exhaustive of the scope of the provision; indeed, Explanation 2 to s 403 “implicitly suggests that initial innocent possession is not a necessary ingredient [of dishonest misappropriation]”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that reading s 403 in the context of s 404 of the Code makes clear that there is no requirement for innocent possession;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) that there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> difficulty with some degree of overlap between property offences in the Code;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the legislative history of s 403 of the Code; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) case law from India and Sri Lanka that has considered the innocent possession question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Explanation of our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The text of the provision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 We started by examining the plain text of s 403. The material part of this section is the phrase “[w]hoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use movable property …”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Prosecution made two main submissions in this regard. First, it emphasised that there is no express mention in s 403 of any requirement as to the accused person’s state of mind at the time he first obtains possession of the subject property. Therefore, imposing a requirement that the initial possession be innocent would be tantamount to adding a further ingredient to the offence which is not permissible. Second, it would also give rise to an absurdity in so far as it would make a criminal of one who is only subsequently dishonest, but would let off one who had been dishonest from the outset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Prosecution’s arguments needed further exploration. On the first point, it is correct that a plain reading of s 403 suggests that there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> requirement that the accused person must have had an innocent or neutral state of mind at the time the subject property first came into his possession. Indeed, there is also <span class="font-italic">no</span> requirement that the accused person must have been dishonest at that specific time. Although dishonesty is a requirement for conviction under the section, by the concurrence principle between <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>, the focus is only on whether the accused is dishonest <span class="font-italic">at the</span> <span class="font-italic">time he misappropriates or converts </span>the subject property to his own use, and not at the time that he first comes into possession of it. On a plain reading of s 403, therefore, the accused person’s state of mind at the time of initial possession – whether innocent, neutral, or dishonest – is irrelevant to a conviction under that provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 There is, however, one possible argument that a plain reading of s 403 is not sufficiently probative of its ingredients because the text of the provision is not indicative of the comprehensive scope of the provision. This argument is derived from the analysis in <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In that case, the accused had picked up a wallet from the ground and kept the cash in it for himself before disposing of the wallet and the rest of its contents. The question was whether the accused was guilty of dishonest misappropriation under s 403 of the Code. Chong J held that in order to establish the offence under s 403, the Prosecution had to prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt (at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the movable property must belong to some person other than the accused person;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there must be an act of misappropriation or conversion to the accused’s own use; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the accused person must possess a dishonest intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Applying the elements to the facts, Chong J found the offender liable for dishonest misappropriation under s 403. If Chong J’s formulation is correct, then it is clear that s 403 cannot be construed strictly by its plain text because the first requirement identified by Chong J – that the movable property must belong to some person other than the accused person – is itself also not a requirement that appears on the face of s 403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is, however, possible to question whether this “not owned by the accused person” requirement is indeed a separate requirement for a conviction under s 403. In our view, this requirement may instead be conceived of as being encompassed within the third requirement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the accused person possessed the requisite dishonest intention. This is because in certain, admittedly limited, circumstances an owner of property may dishonestly misappropriate it. For instance, if person A owns a bicycle and rents it to person B for a specified period of time, and before the expiry of this period, A sees the bicycle parked by the side of the road and takes it away and sells it without the consent of B, thus depriving B of its use for the entire period of hire, it would appear that A could well be liable under s 403 even though he may be the owner of the bicycle. There is also Illustration (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to the main text of s 403 which makes it clear that in certain circumstances a joint owner of property may be guilty of dishonest misappropriation of property which he co-owns. In both the situations described, the misappropriating party, albeit the owner, was not entitled to the immediate and exclusive possession of the property. Indeed, in misappropriating the property, he may have caused wrongful loss to the person so entitled to it. Thus, the first requirement may be rephrased as “the accused person was not entitled to immediate and exclusive possession of the movable property in question”, and once it is so rephrased it is apparent that this is but one aspect of the inquiry into dishonesty, rather than a distinct emphasis on or a separate requirement of ownership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In our judgment, the essential elements of an offence under s 403 of the Code, therefore, are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the thing in question constitutes movable property;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the accused person has misappropriated or converted such property to his own use; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the accused person, not being a person entitled to immediate and exclusive possession of such property, possessed a dishonest intent at the time of such misappropriation or conversion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">All three elements appear on the face of the section. Once they are met, there will be an offence of dishonest misappropriation notwithstanding the ownership of the movable property concerned, as illustrated by the examples we gave earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As far as the Prosecution’s second argument was concerned – that of absurdity if an innocent possession requirement was in fact read into s 403 – we found this more difficult to accept in the form that it was presented to us. The Prosecution’s point was that it cannot rationally be held that a person who is initially innocent but subsequently becomes dishonest is a criminal, but one who had all along been dishonest escapes criminal liability. The strength of this submission, however, was premised on the false assumption that dishonest misappropriation under s 403 is the only relevant property offence and that the other property offences do not even enter the picture. The interplay of property offences is something that we deal with below. We also elaborate below on a slightly different form of absurdity that may arise should the innocent possession requirement be adopted in s 403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In our view, a plain reading of s 403 assisted the Prosecution. As we mentioned above at [26], however, the proper interpretation of a provision involves a consideration of more than just its plain text, and it is to these other considerations that we now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Context of the provision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As s 9A(2) of the IA makes clear, the context of the provision under consideration in the written law as a whole must also be taken into account. In this regard, three factors are relevant:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the explanations and illustrations to s 403;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) section 404 of the Code; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the interplay of and overlap between various property offences set out in the Code.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Explanations and illustrations </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The explanations and illustrations to s 403 are extensive, and they have been reproduced above in full (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Applicant argued that the illustrations to s 403 clearly show that the draftsmen “envisaged a situation where an accused person comes into possession of the property innocently but subsequently formed a dishonest intention to misappropriate the property”. Her counsel submitted that these illustrations are useful notwithstanding s 7A of the IA. In fact, in <span class="font-italic">Basudeb</span><span class="font-italic"> Putra v Kanai Lul Haldar </span>(1949) Cri LJ 382 (“<span class="font-italic">Basudeb</span>”), the Calcutta High Court opined (at [4]) that the illustrations to s 403 are “rather statements of principle than mere illustrations”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Prosecution conceded that the illustrations to s 403 are compatible with an innocent possession requirement, but argued that pursuant to s 7A of the IA, they “should not be seen as exhaustive in respect of the scope of s 403”. In fact, as the Judge had reasoned in the HC GD at [26]–[28], Explanation 2 to s 403 and Illustration (d) thereto “implicitly suggest[]” that innocent possession is <span class="font-italic">not</span> an element of dishonest misappropriation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We agreed with the Prosecution that the illustrations to s 403 of the Code may not show the full scope of the provision, but we disagreed that Explanation 2 (or Illustration (d) to Explanation 2) has any value in disproving or supporting the innocent possession requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Section 7A of the IA states, without providing for any exception, that illustrations are not exhaustive and cannot trump the provision itself:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Examples and illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7A. Where an Act includes an example or illustration of the operation of a provision —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the example or illustration shall not be taken to be exhaustive; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if the example or illustration is inconsistent with the provision, the provision prevails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Section 7A of the IA clearly applies to the illustrations to s 403. In particular, reliance solely on the illustrations to read an innocent possession requirement into s 403 would contravene s 7A(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA which <span class="font-italic">mandates</span> that illustrations <span class="font-italic">not</span> be taken as exhaustive of the scope of a provision. Therefore, little if any weight can be given to the argument that the illustrations to s 403 are uniformly consistent with the existence of a requirement for innocent possession, even if the argument is taken to be correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 <span class="font-italic">Basudeb </span>did not assist the Applicant in arguing the contrary. First, as foreign judicial authority, it cannot displace the operation of s 7A of the IA. Second, the observation in <span class="font-italic">Basudeb</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the illustrations to s 403 are “statements of principle” rather than mere illustrations was <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Basudeb</span>, the accused borrowed gold ornaments from the complainant for his wedding but thereafter refused to return them. The accused argued that he should be convicted and sentenced under s 403 of the Indian Penal Code for dishonest misappropriation, rather than for criminal breach of trust under s 405. The Calcutta High Court disagreed and opined as follows (at [4]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the broad question raised, namely, the difference between Section 403 and 405, [of the Indian] Penal Code the answer is clear. <span class="font-italic">The illustrations to Section</span><span class="font-italic"> 403, which are rather statements of principle than mere illustrations, clearly show that the essence of criminal misappropriation of property is that the property comes into the possession of the accused in some neutral manner</span>, whereas the illustrations to section 405 show equally clearly that the property comes into the possession of the accused either by an express entrus[t]ment or by some process placing the accused in a position of trust … On the facts of the p[re]sent case, which as I have said are not, open to question at this stage, it is quite clear that the ornaments were handed over to the petitioner by the beneficial owner in the confidence that they would be returned to the beneficial owner in due time after having been used for the purpose for which they were handed over. If this is not an entrustment, it is impossible to conceive what can be an entrustment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Therefore, the issue before the court was whether criminal breach of trust was made out on the facts, and the court decided in the affirmative. This conclusion was not affected by the characterisation of the illustrations to s 403 of the Code, which the court did not need to opine on, and which was in any event an observation without apparent substantiation. We would point out, additionally, that the observation does not appear to have been necessary as the fact that the accused might have committed dishonest misappropriation under s 403 would not mean that he had not <span class="font-italic">also</span> committed criminal breach of trust under s 405 if he misappropriated property that had been entrusted to him. We deal with overlapping of property offences below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 However, contrary to the Prosecution’s submission, we see no probative value in Explanation 2 to s 403 of the Code, the relevant part of which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Explanation 2</span>.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to the owner, does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner, and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Prosecution asserted that the second part of Explanation 2 means that “<span class="font-italic">when a person finds property not in possession of any other person</span>, if that person knew the owner or had means of discovering the owner, but decided to appropriate the property to his own use nonetheless, he would be guilty of the offence under s 403 of the [Code]” [emphasis added; original emphasis omitted]. This proposition does not bear scrutiny. The innocent possession question is, in essence, a question about the time at which a dishonest intent must be formed by the accused. The second part of Explanation 2 states “… but he is guilty of the offence above defined, <span class="font-italic">if he appropriates it to his own use</span>, <span class="font-italic">when </span>he knows or has the means of discovering the owner …” [emphasis added]. This wording was present in Explanation 2 from its enactment. The dishonesty that the second part of Explanation 2 actually envisages is thus one that is present <span class="font-italic">at the time of appropriation</span>, and not at the time of initial taking, which the Prosecution’s inaccurate rephrasing of Explanation 2 might at first glance suggest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On balance, therefore, the illustrations and explanations to s 403 neither support nor deny the existence of the requirement for initial innocent possession under s 403. In our view, the fact that many of them deal with situations where the movable property has been found (presumably, with the finder having an innocent or neutral state of mind at the time of taking the property into possession) was rather, as we discuss below, a response to the state of English law at the time s 403 was first formulated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Section 404 of the Code</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As another contextual point, the Prosecution submitted that s 404 of the Code makes clear that there is no requirement for initial innocent possession under s 403 of the Code. The Applicant did not address this issue in her written submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Section 404 of the Code provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by a deceased person at the time of his death</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">404.</span> Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use property, knowing that such property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person’s decease, and has not since been in the possession of any person legally entitled to such possession, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if the offender at the time of such person’s decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant, the imprisonment may extend to 7 years.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Illustration</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Z</span> dies in possession of furniture and money. His servant <span class="font-italic">A</span>, before the money comes into the possession of any person entitled to such possession, dishonestly misappropriates it. <span class="font-italic">A</span> has committed the offence defined in this section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Prosecution argued that both the text and illustration of s 404 of the Code suggest that there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> requirement of initial innocent possession, because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it is “possible” for property to be misappropriated under s 404 of the Code where the accused has a dishonest state of mind from the outset; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it is “entirely plausible” under the Illustration to s 404 that the servant could have had a dishonest intention <span class="font-italic">before </span>the misappropriation or conversion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In our view, s 404 is neutral on the requirement of initial innocent possession. The mental element of s 404, that is, “… knowing that …”, could be construed as having reference to the preceding phrase, “Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use property …”, such that the requisite dishonesty, again, is to be assessed at the time of misappropriation or conversion rather than the time of taking possession of the property in question since such taking could be with an innocent intention, for example, to safe-keep the property until the person entitled to possession comes to claim it. In that sense, s 404 does not positively support the existence of an innocent possession requirement. Nor does it, as the Prosecution appeared to argue, make clear that there is no requirement of initial innocent possession under s 403 of the Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Interplay and overlap between property offences</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The third contextual point related to the interplay and overlap between the various property offences legislated under the Code.

Thus, an innocent possession requirement must be read into s 403 of the Code for dishonest misappropriation, in order to distinguish it from theft under s 378 of the Code under which the dishonest intent must exist at the time of initial possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Prosecution countered that there is no issue with overlapping property offences under the Code. Further, there is no canon of interpretation that penal provisions should be construed such that no overlap will exist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 We agreed with the Prosecution in this regard. The Applicant provided no authority, whether by way of legislation or case law, for her assertion to the contrary. Nor did she give any good reason why an overlap was not permitted. Thus, a requirement of innocent possession could not be justified merely on the basis that it distinguishes between theft and dishonest misappropriation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Indeed, we went further than the Prosecution’s <span class="font-italic">defensive</span> argument and were of the view that the interplay between the property offences <span class="font-italic">positively</span> suggests that it cannot be the proper construction of the provision. Indeed, it could not have been the legislative intent underlying the provision, that innocent possession be an implicit requirement of s 403 of the Code. We say so for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 First, making innocent possession a requirement would be unusual in that it would require the offender to <span class="font-italic">not </span>possess a particular mental state at a particular point in time. As far as we could ascertain, there is no other property offence, or indeed any offence at all, which imposes a similar “negative” or exonerative <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement. In that light, not only is an innocent possession requirement unusual, it invites the question – why would a presumptively exonerative fact be made an element of a criminal (or property) offence? Furthermore, the golden thread across all property offences in the Code is the need for dishonesty, in the sense that the element of dishonesty is common to all property offences (<span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span> at [15]). Consequently, the statutory provisions uniformly focus on defining the circumstances and time at which dishonesty must exist. No other provision provides for the putative offender’s mental state at any other point in time or examines any other mental state apart from dishonesty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, the innocent possession requirement is one that does not sit well with the context of s 403 as one species of the genus of property offences in the Code. While it is not impossible that innocent possession is uniquely required for s 403 but not for other property offences such as criminal breach of trust, it is more natural to construe the property offences consistently and to “begin by presuming that the statute is a coherent whole” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bo</span><span class="font-italic">ck </span>at [40], original emphasis omitted).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Secondly, it was not clear what the precise contours of the definition of “innocent possession” were. The Applicant perhaps assumed that the term is self-evident and means an innocent or neutral state of mind at the time of the accused came into possession of the property in question. But what is “neutral” and how is that different from “innocent”? More importantly, what is “innocence”, and does it mean a “freedom from guile or cunning” or a “lack in knowledge” in the conventional sense of the term, or does it simply mean “not dishonest” which is in turn defined in s 24 of the Code? In that context, how do “innocence” and “dishonesty” interact on the spectrum of mental states that an accused can possess?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This question of the interaction between “innocence” and “dishonesty” is important because, depending on the answer, there might be a lacuna in the law on property offences arising from the imposition of the requirement for innocent possession under s 403. The Applicant’s assumption is that an innocent possession requirement would neatly distinguish theft and dishonest misappropriation – if dishonesty is present at the time of initial possession, theft is made out; if the offender was initially “innocent” but subsequently dishonest, dishonest misappropriation is made out. But, unless “innocence” is defined as simply “not dishonest”, there would be a lacuna in the sense that an offender who is <span class="font-underline">initially</span> <span class="font-italic">neither “innocent” nor “dishonest”</span> will escape criminal liability for <span class="font-italic">both</span> theft and dishonest misappropriation even if he becomes dishonest <span class="font-underline">subsequently</span> and does in fact misappropriate the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 To illustrate, consider an offender who picks up a wallet, not intending then to keep it for his own use, but knowing it to be likely that he would eventually keep it for his own use. He subsequently crystallises his dishonest intention and converts the wallet to his own use. In this hypothetical, the offender would not have committed theft as he did not have an initial intention to keep the wallet and thus was not “dishonest” (within the meaning of s 24 of the Code) at the time of initial possession. But nor was he initially “innocent” in the conventional sense of the term, since he knew it to be likely that he would subsequently convert the wallet to his own use. Thus, he would also not be liable for dishonest misappropriation (assuming innocent possession is required).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 This demonstrates that if “innocent possession” is made a requirement of s 403, then so long as there is a situation where one may be said to be neither “innocent” nor “dishonest”, there would be a possibility that neither theft nor dishonest misappropriation is made out, even though the putative offender clearly misappropriated the property and was dishonest at the time of misappropriation (although not at the time of initial possession).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 This brings us to our third point – that even if “innocence” is defined as “not dishonest” which assists the alignment of theft and dishonest misappropriation, the rest of the definition of the two provisions does not appear to be complementary and might nevertheless give rise to a lacuna in the law if initial innocent possession is made a requirement of s 403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Theft is defined under s 378 of the Code as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">378.</span> Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Dishonest misappropriation is defined as follows under s 403:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">403.</span> Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Apart from the possible requirement of an initial innocence, the other difference between the two provisions appears to be that theft requires the subject property to be <span class="font-italic">taken out of the possession</span> of a person. Therefore, if a person picks up a wallet that has been lying on the ground for some time, it would probably not qualify as “theft” even if that person had a dishonest intention from the outset. Nor would that be dishonest misappropriation since the person was not “initially innocent”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The foregoing illustrates a clear lacuna and absurdity in the law if the requirement of innocent possession is upheld in relation to s 403:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An “innocent finder” who subsequently dishonestly misappropriates the property can be held liable for dishonest misappropriation, as was found to be the case in <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) But a “dishonest finder”, that is, one who finds property that is not in the possession of any person and dishonestly intends to keep it from the outset, <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be held liable for theft or dishonest misappropriation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) And further, a “seeker”, in the sense of one who actively seeks opportunities to appropriate items which others misplace or lose with the intent to thereafter keep them for his own use, is also <span class="font-italic">not</span> liable for theft or dishonest misappropriation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 We add three points on the issue of lacunae and absurdity:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, none of the other property offences in the Code (including cheating, criminal breach of trust, and extortion) appear to be applicable in the situations (b) and (c) identified above. Therefore, in considering whether the requirement of innocent possession would give rise to lacunae and absurdity in the law, it is correct to focus on the interaction between the offences of theft and dishonest misappropriation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it might be possible to “cure” some of the absurdity by broadly construing the term “possession” in s 378. If so, the broader scope of theft might ameliorate some issues arising from a narrowed scope of dishonest misappropriation (given the need for initial innocence). But this is speculative and it is not likely, however broadly “possession” is construed, that theft and dishonest misappropriation will be defined in a perfectly coincident manner.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Applicant argued that “any lacunae in the law should be filled by Parliamentary intervention”. That statement is one of broad principle but has no application in this case. This is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a situation where the court is asked to read words into a statute in order to cure a perceived lacuna or policy deficiency; this is also <span class="font-italic">not</span> a situation where the court is asked to stretch the meaning of statutory terms to fit the facts at hand. Instead, this is a situation where the court is asked to read words into the statute which would <span class="font-italic">precisely</span> give rise to an absurd state of the law. Deference to Parliament operates here against the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 To summarise, the context of s 403 of the Code suggested that initial innocent possession is <span class="font-italic">not </span>a requirement for dishonest misappropriation. First, such a requirement is highly unusual as a negative or exonerative mental element. Second, as we elaborated above, the imposition of such a requirement would likely give rise to lacunae and absurdity in the law of property offences, given the structure and construction of these other offences under the Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 A proper construction of a statutory provision also requires the court to take into account “the purpose or object underlying the written law”. In relation to s 403 of the Code, this can only be gleaned from the history of the enactment of the provision, which in turn requires reliance on extraneous materials.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Applicant did not raise any argument based on the legislative history of s 403 of the Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Prosecution’s position was that the extraneous materials relating to the legislative history of s 403 of the Code confirm that initial innocent possession is not a requirement. This is because the drafters of the Indian Penal Code, from which s 403 of the Code was derived, clearly disagreed with the old English common law position under which initial innocent possession <span class="font-italic">absolutely</span> absolved one of criminal liability even if he subsequently dishonestly misappropriated or converted the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 What follows is a brief legislative history of s 403 of the Code:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the English common law required that to constitute larceny or theft at common law there should be a felonious “taking,” which was understood to mean a “taking out of the possession of some person entitled to [the property]”. Thus, misappropriation of property was not a crime so long as the taker had not taken the property out of its owner’s possession dishonestly but had originally acquired it honestly (Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, <span class="font-italic">A History of the Criminal Law of England</span> vol III (Macmillan and Co, 1883) at pp 150–151 and 158). This remained the law in England until the mid-twentieth century, and appears to have been unaffected by the passage of the Embezzlement Act in 1812 and the Larceny Act 1827 which statutorily enshrined exceptions relating to embezzlements by agents (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v</span> <span class="font-italic">Lam </span><span class="font-italic">Leng Hung and others </span>[2018] 1 SLR 659<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [178]–[181]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In India, the first draft of the Indian Penal Code was submitted by the Law Commission of India under the chairmanship of Lord Thomas Macaulay (“the ILC”) to the Governor-General of India in 1837. This first draft contained provisions criminalising dishonest misappropriation, and aggravated dishonest misappropriation (of property taken from deceased persons, as per s 404 of the Code) (“the Draft IPC”). The relevant provisions read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">OF CRIMINAL MISAPPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY NOT IN POSSESSION</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">383.  Whoever fraudulently takes into his possession any property <span class="font-italic">which is in no person’s possession</span>, is said to, except in the case hereinafter excepted, “criminally to misappropriate property not in possession.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Exception</span>.

A has committed the offence defined in this Clause.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">It would appear from the plain language of the proposed ss 383 and 385 and their illustrations that the offence of dishonest misappropriation was directed primarily at a finder of movable property lost by its owner who dishonestly converted the same to his own use. Legal possession of the property was the distinction between criminal misappropriation and theft, both in English law and in the Draft IPC. The ILC explained that it wanted to maintain a “reasonable and expedient” line between theft and criminal misappropriation because in theft the intention of the offender was always to take property in another’s possession out of that person’s possession.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At the same time, in England, a similar codification effort of the criminal law was underway. The Commissioners on the Criminal Law of England (“the ELC”) released reports in 1839 and 1843 containing a draft digest of the proposed criminal laws (“the Digest”). The Digest was never enacted into law. In regard to theft, it was different from the Draft IPC in that it defined the offence of theft as being “a wrongful taking and removal” of the property of another without the necessity of it being in the possession of that other. It also stated in Art 14 that “[w]here the taking is upon a finding or other casualty, the quality of the act depends <span class="font-italic">on the intention of the party at the time</span>; and it is not theft unless he took with the intention to despoil the owner and fraudulently to appropriate the thing taken, although the owner be unknown” [emphasis added]. Thus, Art 14 made it the crime of theft if a finder, at the time he found the property, had the dishonest intention of taking it for himself. Article 14 did not cover situations in which the original taking was innocent and the dishonest intention arose later. No proposed article appeared to cover those situations.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In 1846, the ILC was tasked to review the Draft IPC against the Digest to detect any omission or imperfection that might have existed in the Draft IPC. In a Special Report issued in 1847, the Indian Law Commissioners noted at para 461 that because the offence of theft under the Draft IPC was the taking of property which was in another’s possession out of that person’s possession, it was “necessary” to introduce separate provisions under the head of “Criminal misappropriation of property not in possession”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Between 1854 and 1856, several changes were made to the Draft IPC, the reasons for which were documented in a final report put together in 1856 by the ILC led by Sir Barnes Peacock (“the Peacock Report”). Unfortunately, there appears to be no surviving copy of the Peacock Report. As far as s 383 was concerned, by the time of the Second Reading of the Indian Penal Code Bill in 1857, its language had been altered considerably to read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fraudulent misappropriation of property</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever fraudulently misappropriates or converts to his own use any moveable property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">As can be seen, the ILC had amended the dishonest misappropriation offence to almost its current wording except for the use of the word “fraudulently” in place of “dishonestly” and had removed the explicit requirement that the property misappropriated was “not in possession”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The Indian Penal Code containing s 403 in its present form was subsequently passed by the Legislative Council of India. On 31 March 1869, the Indian Penal Code was received into Singapore with no changes to s 403. It was then brought into force in Singapore by the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlement in 1872 as Ordinance 4 of 1871. Section 403 of the Code has remained materially unchanged since then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Peacock Report was not available to explain the reasons for the material changes in structure of the provision on dishonest misappropriation between that in the Draft IPC, and that eventually found in the Indian Penal Code Bill. In the absence of such explanation, any attempt to discern the actual intent of the draftsmen would be speculative and contrary to the previous guidance of this Court that extraneous materials relied upon must be “clear” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [54(c)(iv)]). Greater weight must thus be placed on the text and context of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Prosecution’s main point was that the ILC had expressly disagreed with the view of the ELC that taking property which had been found did not amount to theft unless it was accompanied by a dishonest (or fraudulent) intention at the outset. Therefore, the Draft IPC must be taken to have <span class="font-italic">expanded</span> on what was already covered under the English law on theft. As it would not have been logical for the ILC to design a lacuna while filling another lacuna, s 385 of the Draft IPC must be taken to apply to both situations: initial innocent possession, and initial dishonest possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 We were not persuaded by this argument. The ILC’s Special Report accompanying the Draft IPC indicates that in proposing to create a distinct offence of dishonest misappropriation (in addition to theft), the ILC’s primary intent was to avoid the problems with the intricate concepts of ownership and possession that underlay the then-existing English common law on theft. Thus, in the Draft IPC, the ILC defined the offence of theft clearly and singularly against the concept of possession; the ILC’s position was that “possession by the <span class="font-italic">proprietor</span> of the article stolen is not essential to the offence [of theft]”. However, because theft was then defined as the taking of property <span class="font-italic">out of the possession of someone</span>, a distinct offence of dishonest misappropriation had to be created in order to deal with the misappropriation of property “which is in no person’s possession” (see the text of s 383 at [78(b)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Prosecution also cited one part of Lord Macaulay’s comments in the notes to the Draft IPC:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One offence which it may be thought that we ought to have placed amongst thefts is the pillaging of property during the interval which elapses between the time when the possessor of the property dies, and the time when it comes into the possession of some other person authorized to take charge of it. This crime, in our classification, falls under the head, not of theft, but of misappropriation of property not in possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Prosecution submitted that this passage shows that the ILC had “intended for the offence to apply to situations where dishonesty had been formed from the outset”. We agreed that this was a reasonable inference and provided some indication of the thinking of the ILC. The Peacock Report was not available to confirm that that remained the thinking when s 383 was recast. However, as the history of the legislation did show plainly that the intention of the drafters was that initial innocent possession would not prevent a subsequent dishonest misappropriation or conversion from constituting an offence, it would seem incongruous to infer an intention to also make initial innocent possession an ingredient of the offence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consideration of the authorities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 We turned next to examine case and academic authorities on the interpretation of the section.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Local authorities</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 This issue of innocent possession and s 403 of the Code did not appear to have posed a problem in the local courts until fairly recently.

This case involved a “traditional” factual situation involving a finder-turn-keeper. In his grounds, Chong J opined that “it is perhaps useful to provide some overview of the property offences under the [Code] and to explain how they differ from each other” (at [13]). Thereafter, Chong J explained as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14  The distinction between criminal misappropriation and other property offences such as theft, cheating and criminal breach of trust may not be immediately apparent to a layperson. They all involve property and an element of dishonesty but the punishment provisions are somewhat different.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 While the element of dishonesty is common to all property offences, the critical distinction between criminal misappropriation, theft, cheating and criminal breach of trust lies in the manner in which the accused person initially comes across the movable property. An accused person commits theft if the movable property was originally in the possession of some other person and the accused person moves the property with a dishonest intention to take it. <span class="font-italic">For criminal misappropriation, the accused person initially comes across the movable property in a legally neutral manner (</span>eg<span class="font-italic">, by finding), and he subsequently forms a dishonest intention to deal with the movable property in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights of the true owner.</span> As for criminal breach of trust, the accused person is entrusted with property or dominion over the property at the outset by another person, and he dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in abuse of trust while for cheating, the possession of the property is voluntarily handed over to the accused person as a result of his deceitful or fraudulent misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 The fact that <span class="font-italic">an accused person charged with the offence of criminal misappropriation would </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">usually</span><span class="font-italic"> have come across the movable property in a legally neutral manner</span> is significant, because while civil rights and liabilities would attach at the moment when the accused person asserts possession over the property, criminal liability would only attach when the accused person forms a dishonest intention. According to Dr Hari Singh Gour, <span class="font-italic">Penal Law of India</span> vol 4 (Law Publishers (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Ed, 2011) at pp 3918–3919:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. What is criminal misappropriation? …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The illustrations to Sec. 403, which are rather statements of principle than mere illustrations, clearly show that the essence of criminal misappropriation of property is that the property comes into the possession of the accused in some neutral manner, whereas the illustrations in Sec. 405 show equally clearly that the property comes into the possession of the accused either by an express entrustment or by some process placing the accused in a position of trust …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question whether the act is theft or misappropriation depends upon when the dishonesty began — was it before or after the thing came into possession.

In particular, the Judge pointed out Chong J’s use of the word “usually” in [16] of <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 With respect, we find it difficult to reconcile the two local decisions. <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span> took the view that dishonest misappropriation, unlike theft, required innocent possession. Tellingly, after citing the 2011 edition of an Indian text at [16], Chong J went on to conclude at [17] that “the distinction between theft and dishonest misappropriation of movable property depends on <span class="font-italic">whether the initial taking is wrongful</span>” and questioned when “the taking of the movable property, <span class="font-italic">though initially neutral</span>, may nonetheless subsequently become wrongful” [emphases added]. Subsequently, as part of the factual analysis, Chong J observed that “[i]n the present appeal there can be no dispute that in picking up the wallet, the [accused] had committed an act of appropriation. At that stage, <span class="font-italic">his act of appropriation was still neutral</span>. However, his intention will become dishonest if he removed the cash …” [emphasis added] (at [55]). If Chong J had been of the view that innocent possession was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a strict requirement of s 403, there would have been little reason for him to make these comments about neutral or innocent possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The discussion on innocent possession in <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan </span>was, however, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> and made without the benefit of full argument. Chong J did not need to make a finding on innocent possession in that case and therefore counsel did not present him with the materials that were put before us nor with a full analysis of this aspect of the offence. The Judge, however, was faced squarely with the issue and as a result dealt with it in depth in the HC GD. Accordingly, with respect, we find <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng Kwan</span> to be less persuasive on this aspect of s 403.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Foreign jurisprudence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The foreign jurisprudence cited to us consisted of case law from Sri Lanka and India, unsurprisingly, as their provisions on dishonest misappropriation could also be traced to the Draft IPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Prosecution relied on the decision of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court (which is the apex court of the land) in <span class="font-italic">Walgamage</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Attorney-General </span>[2000] 3 Sri LR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Walgamage</span>”).

He was convicted of criminal breach of trust. Special leave to appeal to the apex court was granted to determine the question of “whether to constitute the offence of criminal misappropriation or criminal breach of trust it is essential that the initial taking be innocent”. The lower courts’ decisions on this issue had not been consistent. The statutory provision on dishonest misappropriation in Sri Lanka (that is, s 386 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code (“SLPC”)) was in material part the same as s 403 of the Code: “whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use such movable property …”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Counsel for the accused argued, in <span class="font-italic">Walgamage</span>, that even though s 386 of the SLPC did not on its face<span class="font-italic"> </span>impose a requirement for initial innocent possession, such a requirement nevertheless existed because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In respect of property offences, there were “clear lines of demarcation in the [SLPC] between those where the victim is in possession at the time the offence is committed (such as theft and cheating) and those where the victim is out of possession the offender being already in possession (such as [dishonest] misappropriation and breach of trust)” (at 6).

This is because that case involved an accused who denied an allegation of dishonest misappropriation of electric wires by arguing that he had actually purchased those wires from a shop. The Madhya Pradesh High Court quashed the charge on the basis that there was no evidence to show that the electric wires were <span class="font-italic">not </span>the property of the accused. It was in that context that the court opined that dishonest misappropriation “takes place when the possession has been innocently come by …” (at [8]), before stating the three elements of the charge one of which was that “[t]he property must belong to a person other than the accused” (at [8]). Applying the three elements to the facts, the court concluded that “… there is nothing on record in order to show that the impugned electric wire belong[ed] to any other person other than the accused” (at [8]).

It was argued that the facts could not establish criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the Indian Penal Code, but instead amounted to cheating under s 420 of the same Code. The court held that a charge under s 420 could not be substituted, but that the original charge under s 406 should be substituted with one under s 403 of the Indian Penal Code for dishonest misappropriation, opining as follows (at [19] and [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The offence of Section 403 is a minor offence in comparison to that of Section 406 inasmuch as it is constituted by some of the facts mentioned in the charge.

The offender is already in possession of the property; and is either lawfully in possession of it, because either he has found it or is a just owner of it, or his possession, if not strictly lawful, is not punishable as an offence because he has acquired it under some mistaken notion of right in himself or of consent given by another.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 On the other hand, the 1996 edition of <span class="font-italic">Gour</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Gour</span><span class="font-italic"> 1996</span>”) suggested that innocent possession is <span class="font-italic">not </span>a requirement for dishonest misappropriation. In the 2011 edition of Gour (“<span class="font-italic">Gour</span><span class="font-italic"> 2011</span>”) (which was the edition relied on in <span class="font-italic">Wong Seng</span> <span class="font-italic">Kwan</span>), however, the authors took a contrary position <span class="font-italic">in clear support of</span> a requirement of innocent possession. This position was not maintained for very long as by the 2015 edition of Gour (“<span class="font-italic">Gour</span><span class="font-italic"> 2015</span>”), the requirement of innocent possession was rejected. At p 3923 of this 2015 text, the authors stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">8. Accused having dishonest intention at the moment of taking possession.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The argument that criminal misappropriation cannot be committed if the accused had dishonest intention at the time of taking possession of the article, cannot be accepted. The complainant has the choice; if he thinks that he can make out a case of dishonest intention while taking delivery of the article he can charge the accused with cheating; otherwise he is entitled to charge him with criminal misappropriation. If the prosecution proves a case of Sec. 403, I.P.C., the accused by proving that he had a dishonest intention at the time of taking delivery of the article cannot change the nature of the offence to that of cheating. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 This reading of <span class="font-italic">Gour</span><span class="font-italic"> 2015 </span>was buttressed by the discussion in the same text titled “Theft distinguished”, under which instead of concluding definitively as to the requirement of innocent possession, the authors opined that dishonest misappropriation is “indifferent” to the wrongfulness of the initial taking (at p 3919):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question whether the act is theft or misappropriation depends upon when the dishonesty began – was it before or after the thing came into possession. This is a point of division as much between the two offences – theft and criminal misappropriation in the Code – as between criminal misappropriation and a civil wrong under English law. … In theft the initial taking is wrongful, in criminal misappropriation it is indifferent and may even be innocent, but it becomes wrongful by a subsequent change of intention, or from knowledge of some new fact with which the party was not previously acquainted. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 That said, there are parts of <span class="font-italic">Gour</span><span class="font-italic"> 2015 </span>which did not sit well with its stated proposition that innocent possession is <span class="font-italic">not</span> required for dishonest misappropriation. For instance, <span class="font-italic">Gour</span><span class="font-italic"> 2015 </span>also asserted that the “illustrations to Sec. 403, which are rather statements of principle than mere illustrations, clearly show that the essence of criminal misappropriation of property is that the property comes into the possession of the accused in some neutral manner …” (at p 3918). Perhaps the phrase “the essence was” was intended to suggest that innocent possession is merely the archetypal example of dishonest misappropriation (as the Judge had reasoned), but the proposition that the illustrations to s 403 are statements of principle is a clear reference to <span class="font-italic">Basudeb</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>which is contrary to s 7A of the IA (see [48] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In any event, the present conclusion in <span class="font-italic">Gour</span><span class="font-italic"> 2015</span> ran contrary to the other leading Indian text of <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span><span class="font-italic"> 2013</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As the academic texts had not come to a consistent or conclusive landing on the innocent possession question, we considered it safer not to place reliance on them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other interpretive canons</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Finally, there were other canons of interpretation which are permissible as tools to aid the court’s effort in determining the proper interpretation of a provision (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [38]). For present purposes only two of these have any relevance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Rectifying construction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Rectifying construction “involves the addition or substitution of words to give effect to Parliament’s manifest intentions” (<span class="font-italic">Nam Hong Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Kori Construction (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 604 (“<span class="font-italic">Nam Hong</span>”) at [54]). It is possible to invoke this method in the Applicant’s favour so as to circumvent the absence of an express reference to innocent possession on the face of s 403 of the Code. If so invoked, the words which may be added to s 403 of the Code are as set out in <span class="font-weight-bold">bold</span> in the following re-wording of the section:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">403. Whoever, <span class="font-weight-bold">having obtained possession of any movable property without a dishonest intention</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">thereafter</span> dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In principle, a rectifying construction is not excluded for penal legislation (see Oliver Jones, <span class="font-italic">Bennion</span><span class="font-italic"> on Statutory Interpretation </span>(LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2017)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at section 15.3):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.3 Although a court may, as a matter of principle be cautious about applying a rectifying construction to penal legislation or other onerous enactments, this caution will not prevent it from applying such a construction in suitable cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In our judgment, a rectifying construction could not be applied to assist the Applicant in the present case. This was because our primary conclusion was that innocent possession is <span class="font-italic">not </span>a requirement under s 403 of the Code, and so there was nothing to rectify.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Strict construction rule</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The other potentially relevant canon of construction is the “strict construction rule”, also known as the “principle against doubtful penalisation”. According to VK Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Heng </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [30]–[38], this is a “tool of last resort” to which recourse may be had only if there is genuine ambiguity in the meaning of the provision even after the courts have attempted to interpret the statute purposively. If the meaning of the provision is sufficiently clear after the ordinary rules of construction have been applied, then there is no room for the application of this rule (see also <span class="font-italic">Nam Hong </span>at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In our judgment, even though the plain text, history, and purpose of the provision are not entirely helpful, the context of s 403 of the Code sufficiently demonstrates that innocent possession could not have been an intended element of dishonest misappropriation. In those circumstances, there is no room for the strict construction rule to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In this regard, we add that in <span class="font-italic">Walgamage</span>, the Sri Lankan Supreme Court also rejected the argument that an innocent possession requirement should be read into s 386 of the SLPC on the basis that a criminal statute should be strictly construed in favour of the offender (at 8–9):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principle that penal statutes are to be strictly construed does not apply where a statute is clear and unambiguous. I am therefore of the view that the suggested principles of interpretation cannot be applied so as to introduce an additional ingredient into the definition of an offence. It is unnecessary to consider when and how those principles could be utilised to resolve an ambiguity, because we are here concerned not with an ambiguity but with the imposition of an additional ingredient through interpretation. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We agreed with these observations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary on the question referred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In summary, initial innocent possession is <span class="font-italic">not </span>a requirement for conviction under s 403 of the Code. First, the context of s 403 sufficiently demonstrated that innocent possession could not have been an intended element of dishonest misappropriation. Such a requirement as to “negative” mental state would be highly unusual and would likely give rise to lacunae and absurdity in the law of property offences. Second, while no part of the extraneous evidence as to the legislative history of s 403 was in itself conclusive, they <span class="font-italic">collectively</span> pointed sufficiently towards an <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of Parliamentary intention to distinguish between the offender’s states of mind at the time of initial possession. Third, the absence of such a requirement was also supported by persuasive authority from the Sri Lankan Supreme Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 As we have answered the main question in the negative, we need not deal with the ancillary questions. While the parties’ submissions on the questions were helpful, we would prefer to address the important and difficult issues they pose if and when the appropriate facts are before us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Finally, we note that while the Co-Offenders initially filed separate criminal motions for leave to refer purported questions of law of public interest to this Court, they subsequently withdrew their applications while the Applicant chose to proceed with hers (see [24] above). Strictly speaking therefore, this criminal reference related only to the Applicant. In any event, as the question referred was answered in the negative, there were no grounds and no reasons apparent to us why the convictions and sentences of the Co-Offenders should be disturbed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon Judith Prakash   Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Chief Justice Judge of Appeal  Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ragbir Singh Bajwa (instructed) (Bajwa &amp; Co), <br/>Kertar Singh s/o Guljar Singh and Lee Wei Liang <br/>(Kertar &amp; Sandhu LLC) for the applicant; and<br/>Leong Wing Tuck, Jiang Ke-Yue, Kelvin Chong, Ang Siok Chen and Jocelyn Teo (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-center">_________________________________</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><font face="Calibri">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judith Prakash JA):</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>CoA held that initial innocent possession is not a requirement for a conviction under s 403 of the Penal Code for dishonest misappropriation. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The material facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          The applicant, Ho Man Yuk (“the Applicant”) was convicted in the State Courts on one count of abetment by conspiracy to dishonestly misappropriate monies under s 403 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Code”). On the basis of this conviction, she was also convicted on several counts under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) for money laundering in respect of the monies which had been misappropriated. In aggregate, she was sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment in respect of a total of 21 charges. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          On her appeal to the High Court, the convictions were upheld. She thereafter applied for leave to refer certain questions of law to the Court of Appeal. At the conclusion of the leave hearing, she was given leave to refer only the following question for determination:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Whether a conviction for dishonest misappropriation under s 403 of the Code can be made out only if the accused person had an innocent or neutral state of mind when he first came into possession of the property in question.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          In the reference, the Applicant argued that the question referred should be answered in the affirmative. According to her, an essential element of the offence of dishonest misappropriation under s 403 of the Code was that the misappropriating person had to have come into possession of the relevant property in an innocent or neutral manner. In her case, however, she had known from the outset that she was not entitled to receive the relevant monies. She was therefore dishonest, rather than innocent or neutral, at the time of initial possession. Accordingly, she argued that her convictions should be set aside.  </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          The Prosecution took the opposing position and argued that the question referred should be answered in the negative, relying primarily on the text and the history of s 403. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision on the question of law</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">5          Initial innocent possession is not a requirement for conviction under s 403 of the Code for dishonest misappropriation. Accordingly, the Applicant’s convictions were affirmed. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6          On a plain reading of s 403 of the Code, the accused person’s state of mind at the time of initial possession – whether innocent, neutral, or dishonest – was irrelevant to a conviction under that provision (at [<strong>33</strong>]). This reading of the provision therefore supported the Prosecution’s case (at [<strong>40</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7          On balance, the illustrations and explanations to s 403 neither supported nor denied the existence of the requirement for initial innocent possession under s 403 (at [<strong>52</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8          </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Section 404 of the Code was neutral on the requirement of initial innocent possession as its mental element could be construed as being assessed at the time of misappropriation or conversion rather than the time of taking possession of the property in question (at [<strong>56</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9          There was no issue with overlapping property offences under the Code. Further, there was no canon of interpretation that penal provisions should be construed such that no overlap would exist (at [<strong>59</strong>]). Indeed, it could not have been the legislative intent that innocent possession be an implicit requirement of s 403 of the Code (at [<strong>61</strong>]). Amongst other reasons, there were no other property offence which imposed a similar “negative” or exonerative <em>mens rea </em>requirement (at [<strong>62</strong>]). There would also be a clear lacuna and absurdity in the law if the requirement of innocent possession was upheld (at [<strong>72</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">10        The context of s 403 of the Code suggested that initial innocent possession was not a requirement for dishonest misappropriation (at [<strong>74</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">11        As the history of the legislation showed plainly that the intention of the drafters of the Indian Penal Code, from which the Code had originated, was that initial innocent possession would not prevent a subsequent dishonest misappropriation or conversion from constituting an offence, it would seem incongruous to infer an intention to also make initial innocent possession an ingredient of the offence (at [<strong>83</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">12        It was difficult to reconcile the local High Court decision in <em>Wong Seng Kwan v Public Prosecutor</em> [2012] 3 SLR 12 (“<em>Wong Seng Kwan</em>”) with the judgment of the High Court in the present case (at [<strong>91</strong>]). However, the discussion on innocent possession in <em>Wong Seng Kwan </em>was obiter and made without the benefit of full argument. It was therefore less persuasive on this aspect of s 403 (at [<strong>92</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">13        The Sri Lankan Supreme Court decision in <em>Walgamage v The Attorney-General</em> [2000] 3 Sri LR 1 was salient and persuasive authority against the innocent possession requirement (at [<strong>98</strong>]). The Indian cases were, however, not persuasive precedents as they were not consistent and did not appear to have seriously or thoroughly considered the innocent possession question (at [<strong>104</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">14        It was safer not to place reliance on the academic texts as they had not come to a consistent or conclusive landing on the innocent possession question (at [<strong>111</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">15        A rectifying construction could not be applied to assist the Applicant as there was nothing to rectify (at [<strong>115</strong>]). There was also no room for the strict construction rule to apply as the context of s 403 sufficiently demonstrated that innocent possession could not have been an intended element of dishonest misappropriation (at [<strong>117</strong>]). </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">16        The essential elements of an offence under s 403 of the Code are (at [<strong>38</strong>]):</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">(a)        that the thing in question constitutes movable property;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">(b)        that the accused person has misappropriated or converted such property to his own use; and</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">(c)        that the accused person, not being a person entitled to immediate and exclusive possession of such property, possessed a dishonest intent at the time of such misappropriation or conversion.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">All three elements appear on the face of the section. Once they are met, there will be an offence of dishonest misappropriation notwithstanding the ownership of the movable property concerned. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"> </span></em></span></em></span></p>
