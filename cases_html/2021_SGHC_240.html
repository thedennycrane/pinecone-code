<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  As set out in the Amended Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 17 September 2020.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Koyo International Ltd (“Koyo”) is a Singapore-incorporated company whose shares have been listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) since 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Between 12 August 2014 and 15 January 2016, Lin Eng Jue (“Andrew”) led a scheme to manipulate the price of Koyo shares (“the scheme”). There were altogether eight scheme members, including Andrew, Yeo An Lun (“Yeo”), Goh Qi Rui Rayson (“Rayson”), Teo Boon Cheang (“Steven”), Ang Wei Jie Simon (“Simon”) and the appellant. The scheme employed a total of 53 trading accounts opened in the names of 15 individuals with eight brokerages. On Andrew’s directions, the scheme members used various trading accounts under their control to trade Koyo shares amongst one another, as well as with other third parties trading on the market, and gradually pushed up the price at which Koyo shares were traded on the SGX.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Most of the trades conducted by the scheme members were on a “contra” basis. Contra trading involves buying shares without paying the full price of the shares upfront. The brokerage firms involved in the scheme permitted their accountholders to purchase shares without making full payment upfront, but the brokerages generally required the accountholders to make payment for the shares purchased within three days after the trade. The accounts used in the scheme were subject to trading limits set by the brokerage on the total value of shares that could be purchased on a “contra” basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The appellant, who was initially a broker and later a remisier with CGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“CIMB”), was part of the scheme from 6 February 2015 to 15 January 2016 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 234 days), after having been introduced to Andrew by the CEO of Koyo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Between February 2015 and October 2015, Andrew obtained the appellant’s assistance to procure trading accounts. The appellant convinced her existing clients at CIMB, as well as her family members who had trading accounts with CIMB and other brokerages, to let her use their trading accounts to trade Koyo shares. The individuals who provided their trading accounts were promised a commission of 10% from any profits made through their accounts and were assured that any losses incurred would be paid by the scheme members. These trading accounts were then used to trade Koyo shares on Andrew’s instructions, in pursuance of the scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Between October 2015 and January 2016, the appellant obtained more trading accounts to be used in the scheme. She informed her clients that she was considering leaving CIMB and joining either RHB Securities Singapore Pte Ltd (“RHB”) or KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd (“KGI”). She convinced her clients to open or reactivate trading accounts with the latter two brokerages. The appellant also convinced her family members to open trading accounts with other brokerages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Altogether, the appellant procured 31 trading accounts for the scheme. The accounts the appellant contributed to the scheme were used to perform 5,544 trades involving Koyo shares on a total of 176 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 15 January 2016 (Friday), SGX issued a “trade with caution” warning, stating that a “small group of individuals was responsible for 60% of the trading volume of Koyo [between 26 October 2015 and 14 January 2016], of which at least half of these trades were due to this group of individuals buying and selling among themselves”. After this announcement, Koyo’s share price crashed by almost 84%, from $0.34 on 15 January 2016 to closing at $0.056 on 18 January 2016 (the following Monday). A total of $3,119,034.93 in contra trading losses was incurred in the 31 accounts procured by the appellant, and Koyo’s market capitalisation fell by more than $58 million.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The DJ’s grounds of decision are published at <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lau Wan Heng </span>[2020] SGDC 293 (“GD”). In arriving at the sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment for the Market Rigging Offence, the DJ considered factors which contributed to the appellant’s culpability, the degree of harm caused by the Market Rigging Offence, the appellant’s relative level of criminality as compared to the other co-accused persons involved in the scheme, as well as the unreported case of <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Goh Hin Calm</span> HC/CC 13/2019 (20 March 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Hin Calm</span>”). I will elaborate on each of these considerations in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The DJ identified the following culpability-enhancing factors:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the appellant was motivated by personal gain;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the market rigging scheme was sophisticated and operated for a substantial period;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the appellant had played a critical role in the scheme; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the appellant had deceived her clients.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As for the harm caused by the Market Rigging Offence, the DJ took into account:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the severe market distortion, having regard to the increase in share price during the period of the scheme and the volume of trades performed in pursuance of the scheme;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the extent of damage wrought by the scheme, having regard to the crash in share price and loss in market capitalisation when the scheme unravelled;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the contra trading losses that resulted from the crash in Koyo’s share price;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the amelioration of the actual extent of harm caused to innocent third parties given that only one-third of the Koyo shares were floating, with most of the remainder being held by Koyo’s CEO and/or his family; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the fact that the accountholders were not truly innocent, blameless victims.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 When comparing the appellant’s criminality with that of her co-accused, the DJ made two key observations. First, the appellant was not the mastermind, but operated under Andrew’s directions. Second, the appellant’s overall criminality was higher than that of Yeo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On the basis that <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Hin Calm</span> was the most apposite sentencing precedent to the case at hand, the DJ applied a downward adjustment of 16 months from <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Hin Calm</span>’s sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment to arrive at 20 months’ imprisonment for the Market Rigging Offence, on account of the harm caused, as well as the culpability and overall criminality displayed by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Turning to the Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences, the DJ distinguished the appellant’s case from that of Rayson and Yeo, who received three weeks’ and two weeks’ imprisonment per charge respectively, on account of the greater number of charges faced by the appellant and the fact that she harnessed accounts for the scheme from her clients and family members. The DJ also noted that for the nine TIC charges under s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SFA relating to the CIMB accounts, the party deceived was the appellant’s own employer, to whom the appellant owed the duty of fidelity. After considering the precedent of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Prem Hirubalan </span>[2016] SGHC 156 (“<span class="font-italic">Prem </span><span class="font-italic">Hirubalan</span>”), in which a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was imposed on a s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SFA charge, the DJ sentenced the appellant to six weeks’ imprisonment for each Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offence, with three of these sentences to run consecutively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In arriving at her decision, the DJ gave weight to several mitigating factors put forward by the Defence, namely, the appellant’s cooperation during investigations, her genuine remorse, and her rehabilitative efforts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ submissions on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In this appeal, the appellant argues that the imposition of 20 months’ imprisonment for the Market Rigging Offence is manifestly excessive because the DJ had not given sufficient weight to the following factors:

</div> and certain factors unique to s 197 SFA offences do not feature in the list of factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span>. This is understandable given that s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SFA and s 197 SFA criminalise different offences which involve some distinct considerations. However, laying down a sentencing framework is not the only response to this gap. Guidance can also be rendered by setting out a list of non-exhaustive harm and culpability factors which include considerations unique to s 197 SFA offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Next, in advocating for a sentencing framework, the Prosecution points to the small pool of reported sentencing precedents which appear to diverge before and after <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span>.

First, the perceived divergence in outcomes in reported sentencing decisions must be understood in context. It can be attributed to the distinct fact patterns underlying those decisions, rather than to any inconsistency in judicial reasoning. Second, although the Prosecution has pointed to “numerous” post-<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span> cases where fines were imposed, there were in fact only four examples (with six offenders in total) highlighted in its submissions.

It is settled law that fines can have a deterrent effect in appropriate cases, and it may have been entirely fortuitous that all the cited examples simply did not warrant custodial terms. The fact that fines were imposed is by no means indicative of any clear sentencing pattern. The reference to these cases where fines were found to be appropriate on the facts therefore does not bolster the Prosecution’s case for a sentencing framework to be laid down. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I turn next to address the Prosecution’s submission that the imposition of fines became “exceedingly rare” after <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span> and imprisonment terms “became the norm” thereafter.

</div>
</div>
</div> With respect, this submission is flawed. It speculates on a purported causal link to <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span> when custodial sentences would in all likelihood have been imposed in any event on the facts of these two cases. Moreover, two reported cases in the span of six years after <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span> was decided (in 2015) are hardly empirically or even anecdotally demonstrative of the claim that fines became “exceedingly rare” and imprisonment terms thereafter “became the norm”. The Prosecution did not cite any other case examples, but even if there were other unreported cases where fines were not imposed, that would not necessarily signify the emergence of a “norm” if the facts at hand did not merit fines in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It is important to exercise prudence in relying on small sample sizes before readily drawing broad inferences and conclusions. It is this self-same small pool of reported sentencing precedents, which represents a subset of an already limited number of s 197 SFA prosecutions overall, that engenders difficulty in specifying either a sentencing benchmark or indicative sentencing ranges within the harm-culpability matrix proposed by the Prosecution. There have been relatively few prosecutions under s 197 SFA or its predecessor, s 97 of the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289, 1985 Rev Ed), over the years. Hence, as the Prosecution acknowledges, there is a corresponding paucity of reported decisions from both the lower courts and the High Court. Sentencing trends and patterns are not clearly discernible given the varying factual circumstances in each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Sentencing is always a fact-sensitive exercise. Having regard to the varying fact patterns, the available sentencing precedents do not go so far as to demonstrate that there is an undue clustering of sentences at the lower end of the sentencing range. The precedents do not suggest that there have been serious inconsistencies or obvious anomalies in sentencing practice. It would be fair to infer that the courts have also not encountered major difficulties in reasoning towards appropriate sentencing decisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 A workable and instructive sentencing framework should endeavour to rationalise and encapsulate the broad sentencing trends demonstrated in the more recent decisions. An attempt to construct a sentencing framework without sufficient guidance from reported sentencing precedents can lead to arbitrary indicative sentencing ranges that lack proper justification. Where there are few sentencing precedents, there may be difficulty in obtaining a sense of the prevailing sentencing practice, especially for newer or less commonly encountered offences. Specifying a sentencing framework under such circumstances may be an exercise in abstraction. This is particularly so where the offence in question can be committed in factually diverse situations involving varying degrees of harm and/or culpability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The potential problems of arbitrariness and abstraction are demonstrated by the Prosecution’s attempted justifications for the indicative sentencing ranges set out in its proposed sentencing framework. The Prosecution does not refer to sentencing decisions under s 197 SFA, primarily because there are few such decisions to begin with. But perhaps this may reflect its apparent reluctance to rely on the examples mentioned above at [33] where fines were imposed, notwithstanding that the appeals against sentence in those cases were either discontinued or dismissed. Instead, the Prosecution directly imports the sentencing ranges in the recently pronounced sentencing framework for offences under s 6 read with s 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2020] 5 SLR 807 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Chee Meng</span>”) at [84]) into its proposed sentencing framework for s 197 SFA offences.

</div> This glosses over the fact that the respective offences cover vastly different factual situations of offending and involve distinct policy considerations and protected interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Prosecution also contends that the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Wong Chee Meng</span> should apply instead of those set out in <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span><span class="font-italic"> Vladislav v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 4 SLR 609<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>”) for s 172A(2) of the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed). According to the Prosecution, this is because market rigging offences ordinarily warrant a custodial sentence, and <span class="font-italic">Wong Chee Meng</span> prescribes an indicative range of fines or up to one year’s imprisonment for the slight harm-low culpability category, whereas <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> restricts the slight harm-low culpability category to fines.

</div>
</div> Even if I accept the Prosecution’s argument, however, the Prosecution has not addressed the question of why the custodial sentence in the slight harm-low culpability category should be capped at one year’s imprisonment. Similarly, it is not clear whether the proposed sentencing ranges for the higher high harm and culpability categories of the matrix are correctly pegged at the baseline of two years’ imprisonment upwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In my assessment, it would be inadvisable to prescribe a sentencing framework for s 197 SFA offences at this juncture, without the benefit of rationalisation against a larger pool of sentencing precedents. To do so runs the risk of imposing arbitrary indicative sentencing ranges. In this connection, I would respectfully abide by the views of The Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in <span class="font-italic">Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 3 SLR 1097 at [11]. In that case, Menon CJ declined to prescribe a sentencing framework for a s 324 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) offence as he was not satisfied that there was sufficient sentencing jurisprudence existing under that provision. Similarly, it is more appropriate in my view to allow case law on s 197 SFA to develop further in response to the various factual situations that may come before the sentencing court. Accordingly, I decline to endorse the sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I accept that it is possible to craft a sentencing framework from first principles in an appropriate case without necessarily having to rely on a substantial existing body of sentencing precedents. Whether this approach is viable requires judicious assessment on a case-by-case basis. There should be a reasonable degree of confidence that fact-sensitive nuances in the relevant sentencing considerations have been properly taken into account for sufficient guidance to aid in the formulation of indicative sentencing ranges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Nevertheless, my observations above on the indicative sentencing ranges do not affect my assessment of the harm and culpability factors proposed by the Prosecution. These factors, in my view, are broadly applicable to the sentencing of most s 197 SFA offences and would provide considerable assistance in calibrating the appropriate sentence in future cases. I now turn to elaborate on these factors, before I apply these factors to the case at hand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Offence-specific factors: harm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I agree with the Prosecution that the following non-exhaustive factors have a bearing on the degree of harm occasioned by the accused’s offending conduct:

In assessing the distortion to the market for the particular security, the following factors may be considered: (a) extent of distortion to price, (b) extent of distortion to volume (both trading volume, and where appropriate, order book depth), and (c) gain or loss to market capitalisation brought about by the rigging.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Market rigging may also result in distortions in the broader market where, for example, the security that is manipulated is an important constituent of a broader stock market index.

</div> or a high level of sophistication of the offence. Depending on the facts of the case, it may be appropriate to amalgamate (a) the sophistication and (b) the involvement of planning and premeditation into a single aggravating factor: see <span class="font-italic">Wong Chee Meng</span> at [96]. What is key, at the end of the day, is to avoid double-counting aggravating factors: <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan</span> [2018] 5 SLR 799 at [92].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Turning to the third factor set out above, the frequency of offending is assessed by how often the offender took active steps towards the commission of offences, whereas the duration of offending refers to the time period over which the offender’s conduct lasted. Where the offender is part of a scheme perpetrating the market rigging offence, the assessment of frequency and duration should be focused on the period over which the offender’s individual acts in support of the scheme were committed. This has to be the case since the ultimate inquiry is directed towards ascertaining the offender’s individual culpability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The offender’s role in the overall scheme is also crucial. An offender who is higher up in the scheme’s hierarchy is generally more culpable than an offender who occupies a position at the lower rungs (see <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> at [60]–[61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Deception employed by the offender in the course of a market-rigging scheme adds to his or her culpability.

Since the Prosecution has taken into account the duration of offending for the purpose of assessing the appellant’s contribution to the scale of the scheme, I have considered the duration and frequency of offending in the assessment of the harm caused by the appellant’s conduct. The appellant did not object to the computational method adopted by the Prosecution in assessing frequency in the present case; it also affords a useful measure to evaluate the relative criminality of the appellant and her co-accused (see below at [87]).

This resulted in the appellant’s CIMB clients opening or reactivating a total of nine KGI trading accounts and eight RHB trading accounts, which were then handed over to Andrew for the purposes of the scheme.

I agree with the DJ that there are three instances where the appellant was, as the DJ rather mildly put it, “less than upfront with her clients”. First, to induce her clients into opening accounts with KGI or RHB, she told her clients that she was considering leaving CIMB for either of those brokerage firms because of “work issues”. Her clients were not informed of the true reason behind the need for them to open KGI or RHB accounts, which was that the CIMB accounts were running out of credit limits and the appellant needed them to open RHB and KGI accounts to contribute greater credit limits to the scheme.

While it is well-established as a general principle that an offender who is higher up in the scheme’s hierarchy is generally more culpable than an offender who occupies a position at the lower rungs, it is unhelpful to go one step further to rank the parties by their relative positions in the criminal enterprise. The sentencing court should prioritise substance over form and undertake a qualitative, fact-specific analysis as to how the offender has contributed and to what extent the offender is instrumental to the overall scheme. An offender who takes on a pivotal role in the scheme may be highly culpable, even if he or she is not the mastermind of the scheme (Kow Keng Siong, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2019) at para 12.077; see for example, <span class="font-italic">Than</span><span class="font-italic"> Stenly Granida Purwanto v Public Prosecutor</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 576 at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Yeo handed the log-in credentials of the accounts to Andrew, executed trades personally and acted as a runner to settle contra losses in accounts held or controlled by other scheme members.

</div> This position is not supported by prevailing case law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The case of <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span> at [36] and [49]–[51] draws a distinction between two types of unauthorised share trading under s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SFA: (a) situations where the account owner did not consent and (b) situations where there is lack of consent on the part of the securities trading firm with whom the account was opened. Where the facts fall within the first category, the need to ensure general deterrence is sufficiently pressing to warrant the imposition of a custodial sentence in most cases, given the greater detriment caused to public investors and the diminishing of public confidence in the securities market (<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span> at [49]). For the second category, “the degree of sanction required would, <span class="font-italic">in most cases</span>, be sufficiently expressed through a punishment of a lower order” [emphasis added] because the “need to protect innocent investors would be less pressing since the trading would have occurred with the consent of the relevant investor who owned the account” (<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span> at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span> at [51] went on to clarify that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">… [T]his is not to say that sentences of imprisonment should never, or only very exceptionally, be imposed for unauthorised share trading offences which involve the consent of the account holder.</span> <span class="font-italic">What is instead meant is that a sentencing court faced with such an offence will retain a broader discretion to vary the appropriate form of sentence to suit the </span><span class="font-italic">particular circumstances of the case.</span> In contrast, where the facts involve acts of unauthorised share trading by a remisier without his client’s consent, the public interest in ensuring general deterrence would generally apply strongly in favour of imposing a term of imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The statement made in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span> at [60], which the appellant relies upon (see above at [95]), must be read in light of the High Court’s holding at [51]. Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span>, properly understood, stands for the following proposition. A term of imprisonment is not the norm where there is no threat to innocent layperson investors, but the court still retains the discretion to determine the appropriate form of sentence where there is consent from the accountholder. This discretion to vary the type of sentence is broader in a situation where there is consent from the accountholder, as compared to a situation where there is no consent from the accountholder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In a similar vein, the more recent High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span>, which was heard by a three-judge coram, emphasised at [60]–[61] that the identity of the defrauded party alone is not determinative of whether a custodial sentence should be imposed, and that other aggravating factors can be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Finally, the fact that there is no breach of fidelity duty involved is not a consideration that precludes the imposition of an imprisonment term. The language used in <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span> at [64] does not indicate that the court will confine custodial sentences <span class="font-italic">only</span> to situations where employees in a financial institution abuse the duty of fidelity they owe their employers. In fact, it is clear from [61]–[62] of <span class="font-italic">Ng Sae Kiat</span> that all the facts that have a bearing on an accused person’s criminality will be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether a custodial sentence is warranted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Turning to the facts of this case, the circumstances clearly justify a custodial sentence. In the general run of cases where there is consent by the accountholder, the need to ensure general deterrence is less relevant, and the objective of specific deterrence takes greater precedence (<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Eng</span> at [50]). But the scale and the duration of the deception perpetrated by the appellant on securities trading firms render the appellant’s overall criminality so grave that general deterrence assumes the same importance as specific deterrence, if not more. The appellant committed 12 Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences. Each charge relates to one account. The deception was carried out concurrently on two securities trading firms for three to four months. An additional 19 s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SFA charges were taken into consideration for sentencing, involving five other securities trading firms. The glaring pervasiveness of the appellant’s deception makes it imperative for the court to categorically denounce such conduct and deter others from behaving similarly. Six weeks’ imprisonment for each Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offence is thus appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the imprisonment terms of three Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences should run consecutively</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The DJ ordered the sentences of imprisonment for DAC 929626-2019 (the “First Deceptive Practice Charge”), DAC 929628-2019 (the “Second Deceptive Practice Charge”) and DAC 929635-2019 (the “Third Deceptive Practice Charge”) to run consecutively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The appellant contends that these three sentences should have been ordered to run concurrently, since the crux of these charges was identical: all involved trades carried out in RHB or KGI between November 2015 and January 2016 in the final phase of the scheme.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I do not think that the DJ breached the one-transaction rule. The deception in the First Deceptive Practice Charge was on KGI, whereas the deception in the Second Deceptive Practice Charge was on RHB. The involvement of two different victims entails the invasion of two separate legally protected interests. The Third Deceptive Practice Charge also involves deception on RHB, over the same relevant period as the Second Deceptive Practice Charge. While there appears to be “proximity” in time as between the Second and Third Deceptive Practice Charges, the deception, in reality, was perpetrated on RHB through two different accountholders, and each charge involved multiple occasions of offending over a few months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Moreover, the one-transaction rule is an evaluative rule directed towards the enquiry as to whether an offender should be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time. This brings into play moral considerations and it would be impossible to resolve these solely by reference to the facts (<span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998 at [32]). The multiplicity of offences here greatly enhances the appellant’s culpability, brings the need for general deterrence to the fore and hence justifies the imposition of three consecutive sentences to adequately reflect the gravity of the Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I am aware that the multiplicity of offences has been considered at the first stage of calibrating the individual sentence for each Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offence and at the second stage of determining whether the global sentence should be enhanced by consecutive sentencing. There is authority to the effect that this factor should have primary relevance at the second stage (<span class="font-italic">ADF v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 1 SLR 874 at [92]). If the multiplicity of the offences is <span class="font-italic">only</span> considered at the second stage, arguably, the individual sentence for each Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offence could be lower than six weeks’ imprisonment. However, even if the individual sentences are adjusted downwards slightly, I am of the view that to appropriately encompass the appellant’s overall criminality, an imprisonment term close to 18 weeks in respect of the Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences would still have been in order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 For completeness, I make three further points. First, I agree with the DJ that the imprisonment term faced by the appellant is justifiably higher than those of Rayson and Yeo. The appellant was much more culpable when compared to them. Quite apart from the significantly higher number of s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SFA charges the appellant faced, unlike Rayson and Yeo, the appellant actively procured the accounts through which deception on two securities trading firms (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>KGI and RHB) was perpetrated. These considerations justify a much higher term of six weeks’ imprisonment for the appellant, as compared to three weeks’ and two weeks’ imprisonment for Ray and Yeo respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Second, the DJ should not have placed reliance on the breach of fidelity disclosed in the nine TIC charges relating to CIMB.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In so far as these nine TIC charges relate to a different victim, that justifies a sentencing uplift for the Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences as it shows the appellant’s pattern of criminality in committing s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SFA offences. However, the breach of fidelity disclosed in the TIC charges should not be a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> aggravating factor, because this fact is not present in the charges for the Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences. The proceeded charges relate to deception on RHB and KGI, and the appellant does not owe a duty of fidelity to these firms since there is no employer-employee relationship. The aggravating effect of TIC charges should be premised on the similarities between the offending conduct covered by the TIC charges and the proceeded charges. As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Navaseelan</span><span class="font-italic"> Balasingam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 767 at [17] noted, “the … effect of having admitted [to outstanding] charges would be that the [accused] had committed many more similar offences and that fact must aggravate the charges proceeded with”. Nonetheless, this does not render the total sentence of 18 weeks’ imprisonment manifestly excessive in the light of the scale, duration and overall pervasiveness of the appellant’s deception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Lastly, I accept that fines should be considered to disgorge profits where there is evidence of an offender’s financial gain arising from the offences. However, it is undisputed that the appellant was in dire financial straits and was heavily in debt owing to her involvement in the offences. Imposing a fine in such circumstances would likely result in the appellant serving an additional default term of imprisonment instead. The Prosecution rightly accepted that fines would not be appropriate in view of her financial circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the global sentence offends the totality principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Looking at the facts holistically, I am satisfied that the aggregate sentence is in line with the totality principle. As the Prosecution has highlighted, the appellant played a crucial role in a large-scale, highly sophisticated scheme, which occasioned extensive harm. She also faced a large number of charges.

However, a meaningful comparison cannot be made with <span class="font-italic">Prem </span><span class="font-italic">Hirubalan</span>, which involved a factually distinct situation. In particular, the multiplicity and scale of the offences in the instant case is far greater than what was present in <span class="font-italic">Prem </span><span class="font-italic">Hirubalan</span>, where the offender pleaded guilty to only two charges under s 201(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), along with one other charge under s 406 of the Penal Code.

</div> But there are clear difficulties in seeking to suggest that her global sentence is excessive based on such a comparison. Andrew and Simon have not been sentenced, let alone convicted after trial. It is neither possible nor productive to attempt any comparison between the appellant’s sentence and Andrew and Simon’s presumptive sentences.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Having considered the facts and the parties’ submissions, I find that the sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment for the Market Rigging Offence is not manifestly excessive and the custodial threshold has been crossed for the Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences. The DJ had accorded due weight to the mitigating factors. She did not err in ordering the imprisonment terms of three Proceeded Deceptive Practice Offences to run consecutively, and the global sentence is in keeping with the totality principle. For these reasons, I dismiss the appellant’s appeal against sentence.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon J<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right">Abraham Vergis SC and Loo Yinglin Bestlyn (Providence Law Asia LLC) for the Appellant;</div><div class="txt-body text-right">Suhas Malhotra, Tan Zhi Hao, Phoebe Leau and Pearly Ang (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Respondent.</div><div class="txt-body text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
