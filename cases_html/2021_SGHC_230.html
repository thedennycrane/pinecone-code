</div> It was not clear to me what the defendants meant when they said the parties had “resolved the matter”. If the defendants meant that they and the plaintiff had entered into a full and final settlement of any claims he might have against them in respect of their handling of the First Statutory Demand and the First Bankruptcy Application, or that the plaintiff had waived his rights in respect thereof, this was not specifically pleaded in the Defence (Amendment No. 2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 However, the defendants did plead in para 14 of their Defence that the defence of time-bar applied to the plaintiff’s claim in respect of their handling of the First Statutory Demand and the First Bankruptcy Application (s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Limitation Act”).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Regard must then be had to the plaintiff’s response in his Reply to the defendants’ pleading of this time-bar defence. In the Reply (Amendment No. 2) filed by the plaintiff (or, more precisely, filed by his then solicitors on his behalf) on 8 December 2020, it was stated in para 14:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Paragraph 14 of the Defence (Amendment No. 2) is admitted insofar as the 2nd Defendant’s error, in allowing the Statutory Demand issued on 3 February 2012 to lapse, is time-barred. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Para 14 of the Reply (Amendment No. 2) went on to state that “but for the 2nd Defendant’s error, the Plaintiff could have relied on the powers vested in the Official Assignee to recover the proceeds from the sale of the said properties”. This second sentence of para 14 of the Reply (Amendment No. 2) was clearly a response to that portion of para 14 of the Defence (Amendment No. 2) which was not expressly admitted by the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the assertion that in any event, the First Statutory Demand would not have lapsed in May 2012 and “would not have prevented Mr Kuhadas from selling his properties”. This second sentence did not detract from the admission in the preceding sentence that, in respect of para 14 of the Defence (Amendment No. 2), the “2nd Defendant’s error, in allowing the Statutory Demand issued on 3 February 2012 to lapse, [was] time-barred”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 With respect, this admission in the Reply (Amendment No. 2) of the time-bar defence in respect of the alleged error in allowing the First Statutory Demand to lapse was not addressed by the plaintiff, who appeared to have proceeded on the basis that no such admission was made. The plaintiff certainly did not show any reason why I should disregard this admission of time-bar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the interests of completeness, it should be noted that in the last sentence in para 15 of the Reply (Amendment No. 2), it was stated that the defendants “cannot rely on Section 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163) because their error, which resulted in the sale of the said properties, is simply stated to debunk allegations of Mr Kuhadas’ impecuniosity”. However, para 15 of the Reply (Amendment No. 2) was expressly stated to be a response to para 15 of the Defence (Amendment No. 2), which did not in any way relate to the defendants’ reliance on the defence of time-bar. Read in context, therefore, it did not appear that the last sentence in para 15 of the Reply (Amendment No. 2) in any way qualified the plaintiff’s clear admission of time-bar in para 14 of his Reply (Amendment No. 2). In any event, with respect, the reason given in para 15 of his Reply (Amendment No. 2) for the defendants’ alleged inability to rely on section 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act appeared garbled and made no sense (“<span class="font-italic">because their error, which resulted in the sale of the said properties, is simply stated to debunk allegations of Mr Kuhadas’ impecuniosity</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Even if I were to assume, for the sake of argument, that the admission in para 14 of the Reply (Amendment No. 2) could somehow be disregarded, the defendants having raised a limitation defence in para 14 of their Defence (Amendment No. 2), the burden would have fallen on the plaintiff to prove that his claim fell within the limitation period, and in particular, to prove that the date of accrual of his cause of action in negligence fell within the limitation period (<span class="font-italic">IPP Financial Advisers Pte Ltd v Saimee bin Jumaat and another</span><span class="font-italic"> appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 272 at [36]–[41]). On the evidence adduced before me, it was simply not possible to say that the plaintiff had proven this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In particular, it should be noted that the 2nd defendant had consistently testified that, upon discovering the First Bankruptcy Application had been filed one to two days out of time, he had called the plaintiff to apologise for his fault and to offer to absorb the cost and disbursements related to the filing of another bankruptcy application.

One key source of the plaintiff’s grievance arose from the fact that after he had registered the October 2011 Judgment with the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 14 February 2014 and served the Australian Bankruptcy Notice on Mr Kuhadas, the latter’s application to set aside the Australian Bankruptcy Notice was allowed by the FCC. The FCC held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that Mr Kuhadas at the very least had “raised an arguable case that the effect of [the 22 February 2013 Email] was to discharge Mr Kuhadas of his obligation to satisfy the [October 2011 Judgment]”. As noted earlier, this finding was upheld by the Federal Court of Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In respect of the Australian courts’ findings on the construction of the 22 February 2013 Email, the defendants raised a preliminary argument that these findings did not bind the Singapore courts in the context of the present proceedings.

The context of this email correspondence was clear: from the outset, it was evident that the 2nd defendant (on behalf of the plaintiff) and Mr Kuhadas were concerned with the issue of how the Second Bankruptcy Application should be dealt with. Following the filing of the Second Bankruptcy Application on 30 August 2012, Mr Kuhadas had corresponded with the 2nd defendant in an attempt to persuade the plaintiff to refrain from proceeding with the bankruptcy proceedings. A recurring theme in Mr Kuhadas’ emails was his lament that he had no money and had been obliged to sell off “whatever assets [he] had to pay for [his] personal expenses/debts”.

</div> On 3 October 2012, Mr Kuhadas had informed the 2nd defendant that he had “no objection to selling the only property in Singapore” which he still held, together with his wife and sister-in-law (the Ballota Park Property) – though he also claimed that “there may not be much equity left”.

</div> From the outset, however, it was made clear by the 2nd defendant to Mr Kuhadas that any funds realised from a sale of Ballota Park would only go towards part payment of the judgment debt. This may be seen in the 2nd defendant’s email to Mr Kuhadas on 24 October 2012, in which he had told the latter in no uncertain terms:

In his email on 2 January 2013, Mr Kuhadas enumerated what he thought were the “3 courses of action” open to the plaintiff in respect of the monies owed to him pursuant to the Suit 700 judgment: according to Mr Kuhadas, the plaintiff could choose to have him adjudged a bankrupt; or the plaintiff could postpone the bankruptcy proceedings with a view to tracking down his (Mr Kuhadas’) assets; or the plaintiff could discontinue the bankruptcy proceedings in return for half of the sale proceeds due to Mr Kuhadas after disposal of the Ballota Park Property.

</div> Mr Kuhadas indicated his preference for the last option. However, his suggestion was firmly rebuffed on the same day by the 2nd defendant (on behalf of the plaintiff), who indicated that the plaintiff was inclined to proceed with the second option (postponing the bankruptcy proceedings with a view to tracking down Mr Kuhadas’ assets).

</div> This time, he stated that his sister-in-law (who was one of the three co-owners of the Ballota Park Property together with him and his wife) had agreed to advance him a sum of $50,000 “as a one time settlement inorder [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] for Kevin [the plaintiff] to drop the bankrutpcy [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] against him [Mr Kuhadas] <span class="font-italic">so that the property can be sold without much difficulty</span>” [emphasis added]. Mr Kuhadas explained that his sister-in-law was desirous of recouping her CPF contributions to the property and did not want to get “embroiled” in his “dillemma [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]” (presumably his various debts); further, that he himself was running out of funds; that if the plaintiff wanted “some money”, then the “best course of action” was for the Ballota Park Property to be sold; and that the sale would “only go through smoothly and fetch a good price” if there were no “emcumbrances [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]” in the form of a bankruptcy application against one of its co-owners (Mr Kuhadas).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Mr Kuhadas’ email of 21 January 2013 was important because this was the first time that the sum of $50,000 was offered; and the email showed the context in which the sum was brought up. As seen above, this was the amount Mr Kuhadas’ sister-in-law was willing to lend him to persuade the plaintiff to “drop” the bankruptcy application and to let the sale of the Ballota Park Property go ahead smoothly. This email of 21 January 2013 was also important because it showed that Mr Kuhadas’ offer of a $50,000 payment was not stated by him to be in full and final satisfaction of the judgment sum of $1,226,289.70 owed to the plaintiff.

</div> If Mr Kuhadas’ 21 January 2013 email had been referred to, it would have been seen that Mr Kuhadas himself set out certain matters which explained why he was agreeable to the Second Bankruptcy Application being withdrawn simply to facilitate the sale of the Ballota Park Property at a “good price”: a sale of the Ballota Park Property would let his sister-in-law recoup her investment in the property and avoid getting embroiled in his financial problems; a sale would certainly help him (Mr Kuhadas) as he had been “cracking [his] head” over the imminent exhaustion of his existing funds and had no job or income or family support at that point; and a sale would also let the plaintiff get hold of “some money” since Mr Kuhadas’ sister-in-law was willing to advance him $50,000 to get the plaintiff to “drop” the bankruptcy proceedings to allow the property to be “sold without much difficulty”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It should also be noted that in following up with the 2nd defendant on the above suggestion on 23 January 2013, Mr Kuhadas acknowledged that he was “currently merely buying time”.

</div> Whilst that remark was made in reference to his facing “a number of creditors waiting in line” and not specifically in reference to the plaintiff, it showed that as far as Mr Kuhadas was concerned, the withdrawal of the Second Bankruptcy Application was not about enabling him to avoid bankruptcy for good, since he knew he could be bankrupted by any of his other creditors. Rather, it was about facilitating the sale of the Ballota Park Property for a better price, paying off his sister-in-law’s CPF contributions, getting “some money” for the plaintiff – and replenishing his own dwindling funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The further emails exchanged between the 2nd defendant and Mr Kuhadas lent support to the former’s assertion that both sides understood the 22 February 2013 email was not a full and final settlement of Mr Kuhadas’ liability for the full judgment sum. On 16 February 2013, Mr Kuhadas emailed the 2nd defendant to put forward a new proposal which differed substantively from his proposal of 21 January 2013.

</div> As seen above, his proposal of 21 January 2013 had been to pay the plaintiff $50,000 with an advance from his sister-in-law, so that the plaintiff would withdraw the Second Bankruptcy Application and allow the sale of the Ballota Park Property to proceed without encumbrance. On 16 February 2013, claiming that he had “no money” and that his immediate family was not supportive, he sought instead to “offer $25,000 as full and final setltlement [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to discharge [himself] from bankruoptcy [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”, on the basis that this amount would be paid from his share of the Ballota Park Property sale proceeds once the property was sold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Unsurprisingly, Mr Kuhadas’ new offer was rejected by the 2nd defendant (on behalf of the plaintiff).

</div> Having thus rejected Mr Kuhadas’ new offer, the 2nd defendant conveyed the plaintiff’s counter-offer to withdraw the bankruptcy proceedings on the following terms: Mr Kuhadas’ father could pay the sum of $25,000 upfront to the 1st defendant (as the plaintiff’s solicitors); in consideration of this $25,000 payment, the plaintiff would “wait until after completion of the sale of Ballota Park” and “then accept S$50,000 from [Mr Kuhadas’ share of the] sales proceeds”; and that upon receipt of the $25,000 and “[Mr Kuhadas’] written undertaking to pay” the $50,000, the plaintiff would agree to withdraw the Second Bankruptcy Application.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84  Mr Kuhadas replied to the 2nd defendant’s email on the same day (18 February 2013), stating that he understood “<span class="font-italic">Kevin’s</span> proposal” [emphasis added] and seeking to modify it to the extent that the balance to be paid to the plaintiff on the sale of the Ballota Park Property be “only $25,000”.

</div> The reference to “<span class="font-italic">Kevin’s</span> proposal” showed that Mr Kuhadas knew his attempt to achieve “full and final settlement” via payment of $25,000 was a non-starter. In this email response to the 2nd defendant, he made no further mention of “full and final settlement”. That he clearly understood that the $50,000 to be paid to the plaintiff would not in fact constitute full and final settlement of the full judgment debt was seen from his statement that he appreciated the plaintiff’s “good gesture of accepting $50,000 <span class="font-italic">in consideration of dropping the bankruptcy action</span>” [emphasis added]. Indeed, he attempted to demonstrate his own good faith and to assure the plaintiff that he was “not … trying not to honour [their] initial agreement of $50,000” by suggesting that the balance $25,000 to be paid upon the sale of the Ballota Park Property should “incur an interest of 10% p.a. payable to [the plaintiff] till it is paid or when the property is settled whichever is earlier”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 On 21 February 2013, the 2nd defendant replied to Mr Kuhadas’ email of 18 February 2013 to inform that the plaintiff had agreed to accept an upfront payment of $25,000, with the remaining $25,000 to be paid once the Ballota Park Property was sold, with interest on that remaining sum to be paid as suggested.

</div> The 2nd defendant also informed Mr Kuhadas of additional conditions requested by the plaintiff: namely, that the post-dated cheque for $50,000 provided by Mr Kuhadas’ father would continue to be held as security for the payment of the remaining $25,000; further, that Mr Kuhadas would sign all necessary documents to effect the seizure and sale of his shares in Magnetron. In conveying the second condition, the 2nd defendant added that should Mr Kuhadas fail to sign the documents, “the necessary application” would be made to court “for the company secretary to issue the share certificates anyway”: Mr Kuhadas was expressly warned that “[i]n such a case”, the plaintiff would “obtain further costs orders against [him] and Magnetron, which will only serve to increase the level of [his] indebtedness to [the plaintiff]”. This express warning and the reference to the “level of [Mr Kuhadas’] indebtedness to [the plaintiff]” was not without significance. Had the parties’ intention truly been to allow Mr Kuhadas to effect full and final settlement of the full judgment debt with the payment of $50,000 to the plaintiff, then it was anomalous for the 2nd defendant to be alluding to potential future increases in the level of Mr Kuhadas’ indebtedness to the plaintiff. In his email reply on the same day (21 February 2013), Mr Kuhadas did not raise any protests or objections in respect of the 2nd defendant’s remarks. While it is true that he thanked the 2nd defendant for “arranging a very amicable settlement” between him and the plaintiff, it would appear that he had in mind the “settlement” of the issue of the withdrawal of the Second Bankruptcy Application, because no reference was made to the judgment sum in Suit 700 and/or to “full and final settlement” of his liability for that judgment sum.

That email simply stated that in consideration of the payment of the two tranches of $25,000, the retention of the post-dated $50,000 cheque as security for such payment and the execution of the documents for the new Magnetron shares, the plaintiff was “agreeable to withdraw the bankruptcy application” once Mr Kuhadas had paid the first $25,000, executed the documents for the new shares, and “unequivocally” agreed to the retention of the $50,000 cheque as security.

That was not an issue which required adjudication in the present trial. Instead, the purpose of examining the correspondence between the parties prior to the conclusion of the agreement in the 22 February 2013 Email was to ascertain whether the 2nd defendant had breached the standard of care expected of a reasonably competent and diligent solicitor in the drafting of the said agreement. Bearing in mind the state of the law at the material time (see [72] to [75] above) and having regard to the context of the correspondence between the 2nd defendant and Mr Kuhadas in the period leading up to 22 February 2013, I was satisfied that the 2nd defendant was not in breach of the requisite standard of care. On the materials available, there was sufficient basis for a reasonably competent and diligent solicitor to take the view that as drafted, the 22 February 2013 Email went no further than documenting the parties’ agreement for the withdrawal of the Second Bankruptcy Application in order to facilitate the sale of Ballota Park free from “emcumbrances [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]” and thus to “fetch a good price” (in Mr Kuhadas’ own words).

</div> Mr Kuhadas had an implied duty to cooperate in the performance of the terms of the agreement in the 22 February 2013 Email by taking the necessary steps on his part – and this would certainly have included the steps required to bring about the sale of the Ballota Park Property, since it was a term of the parties’ agreement that the second tranche of $25,000 would be paid upon such sale (see <span class="font-italic">Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 at [48]–[50], cited by the High Court in the case of <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Tan Choo Suan (in her personal capacity and as executrix of the estate of Tan Kiam Toen, deceased) and others and other matters </span>[2015] SGHC 306 (at [141]–[143]) which the 2nd defendant referred to in cross-examination). Furthermore, as the 2nd defendant also pointed out in cross-examination, in the absence of any express deadline, Mr Kuhadas was nonetheless obliged to perform his part of the contract within a reasonable time.

For the purposes of the present trial, the key question was whether, in drafting the 22 February 2013 Email in the terms that he did, the 2nd defendant was guilty of any error which no reasonably competent solicitor would have made. In this connection, apart from relying on the Australian courts’ findings as proof of the 2nd defendant’s negligence, the plaintiff also gave evidence about the Third Statutory Demand which he had caused to be issued against Mr Kuhadas in Singapore on 26 November 2013. Mr Kuhadas applied to set aside this Third Statutory Demand, and while his application was dismissed at first instance, his appeal was allowed by the High Court, which set aside the Third Statutory Demand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Again, I did not find the High Court’s decision in any way probative of negligence on the 2nd defendant’s part in drafting the 22 February 2013 Email. Firstly, there was no evidence that the High Court made any finding to the effect that the 22 February 2013 Email constituted a full and final settlement of the entire judgment debt in Suit 700. As the plaintiff himself testified, his own understanding was that the High Court set aside the Third Statutory Demand on the basis that Rule 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Bankruptcy Rules (2002 Rev Ed) requires the setting aside of a statutory demand if the debt is disputed on grounds which appear to the court to be substantial; and in this connection, the threshold – which requires only the demonstration of a genuine triable issue – is not a high one.

Moreover, in considering whether a solicitor has exercised reasonable skill and care, the fact that the court – or another solicitor – might take a different view from the 2nd defendant on the construction of the 22 February 2013 Email did not mean that the 2nd defendant’s view was one which no reasonably competent solicitor would have taken. Otherwise, any solicitor would have to be in a constant state of anxiety as to whether a court might ultimately disagree with his interpretation of a legal point – and that is not what the law demands of solicitors. As Rajah JA observed in <span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong</span>, solicitors are not meant to be “on tenterhooks about whether or not the court might ultimately rule against their clients” (at [20]). A solicitor’s tortious duty of care to his client also does not require that he “guarantee” that any advice he gives or any document he drafts will be completely fool-proof and cast-iron.

</div> Mr Parwani had argued – successfully – before the assistant registrar on 18 July 2014 that the 22 February 2013 Email in no way constituted a full and final settlement of Mr Kuhadas’ liability for the full judgment debt: Mr Parwani could hardly have undertaken to put such an argument before the court if he had thought the 2nd defendant’s position so unmeritorious to the point that no reasonably competent solicitor would advise the point be taken (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Teh Lee</span> at [85(b)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 To sum up, therefore: for the reasons I have given in [71] to [93], I was unable to agree with the plaintiff that what the 2nd defendant did in drafting the 22 February 2013 Email fell below the standard of care required of a reasonably competent and diligent solicitor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It follows from the above findings that I did not agree the 2nd defendant had committed errors in the drafting of the 22 February 2013 Email which he came under a duty to “rectify” afterwards.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Causation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In any event, even if I were to assume for the sake of argument that the 2nd defendant was negligent in the drafting of the 22 February 2013 Email, the plaintiff would still have to prove on a balance of probabilities that such negligence was the cause of his being unable to recover the sums claimed in his statement of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 On the evidence before me, I found that the plaintiff was unable to satisfy me on the issue of causation. In particular, I did not find it possible to agree that but for the alleged negligence, he would probably have been able to recover the entire judgment sum from Mr Kuhadas. There was simply no evidence that Mr Kuhadas had the funds or means available to pay up the entire judgment sum; quite the contrary, in fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For example, even leaving aside what one might consider self-serving declarations by Mr Kuhadas himself, the undisputed evidence showed that Mr Kuhadas could not even muster sufficient funds to pay the $4,500 costs he was ordered to pay as a condition of the leave granted to him to appeal the October 2011 Judgment out of time (see [8]–[9] above). I inferred that if he could, he would have paid this relatively small amount; after all, he had been sufficiently concerned about appealing the judgment that he expended funds, time and effort in engaging counsel to put forward the application for leave.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 There is one other point which should be made on the issue of causation.  Throughout his testimony, the plaintiff stressed that his objective all along was to bankrupt Mr Kuhadas so that he could then get the Official Assignee to “follow the money trail” and to investigate the whereabouts of Mr Kuhadas’ alleged funds or assets.

</div> The plaintiff felt that the allegedly defective drafting of the 22 February 2013 Email was responsible for thwarting his efforts to bring bankruptcy proceedings, both here and in Australia. However, as the 2nd defendant pointed out in cross-examination, assuming the plaintiff had in fact managed to bankrupt the 2nd defendant, he would probably have realised “very little if anything at all” in terms of monies available to satisfy the Suit 700 judgment debt.

</div> Considering that Magnetron was jointly and severally liable for the Suit 700 judgment debt, it did not make sense for the plaintiff to reject entirely the option of using the company to recover siphoned funds from Mr Kuhadas and then enforcing the Suit 700 judgement against Magnetron. Yet the plaintiff could give no coherent explanation for his conduct. His assertion that it “won’t be easy taking on Mr Kuhadas’ wife” because “she’s a lawyer herself” appeared to be purely speculative, since there was no evidence that he had ever had any dealings with Mr Kuhadas’ wife.

</div> With respect, whilst the plaintiff no doubt felt aggrieved at Mr Kuhadas’ behaviour, his insistence that the satisfaction of his full judgment debt had to come from bankrupting this perceived villain prevented him from taking reasonable steps to mitigate his losses from the failed bankruptcy applications by exploring the alternative route of using Magnetron to pursue satisfaction of the judgment debt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Lastly, in his written submissions, the plaintiff put forward allegations of negligence by the defendants which were never pleaded: for example, the allegation that the 2nd defendant acted without his instructions in agreeing to stay enforcement action against Mr Kuhadas pending the hearing of the latter’s applications to set aside part of the Suit 700 judgment and for extension of time to appeal that part of the said judgment (see [7] above).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The general rule is that parties are bound by their pleadings, and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties have not put into issue (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span><span class="font-italic"> (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [38]). The plaintiff failed to show the existence of any circumstances in this case which would justify departing from this general rule. I was therefore unable to accept allegations which were raised in his closing submissions but which were not pleaded. In any event, I should add that aside from the plaintiff’s bare assertion, there was no evidence to support the allegation that the 2nd defendant acted without his instructions in agreeing to stay enforcement action against Mr Kuhadas pending the hearing of the latter’s applications for setting-aside and extension of time to appeal. On the contrary, the defendants’ letter to Mr Kuhadas’ then solicitors on this matter was clearly copied to the plaintiff (“cc client”); and there was no evidence of any protest or expression of outrage from the plaintiff following this letter.

</div> In the interests of completeness, I should point out that in any event, the plaintiff himself conceded in cross-examination that even <span class="font-italic">before</span> he obtained judgment in Suit 700, he had already discussed with the 2nd defendant the possibility of freezing Mr Kuhadas’ assets. At that stage, the 2nd defendant had already advised him on the costs of an application for a <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunction, and he had accepted that he “probably didn’t have the money” to make such an application.

In any event, it would appear that the plaintiff’s claim of vicarious liability vis-à-vis the 1st defendant was based on the belief that they were the employer of the 2nd defendant – which was not correct.
