<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal to a judge in chambers in
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 115 of 2011 (“the Appeal”) by the
                    first to third defendants <em>viz</em> Lee Gim Siong, Oh

                    (“the AR”) in favour of Tan Teck Boon (“the
                    plaintiff”). The AR had on 31 March 2011 awarded damages to the plaintiff

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellants appealed to reverse or reduce the
                    damages awarded for:-</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">loss of future earnings

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The other damages awarded by the AR (which
                    totalled $88,714.30) were not disputed and partial payments were made to the
                    plaintiff in two tranches on 14 August 2009 and on 27 October 2010
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff’s injuries stemmed from a
                    traffic accident with the Appellants on 26 December 2006 which involved the
                    plaintiff’s motor vehicle and the vehicles driven by the first and second
                    defendants. The plaintiff sued for his injuries which included fractures to his
                    right thigh bone, right forearm and left wrist. On 14 December 2009,
                    interlocutory judgment by consent was entered for the plaintiff against the
                    Appellants in the proportion of 90% and 10% for the first defendant and jointly
                    against the second/third defendants respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The undisputed facts regarding the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff was born in 1977 and was 33 years
                    of age at the date of assessment. He was/is the sole-proprietor of Tom Express
                    which is a courier business. Under a “DHL Owner Operator
                    Agreement” made with DHL Express (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“DHL”), Tom Express provided express transport services for DHL
                    over certain routes (“the DHL Agreement”). The DHL Agreement was
                    given to ex-employees of DHL to run their own business of delivering goods and
                    documents for DHL. The plaintiff started operating Tom Express in September 2005
                    and he <em>personally</em> carried out courier assignments
                    in the Changi South Lane and Bedok North areas. He also paid one Ahmadkalil Bin
                    Mohamed (“Ahmadkalil”) to carry out courier assignments within the
                    Tampines Central area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff would occasionally rely on a
                    company called i.Logistics Pte Ltd if he or Ahmadkalil were not available to
                    complete the assigned jobs. After the accident in December 2006, the plaintiff
                    was unable to personally make courier deliveries and took on what the Appellants
                    described as a “more managerial role in the
                business”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It was not disputed that the plaintiff’s
                    business had grown and he was earning more than he did before the accident. From
                    his tax returns, it was not disputed that the profits earned by Tom Express was
                    the plaintiff’s only source of income. The table below tabulates the net
                    profit of Tom Express over the last 5 years:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The disputed facts regarding the extent of the plaintiff’s
                recovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The injuries suffered by the plaintiff were not
                    disputed. The medical report of his treating doctor, David Paul Bell (“Dr
                    Bell”), dated 27 March 2009, stated that the plaintiff underwent surgery
                    for the following injuries:-</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">closed fracture of the shaft of the right
                            femur;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">closed fracture of the right ulna;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">closed fracture of the left distal
                        radius.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The AR noted (at [3] of her
                    Grounds of Decision [the GD”]) that the plaintiff was discharged from
                    hospital on 3 January 2007 but had two further surgeries for revision of
                    fixation and bone grafting on 22 February 2007 and 3 October
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff was given hospitalisation leave
                    continuously from 26 December 2006 to 14 September 2010. Besides
                    several surgical scars on his right forearm, left wrist, both hips and right
                    knee caps, the plaintiff suffered residual pain in his right groin (also
                    referred to as his right inner thigh) and left wrist. His right leg was also
                    shortened by 1cm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The dispute between the parties centred on the
                        <em>extent</em> of the plaintiff’s recovery from
                    his injuries. The Appellants argued that the plaintiff may need to rely on pain
                    medication intermittently, but he had recovered uneventfully from his injuries
                    and <em>could return to courier work even though he may require
                        assistance to carry heavy loads</em>. The plaintiff’s position
                    was that the pain in his right thigh <em>prevented him from
                        continuing to personally carry out courier assignments</em>. The AR
                    (at [7] of her GD) preferred the opinion
                    of the plaintiff’s two experts and agreed that he could no longer carry
                    out courier assignments personally. The Appellants did not appeal against this
                    finding and it was on the basis that the plaintiff could no longer carry out
                    courier assignments personally that the loss of pre-trial earnings, loss of
                    future earnings and loss of earning capacity were assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   Loss of pre-trial earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The AR in her GD, citing <em>Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 587 at [29]
                        (“<em>Chai Kang Wei Samuel</em>”), did
                    not find it necessary for the plaintiff to prove his business had suffered loss
                    after his accident in order for him to claim pre-trial loss of earnings. She
                    found that if the accident had not happened, the plaintiff would have continued
                    to personally carry out deliveries and would not have needed to pay others to
                    cover his courier work. In order to put him in the position he had been before
                    the accident, the AR held that the plaintiff should be compensated for the cost
                    of paying someone to do his work. The AR then rejected the Appellants’
                    argument that the plaintiff was not entitled to a claim for loss of earnings
                    because the profitability of his business increased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff claimed a total of $146,661 for
                    loss of pre-trial earnings - $117,271 paid to Neo Say Seong
                    (“Neo”) and $29,390 paid to i.Supplies Pte Ltd
                    (“i.Supplies”) to carry out courier assignments on his behalf from
                    January 2007 to October 2010. The AR only allowed the plaintiff to recover the
                    sum ($117,271) paid to Neo. The AR found that on the evidence i.Supplies was
                    hired only when Neo was unable to carry out deliveries and the plaintiff had
                    conceded that even before the accident, he would hire someone else to take on
                    his duties during the times he could not report for work. The AR found it
                    unbelievable that the plaintiff would have “singlehandedly” been
                    able to do all the work Neo and i.Supplies did (see [41] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   Loss of future earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The AR rejected the Appellants’
                    submission that the plaintiff did not suffer any drop in his assessable income
                    since his income increased after the accident. The AR stressed again that
                    “what was important was that but for the accident, the plaintiff could
                    have earned even more by carrying out courier assignments himself rather than
                    paying Neo to do so on his behalf” ([44] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The AR also rejected the Appellants’
                    submission that the plaintiff could still personally deliver the goods, albeit
                    at a slightly reduced capacity with light loads. The AR found that an award of
                    loss of future earnings appropriate because there was sufficient evidence before
                    her to fix a multiplier and multiplicand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The AR awarded $214,613 for the loss of future
                    earnings using as the multiplicand, the average of Neo’s annual pay in
                    2008 and 2009 <em>viz</em> $30,659. For the multiplier, the
                    AR found that “[b]ut for the uncertainties introduced by the accident,
                    there was every indication that the plaintiff would continue as a contractor for
                    DHL using Tom Express” (GD at [50]). The AR found that the
                    plaintiff’s age (33) was not the only factor to be taken into account
                    because as a sole-proprietor of a business, there was no fixed retirement age.
                    The AR also found that the “profit and loss statements of Tom Express
                    showed that the costs of the business were high, with certain items of expense
                    appearing obviously inflated and not supported by any documentary
                    evidence” (GD at [50]). The AR reduced the plaintiff’s multiplier
                    of 15 to 7.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iii)   Loss of earning capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The AR was satisfied that loss of earning
                    capacity could also be awarded in this case – based on the evidence, there
                    was a real risk that the plaintiff, because of his injuries, could lose his
                    contract with DHL before the estimated end of his working life. The contract
                    with DHL was Tom Express’ sole business. If Tom Express lost that
                    contract, the plaintiff’s ability to compete in the labour market would
                    certainly be diminished whether he chose to continue running Tom Express and
                    seek alternative sources of business, or look for a different job. The AR noted
                    that because of the plaintiff’s inability to personally carry out courier
                    assignments, Tom Express would naturally have higher costs than its competitors
                    because it would always have to pay for one additional courier. The plaintiff
                    would suffer from having little opportunity for physical contact with his
                    customers. The plaintiff was also disadvantaged by being limited to sedentary
                    occupations and having only primary school qualifications. The AR gave a lump
                    sum award of $30,000 for the plaintiff’s loss of earning
                capacity.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Principles applicable to appeals on assessment of damages </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Court of Appeal in <em>Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan Shwu Leng</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 made
                    it clear that the judge was not constrained by the principles set out in
                        <em>Davies v Powell Duffryn Associated Colleries</em>
                    [1942] AC 601 when considering an appeal on assessment of damages in a
                    Registrar’s Appeal. The Court of Appeal held at [17] that all appeals from a Registrar to a
                    judge in chambers were dealt with by an actual rehearing of the application and
                    the judge was entitled to treat the matter as if it came before him or her for
                    the first time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   Did the AR err in law or fact in her award for loss of
                pre-trial earnings? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The assessment was conducted by the AR over 6
                    days - 1 to 3 November 2010, 3 to 4 January 2011 and 6 January 2011. Pre-trial
                    loss of earnings is an item of special damages and needs to be specifically
                    proven to be recoverable (<em>Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik
                        Boon</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 513 at 517F). The critical
                    question to answer is, was the plaintiff’s cost of hiring a replacement to
                    cover his courier assignments from the time of his accident to the date of
                    assessment a real assessable loss proven by the evidence, notwithstanding that
                    the plaintiff’s business actually increased in
                profitability?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Appellants argued that the plaintiff had
                    failed to prove any real assessable drop in earnings because his income actually
                    increased during the period between the time of accident and the date of
                    assessment. The Appellants disagreed that his earnings were affected by the sum
                    total of what he paid an extra worker to do on his behalf. The AR had rejected
                    the Appellants’ argument that loss of pre-trial earnings can only be
                    calculated by comparing what the plaintiff earned pre-accident and what he
                    earned post-accident. The AR cited the proposition in <em>Chai
                        Kang Wei Samuel</em> at [29]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The overarching objective of awarding damages is to <em>compensate</em> the injured victim by restoring him or her to the
                        position that he or she would have been (in a monetary sense) had the
                        accident not happened.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis in original)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellants had argued that this
                    proposition was used in the context of loss of future earnings and should not be
                    applied for pre-trial loss of earnings. This argument of the Appellants is
                    flawed. While the proposition was used in <em>Chai Kang Wei
                        Samuel</em> in the context of loss of future earnings, the proposition
                    being applied is clearly a <em>general</em> principle
                    embodying the compensatory purpose of damages in personal injuries as stated by
                    Lord Blackburn in <em>Livingstone v Raywards Coal Co</em>
                    (1880) 5 App Cas 25 at 39:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in settling the
                        sum of money to be given for reparation of damages <b>you
                            should nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the
                            party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in the same position as
                            he would have been if he had not sustained the wrong</b> for
                        which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In <em>Chai Kang Wei
                        Samuel</em>, the claimant’s post-accident income was slightly
                    more than her average yearly income pre-accident. However, the Court of Appeal
                    held at [28] that it would be wholly
                    inequitable to hold that the victim suffered no loss just because her
                    post-accident income was slightly more than her average yearly income
                    pre-accident. The injury had affected the number of hours the claimant was able
                    to work and a more accurate reflection of her loss was the actual number of
                    hours she had worked before the accident multiplied by the actual rate she was
                    earning after the accident (since the rate was normally higher with inflation
                    and her greater experience).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, the AR held that to put
                    the plaintiff in the position he had been before the accident meant that he
                    should be compensated for the cost of paying someone to do his work, regardless
                    of the increased profitability of his business. For sole proprietorship cases, I
                    am of the view that the nature of the claimant’s job should be carefully
                    examined. The AR’s reasoning was based on her assumption that to place the
                    plaintiff in the position he was in before the accident, he should be
                    compensated for having to hire another driver to replace him in his driving
                    role. However, the difficulty in assessing the plaintiff’s damages was due
                    to the fact that he had <em>dual</em> roles – acting
                    both in a <em>managerial</em> and <em>operational</em> (<em>ie</em> driving) capacity
                    for Tom Express. The Appellants would not be wrong in arguing that it is
                    possible Tom Express became more profitable because the plaintiff was focusing
                    his energies more fully on his managerial role. The problem with calculating
                    loss of earnings and profits in a sole proprietorship context is that there are
                    many uncertain contingencies that will affect the final profits of a business.
                    These are valid concerns in assessing pre-trial loss of earnings for the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The AR did not refer to other cases besides
                        <em>Chai Kang Wei Samuel</em> in her analysis of
                    pre-trial loss of earnings. Neither did the parties submit any authorities with
                    similar facts on point where the Court had awarded loss of pre-trial earnings
                    despite the victim’s business being more profitable. In this regard, the
                    English Court of Appeal case of <em>Phillips v Holliday &amp;
                        ANR</em> [2001] EWCA Civ 1074 (“<em>Phillips v Holliday</em>”) is particularly useful. In
                        <em>Phillips v Holliday</em>, the claimant was awarded
                    loss of pre-trial earnings despite his business being more profitable. The
                    claimant worked for a company both administratively (as a contracts manager) and
                    manually (painter and decorator). The Court of Appeal treated the profits of the
                    company as the claimant’s own, as the company was owned fully by the
                    claimant’s wife with the wife also being the sole director of the company.
                    Similar to our case, the Court of Appeal found that the claimant’s
                    injuries severely limited his ability to carry out the manual work he used to be
                    able to do for the company as a painter and decorator and he could only carry
                    out administrative work. Most pertinently, the Court of Appeal held at [20] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the fact that the claimant has made a success of the business as
                        an administrator and supervisor <b>does not mean either that
                            he might not have been more successful if able to do much of the manual
                            work himself</b> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Court of Appeal also addressed another
                    valid concern in our case at [25]
                    of:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>…the fact that the claimant had worked in a
                            managerial capacity after the accident. How then should that fact be
                            reflected in this estimate of damages?</b> One would think that
                        if the claimant was able to spend more time on the administration side of
                        the business, and if the business as was suggested by the claimant was
                        growing, then profits would increase as in fact they did.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Court of Appeal recognised that the
                    inability of the claimant to carry out the manual work that he used to do was
                        <u>a loss</u> even if the company had an increase in
                    profit at [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The profits then picked up, <b>but if the company would be
                            having to pay painters to do the work the claimant could otherwise have
                            done, it is likely that the profitability was not as great as it should
                            be</b>. If the figure of £269 were made a net figure of say
                        £200 [the evidence was that the claimant was taking from the business a
                        figure of around £269 immediately prior to the accident] <b>and if a deduction is made in accordance with the figures shown
                            in the schedule to Mr Mould’s report (page 118) as those which he
                            should have earned as an administrator</b>, then on my
                        calculation one reaches a figure of £18,748 as the loss between
                        accident and trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is also important to consider how the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Phillips v Holliday</em> distinguished the
                    case of <em>Ashcroft v Curtin</em> [1971]
                    1 WLR 1731 (“<em>Ashcroft v
                    Curtin</em>”) at [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This does not seem to me to be a case like <em>Ashcroft v
                            Curtin</em> [1971] 1 WLR 1731 CA in which the Court of Appeal felt
                        driven to hold that the records of a business were such that there was
                        simply no basis for making a calculation. This is a case where albeit it is
                        difficult to make a calculation the starting point is there and the court
                        should strive to make a proper deduction in order to reach an appropriate
                        figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Ashcroft v
                        Curtin</em>, the claimant was a skilled engineer who carried a
                    successful business through a private company of which he was the active
                    managing director. The profits of the company had declined but the claimant had
                    failed to claim loss of profits owing to his disabilities because the
                    company’s accounts were unreliable. The Court of Appeal in <em>Ashcroft v Curtin</em> had made an observation that may be
                    helpful to the present case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But I am very doubtful about the validity of this approach, <b>for if another man had been engaged to do the plaintiff’s
                            pre-accident work, it does not follow that the profits would have gone
                            down by the amount of his salary</b>. On the contrary, I see the
                        force of the observation of Mr. May that<b>, as no
                            other man was in fact engaged, it is irrelevant to consider what would
                            have happened if he had been</b>, so far from producing a drop in
                        profitability, his engagement might equally well have led to a realisation
                        of the 10 per cent increase which Mr. Boulter assumed would have enured
                        but for the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The <em>obiter dicta</em> in <em>Ashcroft v Curtin</em> suggests that the Court cannot assume that the
                    profits may go down by the amount of salary used to hire the replacement for the
                    pre-accident work, for the replacement may have cause the business to be more
                    profitable. However, what <em>Phillips v Holliday</em> is
                    stating is that <em>even if the business becomes more
                        profitable</em>, the profits could have been even greater if the
                    claimant did not have to bear the additional cost of hiring the replacement for
                    doing the work he could have done himself. To prevent over-compensation the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Phillips v Holliday</em> would then
                    consider the appropriate deduction for the value of the claimant’s
                    increased managerial role.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Therefore, although the claimant in <em>Phillips v Holliday</em> did not claim for the expense of
                    hiring someone to paint on his own behalf as in our case, in principle, the
                    plaintiff can claim for the cost of paying someone to do his work despite the
                    increase profits earned by Tom Express. On closer examination of the facts, the
                    plaintiff had hospitalisation leave from the accident up to 14 September 2010
                    – he clearly could not physically carry out the courier services he was
                    contracted to do. He had to hire someone to deliver the goods on his personal
                    route to maintain the contract with DHL. I note that the plaintiff’s
                    contract with DHL in 2005 required him to provide two delivery men to carry out
                    the work while his current contract with DHL requires him to employ at a minimum
                    of 3 full time delivery men. However, Gee Say Liang (“Gee”), the
                    manager of DHL had clarified at the assessment hearing that the decision to hire
                    an extra driver and buy an extra van in 2008 was the plaintiff’s and had
                    nothing to do with DHL:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Did DHL request the Plaintiff to top up his
                            resources by hiring one extra courier and buying one extra van or was
                            this decision made by the Plaintiff on his own? This is in
                        2008.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That decision was made by the Plaintiff but we sat
                            down with him and we told him that your area is growing, if you think
                            you can handle the growth by just maintaining 2 then that is fine, we
                            are not forcing him to hire 1 extra man. But if he keeps to 2 and he
                            cannot manage the business then that would affect his performance and
                            the performance of the company. The decision was made by him – not
                            something we forced onto him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the evidence, I am of the view that the
                    plaintiff has proven on a balance of probabilities that he had hired Neo to
                    replace him in his courier assignments. The plaintiff had also testified that he
                    had to hire a replacement driver to prevent his contract with DHL from being
                    terminated. However, the AR was right in rejecting the plaintiff’s claim
                    for the cost of hiring i.Supplies as pre-trial loss of earning. If the principle
                    is to compensate the plaintiff for the cost of paying someone to do <em>his work</em>, it is only reasonable to compensate him for
                    the cost of the driver he hired to replace him. As the AR stated at GD [41], “[i]t seemed unbelievable that
                    the plaintiff would have single-handedly been able to do all the work that Neo
                    and i.Supplies did.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Even if I accept the $117,271.00 cost of
                    hiring Neo from the period of accident to the date of assessment as pre-trial
                    loss of earnings, the further question that needs to be asked and that was asked
                    in <em>Phillips v Holliday</em> is whether an appropriate
                    deduction should be made for the fact that the plaintiff could take on
                    additional managerial duties after the accident. The problem when the claimant
                    used to occupy dual capacities (administrative/managerial and
                    operational/manual) is the Court is naturally wary of over-compensating the
                    claimant. In <em>Phillips v Holliday</em>, the Court of
                    Appeal had data from which to deduct the appropriate amount for the
                    claimant’s administrative work. In our case, we do not have such data and
                    the plaintiff submitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[he] did not make any significant contribution to his business as his
                        primary role prior to the accident was to be on the road and make the
                        courier deliveries. <b>His role post-accident did not evolve
                            into anything more as there was never any significant or regular

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The evidence on record does provide support
                    for the fact that the plaintiff’s role post-accident did not evolve into
                    substantial managerial duties. His evidence was that he only needed to go back
                    to the office to check on matters 4-5 times a year:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Tom Express was started only in 2005 and while
                    the business had expanded from 2 to 3 drivers and two lorries, the business is
                    admittedly still small-scale. In the circumstances, any additional value of the
                    plaintiff’s administrative work from the date of accident to the
                    assessment would likely be nominal. It would be fair to award him the sum of
                    $117,271 as pre-trial loss of earnings for the cost of hiring Neo without any
                    deduction for administrative work. Accordingly, I uphold the AR’s award
                    for pre-trial loss of earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   Did the AR err in law or fact in her award for loss of
                future earnings?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The AR’s reasoning for this award was
                    similar to her reasoning for pre-trial loss of earnings. At [44] of the GD, the AR said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…what was important was that but for the accident, the Plaintiff
                        could have earned even more by carrying out courier assignments himself
                        rather than paying Neo to do so on his behalf. In my judgment, the Plaintiff
                        was unlikely to be able to return to carrying out courier assignments
                        personally in the near future and would continue to need to hire someone to
                        cover him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The AR also found that there was sufficient evidence before her to fix
                    a multiplier and multiplicand to award the Plaintiff loss of future
                    earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Phillips v
                        Holliday</em>, the Court of Appeal had also awarded loss of future
                    earnings to the claimant at [33]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By being able to spend more time on administration and supervision it
                        seems at least that the business has improved from the pre-accident
                        position. <b>It might however have improved further if the
                            claimant had been able to do more manual work</b> and there is no
                        doubt that if the business does not flourish the claimant is at a serious
                        disadvantage in the labour market. The claimant is entitled to damages to
                        reflect both aspects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal had also added at [34] that “[t]he next question is what deduction should
                    be made for the fact that <em>money will still be paid out to the
                        claimant albeit his role will be that of administrator</em> and the
                    manual work that he can do will be much more limited”. Previously for
                    pre-trial loss of earnings, the concern was also that the claimant may be
                    overcompensated if there was no appropriate deduction for the value of the
                    claimant’s increased capacity for managerial work. It was noted that the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Phillips v Holliday</em> awarded a
                    sum for loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity together, but it
                    would be more appropriate to assess them separately in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I believe from her GD that the AR may have not
                    fully considered the aspect of deducting the value of the plaintiff’s
                    increased managerial role after the accident. For pre-trial loss of earnings,
                    the evidence did show that the plaintiff’s administrative work did not
                    change substantially from what he carried out pre-accident. However, in light of
                    the fact that the plaintiff’s business is expanding and increasing in
                    profits, it would be unsafe to assume that in future he will always be a full
                    time driver for his company concurrently with his increasing managerial
                    role.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     A number of local cases of claimants in sole
                    proprietorships may provide some guidance. In <em>Wong Kim Lan v
                        Christie Kolandasamy</em> [2004] SGDC 234 (“<em>Wong Kim Lan</em>”), the District Court awarded a sole
                    proprietor a sum of $45,000 for loss of earning capacity. The sole proprietor
                    designed jewellery for manufacture within her own factories and recommended
                    designs to customers. The Court drew an adverse inference against the sole
                    proprietor and held that she had earned more after the accident because she
                    failed to produce evidence to prove her post-accident income. Although the sole
                    proprietor hired more designers to assist her in her work, she did not claim as
                    in the present case that she should be compensated for the additional cost of
                    designers and therefore there was also no evidence provided for this aspect. A
                    key distinguishing factor of <em>Wong Kim Lan</em> from the
                    present case is that the business of the sole proprietor there was on a much
                    larger scale than the plaintiff’s -- her business had grown from 5 in
                    Singapore and 200 in China to 10 in Singapore and 300 in China. <em>Wong Kim Lan</em> would be a situation where it was so clear
                    that the claimant was more profitable in his or her managerial role that the
                    appropriate deduction of the claimant’s managerial work would likely leave
                    no claim left for loss of future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Koh Soon Pheng v Tan Kah
                        Eng</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 538 (“<em>Koh
                        Soon Pheng</em>”), the High Court upheld an AR’s award of
                    $180,000 for loss of earning capacity to a 42 year old sole-proprietor who owned
                    a motorcycle workshop and whose specific skill was to repair large motorcycles
                    with high capacity engines. The High Court had upheld the AR’s award for
                    loss of earning capacity instead of loss of future earnings as the High Court
                    had found that it was too speculative to determine how well the claimant’s
                    business would perform in future. It is noteworthy that the Court stated at
                        [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>No doubt the plaintiff would earn a little less because
                            he would have to incur wages which would not have been payable had he
                            remained able to do the work on his own</b>, but this does not
                        mean that the plaintiff’s business cannot still be brought back to a
                        profitable situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the Court recognised the loss of earnings similar to the present
                    case when the claimant had to hire someone to do the work he used to do, no
                    award was made since the claimant there did not actually claim to have hired
                    someone to supplement his reduced working abilities. In <em>Koh
                        Soon Pheng</em>, the business was also making losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Ang Leng Hock v Leo Ee
                        Ah</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 361 (“<em>Ang
                        Leng Hock</em>”) , the claimant was an independent contractor
                    for Grand Court providing services for outdoor catering functions. He was
                    awarded loss of earning capacity at a multiplicand of $1,100 with a multiplier
                    of 10 to compensate for his injury that prevented him from being able to carry
                    heavy loads. The multiplicand of $1,100 was to reflect the cost of hiring a
                    worker to help the claimant carry heavy loads. The plaintiff relied on this case
                    to support his claim for loss of future earnings. However, while it was clear in
                        <em>Ang Leng Hock</em> that the award would compensate
                    for the claimant’s inability to carry heavy loads in his job, the
                    plaintiff would still need to prove that he needed to be compensated as a
                        <em>full time</em> driver of Tom Express despite his
                    increased managerial role.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On an examination of the other cases, it is
                    clear that the award in each case was confined to the specific facts and
                    evidence produced before the Court, because the Court would be unable to award
                    loss of future earnings when it cannot fix a proper multiplicand and multiplier.
                    The Court must also be wary of the fact that some of the older cases before
                        <em>Chai Kang Wei Samuel</em> operated on the premise
                    that loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity were awarded as
                        <em>alternatives</em> and did not see them as
                    conceptually distinct heads of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff had claimed before the AR a sum
                    of $495,000 for loss of future earnings based on Neo’s monthly fees of
                    $2,750 as a multiplicand and a multiplier of 15 years, taking into account the
                    plaintiff’s young age of 33 at the time of assessment. The AR had averaged
                    the figures of Neo’s annual pay in 2008 and 2009 to a multiplicand of
                    $30,659. The AR had then considered the inevitable business fluctuations of the
                    plaintiff’s business and the fact that “the profit and loss
                    statements of Tom Express showed that the costs of the business were high, with
                    certain items of expense appearing obviously inflated and not supported by any
                    documentary evidence” ([50] of the GD) to reduce the multiplier submitted
                    by the plaintiff by half to 7. The AR awarded the plaintiff $214,613 for loss of
                    future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The basis for using the average figures of
                    Neo’s annual pay in 2008 and 2009 as the multiplicand would not reflect
                    what loss of future earnings is meant to compensate. If loss of future earnings
                    is to compensate the plaintiff for his additional expense of always having to
                    hire an additional courier to do the work he used to carry out personally, it
                    would be more logical on the evidence provided to take the average annual salary
                    of the drivers in the plaintiff’s business. The plaintiff had 3 drivers
                    and Neo’s monthly salary used to be the highest of all the 3 drivers until
                    Ahmadkalil had a raise in May 2010. The figures are set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Only the annual salary for 2008 and 2009 was taken as there was
                    insufficient evidence to calculate the annual salaries of the drives for 2010. I
                    am of the view that the appropriate multiplicand (averaging the annual salary of
                    all 3 drivers for 2008 and 2009) would be $31,223.60.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The parties did not submit that the award for
                    loss of future earnings should be reduced by income tax payable and the
                    AR’s award did not deduct any income tax. I believe it should and a fair
                    deduction to reflect the income tax for the plaintiff’s income bracket
                    would be $2,000 from the multiplicand. Therefore, making the appropriate
                    reduction for the plaintiff’s income tax, I find that the multiplicand for
                    loss of future earnings should be $29,223.60.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     While the AR reduced the multiplier to take
                    account of the inevitable fluctuations in the business of Tom Express and the
                    inflated expenses of plaintiff’s business accounts, she did not make the
                    appropriate deduction for the value received by the plaintiff in carrying out a
                    greater managerial role in Tom Express. Due weight should have been given to the
                    fact that the plaintiff had always performed <em>dual</em>
                    roles (both managerial and operational) and the reality of the business was that
                    it had grown from a 2 man 1 vehicle sole-proprietorship to one having 3 drivers
                    and 2 lorries with the evidence suggesting that it was likely to grow further in
                    the future. Hence, the necessary and appropriate deduction for the value of the
                    plaintiff’s increased capacity for managerial work in future would be to
                    reduce the multiplier to 3. This would more fairly reflect what the plaintiff
                    had actually lost. I therefore reduce the AR’s award for loss of future
                    earnings to $87,670.80.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iii)   Did the AR err in law or fact in her award for loss of
                earning capacity?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Appellant submitted that the plaintiff at
                    the hearing below did not submit on a claim for loss of earning capacity in
                    addition to an award for loss of future earnings. This is not entirely correct
                    as the plaintiff’s submissions below did argue for an award of loss of
                    earning capacity as in the alternative to loss of future earnings. Furthermore,
                    since an award for loss of earning capacity is part of general damages, it need
                    not be specifically pleaded. The plaintiff had submitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[h]ad the [AR] awarded a multiplier closer to 15, the Plaintiff would
                        agree that the award for loss of earning capacity would have been excessive
                        and overlapping with the award for loss of future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I am of the view that the AR applied the
                    correct legal test for an award for loss of earning capacity – and had
                    carefully assessed if (i) there was a substantial or real risk that the
                    plaintiff would lose his present job at some time or before the estimated end of
                    his working life and (ii) whether the plaintiff would be disadvantaged in the
                    open employment market because of his injuries. The evidence did support the
                    plaintiff’s contention that there was a real risk that he would lose the
                    ability to sustain Tom Express. His business was highly dependent on his
                    contract with DHL and Gee of DHL had testified that the plaintiff’s
                    inability to personally drive and meet customers would be a factor relevant in
                    the renewal of the DHL contract. However, the AR was right in assessing this
                    risk conservatively as it was undisputed that DHL had renewed the
                    plaintiff’s contract twice after the accident, despite the fact that the
                    plaintiff could no longer personally delivery the goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     If the plaintiff was unable to run Tom Express
                    and had to seek alternative employment, he would be seriously disadvantaged as
                    he has been a driver all his life. However, he would not be able to tap on his
                    driving experience whilst his highest educational qualification was only
                    completion of his primary school examinations. Any sedentary job the plaintiff
                    could manage to get in the open market would pay him far below what he was
                    earning now. Consequently, the AR’s lump sum award of $30,000 for loss of
                    earning capacity was fair and is accordingly upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     While I accept that the AR’s award for
                    pre-trial loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity should be upheld, her
                    award for loss of future earnings should be reduced from $214,613 to $
                    87,670.80.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Although the award to the plaintiff for loss
                    of future earnings has been substantially reduced, I note that the Appellants
                    have only succeeded on one of their three main grounds of appeal. Consequently,
                    although they are entitled to costs of the Appeal, I reduce the costs to the
                    Appellants by two-thirds from $3,000 to $1,000 but with disbursements to them on
                    a reimbursement basis. I will not disturb the costs order made
                below.</p>
