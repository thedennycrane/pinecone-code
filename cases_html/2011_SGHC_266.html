        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an action by Smile Inc Dental Surgeons
                    Pte Ltd (“Smile”) against its former employee, Dr Andrew
                    Stewart Lui (“Dr Lui”), for breaches of express and implied
                    terms of Dr Lui’s employment contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As a result of an agreement between the parties
                    on a reduced list of issues, only two persons gave evidence for Smile:
                    Dr Ernest Rex Tan Sek Ho (“Dr Tan”) and his wife Chong
                    Mo-Ai Grace (“Ms Chong”). Dr Lui elected to make a
                    submission of no case to answer after the close of the case for Smile and not to
                    adduce any evidence for his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After considering submissions, I dismissed the
                    action by Smile with costs to be paid to Dr Lui. Smile has filed an appeal
                    to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The facts or allegations I set out below come
                    mainly from Dr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Smile was incorporated in Singapore in March
                    1997 by Dr Tan and Ms Chong. Since inception, Dr Tan and
                    Ms Chong have been equal shareholders in, and the only directors of, Smile.
                    Dr Tan is a practising dentist and is also a specialist prosthodontist
                    certified by the Singapore Dental Council. Prosthodontics is a dental
                    specialisation in reconstructive and cosmetic dentistry. Ms Chong is not a
                    practising dentist. She is the Managing Director of Smile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Smile opened its first dental clinic in a
                    shopping mall known as “Suntec City” (“the Suntec
                    Clinic”) in October 1997. It was the first dental clinic in Singapore to
                    provide a procedure known as “Britesmile Laser Teeth Whitening”.
                    Dr Tan explained that this procedure was the first technology (back in
                    1997) which enabled patients to whiten their teeth in one sitting in one hour on
                    the dentist’s chair<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Dr Tan
                    bought the rights of distributorship for this procedure for the whole of Asia
                    and brought the first machine for this procedure in Asia back to Singapore in
                    1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Smile opened its second dental clinic at
                    “Forum the Shopping Mall” (“the Forum Clinic”) in
                    September 1998 after securing a covenant from the landlord, Hermill Investments
                    Pte Ltd (“Hermill”), that the Forum Clinic would be the only
                    dental clinic in the shopping mall. The Forum Clinic was the “first and
                    only full-fledged children and family-themed dental practice in
                    Singapore” (see para 26 of Dr Tan’s Affidavit of
                    Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”)). This was in line with Hermill’s
                    positioning of the Forum shopping mall as a children-themed mall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Suntec Clinic was located within the central
                    business district while the Forum Clinic was located along Orchard Road, which
                    is the main shopping belt in Singapore. Dr Tan stated (at para 41 of
                    his AEIC) that Smile’s “Forum Clinic clientele comprises mainly
                    locals/expatriates/tourists who are of the upper middle to high income families
                    that reside around or frequent the Orchard and Tanglin
                vicinity”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dr Lui is an Australian citizen. In 2003,
                    he approached Smile to explore the possibility of employment with the latter. He
                    informed Dr Tan and Ms Chong that he was dissatisfied with his then
                    employment as an associate dentist at a dental practice in Great World City due
                    to its lack of “profile and visibility”. His remuneration with
                    that practice was contingent on the number of patients he treated. He complained
                    that that practice did not attract sufficient patients to make it worth his
                    while to remain employed there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Dr Tan and Ms Chong were impressed
                    with Dr Lui. They felt that “he had the personality, skills and
                    aptitude to relate to patients”, and he struck them as a dentist with
                    “good chair-side manners” (see para 35 of Dr Tan’s
                    AEIC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Dr Lui had several discussions with Smile
                    about his employment prospects. During this time, Dr Lui held an Employment
                    Pass and was living in a rented apartment. Dr Lui informed Dr Tan and
                    Ms Chong that his mother was living in Melbourne, Australia, and that he
                    eventually planned to return to Melbourne to look after her (see para 36 of
                    Dr Tan’s AEIC). He claimed that he had no plans to apply for
                    Permanent Resident status as he did not intend to settle down in Singapore for
                    the long run.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In one of the discussions, Dr Lui asked
                    whether Smile was looking for a partner or an associate dentist. Dr Tan and
                    Ms Chong replied that they were only looking for an associate dentist, and
                    Dr Lui indicated his agreement to this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Initially, the draft employment contract
                    stipulated that Dr Lui’s minimum term of employment was five years.
                    Dr Lui managed to get this reduced to three years. According to Dr Tan
                    and Ms Chong, Dr Lui gave them the impression that he would only stay
                    and practise in Singapore for a short term. As such, it was “completely
                    inconceivable” to them when the contract was entered into that
                    Dr Lui “would seek to practice elsewhere in Singapore” after
                    his employment with Smile ended (see para 39 of Dr Tan’s AEIC).
                    They believed that he would return to Australia to practise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The employment contract was signed by the
                    parties on 31 July 2003 (“the Contract”). Clause 7 of the
                    Contract provided that Dr Lui’s remuneration as an “associate
                    dental surgeon” was to be 40% of the net professional fees collected each
                    month. Dr Lui commenced work with Smile on 1 September 2003. In his
                    first two years of working for Smile, Dr Lui practiced both in the Suntec
                    Clinic and the Forum Clinic. However, with effect from July 2005 Dr Lui was
                    assigned by Smile to work full-time at the Forum Clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Smile set up a third clinic at One Raffles
                    Quay (“the ORQ Clinic”) in 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Dr Tan stated (at para 47 of his
                    AEIC) that, at the end of 2004, the Ministry of Health (“the MOH”)
                    relaxed the advertising guidelines for the medical and dental professions. Smile
                    subsequently embarked on a substantial advertising and marketing effort to
                    increase the awareness and profile of its brand name as well as the profile of
                    the Forum Clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A “large light box signage” was
                    erected on the external facade of the Forum shopping mall facing Cuscaden Road
                    from 9 February 2007 to 8 September 2010 in order to raise awareness
                    of the Forum Clinic in the area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     From October 2007 to August 2008, Smile ran a
                    series of advertisements in “Motherhood Magazine” that
                    specifically promoted the Forum Clinic and the dentists practicing there,
                    including Dr Lui. Smile also ran a series of “Question and
                    Answer” articles in “Motherhood Magazine” and “Ma Ma
                    Bao Bei” (a Mandarin-language child and family magazine) to increase the
                    profile of its individual dentists, including Dr Lui. For instance,
                    Dr Lui was featured in the October 2007 and February 2008 issues of
                    “Motherhood Magazine”, and the December 2008 issue of “Ma
                    Ma Bao Bei”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 7 January 2009, Dr Lui
                    incorporated Dental Essence Pte Ltd (“Dental Essence”) and was the
                    sole director and shareholder thereof while he was still employed by Smile. On
                    or about 25 February 2009, Dr Lui entered into a one-year tenancy
                    agreement for premises at 127 Tanglin Road, Tudor Court, Singapore 247922
                    (“Tudor Court”) on behalf of Dental Essence. This location was
                    within five minutes’ walk from the Forum Clinic. On the same day
                        (<em>ie</em>, 25 February 2009), Dr Lui also
                    gave written notice of his resignation to Smile. Despite the three months’
                    notice period which Dr Lui was obliged to give to Smile pursuant to Clause
                    20 of the Contract, Smile agreed on 31 March 2009 that Dr Lui’s
                    last day of work with Smile would be 18 April 2009. On 14 May 2009,
                    Dental Essence obtained a licence from the MOH to operate a dental clinic, and
                    it began operations the next day, <em>ie</em>, 15 May
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     According to Dr Tan, sometime in March
                    2009 Dr Lui committed to renovation works of Dental Essence’s
                    premises amounting to about $60,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. On
                    19 March 2009, Dr Gareth Pearson (“Dr Pearson”), a
                    former employee of Smile, joined Dental Essence as a shareholder and a dentist.
                    About one year earlier, in March 2008, Dr Pearson had given Smile six
                    months’ notice that he intended to stop working in September 2008 for an
                    indefinite period because he was leaving Singapore. Dr Pearson was a
                    part-time dentist employed by Smile and was based primarily at the Forum Clinic.
                    Dr Lui and Dr Pearson together accounted for 80% of the Forum
                    Clinic’s patient pool<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After Dr Lui’s departure from the
                    Forum Clinic, the Forum Clinic experienced a decrease in monthly revenue.
                    Although the clinic’s monthly revenue was about $116,000 in April 2009
                    (which was the month in which Dr Lui left Smile’s employment), this
                    dropped to about $52,000 by September 2009. This was a drop of about 55%. On
                    8 October 2009, Smile commenced this action against Dr Lui. By this
                    time, Smile had received requests from numerous patients for their dental
                    records. It later found out that many of these patients became patients of
                    Dental Essence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The monthly revenue of the Forum Clinic
                    continued to dwindle, and Smile eventually closed the Forum Clinic on
                    15 September 2010, which was the same day when the Forum Clinic’s
                    licence expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In January 2011, this action was bifurcated
                    upon application by Dr Lui.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case for Smile</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Smile relied on two broad categories of causes
                    of action. First, Smile alleged that Dr Lui had breached various express
                    provisions in the Contract which restricted Dr Lui from undertaking certain
                    activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Secondly, Smile also alleged that Dr Lui
                    had breached implied terms of the Contract which provided that Dr Lui owed
                    certain implied duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As regards the express provisions,
                    Smile’s first allegation (at paras 21 and 22 of its Statement of
                    Claim (Amendment No 2) (“the SOC (No 2)”)) was that Dr Lui
                    had breached Clause 24 of the Contract because the latter was practising as a
                    dentist at Dental Essence’s clinic at Tudor Court, which was within three
                    kilometres of Smile’s Forum Clinic. Clause 24 of the Contract was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24. In the event that Dr. Lui leaves (whether resignation or dismissal)
                        The Practice, Dr. Lui shall not practice within a 3 kilometre radius
                        distance from the Smile Inc. Dental Surgeons practices at Suntec City Mall
                        and from Forum The Shopping Mall, and a 3 kilometre radius from any other
                        new Smile Inc. Dental Surgeons practices that have been set up before and
                        during his cessation of work at The Practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For convenience, I will refer to Clause 24 as the “Radial
                    Clause”. There was no time limit in this clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Smile’s second allegation (at
                    paras 23 to 26 of the SOC (No 2)) was that Dr Lui had breached Clause
                    23 and/or Clause 25 of the Contract by, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, conducting consultations with, examining and/or treating
                    Smile’s patients after he left Smile’s employment. After discovery,
                    Smile found out that 716 patients of Dental Essence were treated by Dr Lui
                    on at least one occasion while he was employed by Smile at the Forum Clinic.
                    However, it was not clear when all the 716 patients eventually migrated to
                    Dental Essence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Clauses 23 and 25 of the Contract were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23. Upon leaving The Practice, Dr. Lui will not seek to damage or injure
                        The Practice’s reputation or to canvass, solicit or procure any of The
                        Practice’s patients for himself or any other persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25. In the event that Dr. Lui leaves (whether resignation or dismissal)
                        The Practice, existing and new corporate and non-corporate contracts, as
                        well as existing and new patients, shall remain with The Practice. Patient
                        data and records, office data and records and computer software programmes
                        and data shall remain the property of The Practice, and such records, in
                        full or in part, shall not be copied manually, electronically or otherwise
                        be removed from the Practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For convenience, I will refer to Clauses 23 and 25 as “the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause” and “the Non-Dealing Clause”
                    respectively. Both clauses did not contain any time limit or geographical
                    limit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As regards the implied terms and duties, Smile
                    relied on the following implied terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     Dr Lui owed a duty of good
                        faith and fidelity to Smile;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dr Lui owed a duty to act honestly and with
                        reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr Lui owed a duty to act in good
                        faith and in the best interests of Smile;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr Lui owed a duty not to act so as to
                        place himself in a position in which his personal interests would or did
                        conflict with those of Smile; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"></a>(e)     Dr Lui owed a duty to disclose his interest in any
                        transactions involving Smile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Smile claimed that these implied duties were
                    breached by Dr Lui by reason of the following acts or omissions while he
                    was still employed by Smile:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     Dr Lui incorporated Dental
                        Essence on 7 January 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dr Lui, for and on behalf of Dental Essence, signed
                        a tenancy agreement for the premises of Dental Essence in Tudor Court on
                        25 February 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr Lui fitted out the said premises of Dental
                        Essence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr Lui had discussions/negotiations with Dr Pearson which
                        resulted in Dr Pearson becoming a shareholder and director of Dental
                        Essence, with a view to Dr Pearson working as a dentist at Dental
                        Essence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_e"></a>(e)     Dr Lui applied for a licence from the MOH to practice dentistry with
                        Dental Essence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_f"></a>(f)     Dr Lui failed to inform Smile of all or any of the foregoing matters;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_g"></a>(g)     Dr Lui
                        failed to obtain Smile’s consent to the setting up of Dental
                        Essence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I noted that, in the SOC (No 2), Smile relied on
                    the facts pleaded in support of the alleged breaches of the Radial Clause,
                    Non-Solicitation Clause and Non-Dealing Clause (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>–<a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above) as
                    also constituting breaches of the said implied terms (see para 27(1) of the
                    SOC (No 2)). However, in its revised opening statement Smile did not mention
                    these facts as a further basis for the alleged breach of Dr Lui’s
                    implied duties (see para 10 of Schedule “B” to Smile’s
                    Supplemental (Revised) Opening Statement filed on 20 September
                    2011).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The substantive remedies which Smile claimed
                    were as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     damages, including damages pursuant
                        to Clause 18 of the Contract; and alternatively</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     an account of profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For completeness, I would mention that
                    Smile’s pleadings originally contained prayers for the following
                    reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     An injunction restraining
                        Dr Lui from practising at Tudor Court and elsewhere within three
                        kilometres from the Suntec Clinic, the Forum Clinic and the ORQ Clinic;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     An
                        injunction restraining Dr Lui from dealing with Smile’s patients
                        (whether by conducting consultations with, examining and/or treating
                        Smile’s patients).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Smile was no longer seeking the
                    said injunctions in the SOC (No 2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I should also mention that the SOC (No 2)
                    contained a separate claim (at paras 17 and 18) for breaches of Clauses 14
                    and/or 16 of the Contract by reason of the fact that Dr Lui became a
                    director and shareholder of Dental Essence on 7 January 2009, which was
                    when he was still an employee of Smile. However, this claim was not pursued any
                    further and it was not mentioned in Smile’s revised opening statement or
                    its closing submissions. Accordingly, I need not say any more about Clauses 14
                    and 16 of the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Dr Lui’s submission of no case to answer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As mentioned above, Dr Lui elected to
                    make a submission of no case to answer and not to call any evidence at the close
                    of the case for Smile. This was on 26 September 2011. The principles
                    governing the effect of such a submission are well-established and can be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     The result of an election by
                        Dr Lui to make a submission of no case to answer is that the court is
                        left with only Smile’s version of the story. If there is some
                            <em>prima facie</em> evidence (<em>ie</em>, evidence which is not unsatisfactory and not unreliable)
                        that supports the essential elements of Smile’s claim, the court
                        should accept such evidence: see <em>Bansal Hemant
                            Govindprasad and another v Central Bank of India</em> [2003]
                        2 SLR(R) 33 (“<em>Govindprasad</em>”) at [10], [11] and
                            [16].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if there is some <em>prima facie</em> evidence that supports the essential
                        elements of Smile’s claim (<em>ie</em>, if limb
                        (a) has been satisfied), the court must still consider whether that claim
                        has been established <em>in law</em>: see <em>Govindprasad</em> at [11].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I should elaborate that Dr Lui’s
                    election did not mean that I was obliged to accept every allegation by Smile.
                    For example, if Dr Tan gave evidence on a disputed conversation between
                    Dr Lui and himself, then in the absence of evidence from Dr Lui, I
                    should accept Dr Tan’s evidence unless his evidence was itself
                    unsatisfactory or unreliable. The disputed conversation would be a matter within
                    the personal knowledge of Dr Tan and Dr Lui. However, if Dr Tan
                    gave evidence on an allegation pertaining to his own intention which was not
                    disclosed to Dr Lui, then the absence of evidence from Dr Lui on this
                    point was neutral since he would have had no personal knowledge of that
                    intention. In a third example, if Dr Tan gave his personal opinion on what
                    a provision in the Contract meant, the absence of any opinion by way of evidence
                    from Dr Lui was again neutral. Dr Tan’s opinion would not be an
                    expert opinion. Dr Lui would still be entitled to advance his case on the
                    interpretation of that provision through submissions from his
                counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Counsel for Smile was Mr Aqbal Singh
                    (“Mr Singh”). The lead counsel for Dr Lui was
                    Mr Wong Siew Hong (“Mr Wong”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As regards the express provisions, the main
                    issues before me concerned the Radial Clause, the Non-Solicitation Clause and
                    the Non-Dealing Clause (collectively, “the Restrictive
                    Covenants”). They required the following questions to be
                    considered:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     What was the correct interpretation
                        of each of the Restrictive Covenants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether Dr Lui had breached any of the Restrictive
                        Covenants; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     If so, whether the Restrictive Covenant which was breached was void as
                        being contrary to the public policy against covenants in restraint of
                        trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The issue concerning the alleged implied terms
                    of the Contract required the following questions to be considered:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the terms which were pleaded
                        by Smile should be implied into the Contract; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the terms should be implied into
                        the Contract, whether Dr Lui had breached any of those terms by reason
                        of the pleaded acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: The Restrictive Covenants</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The principles governing the interpretation of the Restrictive
                Covenants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Clarke v
                        Newland</em> [1991] 1 All ER 397 at 402F–G,
                    Neill LJ summarised the applicable principles of interpretation on this
                    area of the law:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     The question of construction should
                        be approached in the first instance without regard to the question of
                        legality or illegality;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     The clause should be construed with reference to the
                        object sought to be obtained; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     The clause should be construed in its context and in the
                        light of the factual matrix at the time when the agreement was
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The second and third principles are trite law,
                    and it is really only the first principle which is material for present
                    purposes: that the same principles are to be applied to the construction of a
                    clause which is impugned on the ground of being an unlawful restraint of trade
                    as in the construction of any other written term (see also <em>Beckett Investment Management Group Ltd v Hall</em> [2007] EWCA Civ
                    613 at [11]). This is the more accurate
                    interpretation of the following statement of Salmon LJ in <em>Home Counties Dairies Ltd and another v </em><em>Skilton and another</em> [1970] 1 WLR 526
                        (“<em>Home Counties</em>”) at
                    536C:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a clause is valid in all ordinary circumstances which can have been
                        contemplated by the parties, <em>it is equally valid
                            </em><em>notwithstanding that it might cover
                            circumstances which are so “extravagant,”
                            fantastical,” “unlikely or improbable”</em>
                        that they must have been entirely outside the contemplation of the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This statement was quoted with approval by GP Selvam J in
                        <em>Heller Factoring </em><em>(Singapore) Ltd v Ng Tong Yang</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 495
                        (“<em>Heller Factoring</em>”) at [15(a)].
                    Salmon LJ’s remarks should not be read literally, because it is clear from
                    the other sections of his judgment that he was merely reiterating that if some
                    circumstances “must have been entirely outside the contemplation of the
                    parties”, then they would not constitute part of the legal meaning of the
                    clause and would, therefore, be legally irrelevant: see, for instance, <em>Home Counties</em> at 535D–H. This understanding of
                        <em>Home Counties</em> is in fact implicit in <em>National Aerated Water Co Pte Ltd v Monarch Co, Inc</em>
                    [2000] 1 SLR(R) 74 at [37]–[38], and in
                        <em>Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd </em><em>(formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark
                        Chuan David</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“<em>Man Financial</em>”) at [141].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Dr Lui was in breach of the Restrictive
                Covenants</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Radial Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The first part of the Radial Clause (see
                        <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) plainly prohibited
                    Dr Lui from practising within three kilometres from the Suntec Clinic and
                    the Forum Clinic. The only conduct of Dr Lui complained of in respect of
                    this clause was the fact that he was practising as a dentist at Tudor Court,
                    which was well within three kilometres from the Forum Clinic. This was admitted
                    in Dr Lui’s pleadings (see para 16 of the Defence (Amendment No
                    2)). I therefore find that Dr Lui was in breach of the Radial
                    Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The part of the Radial Clause which referred
                    to “any other new ... practices that have been set up before and during
                    his cessation of work” was ambiguous. However, it was unnecessary to
                    consider this phrase because this part of the Radial Clause was not in issue:
                    the Forum Clinic existed at the time the Contract was entered into. Even if this
                    second part of the clause was unreasonable in reference to the interests of the
                    parties and/or the interests of the public, it could be severed without
                    affecting the first part of the clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Non-Solicitation Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As noted earlier (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above), Smile claimed that Dr Lui had breached the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause because he had, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, conducted consultations with, examined and/or treated 716
                    patients at Dental Essence who had previously been patients of Smile. For
                    convenience, I will refer to the activities of conducting consultations,
                    examinations and/or the treatment of patients simply as the treatment of
                    patients. This was the only act pleaded in support of this claim. While the use
                    of the words “<em>inter alia</em>” might have
                    allowed Smile to refer to some other act of Dr Lui done within the
                    treatment room of Dental Essence, it did not allow Smile to refer to other acts
                    done outside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, in his AEIC, Dr Tan stated (at
                    para 121) that when Smile conducted a “Google search” in
                    January 2010 with the keywords “smileinc.com.sg” and
                    “smileinc”, Dental Essence and Dr Lui appeared at the top of
                    the list of search results. Dr Tan also stated (at para 123) that
                    Dr Lui had disclosed during discovery that the latter had placed
                    advertisements on “Google Ad Words” and “Yahoo”,
                    which included purchases of the following keywords: “forum
                    dentist”, “forum the shopping mall”, “forum galleria
                    dentist”, “forum shopping centre dentist”, “dentist
                    at forum shopping centre”, “dentist at forum galleria” and
                    “forum mall dentist”. This was presumably why the search in
                    January 2010 produced the results it did. Dr Tan believed that Dr Lui
                    was trying to capitalise on the reputation of Smile’s brand and in
                    particular that of the Forum Clinic. He was apparently relying on this conduct
                    of Dr Lui as evidence of solicitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Apart from the purchase of keywords on
                    “Google Ad Words” and “Yahoo”, Dr Tan also
                    relied on a testimonial by one Carolyn Strover in the August 2009 issue of the
                    magazine “Expat Living” as another example of solicitation by
                        Dr Lui.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As these two instances were not pleaded, I was
                    of the view that Smile was precluded from relying on them in addition to the
                    sole reason it had pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As regards the sole reason for the allegation
                    about the breach of the Non-Solicitation Clause, I was of the view that the mere
                    fact that Dr Lui was treating patients at Dental Essence who had previously
                    been patients of Smile was insufficient to establish that he had sought to
                    canvass, solicit or procure them to be his patients at Dental Essence. There is
                    a distinction between solicitation and mere dealing.</p>

                        Hinds</em> [1994] FSR 52 (“<em>Austin
                        Knight</em>”), Vinelott J observed (at
                    58–59):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In her evidence in support of this application Miss Pickering lists five
                        former customers of AK(UK) whom, she says, were approached by Miss Hinds.
                        Miss Hinds’ evidence is that she was unemployed for two months after
                        she had been unexpectedly made redundant. <em>She telephoned
                            her main customers with whom she had dealt to tell them that she had
                            been made redundant. She did not want them to hear of her dismissal from
                            others and possibly infer mistakenly that she had been dismissed for
                            misconduct or incompetence. At that time she had no prospects of new
                            employment and could not therefore be said to be soliciting their
                            custom</em>. They all had her home telephone number and later,
                        when she found a post with another company, operating in the same field,
                            <em>they approached her and asked whether she could
                            continue to handle their accounts</em>. She identifies two of the
                        five customers instanced by Miss Pickering as customers who approached her
                        in this way, <em>two others are bodies, a Regional Health
                            Authority and a City Council, who are required by statute to invite
                            offers for work of this kind by tender, and her present employers were
                            amongst those invited to tender</em>. There is direct evidence
                        from the two customers who approached her direct which supports her
                        evidence. Mr. Griffiths nonetheless submitted that by submitting an offer or
                        making a presentation to a former customer, even one <em>who
                            had approached her or her employers, or who put out work for
                            tender</em>, amounted either to soliciting or endeavouring to
                        entice away the customer. That is not I think, comprehended in the usual
                        meaning of soliciting, and as regards endeavouring to entice a customer
                        away, if Mr. Griffiths' submission were well founded <em>the
                            covenant would amount to a covenant not to deal</em> with
                        customers of AK(UK), even customers with whom Miss Hinds had never dealt
                        while an employee of AK(UK) and with whose relationship with AK(UK) she was
                        wholly unaware.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     True, it might have been logical to infer that
                    not all the 716 patients had simply come across the premises of Dental Essence
                    by chance while walking in the vicinity of Tudor Court. Some might have learned
                    about Dental Essence from other patients of Dental Essence or from
                    advertisements of Dental Essence. A third possibility might have been that
                    Dr Lui had indeed directly approached some of these patients to persuade
                    them to use the services of Dental Essence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     If some of the patients had learned about
                    Dental Essence from other patients of Dental Essence, there was no breach of the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     If they had learned about Dental Essence from
                    advertisements of Dental Essence, it was incumbent on Smile to plead the
                    advertisements in question and how such advertisements breached the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause. As mentioned above, the two instances which Dr Tan
                    sought to rely on in his AEIC were not pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As for the last possibility, there was no
                    allegation that Dr Lui had directly approached some of these patients to
                    persuade them to use the services of Dental Essence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I found that Dr Lui did not breach the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Non-Dealing Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The alleged breach of the Non-Dealing Clause
                    flowed from the same fact which Smile relied upon in relation to the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above),
                        <em>ie</em>, that 716 patients of Dental Essence were
                    previously patients of Dr Lui at the Forum Clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Dr Tan was of the view that this clause
                    meant that if patients whom Dr Lui had previously treated while working for
                    Smile came to Dental Essence’s clinic, Dr Lui was under an obligation
                    to turn them away, <em>ie</em>, to refuse to accept and
                    treat them as patients and to refer them back to Smile. He also seemed to be of
                    the view that the scope of this clause covered both persons who were patients at
                    the time of the termination of Dr Lui’s employment with Smile, and
                    persons who subsequently became patients of Smile. During cross-examination,
                    Dr Tan stated as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Dr Tan, is it your case that under clause 25,
                            if <em>any</em> patient were to come to see
                            Dr Lui, Dr Lui must first check with his patient,
                                “<em>Have you ever been treated by Smile? If
                                yes, I cannot treat you</em>”?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Where does it say so, Dr Tan?</span></p>

                            think Dr Lui has a duty to refrain from treating them, especially
                            when it is five minutes walk away, and he has a duty to try and persuade
                            them to continue to seek treatment at Smile.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     However, Mr Singh suggested that all that
                    Smile had to establish on the facts of this action was that Dr Lui was
                    prohibited from treating any person who was a patient of Smile at the time when
                    he left its employment. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the closing submissions for Smile,
                    Mr Singh appeared to assume that the meaning of the Non-Dealing Clause was
                    clear in that it did preclude Dr Lui from treating any person who was a
                    patient of Smile (at the time when Dr Lui left Smile).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On the other hand, Mr Wong submitted that
                    the Non-Dealing Clause precluded Dr Lui from dealing with the records of
                    the patients and not the patients themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mr Singh was relying on the phrase
                    “as well as existing and new patients” in the first sentence of
                    the Non-Dealing Clause for his contention. Yet the phrase before that referred
                    to “existing and new corporate and non-corporate <em>contracts</em>” [emphasis added]. The sentence after the first
                    sentence also referred to “Patient data and records, office data and
                    records ...” which was to remain the property of Smile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Non-Dealing Clause must be considered in
                    totality. I have set it out at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I was inclined to the view that
                    Mr Wong’s submission was persuasive. The reference to
                    “existing and new patients”, when considered in context, seemed to
                    have been a reference to the records of the patients, whether non-existing or
                    existing at the time when Dr Lui left Smile. The purpose of the first
                    sentence of the Non-Dealing Clause would then be to state that all patient
                    records were to remain physically with Smile. This was then emphasized in a
                    different manner in the second sentence by the statement that such data remained
                    the property of Smile and was not to be copied or removed from
                Smile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Furthermore, Dr Tan’s opinion on
                    the meaning of the clause was self-serving. If there was any ambiguity in the
                    interpretation of the clause, then the <em>contra
                        </em><em>proferentem</em> rule might have meant
                    that it should be construed against the person who drafted the Contract. As that
                    person would be someone from Smile, that rule might then have meant that
                    Mr Wong’s submission should prevail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     However, I was precluded from accepting
                    Mr Wong’s submission because of para 11 of the Defence
                    (Amendment No 2). In that paragraph, Dr Lui averred that Clauses 24 and 25
                    (the latter being the Non-Dealing Clause) “are in form and in substance
                    restraint of trade clauses or restrictive covenants. The Plaintiffs’
                        [<em>sic</em>] attempt to claim for protection from
                    competition through the inclusion of Clauses 24 and 25 ... are [<em>sic</em>] unjust and illegitimate. Clauses 24 and 25 ... are
                    onerous, oppressive, unreasonable and are void as against public
                    policy.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     This demonstrated that Dr Lui had, at the
                    time of the relevant pleading, accepted that the Non-Dealing Clause extended to
                    the patients themselves and was not confined merely to their records. Hence, the
                    averment about restraint of trade and public policy. Given that this averment
                    had been made, it was incumbent on Dr Lui to state clearly at some other
                    point in his pleading that this was merely an <em>alternative</em> argument and that he <em>also</em> took the position that the scope of the Non-Dealing Clause
                    did not extend to the patients themselves. This was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the circumstances, I was obliged to adopt
                    the interpretation advanced for Smile and to conclude that Dr Lui did
                    breach the Non-Dealing Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Restrictive Covenants were void as being contrary to the
                public policy against the restraint of trade</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the leading Singapore case of <em>Man Financial</em> (at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above), the Court of Appeal stated the relevant legal
                    principles in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     The legal foundation and starting
                        point is Lord Macnaghten’s statement in <em>Thorsten
                            Nordenfelt (Pauper) v The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company,
                            Limited</em> [1894] AC 535 (“<em>Nordenfelt</em>”) at 565. The only justification for a
                        restraint of trade is if the restriction is <em>reasonable</em>, <em>ie</em>, in reference
                        to the interests of the parties concerned and reasonable in reference to the
                        interests of the public. See <em>Man Financial</em> at
                            [70].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     There cannot be a bare and blatant
                        restriction of the freedom to trade. There must always be a legitimate
                        proprietary interest, over and above the mere protection of the employer
                        from competition. The restrictive covenant must not go further than what is
                        necessary to protect the interest concerned. See <em>Man
                            Financial</em> at <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     
          <em>Man Financial</em>
                    also clarified the relationship between, on the one hand, the twin tests of
                    reasonableness enunciated by Lord Macnaghten in <em>Nordenfelt</em>, and, on the other hand, the <em>legal</em> requirement that there must be a legitimate proprietary
                    interest of the employer which was protected by the restrictive covenant. When
                    considering whether the maintenance of a stable and trained workforce could, in
                    principle, constitute a legitimate proprietary interest, the court remarked (at
                        [106], and further at [121] and [124]) that a positive answer to that question would not
                        <em>ipso facto</em> render the restrictive covenant
                    valid (<em>ie</em>, not void for being contrary to public
                    policy), because the relevant clause would still be subject to the twin tests of
                    reasonableness. In other words, the test is three-fold and all three limbs have
                    to be satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     Is there a legitimate proprietary
                        interest to be protected?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     Is the restrictive covenant reasonable in reference to
                        the interests of the parties?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     Is the restrictive covenant reasonable in reference to
                        the interests of the public?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     However, it is not entirely clear from
                        <em>Man Financial</em> whether there is a distinction
                    between, on the one hand, the test of whether the restrictive covenant went
                        “<em>further than what is necessary</em> to
                    protect the interest concerned” [emphasis added] (see [66(b)] above),
                    and, on the other hand, the twin tests of <em>reasonableness</em> as laid down in <em>Nordenfelt</em> (see [66(a)] above). It appears from the case-law
                    that the courts have not treated both as being distinct (and cumulative) tests.
                    In <em>Vancouver Malt and Sake Brewing Company, Limited v
                        </em><em>Vancouver Breweries, Limited</em>
                    [1934] AC 181, Lord MacMillan stated (at 190):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [S]o far as their Lordships are aware there is no case in the English
                        Law Reports, and certainly none was cited at the bar, in which a bare
                        covenant not to compete has been upheld. The covenants restrictive of
                        competition which have been sustained have all been ancillary to some main
                        transaction, contract, or arrangement, and have been found justified because
                        they were <em>reasonably necessary</em> to render that
                        transaction, contract or arrangement effective...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Similarly, in <em>Herbert
                        Morris, Limited v Saxelby</em> [1916] AC 688
                        (“<em>Herbert Morris</em>”) Lord Parker
                    stated (at 710):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In fact the reason, and the only reason, for upholding such a restraint on
                        the part of an employee is that the employer has some proprietary right,
                        whether in the nature of trade connection or in the nature of trade secrets,
                        for the protection of which such a restraint is—having regard to the
                        duties of the employee—<em>reasonably
                            necessary</em>. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I was of the view that there is no substantive
                    distinction between the two formulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Finally, the crucial time for ascertaining
                    whether or not the restrictive covenant in question is in fact reasonable is the
                    time at which the contract is made: see <em>Man
                        Financial</em> at [72]. This
                    means that the reasonableness of the restriction must be judged in the light of
                    facts and circumstances as they were at that time, although the parties’
                    reasonable expectations as to what might happen thereafter are also relevant:
                    see also <em>TSC Europe (UK) Ltd v Massey</em>
                    [1999] IRLR 22.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In the present case, it was not disputed that
                    the Restrictive Covenants were in fact covenants in restraint of trade. Yet, for
                    reasons unknown to me, para 11 of the Defence (Amendment No 2) challenged
                    the validity only of the Radial Clause and the Non-Dealing Clause but not that
                    of the Non-Solicitation Clause. This was apparently not an oversight as I
                    recollected Mr Wong informing me (perhaps while counsel were in chambers)
                    that Dr Lui was challenging only the scope of the Non-Solicitation Clause
                    and was not challenging its validity even if I were to agree with Smile on the
                    scope of that clause. Yet, surprisingly, Mr Wong’s closing
                    submissions raised the issue about the validity of the Non-Solicitation Clause
                    together with the rest of the Restrictive Covenants. It was too late for
                    Mr Wong to do that. Nevertheless, some of the views I express below on some
                    aspects of the issue of validity would in effect apply to all the Restrictive
                    Covenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The doctrine of restraint of trade applies to
                    render any provision in restraint of trade <em>prima
                        facie</em> void. Accordingly, the questions which I had to consider
                    were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Smile had a legitimate
                        proprietary interest which was sought to be protected by the Radial Clause
                        and the Non-Dealing Clause;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether these Restrictive Covenants were reasonable in
                        reference to the interests of the parties; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether these Restrictive Covenants were
                        reasonable in reference to the interests of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Legitimate proprietary interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As the court in <em>Man
                        Financial</em> affirmed (at [81]), there are two main types of
                    interests which have been categorised as legitimate proprietary interests in the
                    employment context: (a) trade secrets; and (b) trade connections. Only (b) was
                    in issue. In this regard, it is well-established that there must be personal
                    knowledge of (and influence over) the customers of the employer: see <em>Man Financial</em> at [93] and <em>Herbert Morris</em> at 702,
                    709.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     However, the mere existence of such personal
                    knowledge and influence will not always be sufficient to establish a legitimate
                    proprietary interest on the part of the employer. In <em>Herbert
                        Morris</em>, Lord Parker of Waddington explained (at 709):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I cannot find any case in which a covenant against competition by a
                        servant or apprentice has, as such, ever been upheld by the Court. Wherever
                        such covenants have been upheld it has been on the ground, not that the
                        servant or apprentice would, by reason of his employment or training, obtain
                        the skill and knowledge necessary to equip him as a possible competitor in
                        the trade, but that he might obtain <em>such personal
                            knowledge of and influence over the customers of his employer... as
                            would enable him, if competition were allowed, to take advantage of his
                            employer’s trade connection...</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the extent of the knowledge of, and influence over,
                    the customers is also a relevant factor. This is also established in the
                    case-law: see <em>Heller Factoring</em> at [15(c)],
                        <em>Buckman Laboratories (Asia) Pte Ltd v Lee Wei
                        </em><em>Hoong</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 205
                    at [24]. However, I would add that this
                    factor is relevant only insofar as it indicates the influence (or likely
                    influence) of the employee over the customers. In itself, knowledge is
                    immaterial unless it can and is likely to be leveraged in some way by the
                    employee to gain some degree of influence. This customer-centred approach was
                    clearly explained by Stamp J in <em>S W Strange Ltd v
                        Mann</em> [1965] 1 WLR 629 at 641F:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant had a knowledge of the plaintiff’s customers and of
                        their creditworthiness which was no doubt of great value to the plaintiff
                        but there is nothing to show that it was of value to the customer or would
                        in the least degree encourage a customer to deal with him [<em>ie</em>, the defendant] as an individual or as an
                        employee in a rival firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Apart from knowledge of the employer’s
                    customers, there are several other factors which are relevant to the issue of
                    influence. In <em>Arthur Murray </em><em>Dance Studios of Cleveland</em>, <em>Inc v
                        Witter</em> (1952) 105 NE 2d 685, Hooper J identified two such
                    factors: (a) “employer’s hold” (or “institutional
                    hold”); and (b) customer inconvenience. He explained these two factors as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now why can't the elevator operator and the apartment caretaker
                        automatically take the tenant with him? There are two main reasons, for
                        which we would like to coin the phrases ‘employer's hold’ (or
                        ‘institutional hold’) and ‘customer inconvenience.’
                        A customer may like an employee, but how far he is willing to inconvenience
                        himself and suffer because he likes him is a different matter. Because he
                        likes the elevator operator, will he break his lease and incur damages? Will
                        he endure the trouble of packing, moving, re-establishing? And the expense?
                        Will he sacrifice the advantage of customers being accustomed to do business
                        with him at his present stand? Will he leave an advantageous location he
                        likes and follow to a disadvantageous one he dislikes? How far will he
                        follow? Two buildings away? Two miles away?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If two teachers exchange colleges, do their students automatically
                        exchange colleges? If the deans of the Harvard and Yale law schools
                        exchanged chairs it might be very unflattering to see how few, if any, of
                        their students would try to follow them. As every school knows there is such
                        a thing as an ‘institutional hold’ that may be greater than the
                        hold of one teacher, such as the hold it exercises through such things as
                        loyalty, tradition, reputation, the campus, classmates, friends, fraternity
                        brothers, other teachers and the girl who wears one's fraternity pin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     J D Heydon, <em>The Restraint
                        of Trade Doctrine</em> (Butterworths, 1999, 2nd Ed) at 93 also
                    identified several additional factors which are relevant to the question of
                    influence: (a) the frequency of contact; (b) the place where contacts are made;
                    (c) the seniority of the employee; and (d) the nature of the employee’s
                    relationship with the customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I turn now to the facts of this case.
                    Smile’s position was that all the Restrictive Covenants were intended to
                    protect its patient pool. Dr Tan stated (at para 22 of his AEIC) that
                    he had spent considerable time, money and effort into positioning Smile
                    “as a well known premium dental service provider offering cutting-edge
                    dental treatments”. Dr Tan had trademarked the names of
                    Smile’s procedures, established its clinics in prime locations, and
                    designed those clinics with lifestyle-based themes and concepts in mind. This
                    approach enabled Smile “to build up a strong customer base”.
                    Dr Tan elaborated during cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What was the benefit to Smile of such an
                            arrangement with [Dr Pearson]? Meaning that you would keep the
                            chair in a state of disuse and so on. What is the benefit?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The benefit is that he will continue seeing his own
                            patients and the patient -- the relationship with the doctor is
                            maintained, as well as the continuity of the treatment. <em>In dentistry continuity is very important because when you
                                finish a procedure you want to -- the patient will feel very
                                comfortable if the same dentist follows up on his treatment. And the
                                rapport is also maintained between the doctor and the
                                patient</em>.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... The radial clause was put in because we felt
                            that was the only way to protect <em>our patient pool. In
                                every dental practice, that is the life blood of the
                                clinic</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Mr Wong argued that Dr Tan’s
                    evidence demonstrated that no legitimate proprietary interest was being
                    protected by the Restrictive Covenants<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. What Dr Tan was seeking to protect was
                    Smile’s patient pool and that meant that the sole purpose of the
                    Restrictive Covenants was to exclude competition from Dr Lui rather than to
                    protect any legitimate proprietary interest. I did not think that that was the
                    correct approach. The purpose of most, if not all, restraint of trade provisions
                    in the employment context is precisely to protect the employer from competition
                    by an employee should the employee leave his employer. The nature and extent of
                    the protection depends on the terms of each individual provision. Therefore, the
                    fact that a provision seeks to exclude competition to some extent does not
                    necessarily mean that an employer has no legitimate proprietary interest to
                    protect. It is because of such exclusion that the court then has to apply the
                    three-fold test mentioned above at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>, one
                    aspect of which is whether there is a legitimate proprietary interest to be
                    protected. In other words, does the employer have a legitimate proprietary
                    interest to protect by excluding competition or is he excluding competition
                        <em>per se</em>? It may be that a restraint of trade
                    provision has a dual purpose as I shall elaborate below when considering the
                    Radial Clause.</p>

                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, in my judgment, clear that <em>the

                            acquires such a special and intimate knowledge of the

                            confidential relationship which he will not lightly change because, for
                            one thing, a change involves making the same sort of revelations to

                        (A Firm)</em> [1984] 1 AC 705, the Privy Council said (at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he relationship of solicitor and client is not unique in being

                        there were a general rule that they could not bind themselves not to act for
                        former clients of the firm after they had retired from a partnership, the
                        results would be very far reaching. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The above three cases suggest that, generally
                    speaking, an employer of a general medical practitioner, a chartered accountant
                    or a solicitor would have a legitimate proprietary interest to be protected by a
                    restrictive covenant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In <em>Koops Martin v Dean
                        Reeves</em> [2006] NSWSC 449 (“<em>Koops Martin</em>”), the New South Wales Supreme Court said
                    (at [35]) that “a particular solicitor, accountant or doctor with whom a
                    client deals may well, from the perspective of the client, be for all practical
                    purposes the person whose advice they seek and thus the persona of the
                    firm”. This suggested that a restrictive covenant imposed on such an
                    employee would not be inappropriate although whether the covenant is reasonable
                    would depend on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     What then of a professional like Dr Lui
                    who is a general dental practitioner (“GDP”)? No direct evidence
                    was given as to how he obtained his patients while practising with Smile, and
                    the frequency, nature and extent of the interaction between him and the
                    patients. Nevertheless, I was of the view that I was entitled to take judicial
                    notice of or infer the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_a"></a>(a)     As Dr Lui started off as an
                        employee of Smile, most of his patients would be that of the clinic where he
                        practised rather than his own. In other words, his own relatives or friends
                        would form a small portion of the patients he treated. Indeed, the reason
                        why he left the other clinic at Great World City was because of insufficient
                        patients.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_b"></a>(b)     Most
                        of the patients who came to the Forum Clinic would have done so mainly
                        because of the recommendation of other patients and/or the location of the
                        clinic. While the advertisements taken out by Smile might have caught the
                        attention of some patients, the location of the clinic would usually be a
                        greater influence than advertisements for persons seeking general dental
                        services as opposed to specialist services. It is true that some patients
                        who sought specialist services from, say, Dr Tan himself might
                        subsequently have sought general dental services from the Forum Clinic.
                        However, again, in the absence of more evidence, this would be less of a
                        reason than recommendations and/or the location of the
                    clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr Lui’s contact time with the patients would usually be short.
                        Once he began the dental treatment, he would be doing the talking and not
                        the patient.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_d"></a>(d)     Most patients would have seen Dr Lui twice a year for the usual dental
                        check-up and treatment. A patient might have made one or two more visits in
                        a year for treatment for more difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_e"></a>(e)     A patient of a GDP would be likely to
                        make an appointment with that particular GDP for the next session if the
                        patient was satisfied with the services of the GDP. The patient would be
                        likely to have some attachment to that GDP over time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The employer’s or institutional hold of
                    Smile on the patients who sought general dental services at the Forum Clinic
                    would usually not be strong. A patient who was happy with Dr Lui’s
                    services would quite easily switch to a competing clinic which Dr Lui
                    practised at if that clinic was almost equally convenient to the patient and if
                    the charges for both clinics were comparable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     All things considered, it seemed to me that it
                    would be too far-reaching to conclude that, generally speaking, an employer of a
                    GDP would not have a legitimate proprietary interest to be protected. In the
                    absence of evidence that might have persuaded me otherwise, I therefore
                    concluded that Smile did have such an interest to be protected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasonableness in reference to the interests of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Radial Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In the abstract, the mere fact that a
                    particular restriction is unlimited in terms of its duration or geographical
                    area will not necessarily lead to the conclusion that it is unreasonable by
                    reference to the interests of the parties: see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Fitch v Dewes</em> [1921]
                    2 AC 158 and <em>Nordenfelt</em>, respectively.
                    Although the Radial Clause is unlimited as to time, its geographical area is
                    limited because it extends to three kilometres from the Suntec Clinic and the
                    Forum Clinic and from any new clinic set up by Smile before Dr Lui
                    left.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In <em>Office Angels Ltd v
                        Rainer-Thomas and O’Connor</em> [1991] IRLR 214
                        (“<em>Office Angels</em>”), Sir
                    Christopher Slade (delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal)
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A covenant which prohibits wholly the carrying on of business by a former
                        employee in a specified area for a specified time will always be approached
                        with caution by the court, since it amounts to a covenant against
                        competition...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, however, <em>the plaintiff’s
                            clients... are in general readily identifiable</em>. An area
                        restriction against competition is not required for the protection of any
                        trade secrets or confidential information...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [W]hile the locality of an employment agency’s office at a
                        particular part of the City of London (near one of the stations) may well
                        assist it to attract and retain the goodwill of temporary workers, the
                            <em>orders of employers are placed over the
                            telephone</em> and, <em>in general, it would be of
                            no concern to them</em> whether an employment agency office was
                        situated inside or just outside the kilometre circle...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the other hand, clause 4.5(b), if valid, would impose an <em>important and onerous restriction</em> on the defendants
                        since it would prevent them during the restricted period from opening a
                        place of business as an employment agency <em>anywhere in the
                            kilometre circle</em>,<em>which includes the
                            greater part of the City of London</em>. Accordingly, <em>while affording valuable protection to the plaintiff against
                            general competition (in respect of which, as such, it is not entitled to
                            protection) the provision would do little to protect the legitimate
                            interest in respect of which it is entitled to
                        protection</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if this view were wrong, the plaintiff cannot, in my judgment, show
                        that the covenant in clause 4.5(b) is no wider than is necessary for the
                        protection of [its] trade connection without satisfying the Court that there
                        is a <em>real functional correspondence </em><em>between the kilometre circle circumscribed by the restriction
                            and the area particularly associated with the Bow Lane branch</em>
                        [which was where the defendants worked].</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Three kilometres is not big. Singapore, three kilometres he can practice
                        anywhere outside. He can practice at Holland village, Bukit Timah, Sentosa,
                        Thompson, Serangoon Gardens, East Coast, Kat[o]ng, these are all very
                        affluent English speaking expat communities as well. All these areas he can
                        go and practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Singapore is small. The distance and transportation
                            system is so good his patients can access him. I think for his patients
                            the rapport is so strong, him being the sole dentist in Forum, they can
                            easily find him. All he needs to do is get the word out there, “I
                            am practicing now in Holland Village”, and all his patients will
                            find him</em>. In fact some of them live in Holland village.
                            <em>So he does not need to do all that, and open up five
                            minutes away from me and start practice down there</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Dr Tan’s evidence assumed that the
                    Radial Clause precluded Dr Lui from practising within a three-kilometre
                    radius from the Forum Clinic only. However, the terms of the Radial Clause were
                    wider than that. They precluded Dr Lui from practising within a
                    three-kilometre radius from the Suntec Clinic and from the Forum Clinic and from
                    any other new Smile clinic that might have been set up before Dr Lui left.
                    That would include the ORQ Clinic. So, if a Smile clinic had been set up around
                    Holland Village before Dr Lui left, then Dr Lui would also not have
                    been able to practise in the vicinity of Holland Village even if he had never
                    practised at Smile’s Holland Village clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Why should Smile be entitled to prevent
                    Dr Lui from practising within a three-kilometre radius from every Smile
                    clinic if he never practised at the other Smile clinics or had stopped
                    practising there more than, say, two years before he left? The application of
                    the three-kilometre radius to every Smile clinic was too wide and was
                    unreasonable as between Smile and Dr Lui.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Nevertheless, I assumed that I could sever
                    parts of the Radial Clause so that it was confined to a three-kilometre radius
                    from the Forum Clinic only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Even then, the evidence of Dr Tan
                    undermined his credibility somewhat. If Dr Lui’s <em>former</em> patients (<em>ie</em>, patients whom
                    he had treated while working for Smile) could easily find him even if he set up
                    outside the three-kilometre exclusion zone, and they were likely to do so given
                    the strong rapport he had formed with them, then why have the Radial Clause in
                    the first place? If Dr Tan was right, the Radial Clause would serve no
                    useful purpose for Smile while imposing an onerous obligation on Dr Lui.
                    Dr Tan must have known that location was an important factor. The further
                    away Dr Lui’s new clinic was, the more inconvenient it would be for
                    patients of the Forum Clinic to switch to Dr Lui.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     It seemed to me that the three-kilometre
                    exclusion zone had a dual purpose. The first was to make it less convenient for
                    Dr Lui’s former patients from using his services at his new clinic
                    which would be outside the three-kilometre radius. The second was to make it
                    impossible for Dr Lui to compete for new patients in the same vicinity as
                    the Forum Clinic, <em>ie</em>, (a) persons who were treated
                    by others at the Forum Clinic and (b) persons who had never been treated at the
                    Forum Clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I was of the view that the second purpose
                    could not form part of the protection of the “patient pool”
                    <em>qua</em> legitimate proprietary interest. In order to
                    be recognised as a legitimate proprietary interest, the scope of the patient
                    pool which was sought to be protected must be limited to Dr Lui’s
                    former patients. To the extent that Smile was attempting to prevent Dr Lui
                    from competing for other patients in the same vicinity, such an attempt was to
                    prevent competition <em>per se</em>. It was
                    unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     A further factor which was in favour of
                    Dr Lui was the fact that the duration of the restriction was unlimited.
                    Smile alleged that Dr Lui was a foreigner on an Employment Pass who
                    represented at the outset that he intended to return to Australia after a few
                    years. The question of Dr Lui practising in Singapore did not arise at any
                    point in Dr Tan’s or Ms Chong’s minds. Furthermore,
                    Dr Lui himself negotiated the term of his employment downwards from five
                    years to three years as he was supposedly intending to return to Australia.
                    According to Dr Tan, it would not have been Smile’s intention to
                    subject Dr Lui to an indefinite restriction had it known that Dr Lui
                    was going to practise in Singapore after his employment with it
                        ended<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                            never an issue. <em>Had he said he was going to open a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Dr Lui did not give any evidence to rebut
                    Dr Tan’s allegation that Dr Lui had said, at the time the
                    Contract was signed, that he would go back to Australia to practise after he
                    completed his stint with Smile in Singapore. While there was some evidence that
                    Smile had sponsored Dr Lui’s application for permanent residence
                    later, it was not clear when this was done. Apparently, it was done some time
                    after the Contract had been entered into. I accepted Dr Tan’s
                    evidence as to what Dr Lui had said to him. However, that did not mean that
                    I should necessarily accept Dr Tan’s suggestion that he was not
                    thinking of restricting Dr Lui from competing in Singapore because the
                    question of Dr Lui practising in Singapore did not arise in
                    Dr Tan’s mind at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As can be seen from the evidence of
                    Dr Tan quoted above at <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a>,
                    Dr Tan himself stated that it made sense to have the Radial Clause because
                    there was no provision in the Contract precluding Dr Lui from practising
                    elsewhere in Singapore (outside the three-kilometre radius) after he left Smile.
                    Indeed, the very terms of the Radial Clause as well as those of the other
                    Restrictive Covenants took into account the possibility of Dr Lui
                    practising elsewhere in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Therefore, at the time the Contract was
                    entered into, Smile did provide for the possibility of Dr Lui practising
                    elsewhere in Singapore. Whether Dr Lui practised in Singapore immediately
                    or sometime after he left Smile, he would be caught by the Radial
                Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I was of the view that the absence of any
                    time limit for the Radial Clause was unreasonable. According to
                    Dr Tan’s own evidence during cross-examination, the rapport that a
                    GDP has with his patient will wear out, although he said it takes at least two
                    to three years before it wears out<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I was of the view that the absence of a time
                    limit was not an oversight. Smile wanted as much protection from competition as
                    it thought it could get its employee to agree with. It probably did not realise,
                    at the time the Contract was signed, that the wider the scope of a covenant in
                    restraint of trade the more likely it would be struck down as being an
                    unreasonable restraint of trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Dr Tan sought to rely on contracts
                    which Smile has with three local GDPs, <em>ie</em>,
                    Dr Yeo Boon Keng Alvin, Dr Lee Kong Fei Frank and Dr Tsao Sun
                    Paul to demonstrate that the absence of a time limit for Dr Lui’s
                    restrictive covenants was reasonable. These three contracts were entered into
                    between 18 December 2009 and 9 March 2011. In these contracts, the
                    exclusion zone was two kilometres from a Smile clinic and there was a time limit
                    of two years. He referred to these contracts to suggest that had he known that
                    Dr Lui wanted to practise in Singapore, he would have incorporated a time
                    limit in the Radial Clause too. I did not buy his suggestion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    As I have mentioned, the very purpose of the
                    Radial Clause was to restrict Dr Lui from competing with Smile should he
                    ever practise in Singapore. In my view, the absence of a time limit was an
                    attempt to get as much protection from competition as Dr Lui might agree
                    with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    It seemed to me that the incorporation of a
                    time limit in the radial clauses of the contracts for the local GDPs stemmed
                    from Smile’s realisation, after the dispute with Dr Lui had arisen,
                    that a radial clause might not withstand the court’s scrutiny if it did
                    not have a time limt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Likewise, Smile probably realised that if
                    the geographical scope of a radial clause was too wide, the clause might not be
                    upheld. I noted that the radius of the radial clause for the local GDPs was two
                    kilometres and not three kilometres like it was for Dr Lui. I was of the
                    view that the reduction of the radius was Smile’s attempt to have a better
                    chance of success should such a clause be challenged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I add the following observation. Other GDPs
                    employed by Smile before 2009 had different geographical exclusion zones or
                    different time limits for the radial or other restrictive covenants.
                    Notwithstanding Dr Tan’s attempts to try and explain the differences
                    to show that Smile was trying to be reasonable with its professional employees,
                    I was of the view that the discrepancies illustrated again that Smile was trying
                    to get maximum protection for itself against competition and only reduced the
                    scope of the protection it had sought when a particular employee requested for
                    it and not before.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    I need mention only two of the pre-2009
                    contracts by way of illustration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The first was an employment contract between
                    Dr Tim Riesz (“Dr Riesz”) and Smile dated 22 May
                    2008, which was about five years after the date of the Contract with
                    Dr Lui. Dr Riesz’s contract also had restrictive covenants.
                    Clause 22 thereof was the equivalent of the Radial Clause. Interestingly, the
                    engrossed copy of Dr Riesz’s contract provided for a five-kilometre
                    radius from any of the Smile clinics. If Smile genuinely believed that the three
                    kilometre radius (as found in the Contract) was reasonable in 2003, why did it
                    seek to extend the radius in 2008 for Dr Riesz’s contract? No
                    explanation was given by Dr Tan. Indeed, he did not say that the reference
                    to a wider radius was a mistake. On the contrary, he said that he himself would
                    have preferred the larger radius of five kilometres but as Dr Riesz
                    preferred a smaller radius, Smile accommodated Dr Reisz and changed the
                    distance accordingly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Likewise, there was initially no time limit
                    in Clause 22 of the engrossed copy of Dr Riesz’s contract but,
                    at his request, a time limit of three years was inserted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The second illustration was an employment
                    contract between Dr Paul Wong Shaun Yang (“Dr Wong”) and
                    Smile dated 5 June 2008, about two weeks after the date of the contract
                    with Dr Riesz. Clause 22 thereof was the equivalent of the Radial Clause.
                    However, in the case of Dr Wong’s contract, the engrossed copy
                    provided for an eight-kilometre radius, not three or five kilometres. This
                    suggested that Smile was hoping to get as wide a protection as it could get.
                    According to Dr Tan’s evidence, the radius was amended to three
                    kilometres at Dr Wong’s request<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    However, Mr Singh made another argument
                    in order to save the Radial Clause. He submitted that I should read down the
                    clause “in order to do justice between the parties” (see
                    para 52 of his closing submissions). He referred to the judgment of
                    Cullity J in the Ontario case of <em>Transport North
                        American Express Inc v New Solutions Financial Corp</em> (2001) 200
                    DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 560 (“<em>TNAE</em>”) whose reasoning was endorsed by the minority
                    judgment of Sharpe JA in the Ontario Court of Appeal (see <em>Transport North American Express Inc v New Solutions Financial
                        Corp</em> (2002) 214 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 44
                        (“<em>TNAE (CA)</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    He also relied on: (a) the decision of Lai
                    Siu Chiu J in <em>Vandashima (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another
                        v Tiong Sing Lean and another</em> [2006] SGHC 132
                        (“<em>Vandashima</em>”); (b) <em>GW Plowman &amp; Son, Ltd v Ash</em> [1964]
                    2 All ER 10 (“<em>Plowman</em>”); and (c) <em>Home
                        Counties</em> (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above)
                    (see his Opening Statement at para 129 and closing submissions at
                    para 52).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I will deal with the four cases in
                    chronological order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    
          <em>Plowman</em> and
                        <em>Home Counties</em> did not assist Smile. In those
                    two cases, the courts interpreted the relevant provision in a narrower manner
                    than the literal interpretation thereof bearing in mind the context of the trade
                    of the employer in question. They were not cases in which the interpretation was
                    clear but the court read down the provision in order to save it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    
          <em>Vandashima</em>
                    also did not assist Smile. It was not a case in which the scope of a restrictive
                    covenant was in issue. Lai J granted, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, an injunction against a defendant and confined it to
                    Indonesia as that was where the relevant plaintiff had developed its
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In <em>TNAE</em>,
                    Cullity J expressed the view that the blue-pencil type of severance was a
                    relic of a bygone area. Using discretionary severance, he struck out a
                    contractual provision which would have led to payment of interest at a rate
                    higher than that stipulated by statute. Instead, he enforced a promise to pay
                    interest at a lower rate. His approach was endorsed by the minority judgment of
                    Sharpe JA in <em>TNAE (CA)</em>. Sharpe JA described his
                    approach as a reading down of the contractual provision. However, the majority
                    of the Court of Appeal rejected his approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    As mentioned above, that case did not
                    involve a covenant in restraint of trade but a provision on the interest rate
                    payable by a borrower which effectively provided for a rate that turned out to
                    be higher than that allowed by statute. The considerations there were entirely
                    different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In <em>Man
                        Financial</em>, the Court of Appeal declined to express any conclusion
                    on the discretionary severance approach since the doctrine of severance was not
                    before it (see <em>Man Financial</em> at [126] to [131]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    However, it was useful to bear in mind that
                    in <em>Man Financial</em> at [48], the Court of Appeal reiterated that the courts scrutinise
                    covenants in restraint of trade in the employment context far more strictly. One
                    of the reasons for this approach is that employers are likely to have more
                    bargaining power than employees. I would add that employers are more likely to
                    be the ones who draft or cause the employment agreement to be drafted and,
                    unfortunately, in some cases employees do not even read the terms carefully.
                    Even if they do, their bargaining power is usually weaker, as was recognised by
                    the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    It is one thing to construe a restraint of
                    trade provision more narrowly because of the context and background facts and in
                    so doing to save it from being struck down as being unreasonable. It is another
                    thing to have reached a conclusion on the correct construction but then to try
                    and read it down so as to save it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Generally speaking, I do not favour the
                    discretionary severance approach for employment contracts. If employers want to
                    protect their trade connections or pool of clients, customers or patients then
                    they would do well to draft a reasonable restraint of trade provision rather
                    than to try and get the maximum protection which their employees will agree to.
                    The discretionary severance approach will only encourage employers to try their
                    luck by initially imposing the maximum protection they can get an employee to
                    agree to and then to rely on a reading down of the provision when confronted
                    with the likelihood of an unfavourable result in court. Moreover, not every
                    employee will have the courage or resources to resist the threats of an employer
                    to comply with a restraint of trade provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Furthermore, Smile did not plead nor did
                    Mr Singh submit as to just how far the Radial Clause should be read down.
                    For example, should the Radial Clause be read to impose a two-year or three-year
                    time limit when none was expressly imposed? Should the Radial Clause also be
                    read so as not to apply to patients whom Dr Lui had never treated while in
                    Smile’s employment?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In all the circumstances, I was of the view
                    that there was no reason to try and read down the Radial Clause to save it. It
                    was void for being an unreasonable restraint of trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Non-Solicitation Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I found that there was no breach (as
                    pleaded) of the Non-Solicitation Clause (see <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above. I have also mentioned (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above) that the validity of the Non-Solicitation Clause was
                    not challenged. For completeness, I mention briefly my views on its validity if
                    Dr Lui had breached the Non-Solicitation Clause and had challenged its
                    validity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The Non-Solicitation Clause precluded
                    Dr Lui from soliciting any of Smile’s patients from any of the
                    clinics of Smile. Why should Dr Lui be precluded from soliciting patients
                    from the Forum Clinic or any other clinic of Smile whom he had never treated
                    before, just because they were patients of one of the other practitioners of
                    Smile? This point was not addressed by Dr Tan. Also, there was no time
                    limit in this provision as well. Why should the prohibition against solicitation
                    of patients last forever given that Dr Lui’s influence would diminish
                    over time (see <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above)? In my view,
                    the Non-Solicitation Clause was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I also saw no reason to read down the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause. I would have concluded that it was void if its validity
                    was in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The Non-Dealing Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Assuming that the Non-Dealing Clause applied
                    to Smile’s patients and not just to Smile’s patient records, I was
                    of the view that the reference to “new patients” referred not to
                    those who became Smile’s patients after Dr Lui left Smile but to
                    those who became Smile’s patients from the time when Dr Lui started
                    work until Dr Lui’s last day with Smile. The “existing”
                    patients would be those who were already patients of Smile before he joined
                    Smile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Non-Dealing Clause would be even more
                    onerous than the Non-Solicitation Clause because Dr Lui would be precluded
                    under the former from treating patients of Smile even if he did not solicit
                    their patronage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The reasons for rejecting the
                    Non-Solicitation Clause also applied to the Non-Dealing Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    There were other difficulties with the
                    Non-Dealing Clause as well as the Non-Solicitation Clause. In <em>Jenkins v Reid</em> [1948] 1 All ER 471 at
                    481F–H, Romer J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...[I]t seems to me that the whole thing is so hopelessly vague that it
                        would be almost impossible for the plaintiff or anybody else to know whether
                        or not she was breaking her covenant, and for this reason. I think
                        “patients of the practice” there means patients at any time,
                        ie, persons who may at any time during the plaintiff's lifetime after the
                        termination of the partnership be treated as patients of the practice.
                        Counsel for the defendant says that that is not too vague because nobody
                        should be regarded properly as being a patient unless he was a regular
                        patient, but, even so, <em>I do not know how the plaintiff
                            would know whether such and such a person was or was not a patient of
                            the partnership. Supposing that somebody came under her professionally
                            and she enquired whether that person was or had been a patient of
                            Dr Reid and the person said: "Oh well, two or three years ago I had
                            influenza and Dr Reid attended me, but I have not seen him since,"
                            would he be a patient, and should he be treated as a patient, of the
                            practice? For that person substitute one in the same circumstances who
                            five years ago was a patient. Can the plaintiff safely advise or treat
                            that person?</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Mr Singh cited <em>Koops
                        Martin</em> (at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above) for
                    the proposition (at [83]–[84]) that a restriction on
                    “dealing”
                    <em>simpliciter</em> could be justified because (a) it
                    removed the difficulty of proof of actual solicitation, and (b) where the former
                    employee’s connections with the employer’s customers were especially
                    powerful such that the customers would follow the employee unsolicited, an
                    anti-solicitation restriction would be insufficient to protect the
                    employer’s customer connections. Insofar as a restriction on
                    “dealing” removed the difficulty of proof of solicitation, this
                    was undoubtedly true. However, it was important to note that the non-dealing
                    restriction in <em>Koops Martin</em> lasted for 12 months,
                    whereas the Non-Dealing Clause was unlimited in duration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In the circumstances, I was of the view that
                    the Non-Dealing Clause was also unreasonable as between the parties. I saw no
                    reason to read it down. It was void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasonableness in reference to the interests of the public</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    As I found that Smile’s claim of
                    breach of all three Restrictive Covenants could be dismissed for lack of
                    reasonableness in reference to the interests of the parties, it was unnecessary
                    to consider whether they were reasonable in reference to the interests of the
                    public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: The implied terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    As I noted earlier (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above), Smile’s main case also included
                    a claim that various terms were to be implied into the Contract, and that these
                    terms were breached by Dr Lui. Interestingly, Mr Singh put the implied
                    terms, not the express Restrictive Covenants, in the forefront of his closing
                    submissions. The implied terms could essentially be divided into two categories
                    of obligations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_a"></a>(a)     A duty of good faith and fidelity;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_b"></a>(b)     Fiduciary
                        duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Briefly, the facts which Smile relied upon
                    as giving rise to breaches of such implied terms were as follows (see also
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_136-p2_a"></a>(a)     The incorporation of Dental Essence
                        on 7 January 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_136-p2_b"></a>(b)     The signing of a tenancy agreement of premises in Tudor
                        Court on 25 February 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_136-p2_c"></a>(c)     The fitting out of the said premises;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_136-p2_d"></a>(d)     The discussions and negotiations
                        between Dr Lui and Dr Pearson which resulted in Dr Pearson
                        becoming a shareholder, director and dentist of Dental
                    Essence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_136-p2_e"></a>(e)     Dr Lui’s application for a licence from the MOH to practice
                        dentistry with Dental Essence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_136-p2_f"></a>(f)     Dr Lui’s failure to inform Smile of these
                        matters; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_136-p2_g"></a>(g)     Dr Lui’s failure to obtain Smile’s consent to the setting
                        up of Dental Essence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Smile also seemed to plead that
                    these duties were also breached by reason of the fact that 716 patients whom
                    Dr Lui had previously treated at the Forum Clinic were now patients of
                    Dental Essence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Duty of good faith and fidelity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    It is trite law that there is an implied
                    term in the employer’s favour that the employee will serve the employer
                    with good faith and fidelity: see <em>Man Financial</em> at
                        [193]. However, this alone did not
                    assist Smile because it still had to establish that the conduct of Dr Lui
                    breached the term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Dr Lui did not dispute that he took the
                    steps alleged and that he took these steps while he was still employed by Smile.
                    As regards his discussions and negotiations with Dr Pearson, this allegedly
                    took place when Dr Pearson was no longer an employee of Smile although
                    Dr Lui himself was still an employee (see <a href="#p1_169">[169]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Dr Lui’s defence was that, aside
                    from the Restrictive Covenants, he was entitled to compete with Smile after he
                    ceased to be its employee. The steps he had taken were preparatory steps for
                    this competition and as such did not constitute a breach or breaches of the
                    implied term of good faith and fidelity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Smile’s position was that even if such
                    steps could be described as preparatory, Dr Lui had breached the said
                    implied term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Mr Singh and Mr Wong cited various
                    English and Singapore authorities to support their respective clients’
                    positions. I will refer to the main ones cited in chronological
                order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    
          <em>Robb v Green</em>
                    [1895] 2 QB 1 (“<em>Robb</em>”) is
                    significant for the oft-cited passage from the judgment of Hawkins J (at
                    15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In what I have said I do not intend to convey that while the contract
                        of service exists a person intending to enter into business for himself may
                        not do anything by way of preparation, provided only that he does not, when
                        serving his master, fraudulently undermine him by breaking the confidence
                        reposed in him. For instance, he may legitimately canvass, issue his
                        circulars, have his place of business in readiness, hire his servants,
                        &amp;c. Each case must depend on its own circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    That was a case where the employee was
                    intending to compete with his employer after he left the employment. As can be
                    seen in context, Hawkins J was of the view that an employee may take
                    preparatory steps not just to enter into business but to compete with his
                    employer. An employee may, for example, prepare a place for his business and
                    employ others in such preparation, although each case depends on its own
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    In <em>Sanders v
                        Parry</em> [1967] 1 WLR 753 (“<em>Sanders</em>”) the defendant was employed by the plaintiff as
                    an assistant solicitor. In the course of his work, he got to know one Tully, an
                    important client of the plaintiff. While he was still employed by the plaintiff,
                    he and Tully agreed that he would leave the plaintiff’s employment and set
                    up his own practice, whereupon Tully would transfer his legal work to him. The
                    plaintiff learned about this when the defendant handed him a letter from Tully
                    setting out what had been agreed. Havers J concluded that even if the
                    agreement had not been initiated by the defendant he was in breach of the
                    implied term to serve with good faith and fidelity. He said (at
                    765B–H):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The next point that arises is this. If it was not initiated by the
                        defendant, but during the subsistence of his agreement with the plaintiff,
                        he accepted the offer made by Tully, was that a breach of the agreement? Now
                        in my view there was a duty on the defendant at all times during the
                        subsistence of that agreement to protect his master's interests, especially
                        to do his best to retain Mr. Tully as a client of his master, and in regard
                        to the letter to which I have already referred, there was a duty on the
                        defendant to look after and protect Tully's interests on behalf of his
                        principal, the plaintiff. Now, in accepting this offer the defendant was not
                        protecting his master's interests. He made no effort to try and retain Mr.
                        Tully as a client of his master. The defendant was placing himself in a
                        position in which there was a conflict of interests between him and his
                        principal and he was looking after his own interests to the detriment of his
                        master's interests. He was knowingly, deliberately and secretly acting,
                        setting out to do something which would inevitably inflict great harm on his
                        principal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There being a duty on the defendant to protect the interests of his
                        principal, if Tully had expressed any dissatisfaction as to the position,
                        then the defendant should have gone to the plaintiff, his principal, to give
                        him an opportunity to find out any grievance which Mr. Tully thought he had.
                        It may well be there was a misunderstanding in Tully's mind about this
                        Penman affair, and if he had gone to the plaintiff about this there might
                        well have been an opportunity for him and Tully to have sorted it out and of
                        clearing up the misunderstanding. I think it was accurately described by
                        counsel for the plaintiff as a "conspiracy of silence" between the defendant
                        and Tully. The defendant said that if he disclosed the existence of this
                        agreement at once to his principal he would betray Tully's confidence, and
                        so he was silent in the interests of Tully and to his principal's detriment.
                        It apparently never occurred to the defendant that while he was still
                        employed by the plaintiff he could not discuss any offer Mr. Tully made; he
                        could not possibly do that until his agreement with the plaintiff was
                        terminated. I am satisfied that in accepting the offer, by such conduct the
                        defendant was guilty of breach of duty in regard to the agreement implied
                        therein by law that the defendant would serve the plaintiff with good faith
                        and fidelity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Mr Singh pointed out that in <em>Pacific Autocom Enterprise Pte Ltd v </em><em>Chia Wah Siang</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 73 at [70], Prakash J had cited the second
                    paragraph quoted above from <em>Sanders</em> with approval.
                    Even so, I had my reservations on the validity of such observations in <em>Sanders</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    First, I would mention that the reference by
                    Havers J in <em>Sanders</em> to a conflict of interest
                        <em>per se</em> between an employee and his employer
                    may cause confusion if it is not properly understood. An employer may be tempted
                    to argue that if an employee formulates an intention to leave his employment,
                    that in itself is a conflict of interest as it is not in the interest of the
                    employer for the employee to leave. <em>A fortiori</em> if
                    the employee intends to leave and join a competitor or to set up his own
                    business to compete. This is all the more so if the employee acts on that
                    intention by taking preparatory steps to advance his intention, for example, by
                    taking a tenancy of premises to start his own business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    However, <em>Robb</em>
                    and other cases which I shall come to show that an employee may form an
                    intention to leave or set up in competition with his employer and take
                    preparatory steps towards that goal. In the latter case (<em>ie</em>, where the employee takes preparatory steps), such steps may
                    be permissible in law. They do not necessarily constitute a conflict of interest
                    in law which requires an employee to tell his employer of his plans to leave or
                    to refrain from taking those preparatory steps.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Secondly, one may distinguish <em>Sanders</em> on the basis that the assistant solicitor there
                    had reached the agreement with a client whom he was supposed to service on the
                    plaintiff’s behalf. Nevertheless, it seemed to me that to require the
                    assistant to disclose any discussions with Tully would be to betray
                    Tully’s confidence especially if it was Tully who made an unsolicited
                    proposal to the assistant. Yet, Havers J rejected that very point which was
                    taken on behalf of the assistant. It seemed to me that too much emphasis was
                    placed on an employee’s duty to his employer and too little on his duty to
                    the client whom he served. I am certain that a client would be shocked to learn
                    that if he suggested to an employee (of the firm or company servicing him) to
                    start his own business or to move to a competitor with support from the client,
                    that employee would be obliged to disclose the suggestion to his
                    employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    However, I need say no more for the time
                    being because, in any event, those are not the facts before me. There is no
                    evidence that Dr Lui received any suggestion or support from any patient to
                    set up Dental Essence before he left Smile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    I also did not accept that <em>Sanders</em> is authority for the wider proposition that,
                    generally speaking, an employee must disclose his intention to compete with his
                    employer once that intention is formed or to disclose preparatory steps whatever
                    those steps may be. If it was such an authority then I would respectfully
                    disagree with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In <em>Laughton and Hawley v
                        Bapp Industrial Supplies Ltd</em> [1986] ICR 634 (“<em>Laughton</em>”), certain employees wrote to some of
                    the suppliers of their employer to inform them that they intended to start
                    business on their own and to ask for details of the suppliers’ products.
                    An industrial tribunal found that the employees had breached their implied duty
                    of loyalty. The employees’ appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal
                    (“the EAT”) was successful. The EAT was of the view that the
                    letters were no more than an inquiry as to prices and that an intention to
                    compete expressed in the letters was no breach of such a duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The next case involved a claim by Balston
                    Limited (“Balston”) against one Mr Head and his company
                    Headline Filters Limited (“Headline”) which was named as the first
                    defendant with Mr Head as the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Balston was in the business of manufacturing
                    glass microfiber filter tubes. Mr Head was employed by Balston in 1969. He
                    was successful there and after some promotions, he became its deputy managing
                    director in 1985. However, on 17 March 1986, he tendered a notice of his
                    resignation as employee. Mr Head agreed with Balston that his notice would
                    expire on 11 July 1986. On 16 April 1986, Mr Head also resigned
                    as a director of Balston. It was agreed that he no longer needed to attend at
                    work during the remainder of his notice period, <em>ie</em>, up to 11 July 1986, although Balston alleged that
                    Mr Head was still supposed to be available till then if his services were
                    required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    On 25 April 1986, Mr Head acquired
                    a company. He changed its name to the name of the first defendant. From
                    25 April to 11 July 1986, Mr Head prepared Headline for
                    commencement of business after 11 July 1986 in the manufacture of
                    microfiber filter tubes. He took a lease for such a business and ordered
                    materials for the manufacturing process. He also arranged for persons to be
                    employed by Headline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    More importantly, Mr Head had dealings
                    with a customer of Balston. The customer was Clifford Edwards Limited
                    (“CEL”) whose initiative had led to Balston commencing the
                    manufacture of filter tubes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In April 1986, Balston had apparently
                    informed CEL’s Mr Baker that it would raise its price for a certain
                    type of microfiber filter tubes from £29 a box to £126 a box. After
                    1 May 1986, Mr Baker telephoned Mr Head to express his horror at
                    the increase in price. Apparently, Mr Baker was not aware that Mr Head
                    had given notice of his resignation as an employee. Mr Head informed
                    Mr Baker of this in the telephone conversation and made it known that he
                    was prepared to supply microfiber filter tubes to CEL at the price of £29 a
                    box. CEL was prepared to wait till 11 July to place an order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Soon after 11 July 1986, Balston
                    learned about the business which Mr Head was undertaking through Headline
                    and commenced an action against both. One of Balston’s contentions was
                    that between 16 April and 11 July 1986, Mr Head had prepared
                    Headline to compete on 11 July and that his activities during that period
                    were breaches of duties he had owed to Balston. It was submitted for Balston
                    that Mr Head should not be allowed to reap the benefit of the three-month
                    old illegitimate preparation for competition and that he should be deprived of
                    the benefit of that springboard. In particular, Balston complained about the
                    telephone conversation when Mr Head told Mr Baker that he was prepared
                    to supply CEL with microfiber filter tubes at the lower price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Balston applied for an interlocutory
                    injunction pending trial to restrain Mr Head, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, from reaping the benefit of the springboard. The
                    application was heard by Scott J whose judgment was reported as <em>Balston Limited &amp; another v Headline Filters Limited &amp;
                        another</em> [1987] FSR 330 (“<em>Balston (No
                        1</em>)”). Scott J said (at 340) that he was unimpressed
                    by Balston’s springboard argument. He did not think it was wrong for
                    Mr Head to acquire Headline, obtain a lease of premises for it and order
                    materials in preparation for the commencement of business after Mr Head
                    ceased to be employed by Balston.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Scott J was more concerned about
                    Mr Head’s encouragement of Mr Baker and CEL. He considered that
                    it was arguable that Mr Head was in breach of his duty of fidelity assuming
                    that that duty survived till 11 July 1986, but on the facts before him he
                    declined to grant an interlocutory injunction based on that claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The trial of the action was eventually heard
                    by Falconer J. The case is reported as <em>Balston Limited &amp;
                        another v Headline Filters Limited &amp; another</em> [1990] FSR 385
                        (“<em>Balston (No
                2</em>)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Falconer J proceeded on the basis that
                    Mr Head had ceased to be a director of Balston from 18 April 1986
                    although he was still an employee until 11 July 1986. He divided the
                    complaints about Mr Head’s activities between two periods: (a) before
                    18 April 1986; and (b) between 18 April 1986 and 11 July
                    1986.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Apparently, prior to 18 April 1986,
                    Mr Head had consulted accountants about setting up his own company and, on
                    their advice, he had prepared a five year plan and a cash flow plan for a
                    possible business manufacturing filter tubes for his consultation with them. On
                    14 March 1986, he had also signed a lease of premises for a new business.
                    However, Falconer J accepted Mr Head’s evidence that at the time
                    of the signing of the agreement for the lease, Mr Head was uncertain as to
                    whether he was going to be a dealer or a manufacturer of filter tubes. The
                    latter would have been in competition with the business of Balston as a
                    manufacturer of microfibre filter tubes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    After 18 April 1986, Mr Head had
                    had the telephone conversation with Mr Baker already referred to above.
                    This conversation apparently took place on 2 May 1986. On 8 May 1986,
                    Mr Head visited Mr Baker at CEL’s premises and it was agreed
                    then that CEL would place an order with Headline for filter tubes to be
                    delivered from 14 July 1986.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Falconer J decided that Mr Head
                    did not breach his fiduciary duty as a director or his duty of good faith and
                    fidelity as an employee by his intention to compete or his omission to disclose
                    his intention to compete or by taking the preparatory steps mentioned above
                    prior to 18 April 1986. However, he concluded that Mr Head’s
                    visit to CEL on 8 May 1986 and the agreement to supply CEL with filter
                    tubes was wrongful even though such supply would commence only after
                    11 July 1986. He found Mr Head to be in active competition from
                    8 May 1986 onwards and this was in breach of his duty of good faith and
                    fidelity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Falconer J also found that Mr Head
                    was in breach of that duty (<em>ie</em>, the duty of good
                    faith and fidelity) when he approached an employee of Balston (through another
                    person) to work for him while he himself (Mr Head) was still employed by
                    Balston. However, Mr Head was not in breach of that duty by entering into
                    similar discussions with another employee of Balston after that employee had
                    left Balston (see page 417 of the law report).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    I refer to part of the judgment of
                    Falconer J to elaborate on the point I made earlier (at <a href="#p1_147">[147]</a> above) that the principle about avoiding a
                    conflict of interest does not preclude an employee (or a director) from forming
                    an intention to compete with his employer and, generally speaking, from taking
                    preparatory steps to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Falconer J said (at p 412):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the statement of the overriding principle by Roskill J. in the
                            <em>I.D.C</em>. case, namely “that a man
                        must not be allowed to put himself in a position in which his fiduciary duty
                        and his interests conflict,” the conflict contemplated must be one
                        with a specific interest of the company (or other body or person) to whom
                        the fiduciary duty is owed, as, for example, a maturing business
                        opportunity, as in <em>Canaero</em>, or the
                        plaintiff’s interest in the contract secured by the defendant in the
                            <em>I.D.C.</em> case, or a contract falling within
                        the first class of contracts in Lord Blanesburgh’s dichotomy in
                            <em>Bell v Lever</em> (page 194), or the use of
                        some property or confidential information of the company which has come to a
                        director as such (Lord Blanesburgh’s qualification of his second
                        class). In my judgment <em>an intention by a director of a
                            company to set up business in competition</em> with the company
                        after his directorship has ceased <em>is not to be regarded
                            as a conflicting interest within the context of the
                        principle</em>, having regard to the rules of public policy as to
                        restraint of trade, <em>nor is the taking of any preliminary
                            steps to investigate or forward that intention so long as there is no
                            actual competitive activity</em>, such as, for instance,
                        competitive tendering or actual trading, while he remains a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows, in my judgment, that Mr. Head was not in breach of his
                        fiduciary duty owed to Balston as a director of the company in not
                        disclosing to Balston his intention to set up a business in competition,
                        whether as a dealer in filter products or as a manufacturer of micro-fibre
                        tubes or in taking such steps as he did to forward that intention prior to
                        18 April 1986.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Although Falconer J was referring to a
                    director’s fiduciary duty not to place himself in a position of conflict,
                    that part of his judgment applies <em>a fortiori</em> to an
                    employee’s duty of good faith and fidelity which is a less onerous duty
                    than a fiduciary one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Also, Smile’s pleaded case in respect
                    of Dr Lui’s discussions with Dr Pearson was that such
                    discussions took place from in or about January 2009 to the time when
                    Dr Lui left Smile (see para 27 of the SOC (No 2)). This period was
                    after the time when Dr Pearson had left Smile. <em>Balston
                        (No 2)</em> was authority for the proposition that Dr Lui was not
                    in breach of his duty of good faith and fidelity for discussing with
                    Dr Pearson about the latter’s participation in Dental Essence even
                    though Dr Lui himself was still employed by Smile. It seemed to me that
                        <em>Robb</em> was another authority for that
                    proposition. It did not matter whether Dr Pearson joined Dental Essence as
                    an employee, shareholder or director, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    The next case was <em>Lancashire Fires Limited v SA Lyons &amp; </em><em>Company Limited and others</em> [1996] FSR 629 (“<em>Lancashire</em>”). The decisions of the court of first
                    instance and the Court of Appeal are reported in the same law
                report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    In that case, the plaintiff, Lancashire
                    Fires Limited (“LF”), was a leading manufacturer of decorative gas
                    fires and related products. The managing director was Jim Wright
                    (“Jim”). The second defendant was his younger brother Arthur
                    Wright (“Arthur”). Arthur was employed by LF as a new projects
                    manager from September 1992. In November 1993, two directors of a major Canadian
                    company whom I shall refer to as “Lennox” visited LF’s
                    factory and had preliminary discussions with LF about the possibility of LF
                    manufacturing gas fires for Lennox. However, LF did not have the capacity to do
                    so and informed them accordingly in a letter dated 9 December 1993 written
                    by Jim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Arthur had met the two directors of Lennox
                    briefly during their visit. His relationship with Jim had deteriorated since
                    about July 1993 and he had been thinking about improving certain methods of
                    production used in the ceramic industry. At the time of the visit of the
                    directors of Lennox in November 1993, Arthur was thinking of setting up on his
                    own. In December 1993, Arthur had begun to buy pieces of equipment which he
                    thought he might need. In January 1994, he contacted Lennox (after Jim’s
                    letter of 9 December 2003) to ask for financial assistance for research and
                    development of a prototype automated plant. He visited Lennox in Canada during a
                    short holiday. This resulted in an agreement dated 8 (or 11) February 1994
                    under which Lennox agreed to provide an interest-free loan of up to £12,000
                    in stages. The loan was to be made to the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    S A Lyons &amp; Co was the trading name used
                    by Arthur. Clause 5 of the agreement read: “Lyons will enter into a
                    mutually accepted agreement to sell to Lennox on an exclusive basis in North
                    America, ceramic components relating to the decorative gas fire
                    industry”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    After the agreement with Lennox had been
                    reached, Arthur acquired more equipment and rented premises at Albert Mill in
                    Great Harwood which was within 15 minutes’ drive from LF. He spent his
                    spare time improving the premises and developing some equipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Eventually Jim learned about Arthur’s
                    plans and LF issued a writ seeking an injunction and other relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    As regards the duty of fidelity
                    Carnwath J referred to various cases including <em>Robb</em>, <em>Sanders</em> and <em>Balston (No 2)</em>. He said (at 650):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus, the distinction is between preliminary steps by way of preparation,
                        and “actual competitive activity”. The dividing line is
                        crossed if the employee puts himself in a position of conflict of interest
                        between his own interest and his duties as an employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_146">[146]</a>, the reference to a conflict of interest
                        <em>per se</em> may cause confusion. As I have
                    elaborated at <a href="#p1_147">[147]</a> and <a href="#p1_167">[167]</a>–<a href="#p1_168">[168]</a> above, the mere possibility of the existence of a conflict
                    of interest does not in itself preclude an employee from forming an intention to
                    compete or from taking preparatory steps to compete with his employer after he
                    leaves the employment, so long as those steps remain preparatory and do not
                    cross into the territory of being actual competitive activity. So long as that
                    does not occur, the employee’s intentions and steps taken towards his
                    objectives will not constitute an interest <em>which conflicts
                        with his duties to his employer</em>. The reason why there is no
                    conflict of interest is simply because the extent of the employee’s
                    duties, properly understood, does not overlap with the preparatory steps which
                    the employee is taking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Carnwath J found the agreement with
                    Lennox to be of critical importance even though it was an agreement to agree. He
                    noted that it was not simply a financing agreement with a disinterested party
                    like a bank. Indeed, LF’s counsel accepted that a simple financing
                    agreement would not constitute a breach of the duty of fidelity. Carnwath J
                    said (at 653):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... What matters is that he did pursue the project, pursuant to the
                        agreement, and he took advantage of the finance for that purpose. He did so
                        while still employed with Lancashire Fires. In my view this clearly put him
                        a position of conflict. His job with Lancashire Fires was, among other
                        things, to participate actively in the development of new projects, and the
                        refinement of the process. His activity with S.A. Lyons was directed to the
                        same end, with a view to competition with Lancashire Fires. I conclude that
                        between the date of the agreement on February 11 and his departure from
                        Lancashire Fires he was in breach of his duty of fidelity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    In the Court of Appeal, Sir Thomas Bingham
                    MR cited the above passage with approval. He went on to say (at 679):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Applying these principles and having regard to Arthur Wright’s
                        position in the plaintiff, the judge was in our view plainly right to
                        conclude that there was a breach of the duty of fidelity. Arthur Wright was
                        not simply seeking employment with a competitor or taking preliminary steps
                        to set up his own business. His activities at Albert Mill and his dealings
                        with Lennox, already described, placed him well on the wrong side of the
                        line. Indeed, any employee with technical knowledge and experience can
                        expect to have his spare time activities in the field in which his employers
                        operate carefully scrutinised in this context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Therefore, Carnwath J appeared to base
                    his conclusion, that there was a breach of duty, on the agreement which Arthur
                    had entered into with Lennox and not on the preliminary steps which Arthur had
                    taken. Unfortunately, the Court of Appeal was not equally clear about the basis
                    for its conclusion that there was such a breach. It was possible that they too
                    would not have concluded that Arthur was in breach of his duty of fidelity if he
                    had not entered into the agreement with Lennox and had only leased premises and
                    acquired equipment in anticipation of his new business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Mr Singh referred to Norman Selwyn,
                        <em>Selwyn’s Law of Employment</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 2011, 16th Ed) at para 19.4 to show that that textbook
                    had cited <em>Lancashire</em> for the proposition that
                    renting and equipping premises for a competing business are clearly competing
                    activities which will amount to a breach of the duty of faithful
                service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    I did not agree that <em>Lancashire</em> was authority for such a proposition. As already
                    discussed, Arthur did more than just the taking of preliminary steps. While he
                    was still an employee of LF, he entered into an agreement with Lennox. The
                    latter was the basis for the decision of Carnwath J and, in my view, also
                    the decision of the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    In <em>Universal Westech (S)
                        Pte Ltd v Ng Thiam Kiat</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 429
                        (“<em>Universal Westech</em>”), the
                    plaintiff had alleged breach of fiduciary duties by certain employees. At
                        [54] to [56], Kan J referred to three cases:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">
<em>Balston (No 1)</em> in which Scott J said he was unimpressed by the springboard argument;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Laughton; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The American case of <em>Metal &amp; Salvage Association Inc v </em><em>Michael Siegel</em> 503 NYS 2d 26 where the Supreme Court of New York Appellate Division said (at p 27) that:</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[S]o long as the defendants did not use plaintiff’s time, facilities or proprietary secrets to build a competing business, there was no illegality in the secret incorporation of (the company) prior to their departure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Kan J noted (at [57]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A common feature in these cases is that the employees took steps to
                        prepare to compete with their employers, but did not compete with them
                        before they left. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    On the facts before him, Kan J found
                    that the defendants had progressed beyond the preparatory stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Although it was not surprising for
                    Mr Wong to rely on <em>Universal Westech</em>,
                    Mr Singh countered that the same case actually went against
                    Dr Lui’s position. He referred to para [53] of the judgment which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of the second defendant, although he did not participate
                        directly in the business of the third defendant, he had engaged in
                        competition with the plaintiff before he resigned. He did that when he
                        became director of the company so that he and the first defendant can make
                        up the minimum two directors and when his name was used in the effort to
                        secure business for the third defendant from the plaintiff’s
                        principals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    However, in my view, Kan J concluded
                    that the second defendant there was in fact engaged in competition with the
                    plaintiff not just because of one act but a combination of two acts. The second
                    defendant there did not only become a director of a competing company. He also
                    allowed his name to be used in an effort to secure business from one of the
                    plaintiff’s principals. The latter point was not merely an elaboration of
                    the former point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In [48]–[49] of the
                    judgment, the judge had pointed out that the second defendant’s name was
                    used in a letter sent by the first defendant to one of the plaintiff’s
                    principals, Tech Spray, to solicit its support.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    When one recollects what Kan J
                    subsequently said at [57] which I cited above at <a href="#p1_184">[184]</a>, it is quite evident that the judge was of the view that
                    preparatory steps before actual competition were permissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    I should also refer to the judgment of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Thiam </em><em>Kiat and others v Universal Westech (S) Pte Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 439. The Court of Appeal said
                    (at [12]) that Kan J had found that the second defendant had breached his
                    duty of fidelity by becoming a director of the third defendant whilst he was
                    still employed by the plaintiffs. As I have elaborated above, that was not all
                    that the second defendant did. Indeed, the Court of Appeal specifically alluded
                    (at [23]) to the letter which the first defendant had written (to Tech Spray) in
                    which the second defendant’s name was used to solicit support from Tech
                    Spray.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    I should mention that while Kan J
                    referred to the breach by the second defendant as being a breach of his
                    fiduciary duty, the Court of Appeal described that defendant’s duty as one
                    of fidelity. I will say more on this later (see <a href="#p1_226">[226]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    In <em>Thomas &amp; Betts
                        (S.E. Asia) Pte Ltd v Ou Tin Joon</em> and another
                    [1998] SGHC 57 (“<em>Thomas</em>”),
                    the plaintiff alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that the first
                    defendant (who was its former managing director) had breached his implied duty
                    of good faith and fidelity by making preparations to compete with the plaintiff
                    in anticipation of the termination of his employment with the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Lai Siu Chiu J struck out certain
                    paragraphs of the statement of claim pertaining to the breach of that implied
                    duty. She said (at [20]) that mere preparatory acts to compete were insufficient
                    to constitute a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fidelity. For
                    example, an employee was free to apply for a position with a competitor or to
                    find premises to set up a future rival business (citing <em>GD
                        Searle &amp; Co </em><em>Ltd v Celltech Ltd</em>
                    [1982] FSR 92).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In <em>British Midland Tool
                        Ltd v Midland International Tooling </em><em>Ltd</em> [2003] 2 BCLC 523 (“<em>BMT</em>”), Hart J was of the view (at [85]) that at its
                    widest, <em>Balston (No 2)</em> only meant that a director
                    need not disclose <em>his own</em> intention to compete. It
                    did not deal with the question of whether the director was obliged to disclose
                    the intentions to compete of other directors or employees. Hart J was of
                    the view (at [89]) that a director is under a duty to report actual or
                    threatened competitive activity where the activity involves others even if the
                    director was also involved in the same activity. Indeed, he also appeared to
                    have been of the view that a director should resign immediately after he has
                    decided to engage in a competing business if he did not wish to disclose his own
                    intention to compete with his company. He said (at [89]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A director who wishes to engage in a competing business and not to
                        disclose his intentions to the company ought, in my judgment, to resign his
                        office as soon as his intention has been irrevocably formed and he has
                        launched himself in the actual taking of preparatory steps. Although this
                        might seem inconsistent with the wide statement of principle in <em>Balston</em>, it is not inconsistent with the decision in
                        that case on its particular facts: as already noted (see paragraph above)
                        the intention to compete does not appear to have been formed prior to the
                        resignation as a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Mr Singh submitted that <em>BMT</em> and other cases on directors’ duties also
                    applied to Dr Lui even though he was not a director of Smile.</p>

                    made claims against various defendants including two former directors and
                    employees (Mr Walters and Mr Hindle) and a defendant
                    (“Mr Simmons”) who was a former employee and who was also
                    alleged to have been a de facto director of the first claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Etherton J said (at
                    [105]–[108]):</p>

                            plainly wrong. Far from considering that the decision is wrong, I
                            respectfully consider that both the decision and reasoning of
                            Hart J in that case were correct and, in so far as there is any
                            conflict between them and the decision and reasoning of Falconer J

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106    In my

                            the best interests of the company (<em>Item

                            towards it', and not to place himself in a position in which his own
                            interests conflict with those of the company (<em>British

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">107    It is difficult to see
                            any legitimate basis for the 'trumping' of those duties by 'rules of

                            in <em>Balston</em> (at 412). There is no reference
                            to any such principle in any of the relevant cases prior to <em>Balston</em>, such as <em>Robb v

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">'It does not, furthermore, seem to me that the public policy of

                            conclusion. A director is free to resign his directorship at any time
                            notwithstanding the damage that the resignation may itself cause the

                            business opportunities available to him by virtue of his
                            directorship).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">108    What the cases show, and the parties before me
                            agree, is that the precise point at which preparations for the
                            establishment of a competing business by a director become unlawful will
                            turn on the actual facts of any particular case. In each case, the
                            touchstone for what, on the one hand, is permissible, and what, on the
                            other hand, is impermissible unless consent is obtained from the company
                            or employer after full disclosure, is what, in the case of a director,
                            will be in breach of the fiduciary duties to which I have referred or,
                            in the case of an employee, will be in breach of the obligation of
                            fidelity. It is obvious, for example, that merely making a decision to
                            set up a competing business at some point in the future and discussing
                            such an idea with friends and family would not of themselves be in
                            conflict with the best interests of the company and the employer. The
                            consulting of lawyers and other professionals may, depending on all the
                            circumstances, equally be consistent with a director's fiduciary duties
                            and the employee's obligation of loyalty. At the other end of the
                            spectrum, it is plain that soliciting customers of the company and the
                            employer or the actual carrying on of trade by a competing business
                            would be in breach of the duties of the director and the obligations of
                            the employee. It is the wide range of activity and decision-making
                            between the two ends of the spectrum which will be fact sensitive in
                            every case.</p>

                        beyond what was consistent with the directors' fiduciary duty in
                        circumstances where the directors were aware that a determined attempt was
                        being made by a potential competitor to poach the company's workforce and
                        they did nothing to discourage, and at worst actively promoted, the success
                        of that process, whereas their duty to the company required them to take

                            a competitor to the business carried on by SSF, but they continued to
                            take steps to bring into existence that rival business, contrary to what
                            they knew were the best interests of Financial and Investments, and
                            without the consent of those companies to do so after full disclosure of
                            all material facts, and so in breach of their respective fiduciary
                            duties and their obligation of fidelity. That conflict between the
                            duties owed by the Individual defendants to Financial (in the case of
                            Mr Walters and Mr Hindle) and Investments (in the case of
                            Mr Simmons), on the one hand, and the personal and private

                            promotion of the new and rival business is exemplified by

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">128    Further, irrespective of whether, by virtue of

                            disclose their own individual 'preparatory' activity, I am bound by
                                <em>British Midland Tool </em><em>Ltd v </em><em>Midland International
                                Tooling Ltd</em> [2003] EWHC 466, [2003] 2 BCLC 523
                            to hold that each of the individual defendants was obliged, by
                            12 August 2003 at the latest, to disclose to Financial or
                            Investments, as the case may be, the actual and threatened activity of
                            the others to set up the competing business. If and so far as is
                            necessary, like Hart J in <em>British
                                </em><em>Midland Tool</em>, I would
                            distinguish <em>Balston</em> on the facts on the
                            ground that the intention to compete in <em>Balston</em> does not appear to have been formed in that case
                            prior to the resignation of the second defendant as a director. The
                            principle that it is the duty of a director to inform the company of any
                            actual or threatened activity of another, whether or not he himself is
                            involved, which damages the interests of the company, and whether or not
                            that activity would in itself constitute a breach by anyone of any
                            relevant duty owed to the company, is part of the core reasoning and
                            decision in <em>British Midland Tool</em>, which I
                            must follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">129    Finally, on this aspect of the case, I should
                            record for completeness that, even if, contrary to my view,
                            Mr Simmons was a mere employee owing no fiduciary duties to
                            Investments, I nevertheless conclude that his conduct between
                            12 August 2003 and his resignation on 21 September 2003 was
                            such as to breach his employee's duty of good faith and
                        fidelity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">131    Mr Kempster submitted, by reference to the
                            decided cases, that the steps taken by Mr Simmons prior to his
                            resignation never constituted, for the purposes of an employee's
                            obligation of loyalty, more than lawful preparatory steps since nothing
                            was done which had an immediate impact on Investments. I reject that
                            submission. By the time Mr Simmons resigned the individual
                            defendants had not only made a firm decision to set up a competing
                            business, <em>but they were well advanced in the
                                development of a rival and, in their view, superior investment
                                'product'.</em> Not only was that a matter of which, on the
                            defendants' own evidence, Financial and Investments would have wanted to
                            know, but, on Mr Simmons' own admission in cross-examination, he
                            felt it difficult to promote SSF's TLPs when he was developing that
                            competing product. <em>What he was doing did in fact
                                interfere with his duty to serve his employer faithfully and
                                honestly to the best of his abilities</em>. <em>In the circumstances, the fact, as Mr Kempster emphasised,
                                that at the date of Mr Simmons' resignation there was still a
                                great amount to be done to establish the business of Assured and PSL
                                is not a critical factor.</em></p>

                product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    I come now to a case in which Helmet
                    Integrated Systems Limited claimed against Mitchell Tunnard, a salesman, for
                    breach of various duties. In that case, the claimant manufactured protective
                    helmets for fire-fighters and other emergency service personnel. In 2001,
                    Mr Tunnard had conceived a general idea for a new modular helmet for
                    fire-fighters and made preparations to set up in competition with the claimant.
                    In August 2001, he approached a designer (who was the third defendant). In
                    September 2001, he applied for a government grant. After he was awarded the
                    grant, he gave the designer a design specification and examples of existing
                    helmets including a helmet manufactured by the claimant which was then the
                    leading helmet in the claimant’s range of such products. Two months after
                    leaving the claimant, Mr Tunnard incorporated the second
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Mr Wong relied on the decision of the
                    court of first instance (see <em>Helmet Integrated Systems
                        Limited v Mitchell Tunnard</em> [2006] FSR 41 (“<em>Helmet”</em>)). On the other hand, Mr Singh
                    placed much emphasis on the decision of the Court of Appeal in that case (see
                        <em>Helmet Integrated Systems Ltd v Tunnard and
                        others</em> [2007] IRLR 126 (“<em>Helmet (CA</em>”)). I will refer first to the former and then
                    the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    In the court of first instance, Judge Fysh
                    QC paid particular attention to <em>University of Nottingham v
                        Fishel</em> [2000] ICR 1462 (“<em>Nottingham</em>”) as regards instances where an employee may
                    also have fiduciary obligations. He said (at [57] and [58]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    I have found this
                            authority of particular assistance since when it comes to employees (as
                            opposed to directors), one sometimes finds in the authorities a loose
                            use of the words “trust”, “confidence”,
                            “good faith” and above all, of “loyalty” in
                            discussion relating to both fiduciary obligations and the common law
                            duty of fidelity. Elias J. for example, defines “loyalty”
                            as the duty to act in the interests of another. Often I have to conclude
                            from the authorities that the (usually) grossly dishonest behaviour of
                            the ex-employee in such decisions (such as the taking of bribes and the
                            sabotaging of valuable contracts) has driven the conclusion, rather than
                            the application of discrete legal
                            principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58    The question of
                            intention to set up in competition with an employer should perhaps be
                            mentioned separately. It is settled law that even in the case of a true
                            fiduciary, an intention to set up in future business is not to be
                            regarded as something which places the employee in potential conflict
                            with his employer. There is thus no obligation upon the employee to
                            inform his employers of this intention even if the person involved was a
                            sales director like Mr Korny. This is in keeping with the
                            University of Notts case. In 1990, in the <em>Balston v
                                </em><em>Headline Filters Ltd</em> (No.
                            2) case above at 412 (a case involving a director), Falconer J.,
                            having reviewed the authorities, put it thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“In my judgment, the intention by a director of a company to
                            set up business in competition with the company after his directorship
                            has ceased is not to be regarded as a conflicting interest within the
                            context of the principle, having regard to the rules of public policy as
                            to restraint of trade, nor is the taking of any preliminary steps to
                            investigate or forward that intention so long as there is no actual
                            competitive activity, such as for instance, competitive tendering or
                            active trading while he remains a director.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    As regards the duty of fidelity, Judge Fysh
                    QC referred to the judgment of Hawkins J in <em>Robb</em> (which I have cited above at [142]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    He then said (at [61]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A number of other authorities were in fact drawn to my attention in this
                        connection including <em>Balston v Headline Filters Ltd (No
                            2)</em>, above at 412 ff and <em>Bell v Lever Bros
                            Ltd</em> [1932] A.C. 164 upon which it (and the other authorities)
                        draw. Not surprisingly, acts of preparation before departure are not
                        actionable; there is no breach of the duty of good faith and fidelity on the
                        part of an employee to decide to set up in competition with his employer and
                        take preliminary steps to do so: <em>Balston</em> above
                        at 413. The law does not require a working lacuna between jobs and
                        recognises the social utility to an employee and to the community of the
                        acquisition of expertise and knowledge from his employment. This obviously
                        applies even to an employee whose job it is to promote sales and to report
                        on competitive activity. To do otherwise would I consider result in such an
                        employee being either locked in corporate bondage or unable to get a running
                        start were he to leave. Either way, this would be against public policy. I
                        was also referred to <em>Hivac Ltd v Park Royal Scientific

                        connection but they do not take the matter further. It seems to me that to
                        succeed under this head, the claimant must show actual competition or misuse
                        of particular and valuable information (<em>a
                            fortiori</em> confidential information) in his possession which
                        should properly be regarded as being his employer’s and not
                        his.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    The Court of Appeal decided that
                    Mr Tunnard was under no obligation, be it fiduciary or otherwise, to inform
                    his employer about his activities in preparation for competition with it after
                    he left its employment. They also found that Mr Tunnard did not owe any
                    relevant fiduciary obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Mr Singh relied on parts of the
                    judgment delivered by Moses LJ (at [28]–[29] and
                        [31]). For a better understanding, I
                    set out [28] to [31] and the first sentence of [32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>The legitimacy of preparatory
                            activity</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    The battle between employer and former employee,
                            who has entered into competition with his former employer, is often
                            concerned with where the line is to be drawn between legitimate
                            preparation for future competition and competitive activity undertaken
                            before the employee has left. This case has proved no exception. But in
                            deciding on which side of the line Mr Tunnard’s activities
                            fall, it is important not to be beguiled into thinking that the mere
                            fact that activities are preparatory to future competition will conclude
                            the issue in a former employee’s favour. The authorities establish
                            that no such clear line can be drawn between that which is legitimate
                            and that which breaches an employee’s obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    Mr Tunnard relied on the dicta of Hawkins J.
                            in <em>Robb</em> (q.v. above). In <em>Balston Ltd v Headline Filters Ltd</em> (No. 2)
                            [1990] F.S.R. 385 a former director who set up a rival factory and had
                            taken a lease on future business premises and formed a company for his
                            activity was held by Falconer J. (at 412) neither to have breached his
                            duty of good faith nor his fiduciary duty; he had merely taken
                            preliminary steps to investigate the viability of his plan and to
                            advance his intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    But, as Mr Stafford Q.C. on behalf of HISL has
                            demonstrated, there are cases which show that the mere fact that
                            activities during the course of employment may be described as
                            “preparatory” will not necessarily be dispositive of the
                            issue as to whether the employee acted in breach of his obligations to
                            his employer. Hart J. in <em>British Midland Tool
                                </em><em>Ltd </em><em>v
                                Midland International Tooling Ltd</em> [2003] 2 B.C.L.C. 523
                            decided that a director who has irrevocably formed an intention to
                            engage in a competing business and has taken preparatory steps cannot
                            rely upon the public interest in favouring competitive business as an
                            answer to allegations of breach of fiduciary duty. He can only put an
                            end to his fiduciary obligation by resigning his directorship. Until he
                            has done so, preparatory steps taken in pursuance of an irrevocable
                            intention to compete would generally amount to a breach of his fiduciary
                            obligations as director.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    This approach was followed by Etherton J. in
                                <em>Shepherds Investment Ltd v Walters</em>
                            [2006] EWHC 836 (Ch).5. He held that when former directors and
                            employee set up a competing business, diverting business opportunities
                            and misusing confidential information, they had acted in breach not only
                            of their fiduciary obligations but their implied obligation of fidelity
                            the moment that they procured the services of attorneys in the Cayman
                            Islands to set up the rival business. On the facts of that case, he held
                            that a former employee was also in breach of obligations as a fiduciary,
                            whether or not he was to be regarded as a director, and that he was in
                            breach of his duty of fidelity. The case affords an example, on its
                            facts, of work of preparation which constituted breaches of both the
                            implied duty of fidelity and fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    I agree that it is insufficient merely to cloak
                            activities with legitimacy by describing them as preparatory.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    Moses LJ also said at [51]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For these reasons I am in agreement with the judge that HISL has failed to
                        establish any breach, either of an obligation of fidelity or as a fiduciary.
                        But I should emphasise that my reasons are different to those expressed by
                        the judge. No doubt this has arisen because of the change of emphasis in the
                        way HISL’s case has been presented. The reason why Mr Tunnard did
                        not breach any fiduciary obligation was because his own preparatory activity
                        could not legitimately be described as “competitor activity”
                        in the context of his employment as a salesman and his right to prepare for
                        competition once he had left employment as a salesman. However, the mere
                        fact that his activities were preparatory was not, in my judgment, a
                        sufficient answer to HISL’s claim. Mr Tunnard’s activities
                        may well be described as reasonable and necessary acts of preparation for
                        departure (see the judgment at [62]). But that of itself does not determine whether they
                        amounted to a breach either of an obligation of fidelity or an obligation as
                        fiduciary. Many activities might be described as reasonable and necessary
                        for the purposes of future competition but that does not assist in deciding
                        whether they were in breach of either obligation. The true reason, as I see
                        it, why Mr Tunnard’s activities did not amount to a breach of any
                        obligation to HISL lies in the fact that HISL had not restricted the freedom
                        which Mr Tunnard had to prepare for future competition on his
                        departure. I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    The point that Mr Singh was emphasizing
                    was that even preparatory steps to compete may result in a breach by an employee
                    of his duty of good faith and fidelity. He also implied that the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Helmet (CA)</em> had preferred <em>BMT</em> and <em>Shepherds</em> to <em>Balston (No 2).</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    As regards the latter point, I was of the
                    view that the Court of Appeal did not prefer those two cases to <em>Balston (No 2).</em> Moses LJ was merely saying that
                    there were cases in which preparatory steps were held to fall on the wrong side
                    of the line. In my view, those two cases could be distinguished on the basis
                    that the steps there went beyond usual preparatory steps such as setting up a
                    company, taking a lease of premises and acquiring equipment to
                compete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    More importantly, while Moses LJ said
                    that it was not sufficient for a defendant to describe activities as being
                    preparatory in order to avoid liability, he did not go so far as to say that,
                    generally speaking, preparatory steps would be wrongful. That would be a quantum
                    leap. What then were the activities that Smile was relying on as constituting a
                    breach of the duty of good faith and fidelity by Dr Lui? These have been
                    set out above (at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and also <a href="#p1_136">[136]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    It was quite clear to me that Dr Lui
                    was not in breach of the implied duty of good faith and fidelity by engaging in
                    those activities (see, for example, <em>Robb</em>,
                        <em>Balston (No 2)</em>, Judge Fysh QC’s judgment
                    in <em>Helmet</em> and the judgment of the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Helmet (CA)</em>, as well as <em>Universal </em><em>Westech</em> and <em>Thomas</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    I did not agree with any suggestion in
                        <em>BMT</em> and/or <em>Shepherds</em> that, a director has to disclose his intention to
                    compete (and in any event Dr Lui was not a director).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    I also did not agree with any suggestion
                    that once an intention to compete is formed, a director (or even an employee)
                    cannot as a matter of law take mere preparatory steps to compete such as the
                    leasing of premises and equipping the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    In para 17 of Mr Singh’s
                    closing submissions, he stressed that the competing clinic of Dental Essence was
                    a mere five minutes’ walk away from the Forum Clinic. He also submitted
                    that Dr Lui and Dr Pearson had together consistently accounted for
                    about 80% of the patients at the Forum Clinic from 2003 onwards and had much
                    influence and rapport with their patients. He submitted that it was foreseeable
                    and inevitable that the concerted action of Dr Lui and Dr Pearson
                    would lead to the demise of the Forum Clinic. In my view, these allegations were
                    irrelevant. The fact that Dental Essence would become and/or had become a very
                    effective competitor did not transform a non-duty to disclose to a duty to
                    disclose or a permitted act to a wrongful one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fiduciary duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    Three of the implied terms which were pleaded by Smile in the SOC (No 2) (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above), <em>viz</em>, the third, fourth and fifth terms, seemed to indicate that Dr Lui allegedly owed fiduciary duties to Smile. For convenience, these three terms are set out below:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant owed a duty to act in good faith <em>and </em><em>in the best interests of the plaintiff</em>;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant owed a duty not to act so as to place himself in a position in which his personal interests would or did conflict with those of the plaintiff; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant owed a duty to disclose his interest in any transactions involving the plaintiff.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    However, Smile did not mention these three
                    implied terms in the list of issues which it tendered on 20 September 2011
                    (see Schedule “B” of Smile’s Supplemental (Revised) Opening
                    Statement). The only implied duties which were mentioned in the list were
                    “implied duties of good faith and fidelity”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    In his closing submissions, Mr Singh
                    returned once again to the theme of fiduciary duties. Apart from his arguments
                    based on the alleged breach of the implied duty of good faith and fidelity, his
                    alternative argument was that Dr Lui’s “fidelity obligations
                    had the requisite dimension of being of a fiduciary nature”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    Mr Singh cited the decision of
                    Elias J in <em>Nottingham</em> as well as <em>Cobbetts LLP and Lee Crowder (A Firm) v Mark Reginald Stuart
                        Hodge</em> [2009] EWHC 786 (“<em>Cobbetts</em>”) as authority for the proposition that an
                    individual employee may, in certain circumstances, owe specific fiduciary
                    obligations arising from the nature and scope of his work. That much is
                    certainly true, although this alone did not assist Smile much because
                    Mr Singh still had to persuade me, first, that Dr Lui owed fiduciary
                    duties on the facts before me, and, secondly, that he had breached these
                    duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    In para 37 of Mr Singh’s
                    closing submissions, he referred to that part of Elias J’s judgment in
                        <em>Nottingham</em> (at 1489) where the learned judge
                    referred to an article by Lord Millett: “Equity’s Place in the Law
                    of Commerce” (1998) 114 LQR 214. In that article, Lord Millett
                    referred to three categories of relationships in considering when fiduciary
                    obligations may arise. The first two had no application in <em>Nottingham</em>. The third category identified by Lord Millett, and
                    described by him as the most important, was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[it] is the relationship of trust and confidence, which arises whenever
                        one party undertakes to act in the interests of another or places himself in
                        a position where he is obliged to act in the interests of another. The core
                        obligation of a fiduciary of this kind is the obligation of loyalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    Mr Singh suggested that if there is a
                    relationship of trust and confidence between an employer and his employee, as
                    would be the case for Smile and Dr Lui, the employee will have specific
                    fiduciary obligations. He emphasized that there was certainly such a
                    relationship between Dr Lui and the patients he treated at
                Smile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    I was of the view that even if I were to
                    infer that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between those
                    patients and Dr Lui, this did not in itself impose any fiduciary duty on
                    Dr Lui to Smile. It was significant that Mr Singh also did not say
                    what specific fiduciary obligation would be created by reason of that
                    relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    As regards the point about a relationship of
                    trust and confidence between Smile and Dr Lui, I would first point out that
                    a relationship of trust and confidence does not necessarily give rise to any
                    specific fiduciary duty. The third relationship referred to by Lord Millett does
                    not necessarily lead to that conclusion if one were to read the rest of Elias
                    J’s judgment after he referred to Lord Millett’s article. Indeed,
                    Elias J said (at 1493):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, in analysing the employment cases in this field, <b><em>care must be taken not automatically to equate the duties of
                            good faith and loyalty, or trust and confidence, with fiduciary
                            obligations.</em></b> Very often in such cases the court has simply
                        been concerned with the question whether the employee’s conduct has
                        been such as to justify summary dismissal, and there has been no need to
                        decide whether the duties infringed, properly analysed, are contractual or
                        fiduciary obligations. As a consequence, the two are sometimes wrongly
                        treated as identical: see <em>Neary v Dean of
                            </em><em>Westminster</em> [1999] I.R.L.R.
                        288, 290 where the mutual duty of trust and confidence was described as
                        constituting a “<em>fiduciary
                        relationship</em>.” Accordingly, in determining whether a
                        fiduciary relationship arises in the context of an employment relationship,
                        it is necessary to identify with care the particular duties undertaken by
                        the employee, and to ask whether in all the circumstances he has placed
                        himself in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his
                        employer. It is only once those duties have been identified that it is
                        possible to determine whether any fiduciary duty has been breached as Lord
                        Upjohn commented in <em>Phipps v. Boardman</em> [1967]
                        2 A.C. 46, 127: “Having defined the scope of [the] duties one must
                        see whether he has committed some breach thereof and by placing himself
                        within the scope and ambit of those duties in a position where his duty and
                        interest may possibly conflict. It is only at this stage that any question
                        of accountability arises.” ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    In so far as Mr Singh also relied, at
                    para 41 of his closing submissions, on [95] of the judgment of Floyd J in <em>Cobbetts</em> which referred to the fact that the defendant there was
                    placed in a position of trust and responsibility, I was of the view that that
                    was only one of the factors, amongst others, which led Floyd J to conclude
                    that the defendant owed fiduciary duties not to place himself in a conflict of
                    duty and interest and not to make any secret profit while carrying out his
                    responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    Mr Singh also cited <em>Samsung Semiconductor Europe Ltd v </em><em>Docherty</em> [2011] SLT 806 (“<em>Samsung</em>”) in which the solicitors for the pursuer
                    summarised various key propositions from <em>Nottingham</em> which were not disputed by his opponent. It is not
                    necessary for me to set out those propositions. Suffice it for me to say that
                    they did not take the case of Smile on the existence of a fiduciary duty any
                    further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    I was of the view that nothing in <em>Nottingham</em>, <em>Cobbetts</em> or
                        <em>Samsung</em> was authority for the proposition that
                    a relationship of trust and confidence between an employer and employee would
                    necessarily give rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the employee. Indeed,
                    as mentioned above, <em>Nottingham</em> was authority for a
                    different approach, <em>ie</em>, that such a relationship
                    did not automatically give rise to fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    Mr Singh, however, also relied on Kan
                    J’s judgment in <em>Universal Westech</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_183">[183]</a> above) and the Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment in the same case. In that case, the second defendant was
                    a sales manager (<em>ie</em>, an employee), and not a
                    director. Mr Singh pointed out at para 109 of his closing submissions
                    that Kan J had referred to the second defendant’s breach as being a
                    breach of a fiduciary duty whereas the Court of Appeal had described it as a
                    duty of fidelity. He submitted that the interchangeability of the phrases
                    “fiduciary duty” and “duty of fidelity” demonstrated
                    that the latter was the genus and the former the species. I did not agree with
                    this analysis. It seemed to me that counsel before Kan J probably did not
                    draw a distinction between the two duties and referred to a fiduciary duty when
                    they ought to have referred to a duty of fidelity. This led to Kan J doing
                    likewise. The Court of Appeal probably realised the conflation and correctly
                    referred to a duty of fidelity. The two are not interchangeable and neither is a
                    fiduciary duty a species of a duty of fidelity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    Mr Singh also submitted at para 44
                    of his closing submissions that Dr Lui had rapport and influence over the
                    patients he had treated at the Forum Clinic. Dr Lui was the principal fee
                    earner. He bravely submitted that Dr Lui’s “fidelity
                    obligations had the requisite dimension of being of a fiduciary nature”.
                    Dr Lui was a “senior employee” of Smile. Dr Lui was at
                    all material times well aware of Smile’s concerns about protecting their
                    business connection with their patients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    Mr Singh also highlighted at
                    para 45 of his closing submissions that Dr Lui had misled Smile by
                    stating that he would be returning to Australia when he left Smile’s
                    employment when he knew that this was untrue from the time he signed the tenancy
                    agreement for Dental Essence on 25 February 2009. He said that Smile was
                    lulled into a false sense of security and took no measures to protect its
                    patient pool. He submitted that Smile had consented to Dr Lui’s early
                    release from the three-month notice period because it was unaware of his
                    intention to compete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    While I was prepared to accept the last
                    point, I did not accept that Smile took no measures to protect its patient pool.
                    The Restrictive Covenants already discussed above show that Smile did attempt to
                    protect its patient pool. True, Smile could have declined Dr Lui’s
                    request for early release or asked him to go on garden leave but there was no
                    discrete claim for the early release. I reserve further comment on the validity
                    of garden leave, which is used by employers to take an employee out of
                    circulation before the employee commences competition with the
                employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    In my view, there was no fiduciary duty on
                    the part of Dr Lui to refrain from taking any of the positive steps
                    complained of or to disclose any of such steps or his intention to compete or to
                    seek consent from Smile. It was not pleaded that Dr Lui had received any
                    confidential information, or that he had accepted bribes, or that he was
                    entrusted with property of Smile: see <em>Nottingham</em>
                    at 1490–1491. What were the duties undertaken by Dr Lui? Leaving the
                    Restrictive Covenants aside, he had impliedly undertaken a duty of good faith
                    and fidelity. In so doing, had he placed himself in a position where he must
                    subjugate his interests to that of Smile? As I have found earlier, the duty of
                    fidelity does not preclude employees from forming an intention to compete or
                    from taking preparatory steps towards that objective. It must follow that
                    Dr Lui had not placed himself in such a position. I did not agree that
                    there was something special about Dr Lui’s employment by Smile which
                    gave rise to fiduciary duties owed to it. Dr Lui was merely an associate
                    dentist. Unlike the defendant in <em>Cobbetts</em> (see
                    [95] of the judgment), Dr Lui was not obliged actively to find new patients
                    for Smile. Similarly, unlike the defendant in <em>Nottingham</em> (see 1498) Dr Lui was not placed by Smile in a
                    position of power such that he could direct Smile’s other staff to advance
                    his personal interests to the detriment of Smile’s interests. While it was
                    true that Dr Lui had some influence and rapport with the patients he
                    treated, this concern of Smile’s could have been addressed by reasonable
                    restrictive covenants. If such restrictive covenants had existed, then Smile
                    would be in a position to protect (to some extent) their patient pool. In that
                    light, I was not convinced that there was any reason to impose any fiduciary
                    duty on Dr Lui. As I have found that there was no fiduciary duty on
                    Dr Lui’s part, it was unnecessary for me to decide whether
                    Dr Lui was in breach of any such duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    For the reasons above, I dismissed
                    Smile’s action with costs.</p>
