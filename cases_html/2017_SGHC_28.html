The amount awarded was in excess of $500 million. The defendant in the OSes (to whom I shall refer as the “Buyer”) had successfully applied in Originating Summons No 490 of 2016 (“OS 490”) for leave to enforce the Award against all 20 Sellers, which the Sellers are also seeking to set aside. Five plaintiffs in OS 787, who are the 5th and 9th to 12th defendants in OS 490, are minors (“the Minors”). The Minors are separately represented in these proceedings though in the arbitration, all 20 Sellers were represented by the same counsel and no specific submission was made in relation to the legal status of the Minors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The applications are somewhat out of the ordinary. For starters, it is the first occasion a Senior Advocate from the Indian Bar is seeking admission. That in itself does not warrant a treatment which is different from the usual cases involving Queen’s Counsel from the English Bar. The same regime governs the admission of <span class="font-italic">all</span> foreign counsel. Next, the admission is sought for the Applicant to only argue <span class="font-italic">some</span> but not all the issues in OS 784 and OS 787. It is acknowledged by the Applicant that the law governing the OSes is Singapore law and those issues which relate to Singapore law will be addressed by Singapore counsel, both of whom are Senior Counsel – Mr Alvin Yeo SC and Mr Lee Eng Beng SC. Finally, the Applicant seeks admission to address the court only on foreign law issues, specifically the disputed issues on Indian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Given that it is common ground that the setting aside applications in the underlying OSes are governed by Singapore law in particular the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), what then is the relevance of Indian law to the dispute? The Indian law connection stems from the fact that the arbitration arose from an agreement which is subject to Indian law. Essentially, the Applicant claims that the treatment of Indian law on the disputed issues by the majority decision of the Arbitral Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) was so wrong that it should be set aside as being contrary to Singapore’s public policy. In particular, it is alleged that the Tribunal relied on a High Court decision which had been overruled by the Indian Supreme Court in a case which was successfully argued by the Applicant. What is somewhat curious is that the Indian Supreme Court decision was not raised by any party in the arbitration. It was not even mentioned in the dissenting opinion by the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India (“Dissenting Opinion”). It now appears to occupy centre stage of the Sellers’ submission in the OSes. It is also alleged that the Award exceeded the Tribunal’s jurisdiction when it <span class="font-italic">purportedly</span> awarded consequential damages in breach of the arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Assuming that Indian law is relevant in the OSes (a point which is disputed by the Buyer), this judgment will examine how such a limited role of the Applicant will fit into the current admission regime. Since foreign law needs to be “proved”, what then is the role of the Applicant, particularly when the parties have each retained two experts on Indian law, all of whom are either retired judges of the Indian Supreme Court or former Chief Justices of Indian State Courts? All of the experts have already filed their reports. Under these circumstances, I invited the Sellers’ counsel to consider an application under O 28 r 4(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) for leave to cross-examine the experts to assist the court hearing the OSes to determine the correct position under Indian law. I considered this both desirable and preferable especially since the substantive arguments to be presented by local counsel in the OSes, insofar as they relate to Indian law, would in turn be entirely dependent on the court’s determination of the disputed Indian law issues with reference to the expert reports already before the court. The Sellers, however, declined the invitation and elected, as is their prerogative, to pursue the applications to admit the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The underlying dispute concerns a Share Purchase and Share Subscription Agreement (“SPSSA”) dated 11 June 2008 under which the Buyer  purchased the shares held by the Sellers in a company incorporated in India (“the Company”).

</div> The SPSSA is governed by Indian law, although the Buyer disputes whether the arbitration agreement encapsulated in Article 13.14 of the SPSSA (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by Indian law as well. The transaction closed on 7 November 2008 with the Buyer acquiring a controlling stake in the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Trouble surrounding the SPSSA stemmed from an investigation into the Company by US regulators and authorities. These investigations were ongoing during the period of negotiations leading up to the signing and completion of the SPSSA.

</div> Although the Buyer was aware that investigations were being carried out, the parties disagree about the quality of its knowledge in relation to the source and severity of the investigations when it entered into the SPSSA. As things panned out, under the Buyer’s direction, the Company eventually signed a consent decree with a US regulator in January 2012. The cost of compliance with this consent decree is estimated at US$35m to US$50m per year.

</div> It was averred that this conduct constituted fraud under the Indian Contract Act 1872 (Act No 9 of 1872) (“Indian Contract Act”) and that but for the fraud, the Buyer would not have acquired equity in the Company at all. The Buyer did not seek rescission but relied on s 19 of the Indian Contract Act to seek damages that would put it in the same position as if the representations had been true.

</div> It was argued that the Buyer had not suffered any actionable loss. Central to this argument was the fact that the Buyer had managed to enter into a share swap agreement with a third party (“Third Party”) sometime in April 2014. The Buyer sold the shares acquired under this swap in the open market on 21 April 2015 for a sum exceeding the Buyer’s original investment in the Company.

I shall refer to the plaintiffs in OS 784 as the “Individual and Corporate Sellers”.

They have raised five grounds for setting aside and resisting enforcement of the Award.

In essence, the Excess of Jurisdiction Challenge asserts that the Tribunal had awarded “punitive, exemplary, multiple and/or consequential damages”, which were expressly prohibited by the Arbitration Agreement. The Individual and Corporate Sellers argue that this should be determined in accordance with Indian law since the Arbitration Agreement is governed by Indian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In particular, the Individual and Corporate Sellers argue that the Tribunal had erred in awarding a measure of damages that puts the Buyer back in the position as if the representation had not been made, even though the Buyer had elected to affirm the SPSSA. According to the Individual and Corporate Sellers, this measure is (a) contrary to s 19 of the Indian Contract Act; and (b) based on the erroneous authority of the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>High Court Decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In the Public Policy Challenge, it is contended that the Award is contrary to the public policy of Singapore because it is at root contrary to the most basic notions of morality and justice of Indian law. The source of offense is the Tribunal’s purportedly erroneous reliance on the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>High Court Decision when the decision had been overruled on appeal by the Order and Judgment of the Supreme Court of India dated 18 November 1986 (“<span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>Supreme Court Decision”). At the hearing, counsel for the Applicant in OS 1114, Ms Smitha Menon, confirmed that the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>Supreme Court Decision<span class="font-italic"> </span>was not brought to the Tribunal’s attention during the arbitration.

However, as is apparent from the above discussion, issues of Indian law will have to be <span class="font-italic">proved</span> as an <span class="font-italic">anterior</span> <span class="font-italic">question</span> in the course of establishing these grounds of challenge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 At this juncture, I pause to note that the Buyer actually took the view that Indian law is irrelevant to the OSes. It gave a few reasons for this position: first, the Arbitration Agreement, which has purportedly been breached, is governed by Singapore law; second, the merits of the arbitration decided under Indian law cannot be re-litigated; and third, Indian public policy is irrelevant to a setting aside application under Singapore law. I find these objections to be more germane to the substantive OSes. In any event, it is a fact that both the Sellers <span class="font-italic">and the Buyer</span> have engaged Indian law experts for the OSes. Thus, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the Sellers’ grounds of challenge raise anterior questions of Indian law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Turning then to the disputed issues in OS 784, the Applicant listed up to 12 issues of Indian law in his written submissions, all of which he claims are unsettled, complex and difficult.

</div> Upon reviewing the parties’ submissions and documents, it appears to me that the disputed issues of Indian law boil down to the following (“the Damages Issues”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What is the measure of damages permissible under s 19 of the Indian Contract Act, in particular whether a party who has elected to affirm the contract may be awarded damages that put it back in the position as if the misrepresentation had not been made?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The status of the authorities of <span class="font-italic">Smith New Court </span>and the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>High Court Decision<span class="font-italic"> </span>in Indian contract law.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) What constitutes consequential damages under the Indian Contract Act?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In my view, the remaining issues identified by the Applicant in its submissions (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether the Award was for consequential damages and whether the Award used a permissible methodology for quantifying damages) involve interpretations of the Award rather than questions of Indian law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Indian law experts called by both parties in OS 784 disagree on the Damages Issues. This is not unusual in itself. It is necessary to set out their differing views in order to evaluate the extent to which the Applicant has special qualifications or experience for the case and the necessity of his admission to argue the factual and legal Indian law issues in dispute. In summary, the view of the Individual and Corporate Sellers’ expert, retired Justice of the Supreme Court of India, Mr B N Srikrishna, on the Damages Issues is as follows:

The Minors are also the 5th and 9th to 12th defendants in OS 490, in which they are resisting the Buyer’s enforcement of the Award on identical grounds to OS 787. As mentioned earlier, the Minors were not separately represented in the arbitration. In OS 787, the Minors, who are jointly and severally liable for the full extent of the Award, now contend that the Award should be set aside for the following reasons:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) that the Award contained decisions on matters beyond the scope of submission to arbitration (“the Minors’ Excess of Jurisdiction Challenge”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) that the Award is contrary to the public policy of Singapore (“the Minors’ Public Policy Challenge”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Minors’ Excess of Jurisdiction Challenge is similar to the Excess of Jurisdiction Challenge mounted by the Individual and Corporate Sellers in OS 784, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Tribunal awarded punitive, consequential, multiple and/or exemplary damages, which were prohibited by the Arbitration Agreement. Thus, the factual and legal issues identified at [15]–[16] and [18] above in relation to this argument arise in OS 787 as well, including the Damages Issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It is the Minors’ Public Policy Challenge that raises distinct issues. The Minors argue that the Award is contrary to the public policy of Singapore for two independent reasons. First, it fails to protect the best interests of the Minors because it pins liability on the Minors for the fraudulent actions of their guardian.

</div> It was similarly submitted that there is a lack of local counsel able to competently argue the complex and novel issues of Indian law at stake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Unsurprisingly, the Buyer opposes both applications in OS 1114 and 1115. In the Buyer’s view, s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is not satisfied because there is insufficient nexus between the Applicant’s general expertise in Indian law and the issues raised in OS 784 and 787, to which Indian law is irrelevant (see [19] above). In any event, the Indian Law Issues framed by the Sellers have been adequately ventilated through the expert opinions and are not complex or novel simply because the experts disagree. Lastly, the Buyer highlights that Mr Alvin Yeo SC and Mr Lee Eng Beng SC are sufficiently competent to make submissions on the divergent opinions on foreign law. For these reasons, the Applicant’s admission is not necessary from the perspective of the Sellers and/or the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Attorney-General supported the applications. Mr Jeyendran Jeyapal, appearing for the Attorney-General, urged the court to take a “generous” view of the applications. In his view, questions of Indian law and public policy form the crux of the OSes. He accepted that these issues are novel and complex, and submitted that the Applicant would greatly assist the court in navigating the gamut of diverging expert evidence on Indian law, with which the court may not be fully <span class="font-italic">au fait</span>. At the hearing, it became clear from Mr Jeyapal’s submissions that the “governing factor” for the Attorney-General was the fourth notification matter of reasonableness. In this regard, he submitted that the public interest in enhancing the attractiveness of Singapore as a venue for international arbitration serves as <span class="font-italic">further support</span> for the reasonableness of admitting the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Law Society, on the other hand, opposed the applications. It cast doubt on whether the s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) requirement of special qualifications or experience was satisfied because no link had been established between the Applicant’s expertise and the issues in the OSes. The Law Society also took the view that a dispute over foreign law, which is to be proven as a fact, is insufficient basis to admit foreign counsel just to argue the disputed Indian law issues. It suggested that the appropriate method for resolving disputes of foreign law was to subject the Indian law experts to cross-examination, rather than for Indian counsel to make submissions on Indian law. It also highlighted that the eminent local Senior Counsel engaged by the Sellers were competent to address the court on proof of Indian law. In fact, the Sellers had not engaged Indian lead counsel in the arbitration where the issues of Indian law were live.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mandatory requirements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Since it was undisputed that the Applicant satisfies the two formal requirements under s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>), I need not dwell on them for long. I would only note out of interest that this is the first application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admission by a Senior Advocate from the Indian Bar. While unusual, the same legal principles apply to applications for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admission of all foreign counsel regardless of their jurisdiction of practice. Section 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) can be satisfied by any appointment of equivalent distinction to that of a Queen’s Counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This requirement is met in the present case, as the title of Senior Advocate is conferred under s 16(2) of the Indian Advocates Act 1961 on deserving advocates by virtue of their standing at the Indian Bar or special experience or qualifications. Equivalent designations in other jurisdictions (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Senior Counsel in Hong Kong appointed under s 31A of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap 159); Senior Counsel or Silks in South Africa appointed under s 84(2)(k) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996) would be accorded the same treatment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Special qualifications and experience</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Section 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) requires that an applicant for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admission possess special qualifications or experience relevant to the <span class="font-italic">specific </span>issues which arise in the case at hand (<span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span><span class="font-italic">, Heather QC </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1064<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [17]). As I clarified in <span class="font-italic">Re Fordham, Michael QC </span>[2015] 1 SLR 272 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Fordham</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50], the focus here is on the <span class="font-italic">relevance</span> of counsel’s qualifications and experience to the specific issues and not on whether those issues are difficult or complex. This evaluation requires the issues to be clearly identified in a fair manner (see <span class="font-italic">Re Beloff </span>at [68] and <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers </span>at [22]). This means that the issues should be sufficiently particular to capture the essence of the underlying dispute while being sufficiently general to remain neutral to the outcome of the admission application. In respect of these issues, specific subject matter expertise must be shown. It is certainly inadequate to argue, in a vague and general fashion, that an applicant has “special qualifications or experience” merely by reference to his/her expertise in a generic practice area (<span class="font-italic">Re Rogers </span>at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 At this stage, it is important to recall that the Applicant seeks admission only to argue the disputed issues of Indian law in OS 490, OS 784 and OS 787. The specific Indian Law Issues in contention in the OSes have been identified at [20] and [28] above. To recap, the essence of the Damages Issues concerns the appropriate measure of damages for misrepresentation under the Indian Contract Act while the Minors’ Issues engage Indian law and public policy on the protection of minors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  In his affidavits in support of these applications, after listing the disputed issues of Indian law, the Applicant proceeded to describe his qualifications and experience in the following manner:

However, the question raised by the Buyer and the Law Society is whether sufficient nexus has been shown between the Applicant’s avowed expertise and the issues identified (see <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers </span>at [35]). I think their doubts are well-founded. The affidavits contained largely general averments that the Applicant is an expert in Indian law and, at best, in commercial and contractual disputes. Little attempt was made to draw a link between the cases previously conducted by the Applicant and the issues arising in the present case. However, the Applicant did stress two specific qualifications, which I shall now address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, the primary link drawn between the Applicant’s past experience and the Damages Issues was the Applicant’s role as counsel before the Supreme Court of India in the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>Supreme Court Decision<span class="font-italic">.</span> Ms Menon argued on his behalf that his background knowledge of the Supreme Court hearing would assist the Singapore court in making sense of the Supreme Court’s extremely brief order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On the face of the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>Supreme Court Decision<span class="font-italic"> </span>(which in essence is an Order of the Supreme Court)<span class="font-italic">, </span>there is no discussion whatsoever on the appropriate award of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation. That  appears to be because the<span class="font-italic"> R C Thakkar </span>High Court Decision was reversed on the basis that the Indian Supreme Court was “fully satisfied that the Gujarat Housing Board (Board) was not guilty of any fraud and the High Court was in error in recording a <span class="font-italic">finding</span> adverse to the appellant on this score” [emphasis added]. As such, the Applicant’s prior involvement in the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>Supreme Court Decision does not demonstrate that he had previously argued the specific issue of the appropriate measure of damages for misrepresentation in India. I am constrained to arrive at this view by the very terms of the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>Supreme Court Decision<span class="font-italic">.</span> There is no material on the face of the <span class="font-italic">R C Thakkar </span>Supreme Court Decision<span class="font-italic"> </span>to support the Applicant’s expertise as regards the appropriate measure of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation in India. The Applicant has not referred to any other case to support his expertise on this issue.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I should also add that the Singapore court has no jurisdiction to <span class="font-italic">develop </span>the substantive law of India. Its role in the OSes vis-à-vis Indian law is limited to ascertaining the preferred position in Indian law <span class="font-italic">as a fact</span>. In this regard, the dispute over the Damages Issues apparently centres on a binding Order of the Supreme Court of India, however brief. Since the Applicant, as counsel, cannot supplement the Supreme Court’s grounds extra-judicially beyond the face of the order, the Applicant’s understanding of the genesis of the order is of limited utility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The second specific qualification was the Applicant’s role as lead counsel for certain Sellers in parallel enforcement proceedings against the Buyer in India. While the Applicant would undoubtedly be familiar with his clients’ case, I do not think this necessarily qualifies as special experience or expertise within s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) in this case. Since the Sellers have instructed local Senior Counsel to conduct the enforcement proceedings in Singapore, I expect that local Senior Counsel would have as thorough an understanding of the events and factual nuances as the Applicant does for the purposes of the Indian court enforcement proceedings. The case might be more compelling if the Applicant had been the lead counsel in the arbitration proceedings and had made extensive submissions on issues that are inextricably linked to those now arising in the OSes (see <span class="font-italic">Re Joseph David QC</span> [2012] 1 SLR 791 at [54] and <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth </span>at [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 With respect to the Minors’ Issues, the Applicant’s position is weaker. In fact, it was conceded that there is no Senior Advocate in India who has specific experience dealing with the Minors’ Issues.

</div>
</div>
</div> This being the case, I do not see how the Applicant can be of greater assistance than the equally distinguished Indian law experts who have submitted their reports to assist the court in the <span class="font-italic">fact-finding exercise</span> to ascertain the preferred position under Indian law. As I had observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Fordham</span> at [50], the focus is on the <span class="font-italic">relevance</span> of counsel’s qualifications and experience to the specific issues and not on whether those issues are difficult or complex. Therefore, even assuming that the Minors’ Issues are complex, it does not assist the Applicant since he does not possess the specific expertise for dealing with the Minors’ Issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, with regard to the point highlighted by the Minors that the Applicant was formerly the Solicitor General of India and hence would be familiar with Indian public policy, I should state that his general familiarity with Indian public policy does not satisfy the requirement of “special qualifications or experience” for the purposes of the specific issues in the OSes. In any event, it is accepted that whether Indian public policy is relevant at all for the purposes of setting aside the Award as being contrary to Singapore public policy is ultimately a question to be resolved under Singapore law with the assistance of the parties’ respective local Senior Counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Therefore, I concluded that the Applicant had failed to show that apart from his general expertise in Indian law, he had the requisite “special qualifications or experience” for the purposes of the specific issues in this case under s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Notification Matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Since I found that the requirement in s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) had not been satisfied, the question of the court’s discretion does not strictly speaking arise. However, I shall go on to consider the Notification Matters because there are important observations to be made about a case where <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission is sought for foreign counsel solely to argue disputed issues of foreign law. I shall preface my consideration of the Notification Matters with some remarks on this issue, bearing in mind that each of the Notification Matters is directed at assessing if it is necessary to admit the Applicant (<span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth </span>at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Observations on the role of foreign counsel in proving foreign law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It is well established that foreign law is an issue of fact which must be proved either by directly adducing raw sources of foreign law as evidence or by adducing the opinion of an expert in foreign law (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">S Y Technology Inc and another appeal </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Recreation</span>”) at [54]). Such a fact finding inquiry should be and has always been addressed by way of submissions made by local counsel with the assistance of expert law reports. This is unlike the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”), in which a different procedure was consciously adopted. In the SICC, foreign law may be determined on the basis of submissions instead of proof (O 110 r 25 of the ROC).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Local counsel have argued in numerous cases involving proof of foreign law. In <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight International Ltd and another v Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar and others</span> [2016] 2 SLR 841, the defendants applied to stay a suit against them on the basis that Switzerland was the more appropriate forum.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Thus, anterior questions arose as to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whether Swiss courts would take jurisdiction under Swiss private international law rules, and whether equivalent causes of action would be available under Swiss law. The stay application, however, was indisputably governed by Singapore private international law rules. All parties filed expert opinions on Swiss law; their foreign counsel also filed affidavits (see [12]). Significantly, it was local Senior Counsel, including Mr Alvin Yeo SC, who made submissions on the basis of the expert opinions which were not always in agreement (see [65]–[72]). The parties’ presentation of their cases did not appear compromised due to the lack of foreign counsel. To the contrary, the court was assisted to reach a conclusion on the issues of Swiss law (see [78] and [84]) as part of its analysis on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Westacre Investments Inc v The State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as Jugoimport-SDPR) and others </span>[2015] 4 SLR 529, third parties had intervened in garnishee proceedings to assert entitlement to certain advances held by the bank pursuant to either a commission agency relationship or a trust under Serbian law. For the trial, experts on Serbian law provided opinions on whether the third parties had beneficial ownership under Serbian law, if it was the applicable law. The trial was conducted entirely by local counsel, including Mr Lee Eng Beng SC. Submissions made by local counsel on the evidence of Serbian law were discussed in detail in the judgment (see [48]–[57]). In the final analysis, Edmund Leow JC preferred the opinions of the judgment creditor’s experts because they were logical, cogent and substantiated by case law and commentaries (at [47]). I should note that the conclusions on these issues were untouched by the Court of Appeal (see <span class="font-italic">The State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as Jugoimport-SDPR) v Westacre Investments Inc and other appeals </span>[2016] 5 SLR 372<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53] and [63]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The court may be further assisted to reach a finding on foreign law by cross-examination of the foreign law experts, similar to other factual witnesses. This proved helpful in <span class="font-italic">Lim Weipin and another v Lim Boh Chuan and others </span>[2010] 3 SLR 423, a suit under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed) where the court had to determine the authenticity and status of adoption and kinship certificates under Chinese law and the binding status of ancestral books in Chinese courts. Cross-examination by local counsel revealed that the plaintiffs’ Chinese law expert lacked credibility and was unable to present a defensible opinion (see [31] and [42]); as such, the court concluded that the views of the defendant’s Chinese law expert were to be preferred. In a related vein, cross-examination (in particular, through “hot-tubbing”) also has the potential to narrow the areas of disagreement between foreign legal experts (see <span class="font-italic">Giant Light Metal Technology</span> <span class="font-italic">(Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 545 at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Thus, where foreign law has to be proved as a fact, the court has always handled this evidential inquiry by way of foreign law experts rather than submissions by foreign counsel. I think it is important to emphasise that I am not suggesting that foreign counsel should <span class="font-italic">never</span> be admitted to argue disputed questions of foreign law. The crucial difference here is that foreign law has to be proved as an anterior fact. In this context, I think it would set an undesirable precedent to allow foreign counsel to be admitted to argue cases when foreign law is to be proved. I see force in the Law Society’s submission that this would impact the entire landscape of both the admissions regime and the proof of foreign law.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 This should be contrasted with cases where the substantive issues are governed by foreign law or where there is no dispute that foreign law is no different from Singapore law. In such cases, foreign counsel have been admitted to argue the disputed questions of foreign law which are determinative of the issues before the court. In doing so, the foreign counsel is not purporting to “prove” foreign law. This is the critical difference which must be made clear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 A recent example of this latter type of case is <span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK</span><span class="font-italic">) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal</span> [2014] 1 SLR 372. This was a case in which Mr Toby Landau QC and Mr David Joseph QC were admitted to argue issues of international arbitration law that governed the substantive applications. A threshold issue was whether the appellant was entitled to resist enforcement of the awards in Singapore even though it had not applied to set aside the awards. Although the IAA was the controlling statute, the interpretation of the IAA on choice of remedies turned on a mastery of the principles and policies contained in the Model Law and the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (“the New York Convention”). The decision on this threshold issue alone merited extensive discussion of international materials and commentaries as well as foreign authorities applying the Model Law.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In a similar vein, when I allowed the admission of Mr Samuel Sherratt Wordsworth QC to argue OS 492 of 2016 (see <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span>), I observed that the principal issues were “intrinsically in the realm of public international law” (at [43]). Since the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal was to be determined <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> by the Singapore court, the substantive issues were governed by the interpretation of three treaties or international instruments and the application of principles of public international law (at [52]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>Needless to say, in making submissions on public international law, foreign counsel is not aiming to “prove” this law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of factual and legal issues in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the light of the above observations, I shall now consider the Notification Matters in turn. The first Notification Matter is concerned with whether the issues are complex, difficult, novel or of significant precedential value so as to require foreign counsel’s assistance on matters beyond the competence of local counsel (<span class="font-italic">Re Beloff </span>at [61]). In <span class="font-italic">Re Landau, Toby</span> <span class="font-italic">Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">QC </span>[2016] SGHC 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Landau</span>”), I identified a number of general principles to guide this qualitative evaluation of the issues (at [39]–[43]). It is relevant and useful to consider how the issues are likely to be argued and how the court hearing the case is likely to resolve the factual and legal issues. Where factual issues are in dispute, the court should consider whether the nature of the supporting evidence is so convoluted or esoteric as to be beyond the understanding of able local counsel. Where legal issues are in dispute, the court should take into account the existence of conflicting authorities and the breadth and depth of research required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Notwithstanding that foreign law is to be dealt with by way of evidence rather than submissions (see [55] above), the Applicant sought to persuade me that foreign counsel should be admitted. First, it was argued that this case is unique because the Indian Law Issues are so complex and novel that the presence of Indian counsel would assist the court in reaching a conclusion. As evidence of complexity, the Applicant pointed to the absence of binding precedents in India<span class="font-italic"> </span>and the sharp divergence between the experts and within the Tribunal on both the conclusions and the status of the authorities. It was also argued that the finding of the Singapore courts on the Indian Law Issues is likely to have significant impact on the development of Indian law. Finally, the Applicant tried to emphasise that the role of Indian counsel would be distinct from that of the Indian law experts. Given the “unusual complexity” and sharp divergence in views, it was said that the expert evidence is of limited utility on its own and that “being able to engage the Applicant orally at the hearing will bring much needed clarity to understanding the Indian law issues”.

</div> Even if cross-examination were ordered, it was said that the Applicant would have a role in effectively cross-examining the experts on Indian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For a start, I highly doubt that any finding by the Singapore courts on the Indian Law Issues – which, in any case, must be a finding of fact and not a determination of law – will have precedential value in India. It is important to clarify that it is irrelevant to consider the precedential value of the OSes in respect of issues arising under Singapore law. Those are <span class="font-italic">not</span> the issues which the Applicant is seeking admission to argue. Therefore, the Applicant’s submission that the decision would have significant precedential value in future commercial arbitration cases (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, on the extent to which Singapore public policy should take into account foreign public policy) was simply beside the point.

</div>
</div>
</div> In any event, as I had observed at [52] above, that task would fall on the local Senior Counsel and not the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In evaluating the issues, it is crucial to underscore that the Indian Law Issues arise in the OSes as matters of fact to be presented by evidence. The manner in which these issues will be presented at the hearing cannot be ignored. Since the Indian Law Issues do <span class="font-italic">not </span>govern the substantive setting aside applications under Singapore law, the question is not whether these issues are difficult as a matter of Indian law <span class="font-italic">in vacuo</span>. Instead, the question is whether the <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> on Indian law is so exceptionally complex, convoluted or esoteric as to require <span class="font-italic">Indian</span> counsel to make submissions with reference to the expert reports. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In this regard, it is not obvious to me that the evidence on Indian law is unusually complex or difficult so as to be beyond the competence of local counsel. First, as shown at [56]–[57] above, subject matter knowledge of foreign law is not a prerequisite for local practitioners to ably conduct cases involving evidence of foreign law. Further, I agree with the Buyer that the experts’ divergence in views does not in itself demonstrate complexity or novelty. In relation to the Damages Issues, the position appears to turn on how two to three cases should be reconciled with the Indian Contract Act and how the doctrine of precedent operates in India. Testing the soundness of the experts’ views on these matters does not seem particularly complex, since we are dealing with a relatively limited pool of material. Turning to the Minors’ Issues, the difficulty appears to be an absence of clear authority in India. Nevertheless, it is rightfully within the legal experts’ roles to predict the likely decision of the Indian courts in these circumstances (see <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [82]). As long as these views are backed by objectively verifiable reasons, it is not unduly complex to make submissions on the state of the expert evidence. It cannot be gainsaid that the Singapore court has no role in developing Indian law to reach a correct or desirable position if the proposition simply has not been established in India.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Given that the Applicant has repeatedly stressed the sharp disagreement between the experts, I should add that I am mindful of the concerns expressed by Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Wu Yang Construction Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co, Ltd and others</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 451 (“<span class="font-italic">Wu Yang Construction</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [14]–[15]). In that case, expert witnesses testified as to the legality of certain agreements under PRC law. Phang J found the expert evidence to be “singularly unhelpful” because the experts were “diametrically opposed” and offered no nuanced explanation that would aid the court in arriving at an informed and just decision. Pertinently, the experts had not referred to relevant treatises or articles to demonstrate an objective basis for their respective conclusions. It was in this context that Phang J observed that there was “great potential disadvantage” to the rule as to proof of foreign law. However, his observations were understandably made in the context of a case where the experts’ views were not supported by independent material. Such difficulties should be addressed with reference to the quality of the expert reports and not by way of foreign counsel making submissions on foreign law where the experts are strongly opposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As I have stated, unlike the SICC (see [55] above), that is not the procedure in this court. Indeed, if it is contemplated that the Applicant would have a role in (a) informing the court of the contents of Indian law, (b) explaining what status the Indian authorities have, or (c) predicting how Indian courts are likely to rule on the unsettled Minors’ Issues, he would be inappropriately performing the role of a legal expert from the bar (see <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 More significantly, having reviewed the expert evidence filed in the OSes, I see little risk that the obstacles faced in <span class="font-italic">Wu Yang Construction </span>will arise here. The expert evidence tendered has been well supported by objective material including Indian statutes, case law and commentaries. As such, there is an objective basis for the court to ascertain the content of foreign law and prefer certain explanations over others. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Furthermore, the parties have the option of applying to cross-examine the foreign law experts under O 28 r 4 of the ROC. As I indicated above, this appears to be the preferable approach. Mr Jeyapal, appearing for the Attorney-General, agreed with me that cross-examination of the Indian law experts is “both plausible and eminently reasonable”. There is certainly precedent for doing so in the context of applications to set aside arbitral awards: see <span class="font-italic">Azov Shipping Co v Baltic Shipping Co </span>[1999] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 68 and <span class="font-italic">Astra SA Insurance and Reinsurance Co v Sphere Drake Insurance Ltd </span>[2000] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 550. I fail to see the need for the Applicant to orally explain the content of Indian law and the status of the authorities when the persons in the best position to do so should be and are in fact the Indian law experts. I therefore do not see the need to admit foreign counsel to make submissions on these issues of foreign law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Necessity of foreign counsel and availability of local counsel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The second and third Notification Matters tend to be considered together as these matters inevitably overlap (<span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth </span>at [53]). The smaller the pool of local lawyers with the appropriate experience or expertise, the greater the need to engage foreign counsel. Appropriate experience is assessed with reference to the counsel’s ability to put forward and argue the case competently, having regard to the specific issues raised in the underlying case (<span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth </span>at [54]). In this regard, it should be emphasised that “necessity” for foreign counsel’s services denotes a higher threshold than “desirability” or “preference” (<span class="font-italic">Re Beloff</span> at [62]). Necessity may be shown by demonstrating that a litigant would be substantially prejudiced in the conduct of his case if he were precluded from retaining foreign counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The size of the pool of suitable local counsel will vary depending on the evaluation of the issues. The Applicant submitted that the issues in the OSes are not local-centric. Consequently, there are no local lawyers with the appropriate expertise or experience to argue the esoteric and complex Indian Law Issues competently. It is therefore inadequate for foreign counsel to merely contribute to written submissions (see <span class="font-italic">Re Fordham</span> at [86]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 These arguments lose their force once we recognise the proper place of Indian law in the OSes. The lack of local lawyers with expertise in Indian law is precisely why foreign legal experts are called to give an opinion; it is not a reason for the admission of Indian counsel. Since Indian law is to be proved by evidence and not by submissions, the relevant experience and expertise needed are those of evaluating the competing expert evidence and making submissions with the assistance of expert reports. A requirement for counsel to have subject matter knowledge of Indian law is hence misplaced.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 There is an adequate pool of local counsel capable of making submissions with the assistance of foreign legal experts (see [56]–[59] above). It is certainly within the range of competence of the Senior Counsel retained by the Sellers to argue the OSes. My view is bolstered by the Sellers’ own conduct of the arbitration proceedings. The Sellers did not engage Indian lead counsel for the arbitration even though that was the proper forum for the full ventilation of the merits of all these issues of Indian law. Instead, Mr Davinder Singh SC was instructed as lead counsel on behalf of all the Sellers. If the matter appeared to be within the competence of Singapore Senior Counsel at the arbitration, it is baffling how the presence of Indian lead counsel can be said to be necessary in the OSes where the Indian Law Issues feature only as anterior facts to be proven.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasonableness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 A final consideration that merits some discussion is the Attorney-General’s submission on the policy of promoting Singapore as a venue for international arbitration. In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Wordsworth</span>, I had indicated that it may be relevant to consider the potential impact of the decision on admission on the main setting-aside application where there was a lack of local practitioners with the expertise to address the issues thereunder (at [69]). This merely expressed the simple observation that a litigant may be prejudiced in the presentation of his case if he is unable to engage suitable counsel. Were necessity not otherwise established under the other Notification Matters, I am not persuaded that the promotion of Singapore as a venue for international arbitration should be a dominant or “governing” reason for admitting foreign counsel. My view is reinforced by Mr Jeyapal’s candid concession that the “logical effect” of the Attorney-General’s submission would be that foreign counsel should be admitted for <span class="font-italic">all</span> and <span class="font-italic">any</span> arbitration-related proceedings since such a “generous” approach will enhance Singapore as an arbitration hub. Surely this would dilute the underlying rationale of “need” behind the admissions regime (see <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth </span>at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For all the reasons set out above, even if I had found that the Applicant possesses the “special qualifications or experience” for the purposes of the issues in the OSes, I would have dismissed the applications in any event.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the foregoing reasons, I find that this is not an appropriate case to admit the Applicant. I therefore dismiss the applications with costs fixed at $8,000 inclusive of disbursements. Consistent with the costs order in <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers </span>(see [66]–[68]), such costs are to be paid by the “true party” who stood to benefit from these two applications, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiffs in the OSes and not the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Steven Chong  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Smitha Menon, Stephanie Yeo and Doralyn Chan <br/>(WongPartnership LLP) for the applicant in OS 1114;<br/>Kelvin Poon, Alyssa Leong and Matthew Koh <br/>(Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the applicant in OS 1115;<br/>, Aaron Leong and Victoria Choo<br/>(Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the respondent in OSes 1114 and 1115;<br/>Christopher Anand Daniel and Harjean Kaur <br/>(Advocatus Law LLP) for the Law Society;<br/>, Elaine Liew and May Ng <br/>(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Attorney-General.<br/></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
