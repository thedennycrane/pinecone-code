Nevertheless, it was noted in the Court of Appeal’s minutes when allowing the appeal on 7 September 2022 that the claimant “did not furnish solid evidence of a risk of dissipation by the [defendant]”.

It relied on advice from Mr Chirag Karia KC (“Chirag KC”) to the effect that an application to the arbitral tribunal for equivalent relief would pose significant difficulties for three reasons. First, the arbitral tribunal would not act <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> but only on an application made with notice to the defendant. However, as noted above, this point was moot since I had directed that notice should be given to the defendant. The second reason was that the arbitral tribunal would take “considerably longer than the Court to deal with such an application”. The third reason was that the arbitral tribunal would be unable to act effectively as any injunctive relief granted would not be backed up by the threat of contempt sanctions, and its jurisdiction did not extend to third parties such as HSBC.

The Deposit should therefore be held by the defendant on a resulting trust for the claimant until it is used for its designated purpose. In particular, cll 13 and 14 of the MOA demonstrated the parties’ intent to restrict the disposal of the Deposit by the defendant except in accordance with the two clauses, such that the Deposit was clearly not intended to be at the free disposal of the defendant. As the matter is before the arbitral tribunal, the claimant submitted that there was at least a serious issue to be tried in relation to whether a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust arose in relation to the Deposit.

Conversely, the defendant would not suffer prejudice since it had operated without access to the Deposit from 23 August 2021 to 6 September 2022 when the Mareva injunction was in place, and its operating expenses had been funded by Qatar Navigation.

Clause 2 of the MOA specified that the Deposit was to be furnished as security for the correct fulfilment of the MOA, with cl 13 setting out the defendant’s right to forfeit the Deposit should the claimant fail to pay the purchase price for the Vessel. Thus, the Deposit was meant to be security for the defendant against potential breaches by the claimant, and the defendant was free to hold the Deposit in any bank account or mix it with other moneys. It was only after the Court of Appeal had discharged the Mareva injunction that the claimant asserted for the first time that it had a proprietary interest in the Deposit. The claimant had not objected even in November 2021 when the defendant disclosed in its compliance affidavit that US$13,264.65 out of the sums previously deposited in the HSBC account had been spent in the ordinary course of business.

The defendant would be prejudiced if the proprietary injunction were to be granted, with the imposition of onerous disclosure and reporting obligations without any concomitant undertaking from the claimant as to damages when the claimant itself was insolvent. There would be no finality in litigation despite the Court of Appeal having already rejected the claimant’s primary arguments on the risk of dissipation of assets in the face of the defendant’s insolvency.

The claimant submitted that there was such urgency in the application, on account of the defendant’s refusal to accede to the claimant’s request not to “deal with, dissipate or otherwise use” the Deposit pending a final arbitration award and/or final appeal therefrom. Further, this urgency also necessitated the bringing of this application without notice.

</div> However, the relevant passage of Lee Seiu Kin JC’s (as he then was) judgment in <span class="font-italic">WSG Nimbus</span> at [70] cited by the claimant appeared to contain Lee JC’s observation arising from the facts, rather than an enunciation of a statement of broad legal principle. In the factual context of that case, the defendant had already taken positive steps in dealing with certain rights under the agreement and Lee JC therefore found that there was urgency in the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Related to the question of urgency, I also preliminarily considered the claimant’s arguments seeking a proprietary injunction. It was apparent that irrespective of how the claimant framed the present application, the question whether there was a risk of dissipation remained at the core of its submissions. To be clear, the claimant had fairly stated in its written submissions for the without notice hearing that the defendant’s appeal in CA 2/2022 was allowed and that the Court of Appeal had found insufficient evidence of risk of dissipation.

</div> However, this did not alter the fact that the application appeared to be an attempt by the claimant to relitigate the same point, while relying on the risk of dissipation as a reason for the urgency of the application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In view of the background to the proceedings, I saw no clear need for urgency and thus declined to deal with the application on a without notice basis.

</div>
</div> This argument was neither here nor there and did not assist the claimant. In any case, this consideration was not material as I had found that a without notice hearing was inappropriate and had directed that notice be given to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As for the argument that the arbitral tribunal would likely take a comparatively longer time to make a determination, this was again a neutral point that did not advance the claimant’s case. It could not be a reason by itself for the court to exercise its powers under s 12A of the IAA. Moreover, the parties had agreed to refer the dispute to the arbitral tribunal. In the absence of special circumstances, there was no reason why the court’s jurisdiction under s 12A of the IAA had to be invoked. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">NCC International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [61]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the courts should generally decline to exercise their jurisdiction to grant interim injunctions pending arbitration where an arbitral tribunal has concurrent jurisdiction to make such orders <span class="font-italic">and</span> there are no special circumstances to justify the application being made to the court instead of to the tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, it was certainly not the case that interim relief, if warranted, could not be obtained from the arbitral tribunal. The defendant rightly highlighted the fact that the claimant’s expert opinion, as proffered by Chirag KC, affirmed that the arbitral tribunal had the power to grant interim relief in the form of the proprietary injunction sought. It also could not be said that the arbitral tribunal was “unable for the time being to act effectively”, as specified in s 12A(6) of the IAA. There were no special circumstances warranting the application being made to the court instead of to the tribunal. Accordingly, I agreed with the defendant that the claimant had not met the statutory requirement in s 12A(6) of the IAA, especially since it had agreed to the relevant arbitral process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Finally, it was incorrect for the claimant to make the sweeping suggestion that any order made by the arbitral tribunal would be ineffective as it could not be enforced through contempt sanctions and had no effect on third parties. As the defendant correctly pointed out, s 12(6) of the IAA expressly provides for the enforceability of “[a]ll orders or directions” made by the arbitral tribunal in the course of an arbitration, subject to the permission of the General Division of the High Court. In <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts and Hotels Inc and another v Global Gaming Philippines LLC and another</span> [2021] 2 SLR 1279, the Court of Appeal further clarified (at [113(a)]) how such an order or direction made by an arbitral tribunal could be enforced, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, either with leave of the court, in the same manner as orders of court; or by entering judgment in terms of the order or direction. As for the claimant’s argument relating to the alleged inefficacy of the tribunal’s order against third parties (such as HSBC), this was irrelevant in the present context since the order sought pertained only to the defendant and not HSBC. In any case, if the tribunal’s order is registered in Singapore and enforced as a court order, third parties who knowingly act in breach of the order would face similar sanctions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For the above reasons, I was not persuaded that the court’s jurisdiction under s 12A of the IAA was properly invoked. The application would have failed on this ground alone, but I also gave due consideration to the claimant’s remaining arguments in support of the application and found them to be unmeritorious as well.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the considerations in support of a proprietary injunction were satisfied </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The claimant submitted that the present application was premised on interim preservation of its purported proprietary interest in the Deposit. In couching the submission in this form, the claimant took the view that it did not need to demonstrate risk of dissipation of assets to support its application for a proprietary injunction. With respect, I differed from this view. Perhaps inevitably, the claimant in fact centred its arguments on the risk of dissipation, given that the factual premises it relied on were closely and inextricably intertwined with the facts on which the previous application for a Mareva injunction were grounded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It appeared to me that the question of risk of dissipation was very much a live issue in this application. It remained central to the claimant’s various arguments. This was manifestly clear from its written submissions. At paras 46 to 55 of the said submissions, it was submitted that a term should be implied into the MOA precluding the defendant from dealing with the Deposit and further that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust was operative. At para 59, the claimant submitted that it may suffer “irreparable damage in that there will be nothing left of the Deposit to be repaid”. All these arguments were indisputably aimed at showing that the Deposit was at serious risk of being dealt with and dissipated, and that a proprietary injunction was thus necessary and justified. However, these would have been the same arguments it could (or would) have relied on in applying for a Mareva injunction at the outset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The claimant also sought to demonstrate the urgency in the application by pointing to the defendant’s virtual insolvency and its refusal to confirm that it would not deal with the Deposit in the HSBC account pending the determination of the arbitral tribunal. Once again, this argument revolved around the risk of dissipation, despite the claimant’s efforts to suggest otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendant submitted that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applied to preclude the claimant from raising the present arguments in support of the application for a proprietary injunction. I found this cogent and persuasive. It bears repeating that the claimant had already unsuccessfully canvassed the argument of risk of dissipation of the Deposit before the Court of Appeal.

In my view, the defendant’s position was perfectly legitimate and justified, given that the Court of Appeal had set aside the Mareva injunction on the basis that the claimant had failed to furnish solid evidence of any risk of dissipation. There was simply no reason why the defendant had to accede to the claimant’s request for an undertaking not to deal with the Deposit, and the defendant’s refusal to do so could not form a basis for the present application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1104, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> is termed as such because (at [102]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it extends cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel beyond cases where the point sought to be argued in later proceedings had actually and already been decided by a court in earlier proceedings between the same parties … to cases where the point was not previously decided because it was not raised in the earlier proceedings even though it could and should have been raised in those proceedings.

In this process, the court is guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The claimant appeared to maintain that even though the factual premises remained unchanged, the relief sought in the form of a proprietary injunction was different from the Mareva injunction sought in OS 849/2021 which was set aside by the Court of Appeal in CA 2/2022. However, this missed the point that the issue of risk of dissipation arising from the <span class="font-italic">same</span> factual premises had already been determined by the Court of Appeal. As I previously noted at the initial without notice hearing on 27 September 2022, it did not appear that there was any new evidence on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Having had the benefit of hearing full submissions from the parties, I concluded that the claimant plainly could have, or ought to have, with reasonable diligence, advanced the same arguments pertaining to its alleged proprietary interest previously when applying for the Mareva injunction before the High Court and/or the Court of Appeal. This was an abuse of process, being a thinly veiled collateral attack on the Court of Appeal’s decision to allow the appeal in CA 2/2022. In my assessment, the claimant was estopped from pursuing the present application on essentially the same grounds.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In any case, I was of the view that the claimant had raised the argument of having a proprietary interest in the Deposit as an afterthought. As Lord Millett opined in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley and others </span>[2002] 2 AC 164 at [73], “[a] <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust does not necessarily arise merely because money is paid for a particular purpose”. The question in every case is whether the parties intended the money to be at the <span class="font-italic">free disposal</span> of the recipient (at [74]). Based on the terms of the MOA, I saw no basis for reading in an implied term to prohibit the defendant from dealing with the Deposit as part of its assets. The Deposit was furnished by the claimant to provide “security for the correct fulfilment of [the MOA]”: cl 2 of the MOA. I accepted the defendant’s submission that the MOA thus envisioned the Deposit as security for the defendant against potential breaches by the claimant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Even if I had erred in this reasoning, and cll 13 and 14 of the MOA could instead be validly construed in the restrictive fashion suggested by the claimant as set out at [20] above, any force in this argument was blunted once it was appreciated that the claimant itself was equally subject to those clauses. If the claimant was correct that the Deposit was subject to a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust which was supported by those clauses, then the defendant could, by the same token, be said to have an equivalent proprietary interest in the Deposit by virtue of cll 13 and 14. This was of course illogical and unlikely to have accorded with the parties’ intent as set out in the terms of the MOA. I was not persuaded therefore that the claimant had shown a seriously arguable case of proprietary interest in the Deposit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The claimant’s arguments pertaining to whether there was a serious issue to be tried and the balance of convenience were similarly plainly grounded in substance on the claimant’s fear or suspicion that the Deposit was at risk of being dissipated. I accepted the defendant’s submission that there was no serious issue to be tried, particularly when the same arguments as those raised in CA 2/2022 were being repeated in substance in this application. The Court of Appeal had already rejected the claimant’s arguments as to risk of dissipation. Pending the release of full grounds for the Court of Appeal’s decision, the matter could be wholly <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or would at least give rise to issue estoppel. I found that the balance of convenience did not lie in favour of the claimant as it had not shown that it would suffer irreparable or irremediable prejudice if the injunction was not granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For the reasons set out above, the application was dismissed. In summary, the claimant had not succeeded in showing why the court’s jurisdiction under s 12A of the IAA ought to be invoked in aid of the ongoing arbitration proceedings in London.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The claimant was in effect seeking a second bite of the cherry to obtain a Mareva injunction under the guise of an application for a proprietary injunction. The application was misconceived and a clear abuse of process, thereby attracting the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. The defendant was compelled at short notice to defend an application which was little more than an attempt to go behind the Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 2/2022 allowing the defendant’s appeal and setting aside the Mareva injunction that had initially been ordered. Despite the Court of Appeal having categorically found that the claimant had not provided solid evidence of the risk of dissipation of the Deposit, essentially the same arguments as to risk of dissipation were raised again in this application, in a vexatious attempt to relitigate the issue where no relevant new evidence was placed before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Having regard to the established <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid</span> principles, the claimant did not have a seriously arguable case founded on a proprietary interest, and the balance of convenience did not lie in favour of the grant of an injunction. I found that the claimant’s various arguments were unmeritorious in all respects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the circumstances, after hearing the parties’ submissions on costs, I was satisfied that it was appropriate to order the claimant to bear the defendant’s costs on an indemnity basis. I ordered costs against the claimant fixed at $35,000 all-in.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Goh Kok Leong, Daniel Tan An Ye and Nicholas Say Gui Xi (Ang &amp; Partners) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Zhengxian Jordan and Leong Hoi Seng Victor (Audent Chambers LLC) (instructed), Edgar Chin Ren Howe and Ch’ng Cheng Yi Samantha (Ascendant Legal LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
