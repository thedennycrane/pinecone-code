Considering the plain words of Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Constitution, I am satisfied that the disqualification applies to convictions for criminal contempt. The applicant is thus disqualified by the sentence imposed for the criminal contempt which the court in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham (Conviction) </span>found had been committed by him. I do not consider that the purpose can be properly construed in a way to assist beyond the plain words of the text.

That decision was made in the context of determining how the court’s jurisdiction was established in respect of an overseas contemnor. The Court of Appeal recognised that there could be differences between the two although the AJPA itself dispenses with the labels of “civil” and “criminal” contempt: <span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu </span>at [122]–[123].

Article 44 of the Constitution states that a person is qualified to stand for election as a Member of Parliament if he fulfils the requirements therein and is not disqualified under Art 45. It thus appears that the right to stand for election (provided the necessary pre-requisites are met) is properly characterised as a <span class="font-italic">personal </span>one. There is thus no need for the applicant to show that he has suffered special damage, which would have been required had declaratory relief been sought on the basis of a <span class="font-italic">public </span>right: see <span class="font-italic">Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v </span><span class="font-italic">AG</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>”) at [29]–[33].  One issue which arises is that the application in the present case can arguably be described as theoretical. The applicant has not yet had an application to stand for election as a Member of Parliament rejected on the basis of his being disqualified under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>). However, I do not think that this prevents him from bringing the present application. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Hong</span>, the Court of Appeal held that the court <span class="font-italic">may </span>exercise its discretion to hear cases involving applications for declaratory relief even though the facts on which the action is based are theoretical: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [143]. Here, I am satisfied that the hearing of a theoretical case in this instance is justified on the basis that a general election must be called relatively soon. It would be appropriate to determine the issue of the applicant’s eligibility at this point given his undisputed intention to stand for election. In any event, the respondent does not take issue with the availability of declaratory relief, or the applicant’s standing to seek the same, in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The meaning of “offence”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In construing the meaning of “offence” in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span><span class="font-italic"> v AG </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”), laying down a three step approach to constitutional interpretation, will have to be borne in mind.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I would not read Art 22P narrowly: there is nothing in that article which would curtail the constitutional power of the President to grant a pardon for offences, including criminal contempt.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>The plain words do not expressly exclude contempt, whether civil or criminal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Malaysian decision in <span class="font-italic">Wee Choo Keong</span> is, with respect, not persuasive. In <span class="font-italic">Wee Choo Keong</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Malaysian Court of Appeal held that Art 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia (2010 Reprint) (M’sia) (“the Malaysian Constitution”), which for present purposes is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Constitution, did not operate to disqualify a person convicted of civil contempt. The Malaysian Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the wording and context limited its operation to criminal offences as only they could be subject to a free pardon (<span class="font-italic">Wee Choo Keong </span>at [19]–[20]). With respect, the Malaysian Court of Appeal’s decision was arrived at without reference to any authority that a person convicted and sentenced of civil contempt could not obtain a free pardon, with the result being that a civil contemnor would not be disqualified under Art 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Malaysian Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 A few points arise from <span class="font-italic">Wee Choo Keong</span>. First, in so far as the Malaysian Court of Appeal concluded that civil contempt is excluded, that is an issue that must be disposed of on another occasion. The issue before this court is whether disqualification under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) applies to <span class="font-italic">criminal contempt</span>. Different considerations may or may not apply to civil contempt, for which fuller arguments and consideration may be required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Second, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Wee Choo Keong</span> suggested that disqualification in Art 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Malaysian Constitution applies to criminal contempt. At [19], the Malaysian Court of Appeal referred to s 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1981 (c 34) (UK), which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A person found guilty of one or more offences…and sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained indefinitely or for more than one year, shall be disqualified for membership of the House of Commons…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Malaysian Court of Appeal, while noting that the provision appeared broader than Art 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Malaysian Constitution, nevertheless found that the English position was helpful in interpreting the provision, observing that it “would appear to apply to criminal but not civil contempt”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Third, the Malaysian Court of Appeal linked the interpretation of Art 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Malaysian Constitution to the availability of a free pardon, reasoning that an offence only disqualifies a person if the offence is capable of being subject to a free pardon.  As mentioned above at [27], I am doubtful that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Wee Choo Keong</span> accurately defines the scope of the President’ Constitutional power to pardon under Art 22P. But aside from that, I am, with respect, uncertain that this is the appropriate reading. It controls the meaning of the term “offence” by linking it to a quality, namely the ability to be pardoned.  If that had been the intention of the drafters of the Constitutional provision, it would have been relatively easy to define “offence” expressly as an offence for which a pardon is available. That the drafters did not do so would seem to point against this interpretation. In fact, the more natural reading to my mind would simply be that an offence disqualifies if the punishment prescribed is imposed, but the disqualification does not operate if a free pardon is obtained. If a free pardon is in fact not available, then the disqualification is not capable of being removed. I am aware that my approach here means that there is a divergence between the law in Malaysia and Singapore. But that issue alone cannot control the interpretation of Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I should note in passing that there does not seem to be much that needs to be made out of the phrase “free pardon” as opposed to a pardon <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>:   the term would seem to connote an unconditional pardon.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As for the reference to a conviction in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), this could point to a narrow meaning. However, the term “convict” has always been used in relation to criminal contempt, specifically for the offence of contempt by scandalising the court: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">AG</span><span class="font-italic"> v Shadrake Alan </span>[2011] 2 SLR 445 at [137]; <span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang v </span><span class="font-italic">AG </span>[2016] 1 SLR 992 at [9].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Article 45 as a whole </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I do not agree with the applicant’s arguments that considering Art 45, particularly Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>), as a whole leads to the conclusion that the term “offence” must be given a narrower meaning, excluding criminal contempt. Article 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) provides for disqualification where a person commits various election-related offences. It does not follow that Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) should be read narrowly to avoid tautology. As argued by the respondent, Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) is concerned with a specific basis of disqualification relating to offences or proceedings concerning elections, such as those found in s 55 of the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap 218, 2011 Rev Ed) (“PEA”). It does not follow that there is any tautology or needless duplication. In other words, Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is concerned with general situations, whereas Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) deals specifically with election-related offences. The overlapping nature of the various bases for disqualification in Art 45 may also be seen in the relationship between Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), referred to by the applicant. The various subsections of Art 45 may refer to overlapping categories of offences and events; it does not follow that they have to be construed as being entirely distinct and segregated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Tautologies are to be avoided, but some overlap and redundancy is to be expected, especially where some provisions deal with specific situations and others are of more general applicability. I do not think that the rule that Parliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain goes so far as to prevent any overlap in enacted legislation; some redundancy is human and is to be expected out of an abundance of caution. An example of this can be found in the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC"). Lesser offences such as voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 PC overlap with more serious ones such as voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 PC; in cases where the more serious offence is made out, the elements of the lesser offence would inevitably be satisfied as well. It cannot be the case that such provisions must be interpreted in a way such as to avoid any element of overlap, as the applicant appears to argue. To do so is an incorrect application of the interpretive rule and would lead to absurd results. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The Constitution as a whole</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As argued by the respondent, the rest of the Constitution contains references to offences which must be taken to include criminal contempt. Article 35(8), which deals with the powers of the Attorney-General, states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is not disputed that this power extends to cover contempt of court, meaning that the term “offence” in Art 35(8) includes criminal contempt. The respondent, citing <span class="font-italic">Woon Brothers Investments Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">MCST Plan No 461 and others </span>[2011] 4 SLR 777 at [19], relies on the presumption that the same word is to bear the same meaning throughout a particular statute.

</div> There is indeed force in this argument, but the presumption may be displaced by other considerations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Statute</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37  Statutes use the term “offence” to mean criminal offences, but this is inherent in the statutes specifying non-compliance as criminal matters to be dealt with through the criminal justice system. I do not therefore take the general usage of the term “offence” in the statute books to control its meaning in the Constitution, since what is in issue before me is whether that term can extend to a quasi-criminal matter. There do not appear to be other similar quasi-criminal offences under our laws. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Disciplinary offences</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The applicant raises the example of disciplinary offences as indicating ambiguity. Interpreting the term “offence” widely would mean that even disciplinary proceedings resulting in the imposition of a fine of more than $2,000 would lead to disqualification under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>). For example, a finding by a disciplinary tribunal that a doctor is guilty of disreputable conduct under s 53(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (“MRA”)  would potentially disqualify him from standing for election as a Member of Parliament if a fine of more than $2,000 is imposed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I accept the arguments of the respondent. Findings by a disciplinary tribunal that disciplinary offences are made out do not lead to a disqualifying offence under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>). Such tribunals are not courts of law. I would also note that s 53(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the MRA empowers the disciplinary tribunal to impose a penalty as opposed to a fine, though there does not appear to be a significant difference between the two.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Article 74 does not assist the applicant as it refers to a specific tribunal established under the Constitution. In any event, Art 74 distinguishes the tribunal from the courts. No ambiguity or risk of disqualification for a minor matter arises.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) Strict interpretation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Although not couched as such, there are parts of the applicant’s arguments which can be taken as advancing the point that the disqualification criteria in Art 45 should be construed strictly because they affect an important right or capacity, namely, the ability to stand for an office. The applicant referred to this as a fundamental right, mirroring the right to vote, which had to be vindicated by the court; this is considered below (at [66]). In this portion, the focus will be instead on whether the words in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) have to be strictly construed or interpreted to avoid, wherever possible, infringement of that right or capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Such a strict interpretation is adopted in relation to ambiguous criminal provisions where there are two plausible ways of interpreting a statutory provision, even after it has been purposively interpreted. In such a scenario, the principle against doubtful penalisation applies and the provision is construed strictly in a way that is in favour of leniency to the accused: see <span class="font-italic">Kong Hoo (Pte) Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1131 at [140], citing <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Low Kok Heng </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [31]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 While there would be some sympathy for the view that restrictions against running should be narrowly construed, it is doubtful that there is such a level of ambiguity in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) that would attract a strict construction. Furthermore, as argued by the respondent, there are in fact various restrictions on qualification to run.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Even leaving aside the qualifications under Art 19 for those running for President, the stipulations in Art 45 are quite wide. Excluding Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), Art 45 contains no less than six other different grounds on which a person can be disqualified from standing for election as a Member of Parliament including: unsoundness of mind; bankruptcy; holding an office of profit; failure to properly lodge returns of election expenses; foreign citizenship or allegiance; and election-related offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I am not aware as presently advised of any authority expressly adopting the position that a strict interpretation is to be adopted with regard to Art 45.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The purpose </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The applicant argues that caution has to be exercised in determining the purpose of a statute; otherwise, the purpose may be defined simply to support a party’s preferred interpretation. The court should presume that the statute is a coherent whole, and generally, the specific purpose of a particular provision should not go against the general purpose of the statute. As far as possible, the provision in question should be read consistently with both the general purpose of the statute as well as the specific purpose of the provision.

The terms “crime” or “criminal offence”, which were present in predecessor provisions to Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), were removed without explanation, but such removal does not indicate that disqualification is to be tied to the punishment imposed rather than whether an offence is criminal in nature.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>None of the reports cited by the respondent shed any light on whether quasi-criminal offences such as criminal contempt were caught by Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I accept that caution has to be exercised in construing meaning from the text of Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>). There is a danger of the court projecting a meaning on to the words that distorts those very words.

Doing so would disregard the mechanisms and safeguards laid down in the Constitution for amendment of its provisions and the division of power between the three branches of the government.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 What can be construed from the text of Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is that persons who are sentenced to a fine of more than $2,000 or imprisonment of more than a year are disqualified. This does not, however, shed light on the meaning to be given to the term “offence”. The respondent’s arguments that the sentence floors prescribed indicate that the nature of the offence is immaterial show one possible position; but there are insufficient grounds to regard that position as encapsulating the purpose, excluding the possibility that “offence” can be construed in a narrower sense to cover only “criminal offence”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I would also note that the usefulness of some of the materials cited by both sides has to be questioned.

</div> It is not evident from the newspaper report that this was indeed the position taken by the RO. The only statement attributed to the RO is that Mr Jufrie Mahmood’s nomination papers would not be rejected if filed. There might be other possible explanations for the RO’s position, such as a waiver of some sort having been granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Even if the position of the RO in 1988 were accurately reported and reflective of the actual legal position taken by the government then, this does not mean that the government remains bound by this position some 31 years later. While the applicant invoked the presumption of legality, it is not entirely clear how the presumption would assist in the present proceedings, which concern the interpretation of a constitutional provision. The fact that the RO in 1988 might have taken a position in relation to the interpretation of Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) cannot be binding on the courts, which are tasked under the Constitution to interpret the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The more important question that arises here is whether the government is bound by the stance taken by the RO in 1988. The primary basis that may bind the government is estoppel. While not raised in written arguments, what I considered and asked the parties to address me on orally was estoppel.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For estoppel to be made out, the primary elements which the applicant has to establish are representation and detrimental reliance. It was unlikely that there was such a representation on the facts: I would not consider a newspaper report to be sufficient indication of a position being taken as to the interpretation of Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and forming the basis of a representation.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>As indicated above at [54], such reports may not be entirely accurate.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Importantly, newspaper reports cater to a general audience, omitting nuance in the interest of space. Furthermore, detrimental reliance would also be difficult to make out. The applicant would have had to commit the offence of criminal contempt while relying on the RO’s representation that he would not be disqualified under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) if convicted. However, it is clear from the position taken by the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham (Sentencing)</span> that he believed that he would be disqualified if sentenced to a fine greater than $2,000. It follows that the applicant could not have had the RO’s statements from 1988 in mind while undertaking the conduct leading to his conviction for criminal contempt, and that his estoppel claim is consequently not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I also doubt that estoppel is available as a remedy in the present case. To allow the applicant to invoke the doctrine of estoppel would be to effectively circumvent the disqualification criteria set out in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>). It would also go against the grain of the PEA. Section 90 of the PEA allows for the election of a candidate as a Member of Parliament to be declared void by an Election Judge on various grounds, including the candidate being disqualified from election as a Member of Parliament. This strongly suggests that the disqualification criteria in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is not capable of being derogated from by the RO (or the government for that matter). Such an approach would be consistent with that adopted in Canada, one of the jurisdictions that still retains the doctrine of estoppel against public authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Immeubles Jacques Robitaille inc. v Québec (City)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2014] 1 SCR 784, the Supreme Court of Canada stated (at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the doctrine of estoppel must yield in the public law context to an overriding public interest and may not be invoked to prevent the application of an express legislative provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It follows, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, that the doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked to bind the government to an incorrect interpretation of a constitutional provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 There may also be a question as to whether estoppel should only be put forward under an application under O 53 r 1 of the ROC, rather than in an application for a declaration. However, given my assessment that estoppel cannot be made out, I need not say more at this time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I do note that in <span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng</span><span class="font-italic"> @ Kallang Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority </span>[2014] 1 SLR 1047 (“<span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng</span>”) at [83],<span class="font-italic"> </span>there was some indication that estoppel in judicial review has been subsumed under the doctrine of legitimate expectation. With respect, subject to guidance on this point by the Court of Appeal, I am not convinced yet that this is so:<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>there may be differences in the elements of the two doctrines.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>The doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation was not canvassed by parties before me, but will be addressed for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation has not been firmly established in Singapore. While Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng </span>(at [119]) was of the view that it was part of Singapore law,<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">SGB Starkstrom Pte Ltd v Commissioner for Labour </span>[2016] 3 SLR 598 (at [59]) voiced some concerns about accepting the doctrine, preferring instead to leave the question open for consideration in a future case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In any event, similar issues would arise under substantive legitimate expectation as for estoppel. The following requirements for a claim in the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation were adopted by Tay J in <span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng</span> (at [119])<span class="font-italic"> </span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  The applicant must prove that the statement or representation made by the public authority was unequivocal and unqualified;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  If the statement or representation is open to more than one natural interpretation, the interpretation applied by the public authority will be adopted; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  The presence of a disclaimer or non-reliance clause would cause the statement or representation to be qualified.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The applicant must prove the statement or representation was made by someone with actual or ostensible authority to do so on behalf of the public authority.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The applicant must prove that the statement or representation was made to him or to a class of persons to which he clearly belongs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The applicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the statement or representation in the circumstances of his case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) if the applicant knew that the statement or representation was made in error and chose to capitalise on the error, he will not be entitled to any relief;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) similarly, if he suspected that the statement or representation was made in error and chose not to seek clarification when he could have done so, he will not be entitled to any relief;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) if there is reason and opportunity to make enquiries and the applicant did not, he will not be entitled to any relief.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) The applicant must prove that he did rely on the statement or representation and that he suffered a detriment as a result.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) Even if all the above requirements are met, the court should nevertheless not grant relief if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) giving effect to the statement or representation will result in a breach of the law or the State’s international obligations;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) giving effect to the statement or representation will infringe the accrued rights of some member of the public;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) the public authority can show an overriding national or public interest which justifies the frustration of the applicant’s expectation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As can be observed from Tay J’s formulation of the requirements for a claim in substantive legitimate expectation, the elements of representation and detrimental reliance are not preconditions, but form part of the test to be applied in determining whether relief should be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Here, the applicant’s case ran into the same difficulties as it did in the context of estoppel. The position taken by the RO in 1988 does not by itself show that a representation was made or that there was any settled practice. There was also nothing to show that the applicant had relied on such a representation or settled practice when committing the offence of criminal contempt. Finally, even assuming that the other elements were made out, relief would still not be granted as to do so would result in a breach of Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fundamental rights</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The applicant referred in oral arguments to the litigation in <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>, arguing that it established a right to vote, which would imply a corresponding right to be able to stand for election.  However, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Vellama </span>did not in fact recognise a right to vote in elections as a fundamental right. One issue in <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span> was the interpretation of Art 49, particularly whether it imposed on the Prime Minister a duty to call a by-election to fill casual vacancies of elected Members of Parliament. Further, as argued by the respondent, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v </span><span class="font-italic">AG </span>[2017] 5 SLR 424 at [41]–[43] held that the right to stand for election to the Presidency is not part of the enumerated fundamental rights in Part IV of the Constitution and hence not subject to the generous interpretation afforded to fundamental liberties in <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 710. In the same vein, the right to stand for election as a Member of Parliament cannot be subject to the same interpretive approach afforded to fundamental liberties under Part IV of the Constitution.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Article 9 was briefly referred to in the course of oral arguments. I do not think it assists the applicant. While there have been some academic arguments that Art 9 should be extended to cover “life” in a very broad sense, it is clear from various cases that Art 9 is only concerned with punishment: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2015] 2 SLR 1129 at [13]–[23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Article 12 was not engaged either. The fact that Mr Jufrie Mahmood was treated differently, even if taken at face value, would mean that, based on the present arguments by the respondent, it was done in error of law. The fact that the respondent in the present proceedings adopts a different position from the RO does not amount to deliberate and arbitrary discrimination against the applicant: see <span class="font-italic">Eng Foong Ho</span> <span class="font-italic">v </span><span class="font-italic">AG </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 542 at [30].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position at the committal proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It was not argued by the respondent that the applicant was bound by the position previously taken before Woo J that his conviction for criminal contempt disqualified him under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) (see [4] above).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Decision of the High Court (Aedit Abdullah J):</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome:
<em>
The High Court dismisses the applicant’s application for a declaration
that he is not disqualified from standing for election as a Member of
Parliament under Art 45(1)(e) of the
</em>
<em>
Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Reprint) (“the
Constitution”).
</em>
<em></em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Facts</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 The applicant – Mr Tan Liang Joo John – was found guilty by Woo Bih Li J
of contempt by scandalising the court (referred to as “criminal contempt”)
under s 3(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act
(No 19 of 2016 (“AJPA”) in <em>AG v Wham Kwok Han Jolovan </em>[2018] SGHC
222. A sentence of a $5,000 fine, with 1 weeks’ imprisonment in default,
was imposed on him in <em>AG v Wham Kwok Han Jolovan </em>[2019] SGHC 111
(“<em>Jolovan Wham (Sentencing)</em>”).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 The applicant sought a declaration that he is not disqualified from
standing for election as a Member of Parliament under Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>)
of the Constitution, which states:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>45.</strong>
—(1) Subject to this Article, a person shall not be qualified to be a
Member of Parliament who —
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
...
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(<em>e</em>) has been convicted of an offence by a court of law in
Singapore or Malaysia and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less
than one year or to a fine of not less than $2,000 and has not received a
free pardon:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Provided that where the conviction is by a court of law in Malaysia, the
person shall not be so disqualified unless the offence is also one which,
had it been committed in Singapore, would have been punishable by a court
of law in Singapore;
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 The applicant contended that the term “offence” in Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>)
does not extend to quasi-criminal offences such as criminal contempt.
Alternatively, the government is bound by the position taken in 1988 by the
then Returning Officer, Mr Ong Kok Min (“the RO”). The RO had informed the
Straits Times that the nomination paper of one Mr Jufrie Mahmood, who had
earlier been fined $3,000 for contempt of court, would not be rejected as
the offence was not criminal in nature. The applicant also argued that Art
9 and Art 12 of the Constitution were violated in this case.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Decision of the High Court
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
</p>
<p><em>
The meaning of the term “offence” in Art 45(1)(e) of the Constitution</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 The term “offence” in Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>) of the Constitution covers
quasi-criminal offences such as criminal contempt.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 The Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Cheng Bock v AG </em>[2017] 2 SLR 850 laid
down a three step approach to constitutional interpretation:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
a. First, ascertain possible interpretations of the provision, having
regard to the text of the provision as well as the context of the provision
within the written law as a whole.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
b. Second, ascertain the legislative purpose of the statute.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
c. Third, compare possible interpretations of the text against the purpose
of the statute. An interpretation which furthers the purpose of the written
text is preferred to one which does not.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 Here, the term “offence” is broad enough to cover contempt of court.
There is nothing in the context to show that the term should be limited to
criminal offences and not quasi-criminal offences:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
a. First, the fact that Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>) references a free pardon and
conviction does not mean that only criminal offences are covered by the
term “offence”. Nothing in Art 22P of the Constitution curtails the
constitutional power of the President to pardon for offences, including
criminal contempt (at [<strong>25]–[33]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
b. Second, the fact that the grounds for disqualification in Art 45 might
overlap does not mean that they should be construed as being entirely
distinct and segregated to avoid any tautology or needless duplication (at    <strong>[34]–[35]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
c. Third, the rest of the Constitution contains references to offences
which must be taken to include criminal contempt, such as Art 35(8) (at    <strong>[36]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
d. Fourth, the fact that other statutes use the term “offence” to mean
criminal offences does not control its meaning in the Constitution, since
what is in issue here is whether term extends to a quasi-criminal matter
(at <strong>[37]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
e. Fifth, no ambiguity or risk of disqualification for minor matters arise
from interpreting the term “offence” to include criminal contempt (at    <strong>[38]–[40]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
f. Sixth, there is no level of ambiguity in Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>) that
would attract a strict construction on the disqualification criteria
therein (at <strong>[41]–[44]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 A consideration of the purpose of Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>) does not assist
in respect of the interpretation of the term “offence”. Based on the text
of the provision and the context in which it is found in the Constitution,
the interpretation to be given to the term extends to cover quasi-criminal
offences such as criminal contempt (at <strong>[45]–[51]</strong>).
</p>
<p><em>The prior example of Mr Jufrie Mahmood</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 There were several difficulties with relying on the treatment of Mr
Jufrie Mahmood. The newspaper record only records what was told to the
newspaper by the RO without details on his reasoning. No official record
was tendered, which would provide some assurance against inaccuracies in
reporting. Since the court was concerned with a legal question, the legal
basis underlying the RO’s decision had to be laid bare (at    <strong>[54]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 Even if the RO’s position was accurately reported, this does not mean
that the government remains bound by the position some 31 years later. The
RO’s interpretation cannot be binding on the courts, which are tasked under
the Constitution to interpret the law (at <strong>[56]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 The question is whether the government is bound by the stance taken by
the RO in 1988, such as by estoppel. Here, the newspaper report would not
be sufficient indication of a position being taken on the interpretation of
Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>) and forming the basis of a representation.
Detrimental reliance was also not made out as it is clear from the position
taken by the applicant in <em>Jolovan Wham (Sentencing) </em>that he
believed he would be disqualified if sentenced to a fine greater than
$2,000 (at <strong>[57]–[58]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11 It is also doubtful that estoppel is available as a remedy in the
present case. To allow the applicant to invoke the doctrine of estoppel
would be to effectively circumvent the disqualification criteria set out in
Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>) and go against the grain of the Parliamentary
Elections Act (Cap 218, 2011 Rev Ed), which allows the election of a
candidate as a Member of Parliament to be declared void for being
disqualified from election. These suggest that the disqualification
criteria in Art 45(1)(<em>e</em>) cannot be derogated from by the RO or the
government (at <strong>[59]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12 In the alternative, if the doctrine of estoppel in judicial review were
subsumed under the doctrine of legitimate expectation, the applicant would
still not succeed in his application as he did not satisfy the requirements
set out in <em>Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority </em>
[2014] 1 SLR 1047 (at <strong>[61]–[65]</strong>).
</p>
<p><em>Other arguments</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
13 The applicant argued that the Court of Appeal in    <em>Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v AG</em> [2013] 4 SLR 1 established the right
to vote, which would imply a corresponding right to stand for election.
However, <em>Vellama</em> did not in fact recognise a right to vote in
elections as a fundamental right as it was concerned with whether the Prime
Minister had a duty to call a by-election to fill casual vacancies of
elected Members of Parliament. Further, as the right to stand for election
as a Member of Parliament is not part of the enumerated fundamental rights
in Part IV of the Constitution, it is not subject to the generous
interpretation afforded to fundamental liberties in    <em>Ong Ah Chuan v PP </em>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 710 (at <strong>[66]</strong>
).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
14 Article 9 and Article 12 of the Constitution are not violated. The term
“life” in Art 9 is concerned with punishment and is not interpreted in a
very broad sense. Based on the respondent’s arguments, the fact that it
adopts a different position from the RO also does not amount to deliberate
and arbitrary discrimination against the applicant such as to violate Art
12 (at <strong>[67]–[68]</strong>).

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><em>Conclusion</em></em></p>
