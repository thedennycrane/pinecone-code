        Philip Pillai JC:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the Assistant
                    Registrar’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s application to set aside
                    the defendant’s statutory demand of USD 10,309,708.87 and grant of
                    leave to the defendant to file a bankruptcy application against the plaintiff
                    after the day of that order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appeal was based on rr 98(2)(b) and (e)
                    of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“<em>Bankruptcy Rules</em>”) <em>viz</em> that the statutory demand is disputed on grounds which
                    appear to the court to be substantial or that the court is satisfied on other
                    grounds that the demand ought to be set aside, respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It was common ground that the test to be applied
                    by the court in this determination is the same as the test to be applied for the
                    grant of summary judgment pursuant to Order 14 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, Rev Ed), <em>ie</em> whether or not
                    there are triable issues to go to trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is there a triable issue that the guarantee has been discharged by
                reason of impairment caused by the defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff argued that he was discharged from
                    the joint and several continuing guarantee or that at least there was a genuine
                    triable issue on whether or not he had been discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The threshold for this court is helpfully set
                    out by the Court of Appeal in <em>Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Lim Chor
                        Pee CA</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) at [19] that there is “some
                    real doubt about the question, thus a triable issue, upon which further evidence
                    or arguments [are] required.” In <em>Manjit Kaur Monica v
                        Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2000] SGHC 205, Woo Bih Li JC
                    (as he then was) adopted the formulation in <em>Eyota Pty Ltd v
                        Hanave Pty Ltd</em> (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787-788 by
                    McLelland CJ in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression
                        “genuine dispute” where it occurs in [s 459H of the
                        Corporations Law]. In my opinion that expression connotes a plausible
                        contention requiring investigations, and raises much the same sort of
                        consideration as the “serious question to be tried” criterion
                        which arises on an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the
                        extension or removal of a caveat. This does not mean that the court must
                        accept uncritically as giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in
                        an affidavits “however equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent
                        with undisputed contemporary documents or other statements by the same
                        deponent, or inherently improbable in itself, it may be “sufficient
                            <em>prima facie</em> plaudibility to merit further
                        investigation as to [its] truth” (cf <em>Eng Mee
                            Yong v Letchumann</em> [1980] AC 331 at 341), or “a
                        patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of acts unsupported by
                        evidence”: cf <em>South Australia v Wall</em>
                        (1980) 24 SASR 189 at 194.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       With respect to valid counterclaims, set-off or
                    cross demands, <em>Goh Chin Soon v Overseas-Chinese Banking
                        Corporation Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 17, per Lee Seiu Kin JC (as
                    he then was) is also germane:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rule 98(2)(a) provides that the court shall set aside the [Statutory
                        Demand (the “SD”)] if the debtor appears to have a <em>valid</em> counterclaim, set-off or cross demand which
                        exceeds the amount of the debts in the SD. The word “valid” is
                        placed there for good reason. It requires the court to examine the alleged
                        counterclaim, set-off or cross demand to see if the debtor has a <em>bona fide</em> claim against the creditor that, if
                        successful, would enable him to pay the debt the subject of the statutory
                        demand. If all that rule 98(2)(a) requires were the mere existence of such a
                        claim, no matter how spurious, then it will be only too easy for a debtor to
                        make such a claim in order to stave off bankruptcy proceedings. …
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff cited <em>Bank of
                        Montreal v Wilder</em> [1986] 2 S.C.R. 551 for the
                    proposition that a guarantee is discharged where the creditor impairs the
                    security, increases risk or causes default. The plaintiff referred to the
                    following sequence of events in support of his position that the guarantee had
                    been discharged by impairment caused by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendant granted credit facilities to EP
                    Carriers Pte Ltd on 11 March 2008. In December 2008 following restructuring
                    discussions it was agreed that the credit facilities would be novated to Linford
                    Pte Ltd whilst the security given to support credit facilities, including a
                    mortgage on the vessel “Eagle Prestige” would remain. However, new
                    documents would be signed together with a continuing guarantee
                    (“Guarantee”) provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. On
                    2 December 2008 prior to the completion of the novation and security
                    documents, the vessel “Eagle Prestige” was arrested by TS Lines
                    Ltd and sold by way of judicial sale. The writ of arrest escaped the notice of
                    the defendant which proceeded to complete the novation and security
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was the plaintiff’s case that the sale
                    of the vessel caused him loss and that the defendant ought to have conducted
                    proper searches in connection with perfecting its security, following which they
                    would have discovered the arrest writ. The plaintiff’s argument was that
                    had the defendant discovered the arrest writ, they would not have proceeded with
                    the novation because it would not have met the bank’s preconditions to the
                    novated facilities and security. It was argued that had the defendant not
                    proceeded with the novated facilities and security, EP Carriers Pte Ltd would
                    have remained as borrower and TS Lines Ltd would have stood lower in ranking
                    against the vessel <em>vis-à-vis</em> the defendant’s
                    mortgage over the vessel. As the new mortgage under novation was effected after
                    the <em>in rem</em> writ, but before arrest, it was argued
                    that by this omission, the Guarantee had been impaired. In other words, the
                    plaintiff argued that had the defendant been vigilant in its searches, it would
                    not have proceeded with the novation and security and the defendant could have
                    resisted the arrest and sale or claimed against the sale proceeds. This was
                    because the defendant, under the original security had mortgagor’s
                    priority for the indebtedness far in excess of TS Lines Ltd which arrested the
                    vessel. Accordingly, it was argued that the statutory demand which was founded
                    on the Guarantee had by law been discharged and the statutory demand on which it
                    was founded was substantially disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant replied that the
                    plaintiff’s case was based on the defendant breaching a purported
                    obligation, where the defendant owed no such obligation. Even if the novation
                    had not been carried out, the same guarantors would have been liable for the
                    debt under the previous guarantees. Even if the security was impaired, the
                    impairment was only of the magnitude of USD 1.16m and not for the
                    defendant’s full statutory demand of USD 10,309,708.87. To the
                    plaintiff’s reliance on set offs and counterclaims to the Guarantee, the
                    defendant referred to Clauses 1, 4 and 9 of the Guarantee which expressly
                    excluded the right to raise them on a call on the guarantee: see <em>Bauer v The Bank of Montreal</em> [1980] 2 SCR 102
                    at 108. It was further argued that even if the defendant had taken full priority
                    and proceeded against the vessel, the plaintiff would still have no defence
                    against the claim of USD 10,309,708.87 as there would have remained owing
                    and payable the sum of USD 8m. In any event, TS Line Ltd’s claims had
                    not crystallized and the sale proceeds remained with the sheriff as their claims
                    have been disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It was further the defendant’s position
                    that it was only obliged to set off value of any security which only the
                    guarantors have given. In this case, the relevant security was security provided
                    by third parties. At the time the defendant issued its statutory demand,
                    USD 10,309,708.87 was outstanding and not paid. The defendant had and has
                    since received nothing by way of other security.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In any event, the defendant’s failure to
                    make a search or discover the admiralty writ was not a breach on the part of the
                    defendant. The obligation was placed on the borrower and mortgagor with
                    particular reference to clause 3 of the representations and warranties in
                    the mortgage, that there were no writs pending against the vessel as of
                    22 December 2008 where in fact the admiralty writ had been issued on
                    2 December 2008. Once the vessel had been arrested, clauses 6.2 and 10
                    of the mortgage obliged the borrower to have the vessel released. The defendant
                    submitted that it was disingenuous for the plaintiff, who was a director and
                    controller of the corporate borrowers, not having complied with these
                    obligations, to now argue that the security had been impaired by the
                    defendant’s failure to make a search or discover the admiralty writ which
                    it was not obliged to do. The defendant submitted that accordingly, it had not
                    breached any obligations which would lead to the discharge of the guarantee
                    under the authority of <em>Bank of Montreal v Wilder</em>,
                    above, at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Finally, on the question of whether an
                    excessive demand in the statutory demand compels the conclusion that the
                    statutory demand is defective, it was submitted by the defendant that if the
                    evidence was that the plaintiff could not pay the undisputed sum, nothing could
                    be served by setting aside the statutory demand. This was because the next step
                    is to issue a fresh statutory demand. The pivotal consideration of the court was
                    whether the plaintiff had a defence of the whole amount and not just the
                    USD 1.61m or USD 1.97m claimed by the plaintiff to have been lost in
                    the arrest of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff conceded that there had been no
                    breach by the defendant of an express obligation under the novation agreement
                    and security documents. It was conceded that he bore the heavy burden to
                    establish that the obligation was a term of the guarantee by implied term or a
                    collateral contract or by misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having carefully considered the written and
                    oral submissions and authorities cited I found that no triable issues have been
                    made out which would be sufficient to justify the setting aside of the
                    defendant’s statutory demand. The issues that have been run by the
                    plaintiff were naturally raised in order to avoid the anticipated consequences
                    of an unsatisfied statutory demand, <em>viz</em>,
                    bankruptcy. It did not mean, however, that any defences asserted would
                    necessarily result in the setting aside of the statutory demand. The first
                    threshold was whether these defences raised triable issues. The gist of the
                    argument made before me was that the defendant had caused an impairment of the
                    security by reason of its not having conducted the relevant register searches,
                    which in the first place, it was never contractually expressly obliged to
                    do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Would such impairment have matched or exceeded the statutory
                demand?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Even if I were to have found that a triable
                    issue relating to the impairment of the guarantee exists, the question remains
                    whether the effect of such counterclaim would be to fully meet the statutory
                    demand amount of USD 10,309,708.87.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff submitted that the prejudice
                    suffered by him was the whole claim made by defendant, <em>viz</em>, USD 10,309,708.87 plus the USD 1.61m, which were
                    the sums he was supposed to pay. In the alternative, he submitted that the
                    extent of prejudice was the difference in the value of the vessel for the
                    purpose of novating and the net sale proceeds. The plaintiff then relied on the
                    valuation of the vessel at USD 8.2m in connection with the facility and
                    submitted that the prejudice was the difference between USD 8.2m and
                    S$1,974,492.79 (the net sale proceeds).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I found no merit in those submissions. The
                    plaintiff’s claim would not in my view, in any event, have equalled or
                    exceeded the amount stated in the statutory demand and accordingly this
                    application and appeal was flawed at the outset. There was therefore no
                    justification for this court to exercise its powers under Rule 98(2)(a) of
                    the <em>Bankruptcy Rules</em> (see also <em>Goh Chin Soon and anor v Vickers Capital Ltd</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 977). I would also add, for the purposes of this application,
                    that there was also no justification for this court to exercise its power under
                    Rule 98(2)(e) of the Bankruptcy Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ought a fresh statutory demand be required to be issued in these
                circumstances?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As I have found that even if triable issues
                    were to exist, they would not have extinguished the whole of the statutory
                    demand, the next question was whether the statutory demand was liable to be set
                    aside and the defendant obligated to issue a fresh one. In the circumstances
                    before me, I saw no purpose in requiring the defendant to issue a fresh
                    statutory demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed and the
                    plaintiff was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal to defendant, which was to
                    be agreed or taxed.</p>
