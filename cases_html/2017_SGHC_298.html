The application was based on a Shareholders’ Agreement dated 18 March 2011 (“the SHA”) which Wellness and TWG Tea had signed together with the other two shareholders of TWG Tea, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the second defendant, OSIM International Pte Ltd (“OSIM”) and the third defendant, Paris Investment Pte Ltd (“Paris”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 10 July 2017, I dismissed the application. Wellness has appealed against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Undisputed facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Wellness was established for the purposes of wholesale and/or retail of lifestyle and/or wellness related products. TWG Tea operates Wellness’ tea division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In early 2011, the then-director and chief executive officer (“CEO”) of TWG Tea, Mr Manoj Mohan Murjani (“Manoj”), started negotiations with Mr Ron Sim Chye Hock (“Ron Sim”) regarding an investment by OSIM into TWG Tea. OSIM was then a public company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange; Ron Sim was the CEO, a director and Chairman of OSIM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 18 March 2011, OSIM acquired 35% of the shares in TWG Tea. The other two shareholders, Wellness and Paris, held 54.7% and 10.3% respectively. On the same day, Wellness, OSIM, Paris and TWG Tea signed the SHA. Clause 5.2 of the SHA provides for the composition of TWG Tea’s board of directors, and reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.2</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Composition</span>: The Board shall comprise:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.2.1  two persons appointed by [Paris] and [Wellness]; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.2.2 one person appointed by [OSIM], for so long as [OSIM’s] Shareholding Percentage is not less than 25 per cent. That person shall be Mr Ron Sim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Subsequently, disputes arose between Manoj and Ron Sim. In December 2011, Ron Sim called for a TWG Tea board meeting to review the suitability of Manoj continuing as CEO and if thought appropriate to remove him as CEO. For various reasons, the board meeting was not held.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 14 August 2012, Manoj resigned as CEO of TWG Tea. On 28 September 2012, he also resigned as a director of TWG Tea. Wellness did not appoint anyone to replace Manoj on the board of TWG Tea at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Subsequently, for reasons which I need not go into, OSIM’s shareholding in TWG Tea increased to 45% while Wellness’ and Paris’ shareholdings decreased to 46.3% and 8.7% respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 18 October 2013, OSIM purchased all the shares in Paris. Their combined shareholding in TWG Tea was 53.7%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In November 2013, TWG Tea had a rights issue to raise capital. Wellness did not subscribe to this rights issue. OSIM and Paris together subscribed for the entire rights issue. Consequently, OSIM and Paris, combined, held 69.9% of the shares in TWG Tea while Wellness’ shareholding was diluted to 30.1%. To date, Wellness continues to hold 30.1% of the shares in TWG Tea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In February 2014, Wellness and Manoj commenced a minority oppression action in S 187/2014 against OSIM, Paris and the directors of TWG Tea. On 22 April 2016, I dismissed the claims in S 187/2014 – see <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group Pte Ltd and another v OSIM International Ltd and others</span> [2016] 3 SLR 729. Wellness’ appeal in Civil Appeal No 64 of 2016 was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 25 October 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 For present purposes, the only relevant finding in S 187/2014 is that there is an implied term in the SHA that the majority shareholder(s) (whoever they may be) would be entitled to appoint two directors to the board of TWG Tea, and the minority shareholder(s) in TWG Tea would be entitled to appoint one director so long as they hold at least 25% of the shares in TWG Tea (“the Implied Term”) (at [121(c)]). The Implied Term addressed the situation where Wellness, whether by itself or with Paris, ceased to be the majority shareholder/s in TWG Tea. In the present case, Wellness has ceased to be the majority shareholders and OSIM together with Paris form the majority shareholders. Since Wellness (as the minority shareholder) holds 30.1% of the shares in TWG Tea, it is entitled to appoint one director to the board of TWG Tea.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wellness’ attempts to appoint a director to the Board</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 For some four years, Wellness did not exercise its right to appoint a director to the board of TWG Tea after Manoj resigned on 28 September 2012. On 26 October 2016, Wellness informed TWG Tea that it wished to re-appoint Manoj as a director of TWG Tea, pursuant to cl 5.2 of the SHA and the Implied Term.

It was not also disputed that although described as a right to appoint a director, this right was in effect a right to nominate a person to be appointed as a director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Before me, Wellness conceded that it was not entitled to impose “conditions” in respect of AP Mak’s appointment as director. However, Wellness then argued that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Ancillary Matters were not “conditions”, but merely “requests”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) in any event, the point was moot as the Ancillary Matters were not part of the prayers sought in the present proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Wellness submitted that it was simply seeking an order that AP Mak be appointed as a director of TWG Tea. Wellness argued that since the unacceptability of the Ancillary Matters was the only reason given by the defendants for not appointing AP Mak as a director, the defendants had no other basis to object to AP Mak’s appointment now that the Ancillary Matters did not form part of the orders sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I agreed with the defendants that Wellness had in fact changed its position with respect to the Ancillary Matters. In my view, the Ancillary Matters were clearly intended and conveyed to the defendants as conditions that were attached to AP Mak’s appointment:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In para 7 of the 13 February Letter, Wellness asked TWG Tea to arrange for the appointment of AP Mak “and the [Ancillary Matters] to be formalised as soon as practicable”.

</div> Again, Wellness made no attempt to clarify that it was no longer insisting on the Ancillary Matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The first time that Wellness clarified that it was not insisting on the Ancillary Matters was in its written submissions exchanged with the defendants on 6 July 2017 (two working days before the hearing). It seemed to me that Wellness’ actions were calculated to steal a march on the defendants at the hearing before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The defendants submitted that they had considered the issue of AP Mak’s appointment with the Ancillary Matters as conditions for his appointment. The TWG Tea board refused to appoint AP Mak as the Ancillary Matters were unacceptable. The defendants submitted that they did not have to and did not go further to consider whether AP Mak should be appointed as a director of TWG Tea on the basis that the Ancillary Matters could be disregarded. The defendants submitted that, in the circumstances, they ought to be given an opportunity to reconsider AP Mak’s appointment afresh. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I agreed with the defendants.
