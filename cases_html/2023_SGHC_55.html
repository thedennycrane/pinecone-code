First, the Deceased did not make the nomination himself, and Mr Ng had done so on the Deceased’s behalf. Second, the Deceased did not directly communicate his intention to make this nomination with one of his witnesses, Ms Ng. It was not appropriate for Mr Ng to have been the one to communicate the Deceased’s intention to Ms Ng, given that Mr Ng was the other witness and the spouse of the sole intended beneficiary, and given that there was no reason why Mr Toh could not communicate directly with Ms Ng.

Firstly, it is clear from the evidence that the Deceased could not have intended for his CPF monies to pass to Ms Yee. They had lived their lives essentially as strangers since their divorce. At the time of the Deceased’s passing, Ms Yee and the Deceased had been divorced for over 36 years. Further, Ms Yee had not remained in contact with either the Deceased or Ms Toh for many years. The completeness of her estrangement from the family can be seen from the difficulties that Ms Toh encountered in locating Ms Yee to serve the documents for the present case. Given the lack of any functional relationship between the Deceased and Ms Yee and the long duration of their estrangement, it would be highly unusual for the Deceased to have intended for his CPF monies to pass to Ms Yee upon his death rather than to his only daughter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Indeed, the evidence is strong that the Deceased intended for his CPF monies to pass to Ms Toh upon his death. Firstly, the circumstances outlined above indicate that the Deceased would have intended for his CPF monies to pass to Ms Toh. Secondly, the evidence showed that the Deceased had made active efforts to change his nominee from Ms Yee to Ms Toh, not once, but twice, after he learnt that the first attempt had failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 This intention to nominate Ms Toh to receive his CPF monies was corroborated by his Last Will and Testament, which showed his testamentary intent to bequeath his property absolutely to her as well.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> For the avoidance of doubt, I am not saying that the Deceased’s testamentary intent supersedes the operation of the CPF Act, but merely that when all the evidence is taken together, the Deceased’s testamentary intent is part of the evidence in support of the finding that he intended his CPF monies to go to Ms Toh rather than to Ms Yee. I therefore find that the Deceased had intended for his CPF monies to pass to Ms Toh and had intended to make a new nomination in her favour. He had, in fact, taken steps to give effect to that intention on the two occasions that he attempted to make the online nominations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The nomination was not invalid</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The statutory regime of CPF and CPF nominations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Under s 25(1) of the CPF Act, any CPF member who is at least 16 years of age may nominate person(s) to receive CPF monies payable on the member’s death “by a memorandum executed in such manner as the Board may prescribe”. Rule 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules in turn provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.—(1)  Subject to these Rules, a member may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) by executing a memorandum in electronic form by using the electronic system designated by the Board for that purpose, nominate any person to receive —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) any portion of the amount payable on the member’s death out of the Fund in accordance with section 25(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Act; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) any portion of any designated shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Further, r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules requires that the same nomination be “witnessed or attested to in the manner set out in the relevant form by 2 persons who satisfy the qualifications set out in rule 9”. <span class="font-italic">Per</span> r 9, a person may be a witness or make an attestation in respect of a nomination if the person is an employee of the CPF Board and takes no benefit under the nomination, or if the person does not take any benefit under the nomination, does not lack capacity and has attained 21 years of age.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It is undisputed that the Deceased had attempted to make an electronic nomination in favour of Ms Toh and that Ms Ng would have been a witness who satisfied the qualifications set out in r 9 of the CPF (Nominations) Rules. It is also undisputed that because the Deceased had keyed in the wrong NRIC number under his second witness’s details, he had, therefore, not managed to fulfil the requirement under r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>for his Second Submission to be attested to. The next question, then, is whether the Deceased’s Second Submission should be considered <span class="font-italic">invalid</span> given his non-compliance with r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It seems to me that there are two possible interpretations of the purpose of r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules. On the one hand, it could be a condition precedent to a valid nomination such that, unless all the requirements are met, the nomination would not be valid. On the other hand, compliance with the r 2(2) requirement amounts to evidence that the CPF Board would accept as proving the fact of nomination, such that unless the CPF Board has any grounds to believe otherwise, a nomination that complies fully with the rules would be accepted at face value and the CPF Board would be empowered to pay the deceased’s CPF funds in accordance with that nomination. The issue is which of these two possibilities governs r 2(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The CPF is a statutory creation established pursuant to the CPF Act. The CPF Act is a piece of social legislation, which was first enacted in 1955 to (amongst other social functions) “provide employees in Singapore with a compulsory savings scheme so that they will have some savings when they retire from active work” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (25 July 1973) vol 32 <https: #="" search="" sprs.parl.gov.sg="" topic?reportid="014_19730725_S0002_T0003"> at col 1175 (accessed 16 January 2023) (Ong Pang Boon, Minister for Labour)).</https:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The CPF Act also governs the status and movement of the monies in a member’s CPF accounts (<span class="font-italic">BTB and another v BTD </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1289<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [40]–[41]). During a member’s lifetime, the CPF Act provides for members (and their employers) to make contributions to the CPF and places restrictions on the withdrawal of monies from members’ CPF accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Upon a member’s death, s 24(3A) of the CPF Act deems that monies from a deceased member’s CPF fund do not form part of his or her estate and are not subject to his or her debts:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3A) Subject to subsection (3B), sections 16A, 25A(3), 27N and 57C and any regulations made under section 27Q or 57F, all moneys paid out of the Fund on the death of any member of the Fund are deemed to be impressed with a trust in favour of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the person or persons nominated under section 25(1) by the deceased member, if any; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the person or persons who are entitled to the whole or a share of the moneys payable to the Public Trustee under section 25A(1),</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">but, without affecting the operation of the Estate Duty Act 1929, are deemed not to form part of the deceased member’s estate or to be subject to his or her debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Section 24(3A) of the CPF Act also delineates a deceased member’s CPF monies as being held on a statutory trust in favour for a nominated beneficiary (or the eligible beneficiaries under s 25A(1) of the CPF Act should no nomination have been made). It is trite law that what falls within the ambit of a statutory trust and the obligations of a statutory trustee are matters of statutory interpretation, and the scope and nature of a statutory trust must be ascertained from the context and the public function for the exercise of which the statutory trust is created (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>vol 9(3) (LexisNexis Singapore, 2018) at para 110.445; <span class="font-italic">MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation) and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">others </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">v Vintage Bullion DMCC (in its own capacity and as representative of the customers of the first plaintiff) and another</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">matter</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2015] 4 SLR 831 at [71]).</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Saniah</span><span class="font-italic"> bte Ali and others v Abdullah bin Ali</span> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 555 (“<span class="font-italic">Saniah</span>”), the High Court found that the imposition of a statutory trust over a member’s CPF monies on his or her death is to protect a member’s rights or interest in the fund specifically, by ensuring “that the moneys payable on the death of a member are paid, and ought to be paid, to the person or persons nominated under s 24(1)” and “expressly [keeping] the moneys out of the estate of the member or from being subject to payment of any debt” (at [10]–[11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Against this backdrop, the statutory regime for making CPF nominations (see above at [20]–[21]) serves the complementary purpose of giving effect to a member’s intentions as to where his CPF monies are to go after his death. It provides an instrument through which a member may provide “effective direction” to the CPF Board to pay to his nominee(s) monies out of the Fund on his death while simultaneously “[protecting] the CPF Board from … being embroiled in any dispute with anyone as to who is entitled to receive the member’s moneys in the Fund” (<span class="font-italic">Saniah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]–[12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Indeed,  Parliament has expressed that CPF nominations would serve to expedite the distribution of CPF monies to beneficiaries in accordance with the wishes of members (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (1 February 2021) vol 95 <http: search="" sprs.parl.gov.sg="" sprs3topic?reportid="written-answer-na-7094"> (accessed 16 January 2023) (Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower); <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (4 July 2022) vol 95 <http: search="" sprs.parl.gov.sg="" sprs3topic?reportid="written-answer-10716"> (accessed 16 January 2023) (Tan See Leng, Minister for Manpower)).</http:></http:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Viewed against this backdrop, the purpose of the requirement for attestation under r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules must be aligned with this purpose of protecting members’ monies such that effect can be given to members’ intentions of how their monies should be distributed after death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Interestingly, both the CPF Act and the CPF (Nominations) Rules do not make any provision for the consequences of non-compliance with the requirement for attestation under r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules. In contrast, the Wills Act 1838 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Wills Act”), which lays out in s 6(2) a requirement for the signature of the testator (or some other person in his presence and by his direction) to be witnessed, expressly states at s 6(1) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No will shall be valid unless it is in writing and executed in the manner mentioned in subsection (2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The point I wish to make is this. While the Wills Act expressly states that non-compliance with the required formalities would render a will invalid, s 24(3A) of the CPF Act and the CPF (Nominations) Rules are conspicuously silent on the consequences of non-compliance with the formalities of a CPF nomination. This is not to say that the requirement for attestation of a member’s nomination under s 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules is unimportant. In fact, the SGCA has noted that the main purpose underpinning the rule for attestation of a CPF nomination is, similar to the purpose behind the formalities of wills, to prevent fraud. The act of signing must be seen by others at the same time to ensure confirmation of the authenticity of the member’s signature (<span class="font-italic">Chai</span> at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Where r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules differs from s 6(2) of the Wills Act is hence not in the importance of ensuring that a member or testator’s signature is authentic, but in whether the failure to comply with the formalities of the attestation renders the nomination or will invalid. Some laxity has been afforded <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the attestation of CPF nominations in cases where the breach is minor, and no fraud has been perpetrated (<span class="font-italic">Chai</span> at [49]–[50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">Chai</span>, the deceased had nominated the second respondent, whom she described in her nomination form as her “friend”, to receive all the monies in her CPF account (<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)">at [2</span>]). Upon receiving her nomination form, the board sent the deceased a letter asking if she wished to include her next of kin as nominees. The deceased confirmed that she wished to nominate the second respondent, following which the officer handling her file contacted her to explain the implications of this nomination (at [3]). The deceased’s mother applied to have the deceased’s CPF nomination declared null and void on the basis that the deceased’s signature was not witnessed in the presence of two witnesses (at [4]). Her application was dismissed by the High Court, and she appealed the decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The SGCA found that the evidence was too weak to establish that the deceased had not signed the form in her witnesses’ presence (at [37]–[40]). In any event, as the CPF Board had verified the deceased’s signature and intention in that case, the alleged breach of procedure in this case did not warrant a declaration that the nomination was void, as the CPF Board had “discharged its responsibility in ascertaining and confirming the intentions of [the Deceased], and no fraud had been perpetuated” (at [50]–[51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In summary, the <span class="font-italic">princip</span><span class="font-italic">al </span>aim of ss 24(3A) and 25 of the CPF Act and r 2(2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules is to protect a deceased member’s CPF monies from creditors and beneficiaries of his or her estate in favour of giving effect to the same member’s <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">vivos</span> intention (where expressed) as to whom the beneficiary of these monies should be. This aim comes hand in hand with the <span class="font-italic">administrative</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>function of the same provisions in providing an effective methodology through which these intentions can be communicated by members to the CPF Board, thereby safeguarding both the CPF Board and the members from disputes over the monies after the death of members. The administrative function of ss 24(3A) and 25 of the CPF Act and r  (2) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules is hence geared towards the just distribution of a member’s CPF monies and should not be used to cause injustice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Deceased’s Second Submission was an effective and authentic communication of his directions to the CPF Board</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I have found (at [17]–[19]) that the Deceased had intended for his monies to be passed to Ms Toh upon his death. This would be the intention that the statutory regime of CPF nominations would have sought to give effect in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The next question is whether the procedural irregularity of the Second Submission would have compromised the administrative aim of safeguarding the CPF Board and members from disputes after the passing of members. I do not think this to be the case. The evidence did not suggest any fraud and/or inauthenticity behind the Second Submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The CPF Board had submitted that it was not appropriate for Mr Ng to perform the nomination on the Deceased’s behalf or to communicate the Deceased’s request for Ms Ng to be a witness to her. The CPF Board relied on evidence of the 2 March 2022 communication to establish that the Deceased had not communicated his intention to make his nomination directly with Ms Ng but that Mr Ng had communicated it to Ms Ng instead.

On the evidence available, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Ng’s assistance had compromised the authenticity of the Second Submission or of the Deceased’s intention for his CPF monies to be given to Ms Toh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I therefore find that the Deceased had nominated Ms Toh as the beneficiary of his CPF monies and that such nomination was witnessed by Mr Ng and Ms Ng. On the evidence before me, I hold that the nomination is valid under the CPF Act. However, in the absence of a nomination that complies with the rules, the CPF Board is not obliged to recognise the claims of an alleged beneficiary. Payment made by the CPF Board under a nomination that fully complies with the rules would absolve the CPF Board of any liability in the event of a claim by another person to be the rightful nominee (save where the CPF Board has reason to suspect that the nomination is not valid). But any payment made on a nomination that does not fully comply with the rules will expose the CPF Board to liabilities in the event that such nomination is not valid. The CPF Board is therefore justified to refuse to pay Ms Toh without a court order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Ms Toh applied to this court to make a finding that the Deceased had nominated her as the sole beneficiary to his CPF monies. I have examined the evidence and find that the Deceased had the intention of nominating Ms Toh and had made that nomination which was witnessed by Mr Ng and Ms Ng,  even though it was not compliant with the CPF rules. I therefore declare that the Deceased had nominated Ms Toh as the sole beneficiary of his CPF monies when he made the second attempt at making the online nomination on 30 November 2021 and order the CPF Board to release the CPF monies of the Deceased to her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 By way of a final observation, it is puzzling to me that while a pre-existing nomination would be automatically revoked by marriage under s 25(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF Act and r 7(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF (Nominations) Rules, a divorce would not have the same consequences. This could be a matter for the CPF Board to consider.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With respect to costs, I do not think that the CPF Board should be liable for costs as this application was warranted by the Deceased’s own non-compliance with the nomination process, such that the nominee had to come to court to give effect to the nomination. As formalities were not complied with, the CPF Board was entitled to refuse to recognise the nomination until the court orders otherwise. I also note that the CPF Board’s caution in applying to this court was especially warranted in light of Ms Ng’s 2 March 2022 communication to the CPF Board. I hence make no order as to costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Goh Hui Hua and Tan Jia Jun James (Covenant Chambers LLC) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Teh Ee-von (Infinitus Law Corporation) for the first respondent;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The second respondent absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
