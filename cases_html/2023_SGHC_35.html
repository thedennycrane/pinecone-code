The present case engages the offence under s 377BB(4) PC, which is punishable under s 377BB(7) PC. The appellant was a 24-year-old student in his final year of undergraduate studies at the Nanyang Technological University (“NTU”) when he committed two counts of the offence.

This patchwork of laws, however, did not adequately cover the range of circumstances in which voyeurism offences are committed. Against this backdrop, the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 (Act 15 of 2019) (“CLRA”) introduced s 377BB PC with the view to define the offending behaviour of voyeurism and provide adequate punishments (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (6 May 2019) vol 94 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Section 377BB PC, as introduced by the CLRA, reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Voyeurism</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">377BB.</span>—(1)  Any person (<span class="font-italic">A</span>) shall be guilty of an offence who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) intentionally observes another person (<span class="font-italic">B</span>) doing a private act without <span class="font-italic">B</span>’s consent;

When V1 was waiting for the lift at level 3, the appellant took out his mobile phone with the intention to take an upskirt video of V1. He switched his phone camera on to video mode, squatted down, placed his phone under V1’s dress with the camera aimed up her dress, and recorded an upskirt video despite knowing that V1 did not consent to this.

The appellant noticed that V2 was wearing a skirt and felt the urge to take an upskirt video of her. He then followed V2 from the entrance of the car park to the lift lobby at 306 Canberra Road and stood next to her at that lift lobby. When the lift arrived, he followed V2 into the lift. V2 selected the 12th floor and the appellant selected the 15th floor.

He also found that some measure of specific deterrence was called for in this case as the appellant had reoffended on bail in the Second Incident (GD at [14]). The DJ then held that there was no reason for rehabilitation to displace deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration. The appellant was not a youthful offender, but a sufficiently mature yet recalcitrant offender whose alleged voyeuristic disorder did not cause or contribute to his offending (GD at [15]). The appellant’s rehabilitation efforts also did not displace the need for deterrence since the purported disorder he was being treated for did not cause or contribute to his offending (GD at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Next, the DJ analysed the aggravating factors relating to each incident. In respect of the First Incident, the DJ noted the following factors (GD at [16]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was “an element of stalking, planning and pre-meditation” – the appellant spotted V1 and followed her from level 1 to level 3.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The offence occurred at V1’s place of residence where she had the right to feel safe.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In so offending, the appellant committed criminal trespass which was the subject of the TIC Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The aggravating factors relating to the Second Incident were more severe. They were (GD at [17] and [22]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant reoffended while on police bail.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There was again “an element of stalking, planning and pre-meditation” – he spotted and targeted V2 and followed her from the carpark to her block.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The offence was committed in a lift, even though it was when V2 was about to head out of it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) V2 was distressed and cried when she spoke to her father.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Against these, the DJ considered the following mitigating factors (GD [18]–[19]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant had no antecedents.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellant was genuinely remorseful, as demonstrated by his early plea of guilt and efforts at rehabilitation through multiple sessions with his psychiatrist and psychotherapist. The appellant’s efforts in seeking psychiatric treatment also evinced his desire to change.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The appellant had good family support.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The DJ did not place mitigating weight on the appellant’s alleged voyeuristic disorder since it did not cause or contribute to his offending (GD at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As to the type of punishment, the DJ held that the custodial threshold has been crossed given the need for deterrence and the aggravating factors. He rejected the appellant’s submission for a fine, holding that it would be an inadequate punishment (GD at [20]). Although full weight must be placed on the appellant’s rehabilitation efforts, the DJ found that this did not mean a fine ought to be imposed since the appellant’s purported voyeuristic disorder did not cause or contribute to his offending (GD at [20]), and rehabilitation could continue in prison and even after the appellant was released (GD at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Instead, the DJ placed full weight on the appellant’s rehabilitation efforts by factoring a “substantial sentencing discount” into the imprisonment term (GD at [25]). For the offence arising from the First Incident, the DJ calibrated the starting point of four weeks’ imprisonment to three weeks’ imprisonment on account of the appellant’s remorse, as demonstrated by his plea of guilt and attempts at rehabilitation. As for the offence arising from the Second Incident, the DJ used a starting point of six weeks’ imprisonment but calibrated it downwards to four weeks’ imprisonment after having regard to the mitigating factors and the totality of the sentence (GD at [21]–[22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate sentence of seven weeks’ imprisonment (GD at [23]). The DJ was satisfied that this aggregate sentence was not crushing, and noted that it was much lighter than the sentence meted out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mark Fritz </span><span class="font-italic">Tanel</span> [2022] SGMC 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Mark Fritz </span><span class="font-italic">Tanel</span>”) for a similar offence (GD at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On appeal, the accused sought a non-custodial sentence on the basis that rehabilitation rather than deterrence should be the primary sentencing consideration.

</div> In response to the appellant’s argument, the Prosecution submitted that the fact that an offender has shown a strong rehabilitative potential by voluntarily seeking treatment for his voyeuristic disorder cannot by itself shift the focus from deterrence to rehabilitation. That said, it accepted that the act of seeking treatment can still be considered when calibrating the sentence in so far as it is indicative of the offender’s remorse and rehabilitative potential.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We make three preliminary points. First, the YIC had, for the purpose of determining the relevance of rehabilitation as a sentencing consideration, developed the same analytical approach for youthful offenders, adult offenders with an extremely strong propensity for reform, and offenders who have a mental condition that is causally linked to the offending conduct. For all three categories of offenders, the YIC submitted that there should be a presumption that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, and this presumption may be displaced by the need for deterrence in certain circumstances. We are, however, disinclined to adopt a standardised approach across all three categories. We prefer to think of these categories as factual circumstances in which the court has the difficult yet important task of striking a fine balance between deterrence (as well as retribution and prevention, as the case may be) on the one hand and rehabilitation on the other, where each of these sentencing considerations may very well pull the court towards different sentencing outcomes. The determination of how this balance ought to be struck involves a highly fact-centric inquiry, which is in turn shaped by distinct policy considerations relating to the offender’s personal attribute (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, his youth, extremely strong propensity for reform, or mental condition). A standardised approach should therefore not be adopted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 To put things into further perspective, it is trite that rehabilitation is the presumptive dominant sentencing consideration where youthful offenders are concerned. However, the basis for this is grounded in a retrospective rationale and a prospective rationale, both of which are heavily influenced by the unique policy considerations relating to the youth of the offender. The retrospective rationale justifies giving the youthful offender a second chance by excusing his offending behaviour on the grounds of his youthful folly and inexperience. The prospective rationale justifies rehabilitation as the preferred tool to discourage future offending on the premises that the youthful offender will be more receptive towards a sentencing regime aimed at altering his values and guiding him on the right path, society will stand to benefit considerably from the rehabilitation of the youthful offender who has many potentially productive and constructive years ahead of him, and the youthful offender will appear to suffer disproportionately as compared to adult offenders if typical punitive options were to be imposed: <span class="font-italic">A Karthik v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1289 (“<span class="font-italic">A Karthik</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]. Evidently, these considerations are not directly applicable to an adult offender with an extremely strong propensity for reform, or an offender who has a mental condition that is causally linked to the offending conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Secondly, it is possible for rehabilitation to be the dominant sentencing consideration outside of the three categories identified by the YIC. Much will depend on the interplay of the various sentencing considerations in a given set of facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Thirdly, this judgment will only consider the relevance of rehabilitation as a sentencing consideration for s 377BB(4) PC offences (punishable under s 377BB(7) PC) committed by adult offenders with no mental condition contributing to their offending conduct. We are cautious of adjusting the body of case law concerning the treatment of youthful offenders (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin </span><span class="font-italic">Basri</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 449; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen </span><span class="font-italic">Jie Boaz</span> [2016] 1 SLR 334; <span class="font-italic">A Karthik</span>) when the facts of this case do not concern one. Further, given that the appellant had unequivocally disclaimed any reliance on his alleged voyeuristic disorder, it is not necessary for us to consider the appropriate approach to take where the s 377BB(4) PC offence (punishable under s 377BB(7) PC) is committed by an offender who suffers from a psychiatric condition, such as voyeuristic disorder, that is causally linked to the commission of the offence. We prefer to leave the consideration of this issue to a future case where it directly arises on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We now turn to elaborate on the relevance of rehabilitation as a sentencing consideration for s 377BB(4) PC offences (punishable under s 377BB(7) PC) committed by adult offenders with no mental condition contributing to their offending conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Generally, neither the prospective nor the retrospective rationale set out at [31] above will apply to an adult offender. As such, the starting point is that rehabilitation is not<span class="font-italic"> </span>the presumptive dominant sentencing consideration where an adult offender is concerned: <span class="font-italic">A Karthik</span> at [34] and [44]. That is not to say that rehabilitation can never be the operative sentencing consideration for an adult offender. Where it is shown that the <span class="font-italic">particular </span>adult offender in question has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, rehabilitative sentencing options may still be an effective means of discouraging prospective offending despite the age of the offender. To this extent, the prospective rationale described above is engaged. It is for this reason that the law takes the view that rehabilitation may be the operative sentencing consideration where the particular adult offender in question demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform, provided that the significance of rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration is not displaced by another sentencing consideration such as deterrence: see <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> at [42], [45], [52] and [60]. These principles are well settled in case law and are equally applicable to a s 377BB(4) PC adult offender who is not suffering from any mental condition that is causally connected to the offending conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In this connection, the following three-limbed framework developed in <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> is useful in evaluating whether a s 377BB(4) PC adult offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform (<span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow </span>at [55]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should consider whether the offender has demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offence(s) (“the first limb”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court should consider whether there are conditions in the offender’s life that are conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf (“the second limb”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If, after considering the first two limbs, the court comes to a provisional view that the offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, the court should then consider, in light of the risk factors presented, whether there are reasons to revisit the finding of such a high capacity for reform (“the third limb”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This framework, which weighs the factors in favour of reform against the risk factors that may counteract and so compromise the efficacy of the reformative efforts, provides a systematic approach towards a fact-sensitive inquiry: <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> at [60].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Under the first limb, the court examines the offender’s own resolve to change, as inferred from evidence of the offender’s remorse and the trajectory of his rehabilitative progress between the time of offending and sentencing. The non-exhaustive factors in this regard are (<span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> at [56]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) evidence of genuine remorse;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) taking active steps post-offence to leave errant ways behind;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) compliance with and amenability to rehabilitative measures;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) offender has not reoffended since his offence; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the index offence(s) were “out of character”.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The first of these factors, namely genuine remorse, can be evinced by an early plea of guilt and a full and frank disclosure of criminal activities beyond the offences for which the offender is presently charged, amongst other indicators. As regards the last of these factors, the offender’s hitherto clean record and otherwise unexceptional conduct and temperament can be relevant in showing that the offences in question were likely an aberration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Next, the second limb focuses on whether the offender’s environment presents conditions that are conducive in helping him turn over a new leaf. This may be discerned from the following non-exhaustive factors (<span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> at [57]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) strong familial support;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) availability of a positive external support system (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, from the offender’s romantic partner);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) external sources of motivation for reform; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) availability of positive avenues to channel energy (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, employment).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 If, after considering the first and second limbs, the court comes to a provisional view that the offender has demonstrated a sufficiently strong propensity for reform, the inquiry will shift, at the third limb, to the risk factors that are present in order to determine whether, in all the circumstances, the offender can indeed be said to have an “extremely strong propensity for reform”. Risk factors include the offender’s association with negative peers, or the presence of bad habits such as an offender’s habitual drug use or dependence: <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> at [58].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 If the court is satisfied that the adult s 377BB(4) PC offender concerned demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform after applying the three-limbed <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow </span>framework, it remains to be considered whether it is appropriate in all the circumstances to retain the emphasis on deterrence despite the offender’s extremely strong propensity for reform: <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> at [45], [52] and [60]. Where, for instance, the offence is serious or the harm caused is severe, deterrence may displace rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration even though the adult offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform: see <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow </span>at [52]–[53], citing <span class="font-italic">Boaz Koh </span>at [30] and <span class="font-italic">GCO v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 3 SLR 1402. In this regard, both general and specific deterrence are relevant. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender, whereas specific deterrence seeks to instil in a particular offender the fear of reoffending through the potential threat of re-experiencing the same sanction previously imposed: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v</span> <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span>”) at [21] and [24]. General deterrence assumes significance for certain types of offences (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, offences affecting public safety and offences against vulnerable victims) and where the circumstances of the offence demands so (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the offence is prevalent or causes public disquiet): <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> at [24]–[25]. In particular, it is appropriate to place emphasis on general and specific deterrence where the crime is premeditated because deterrence works best where there is a conscious choice to commit crimes: <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> at [22].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This inquiry mentioned at [40] above is an important one which balances the s 377BB(4) PC <span class="font-italic">offender</span>’s extremely strong propensity for reform against aspects of the s 377BB(4) PC <span class="font-italic">offence </span>which point towards the need for general and specific deterrence. Whilst the offender’s extremely strong propensity for reform may signal a shift to a focus on rehabilitation at first instance, this may still give way to society’s need for general and specific deterrence in light of offence-related considerations. This balancing exercise is a highly nuanced one that will turn on the facts of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Nevertheless, for the reasons ably articulated by the YIC, we take the view that deterrence is <span class="font-italic">generally</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the dominant sentencing consideration for this offence, and it would <span class="font-italic">rarely</span> be the case that emphasis would shift away from deterrence to rehabilitation even where the s 377BB(4) PC adult offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform. We elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 First, in every case, the impact of a s 377BB(4) PC offence extends beyond the particular victim concerned because it offends the sensibilities of the general public and triggers unease. Bearing in mind that the offence entails the operation of an equipment with the intention of observing the victim’s <span class="font-italic">private region</span> in circumstances where that region <span class="font-italic">would not otherwise be visible</span> and where the victim <span class="font-italic">did not</span> give his or her <span class="font-italic">consent</span>, it goes without saying that the commission of a s 377BB(4) PC offence involves an appalling attempt to invade the victim’s privacy. At its core, a s 377BB(4) PC offence is an affront of our society’s fundamental value that no woman or man should have to suffer the indignity of having his or her modesty outraged or insulted (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 March 2021) vol 94 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs);

</div> Adding to the public disquiet occasioned by the transgression of our society’s fundamental belief, the discovery of a surreptitiously committed s 377BB(4) PC offence also affects the extent to which members of the public feel safe as they go about their daily life. This is the case regardless of whether the offence was committed in a private location, such as the victim’s own home, or a public location, such as an escalator in a shopping mall. In light of these consequences, it behoves the sentencing court to send a stern and unequivocal signal, on behalf of society, that s 377BB(4) PC offences will not be tolerated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Second, a deterrent sentence would usually be warranted as s 377BB(4) PC offences often inflict significant emotional harm on the victim. The archetypal situation envisaged by s 377BB(4) PC is one where the offender had attempted to make a record of the victim’s image but was caught before any recording could be made (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a failed recording situation). This can be gleaned from the fact that ss 377BB(4) and 377BB(5) PC cover substantially the same act, save for the fact that the recording of the victim’s image is an ingredient of the s 377BB(5) PC offence whereas a s 377BB(4) PC offence is made out <span class="font-italic">regardless of whether the victim’s image was recorded</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Mark Fritz </span><span class="font-italic">Tanel</span>, for example, the s 377BB(4) PC offender bent down to take an upskirt video of the victim on the escalator but was caught by the victim before he could record a video (at [6]–[7]).

</div> In a failed recording situation such as in <span class="font-italic">Mark Fritz </span><span class="font-italic">Tanel</span>, the victim would more often than not be aware that he or she had been a victim of voyeurism and would, as a result, suffer significant emotional distress. Such harm brings both general and specific deterrence to the fore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Even where the s 377BB(4) PC offender had surreptitiously captured a record of the victim’s image without the victim’s knowledge, there remains a danger of considerable emotional harm being inflicted upon the victim post-offence given the ease with which such material can be disseminated through the Internet. The degree of emotional harm that could potentially be caused would be aggravated if the victim was identifiable from the record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Third, as the s 377BB(4) PC offence entails the operation of an equipment with the intention to observe the victim’s <span class="font-italic">otherwise not visible </span>private region <span class="font-italic">without the victim’s consent</span>, the commission of the offence generally involves a degree of furtiveness, planning and premeditation on the part of the offender. This is yet another feature of the offence which warrants the imposition of deterrent sentences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Fourth, the need to censure s 377BB(4) PC with deterrent sentences is augmented by the increasing prevalence of voyeurism offences, a trend noted by the Minister of Home Affairs during the Second Reading of the Criminal Law Reform Bill which introduced s 377BB PC (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (6 May 2019) vol 94 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs)).

</div> The rise in the number of voyeurism offences is in part attributable to technological advancements that have facilitated the ease with which such offences can be stealthily committed. For instance, the production of cameras and lenses which are small enough to be placed discreetly below women’s dresses and skirts has made it much easier for a s 377BB(4) PC offender to observe the victim’s private parts without being caught. In these circumstances, the imposition of stiff sentences would be both timely and necessary in curbing the rising number of voyeurism offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Finally, keeping the emphasis on deterrence in <span class="font-italic">most </span>s 377BB(4) PC cases, even where the adult offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, accords with Parliament’s intention to place deterrence at the fore for such offences. The clearest indication of this intention is s 377BB(7) PC, which provides for a maximum imprisonment term of <span class="font-italic">two years</span>. This is double the maximum imprisonment term under s 509 PC, the earlier provision criminalising the insult of modesty of a women and under which voyeurism offences were previously prosecuted prior to the introduction of s 377BB PC. Although Parliament has recognised that an adult offender’s strong propensity for reform may justify placing rehabilitation as the primary sentencing consideration, it has indicated in <span class="font-italic">no uncertain terms</span> that the <span class="font-italic">general </span>sentencing position in respect of adult offenders who commit sexual offences, including voyeurism, is to prioritise deterrence over rehabilitation, and that only <span class="font-italic">exceptional circumstances</span> may justify deviation from this general position (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 March 2021) vol 94 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs)):

</div>
</div> Recording “down-blouse” pictures and videos of victims in public areas is yet another typical instance of voyeurism. Moreover, as technology gradually advances, it is likely that the typical manifestations of voyeurism offences will incrementally diversify. The <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> framework, which provides for a methodical evaluation of offender-specific and offence-specific factors without overemphasising any particular factor, is particularly apt for voyeurism offences such as s 377BB(4) PC, as it assists the sentencing court in systematically navigating the broad range of common situations in which the offence may manifest whilst giving the sentencing court sufficient latitude to respond to the distinctive features of a particular case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 We now turn to compare the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework against the sentencing bands approach proposed by the appellant. The sentencing bands approach is not too far apart from the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> framework. Both involve the selection of an indicative sentencing range in view of the offence-specific factors, followed by the identification of a precise sentence having regard to offender-specific factors. However, there are significant differences between the two which lead us to the view that the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> framework is to be preferred in so far as s 377BB(4) PC offences punishable under s 377BB(7) PC are concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, unlike the sentencing bands approach, the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework categorises the offence-specific factors into those relevant to the level of harm caused by the offence and those relevant to the level of the offender’s culpability. By requiring the sentencing court to reason along the lines of harm and culpability respectively, the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> framework facilitates a clearer and more systematic evaluation of the seriousness of an offence, and this in turn promotes the development of consistent and coherent sentencing precedents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Second, the three-by-three matrix in the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework breaks down the overall sentencing range prescribed by legislation into five distinct indicative sentencing ranges, whereas the sentencing bands approach breaks down the same overall sentencing range prescribed by legislation into three distinct indicative sentencing ranges. As such, for the same offence, each indicative sentencing range in the sentencing bands approach will be broader than each indicative sentencing range under the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> framework. Generally, narrower indicative sentencing ranges promote consistency in methodology whereas broader indicative sentencing ranges potentially heighten the risk of inconsistency. Thus, broader indicative sentencing ranges should only be used when necessary, such as where the offence in question manifests itself in a “broader than usual spectrum” of factual circumstances and greater flexibility is required to calibrate the precise sentencing accordingly: see <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2022] SGHC 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span>”) at [99].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In light of these differences, the choice between the two forms of sentencing framework turns on whether the offence-specific factors of the offence in question lend themselves to being categorised by reference to harm and culpability, and whether the circumstances in which the offence manifests are so diverse that there is a greater need for flexibility in sentencing. Both these considerations lead us to the view that the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework is to be preferred in so far as s 377BB(4) PC offences punishable under s 377BB(7) PC are concerned. As will be seen, the offence-specific factors of this offence can be meaningfully categorised into harm and culpability respectively. The circumstances in which this offence presents itself are also relatively circumscribed even though they cover a wide variety of typical presentations. Each sub-section from ss 377BB(1) to (6) PC, including s 377BB(4) PC, covers a specific set of circumstances in which the act of voyeurism can be committed (see above at [6]). Since s 377BB(4) PC covers a range of factual situations which engage offence-specific factors amenable to being categorised into harm and culpability respectively, the sentencing framework for s 377BB(4) PC offences punishable under s 377BB(7) PC should be modelled using the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> framework instead of the sentencing bands approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Finally, we observe that the YIC had rightly refrained from pressing for her proposed sentencing framework during the oral hearing. In our view, this proposed sentencing framework, which takes the form of a decision tree, is likely to be difficult for sentencing courts to apply. Further, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, the YIC’s proposed sentencing framework does not expressly account for the full breadth of the custodial term prescribed under s 377BB(7) PC.

</div>
</div> Ideally, to give effect to the full range of possible sentences intended by Parliament, the prescribed sentencing framework should take into account the whole range of penalties prescribed so that sentencing courts can determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within that range and avoid meting out sentences which are arbitrarily clustered in a particular segment of the full range: see <span class="font-italic">Ong Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Eng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 776 at [24]; <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 3 SLR 606 (“<span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span>”) at [79].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicability to other offence-creating provisions under s 377BB PC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Given the facts of this case, the sentencing framework in this judgment only concerns s 377BB(4) PC offences punishable under s 377BB(7) PC. Though we see no reason why the same sentencing framework should not apply to the other offences in ss 377BB(1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) PC should they also be punishable under s 377BB(7) PC, we prefer to leave this point to be considered in an appropriate future case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We now turn to set out the two-stage, five-step sentencing framework applicable to the offence under s 377BB(4) punishable under s 377BB(7) PC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 1: Offence-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 At the first step, the court has to consider the offence-specific factors and identify the level of harm caused by the offence as well as the level of the offender’s culpability (<span class="font-italic">Logachev</span> at [76]). In this regard, we are generally in agreement with the list of non-exhaustive factors proposed by the Prosecution and YIC but have structured the harm factors in a different manner.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Harm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The harm caused by a s 377BB(4) PC offence can be categorised into three types, and each type may arise only under certain circumstances:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Invasion of the victim’s privacy, in cases where there was unwanted observation of the victim’s private region, or the retention or dissemination of a record of the victim’s image.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Violation of the victim’s bodily integrity, in cases where the offender made physical contact with the victim in the course of committing the s 377BB(4) PC offence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Humiliation, alarm or distress, in cases where the victim was made aware of the offending conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 We have organised the concept of harm into these categories to stress that the victim’s lack of knowledge of having been subjected to a s 377BB(4) PC offence does not necessarily mean that no harm was caused – whilst such a victim would not have <span class="font-italic">subjectively </span>suffered emotional harm, harm in the form of a loss of privacy, the degree of which is to be determined by reference to <span class="font-italic">objective </span>indicia (see below at [67]–[71]), might still result from the offence. On the flipside, if the victim was aware of the offending conduct, the humiliation, alarm or distress suffered would be affected, in part, by the extent to which his or her privacy was invaded. Bearing in mind the rule against double counting, the court should only take into account the emotional harm subjectively experienced by the victim in so far as it exceeds that which is objectively inferred from the extent of the invasion of privacy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Invasion of the victim’s privacy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 We begin with the first type of harm, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the invasion of the victim’s privacy. Harm in the form of actual or potential invasions of privacy may arise where the offender observes the victim, retains a record of the victim’s image or disseminates a record of the victim’s image. We will elaborate on each of these in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, the more intrusive the observation, the greater the actual loss of privacy. The intrusiveness of the observation is in turn a function of several objective factors, such as the extent of the body parts under observation, how exposed those body parts were, the duration of observation and the number of other persons who were enabled by the offender to observe the victim’s private regions. The last of these factors concerns persons who observed the victim’s private regions <span class="font-italic">while the offence was being committed</span>, as opposed to persons who viewed a record of the victim’s image following the offender’s <span class="font-italic">post-offence</span> <span class="font-italic">dissemination</span> of the same. The latter will be addressed at [71] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Second, the offender’s retention of a record of the victim’s image gives rise to the potential for repeated invasions of the victim’s privacy long after the s 377BB(4) PC offence had taken place – the offender is able to view the record repeatedly for his or her own perverted pleasure, allow others to view the same on his or her device, and even circulate it to others through the Internet. This potential harm is further amplified if the victim is identifiable from the record (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the photo or video reveals the victim’s face).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Where the offender had made a record of the victim’s image but subsequently deleted it, the potential for harm might be curtailed. That said, actual harm might have already been caused to the victim post-offence if the offender had viewed or circulated the record prior to its deletion. We add that the offender’s act of deletion may not have mitigating value, and may even be an aggravating factor, depending on the offender’s motivation for deleting the record. If, for instance, the act of deletion was an attempt to destroy evidence, the deletion would be an aggravating factor going towards the offender’s culpability. However, if the deletion was a result of the offender realising the reprehensibility of his actions, the deletion may be indicative of the offender’s remorse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Third, where the offender not only retained a record of the victim’s image but disseminated it, the act of dissemination represents a significant incursion into the victim’s privacy over and above observing and recording the victim. If, however, the offender is already facing a separate proceeded charge under s 377BE(1) PC for distributing an intimate image or recording of the victim, the same act of distribution cannot be regarded as an aggravating factor for the s 377BB(4) PC offence in the light of the rule against double counting: Kow Keng Siong, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 08.082. In cases where the s 377BE(1) PC charge is stood down, the courts may consider the act of distribution either as an aggravating factor for the sentencing of the s 377BB(4) offence, or take into consideration the s 377BE(1) PC charge for the purpose of sentencing. Where the act of dissemination can be properly regarded as an aggravating factor for the s 377BB(4) PC offence, the extent of the invasion of privacy arising from the dissemination can be evaluated by reference to the objective indicia set out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v</span><span class="font-italic"> GED </span>[2022] SGHC 301 (“<span class="font-italic">GED</span>”) at [51]–[53], such as how widely the record was distributed, whether it was distributed to certain recipients known to the victim, and the degree of identifiability of the victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 We note that the s 377BB(4) PC offence may be committed even in circumstances where the offender had not observed, recorded or disseminated recordings of the victim. Though there would be an absence of the aforementioned harm in such cases, the intrusiveness of the offender’s <span class="font-italic">intended </span>observation of the victim (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether the offender intended to observe a fully nude or partially dressed victim), and whether the offender <span class="font-italic">intended</span> to record or disseminate a record of the victim’s image, may be relevant in evaluating the culpability of the offender. All other things being equal, an offender who intended to record the victim (but failed to do so) is more culpable than an offender who merely intended to observe the victim, given that the retention of such a record harbours the potential for prolonged incursions into the victim’s privacy long after the offending conduct had taken place. For completeness, we add that the offender’s omission to record or disseminate such recording should not be accorded mitigatory weight as the absence of an aggravating factor cannot, as a matter of logic, be called in aid as a mitigating factor: see <span class="font-italic">Edwin s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1139 at [24].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether physical contact was made with the victim</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Next, the victim’s bodily integrity may be violated where the offender made unwanted physical contact with the victim whilst committing the s 377BB(4) PC offence. This may happen, for instance, where the offender accidentally bumped the victim on the back of her knee while using a device to take an “up-skirt” photo or video. The offender will be placed higher up on the spectrum of harm if, for example, he or she made prolonged physical contact with the victim’s private parts or visited violence upon the victim in the course of committing the s 377BB(4) PC offence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Whether humiliation, alarm or distress was caused to the victim</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Victims of s 377BB(4) PC offences may suffer emotional harm contemporaneous to the offence as well as subsequent psychological harm (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, post-traumatic stress disorder). The existence and extent of the emotional harm suffered may either be disclosed by the victim or inferred from the circumstances and may, in appropriate cases, need to be corroborated by evidence (including expert evidence). In particular, where it is alleged that the victim had developed conditions such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the offending conduct, such allegations should be supported with evidence in the form of victim impact statements and medical reports: see <span class="font-italic">GED</span> at [56].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Generally, the subjective emotional trauma experienced by the victim would be contingent on the extent to which the victim’s privacy was invaded and other victim-specific factors such as the vulnerability of the victim, which may be a relevant consideration where the victim is relatively young, has pre-existing mental conditions or has a relationship with the offender that renders the victim susceptible to being manipulated or taken advantage of. Where the victim was made aware of the offending act and the objective indicia at [67]–[71] above have been accounted for in the evaluation of the extent of the invasion of privacy, the court must avoid double counting the same factors when assessing the subjective emotional harm experienced by the victim, and only take into account the emotional harm suffered in so far as it exceeds that which is objectively inferred from the extent of the invasion of privacy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Culpability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The factors going towards culpability are as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the offender actually knew, or merely had reason to believe, that the victim had not consented to be observed;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) degree of premeditation and planning;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) stalking or following victim;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) type and sophistication of equipment used and whether it was concealed;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) breach of relationship of trust with the victim;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) steps taken to evade detection;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) motivation for the offence; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(h) persistence of the offending conduct that is the subject of the charge.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">When evaluating the offender’s level of culpability, the sentencing court must guard against the risk of double counting. For instance, the assessment of the degree of pre-meditation should exclude factors relating to the use of equipment if considerations relating to the type and sophistication of the equipment used, as well as whether it was concealed, are also taken into account as standalone factors going toward culpability. With this in mind, we now turn to elaborate on a few of these factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As regards the factor at [76(a)] above, an offender who had <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge</span> that the victim did not consent to the offending conduct and an offender who merely <span class="font-italic">had reason to believe</span> that the victim had not consented to the offending conduct would both be caught by s 377BB(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) PC. However, the culpability of the former would be higher. As explained by this court in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [74]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That said, I recognise the logical force of the appellant’s arguments that there is a distinction in culpability between an offender who knows that he is facilitating the retention or control of another person’s benefits of criminal conduct, as compared to someone only having reasonable grounds to believe that they are such. After all, as <span class="font-italic">Ang Jeanette</span> makes clear, a person having “reasonable grounds to believe” essentially has a “lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Jeanette</span> at [70], whereas a person having actual knowledge is either certain or almost certain of the fact: <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kiam Peng v PP</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [103]. It is therefore right for a court to recognise the distinction in culpability in sentencing, but only as a factor in the round.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In relation to the factor at [76(d)] above, the operation of equipment with recording capability (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a mobile phone with an in-built camera) is strongly indicative of the offender’s intent to make a record of the victim. This, as noted earlier at [72] above, is a factor raising the culpability of the offender in situations where the offender intended to make a record of the victim’s image but had not in fact done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Turning now to the factor at [76(e)], a breach of a relationship of trust may arise where the offender and the victim are husband and wife (or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>) (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GEZ</span> [2022] SGMC 59 at [104]),

The offender’s culpability may be higher in instances where, for example, the s 377BB(4) PC offence was committed out of spite or for the purpose of commercial exploitation. The case of <span class="font-italic">Prasanth s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Mogan </span>[2022] SGDC 209<span class="font-italic"> </span>is one instance in which the s 377BB(4) PC offence was committed out of malice.

In our judgment, the offences which involve either high harm or high culpability, as well as the offences on the more egregious end of the moderate harm-moderate culpability scale, may undermine social safety to such an extent that necessitates the extremely strong deterrent effect which is secured through the imposition of caning: see <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span> at para 29.008. Caning will be further warranted if the moderate to high harm in a particular case flows from an act of violence against the victim, in which case the additional sentencing objective of retribution is engaged: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BDB</span> [2018] 1 SLR 127 at [76];

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Nevertheless, notwithstanding that the offender had not profited from his offending conduct, it may be appropriate to impose fines without an accompanying imprisonment term provided that the offence lies at the less severe end of the low harm-low culpability spectrum. The level of deterrence warranted by such an offence may not justify a custodial sentence and may be sufficiently met with the imposition of a fine. That said, we are of the view that s 377BB(4) PC cases will typically cross the custodial threshold given the intrinsic seriousness of the offence (see above at [43]–[46]), and we stress that it will only be in the less severe of the low harm-low culpability cases that a fine may sufficiently advance the sentencing objective of deterrence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 4: Offender-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 At the fourth step of the sentencing framework, the court must adjust the starting point sentence having regard to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors.

Further, when considering the totality principle, the sentencing court must ensure that the total term of imprisonment for sentences that are ordered to run consecutively exceeds the term of imprisonment that is imposed for the highest individual sentence: <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [77].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Where the aggregate sentence is considered excessive upon the application of the totality principle, the sentencing judge may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences: <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [59]; <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span> at [73]. Conversely, if the overall sentence would otherwise be inadequate in reflecting the offender’s overall criminality, the court can order more sentences to run consecutively or make upward adjustments to the individual sentences: <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [80]; see also <span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 4 SLR 838 at [20]. We add that when choosing which of the multiple sentences of imprisonment should run consecutively, the sentencing judge must guard against double counting and refrain from choosing a combination of longer sentences on account of aggravating factors that were already considered when calibrating the sentences for each individual offence: <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [79].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision on the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The dominant sentencing principle in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The first factual issue that arises for our consideration is whether the DJ erred in finding that deterrence, instead of rehabilitation, should be the dominant sentencing principle. As we have reiterated above, it would take an exceptional case to warrant a shift of emphasis from deterrence to rehabilitation. In our judgment, this case does not come close to being such an exceptional case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In the first place, we are not persuaded that the appellant had displayed an <span class="font-italic">extremely strong</span> propensity for reform under the three-limbed framework in <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> such as to take him out of the space where deterrence is the key consideration. The first limb requires a consideration of whether the appellant has demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offences. In this regard, we note that the appellant had reoffended while on bail for the first offence. Though he subsequently took active steps to address his voyeuristic urges by regularly attending psychiatric reviews and psychotherapy sessions after the second offence, we are particularly troubled by the fact that he fought hard to prove that that his offence was a result of a voyeuristic disorder, only to drop it on the day of the Newton hearing (see above at [14]). This, in our view, is an attempt to evade the due consequences under the law and suggests the appellant’s lack of willingness to accept responsibility for what he did. On balance, we find that the appellant has only demonstrated only <span class="font-italic">some</span> positive desire to change, as evinced by his efforts to seek psychiatric help. At the second limb of the <span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Siow</span> framework, we accept that there are no evidently strong risk factors, and the appellant may have a positive external support system from his family and romantic partner. Nevertheless, given our view under the first limb, we do not take the view that the appellant has demonstrated an <span class="font-italic">extremely strong</span> propensity for reform, though we are willing to accept that the appellant has shown <span class="font-italic">some</span> propensity for reform.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In any event, even if the appellant had displayed an extremely strong propensity for reform, the emphasis would remain on deterrence for the reasons set out at [43]–[48] above, as well as the specific circumstances of the present case. In particular, the need for deterrence is buttressed by the fact that the second offence was committed against a relatively vulnerable victim, who experienced considerable distress upon catching the appellant red-handed, and the fact that both offences involved an element of premeditation as the appellant had stalked his victims for a short while before committing the offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 If it were proven that the appellant had suffered from voyeuristic disorder at the time of the offences, and that disorder contributed to his offending conduct, we might have taken a different view on the appellant’s propensity for reform and the dominant sentencing consideration at play. However, we say no more on this point given that the appellant is no longer alleging that he suffered from voyeuristic disorder at the time of his offending.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sentence in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 We now turn to consider whether the DJ erred in imposing a seven weeks’ imprisonment term. As a preliminary point, the sentence imposed by the DJ may be set aside even if it is not manifestly excessive or inadequate, as the introduction of a new sentencing framework warrants a re-evaluation of the sentence in principle: <span class="font-italic">GED </span>at [119], citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Manta Equipment (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2022] SGHC 157 at [48].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In our judgment, both offences committed by the appellant are in the low harm category. Although the appellant invaded the victims’ privacy by observing and recording videos of them, the degree of the invasion of privacy is limited – the appellant observed only the victims’ covered genitals for a brief period of time, and the video recordings were deleted shortly after the offences were committed. There is no indication that the appellant had viewed or disseminated the videos prior to deleting them. While both offences are in the low harm category, the harm caused by the second offence is higher for two reasons. First, the appellant touched V2’s thigh but did not make any physical contact with V1. Second, V2 was considerably more traumatised, as can be gathered from the fact that she called her father and cried shortly after she caught the appellant in the act. In our view, V2’s relative youth had exacerbated the level of distress she experienced from the invasion of privacy and the violation of her bodily integrity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Next, we take the view that the appellant’s culpability for both offences falls within the low category. Though the appellant followed both victims, an act which suggests a degree of determination, the appellant only did so for a brief duration leading up to the commission of the offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As both offences involve low harm and low culpability, the applicable indicative sentencing range is a fine or up to four months’ imprisonment. The offence-specific factors considered above lead us to the view that a starting point of three weeks’ and four weeks’ imprisonment for the first and second offences respectively would be appropriate. The circumstances of both offences are such that the custodial threshold is crossed, and there is nothing about the case that suggests that the interests of deterrence would be adequately met by the imposition of a fine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 We now turn to adjust these starting points with reference to offender-specific factors, starting with the first offence. After taking into account the TIC Charge, and balancing that against the appellant’s guilty plea, cooperation with authorities (the NTU investigation officer and the police), as well as the fact that the appellant has demonstrated some (though not extremely strong) propensity for reform, we calibrate the starting point of three weeks’ imprisonment to one week’s imprisonment. The first offence is a fairly standard iteration of the offence, and we therefore think that an imprisonment term of one week would be appropriate in all the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The sentencing discount for the second offence, however, will be much less given that the appellant had the audacity to reoffend on bail slightly more than four months after he was arrested for his first offence. As the appellant is no longer relying on his alleged voyeuristic disorder in his mitigation, the appellant must be treated as a normal 24-year-old adult who retained the mental ability and capacity to control himself at the time of the offences. The fact that he <span class="font-italic">chose not to exercise self-control</span> and <span class="font-italic">reoffend while on police bail</span> speaks volumes about the appellant’s lack of remorse and blatant disregard of the law. Taking these alongside the appellant’s guilty plea, cooperation with authorities and his prospect for reform, a slight downward calibration from four to three weeks’ imprisonment would be justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Both sentences should run consecutively for an aggregate term of four weeks’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 For completeness, we add that it is unclear whether the appellant’s deletion of the videos shortly after both offences were motivated by his sense of guilt or remorse, or constituted an attempt to destroy evidence because both victims were alerted to his wrongdoing. In these circumstances, the appellant’s deletion of the videos is at best a neutral factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 We accordingly set aside the sentences that were imposed by the DJ and substituted in their place a sentence of one week and three weeks’ imprisonment respectively, for an aggregate imprisonment of four weeks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Finally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to the YIC, Ms Li, for her thorough research and comprehensive submissions on the legal issues raised in this appeal.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sundaresh Menon<br/>Chief Justice</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><br/></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Quek Mong Hua and Wong Wai Keong Anthony (Huang Weiqiang) (Lee &amp; Lee) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Deputy Attorney-General Tai Wei Shyong, Stephanie Koh and Seah Ee Wei (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eden Li Yiling (WongPartnership LLP) as the Young Independent Counsel. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

He pleaded guilty to the two charges. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The District Judge sentenced him to seven weeks’ imprisonment, consisting of three weeks’ and four weeks’ imprisonment respectively, with the sentences to run consecutively. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed by the DJ, the appellant filed the present appeal. On appeal, he sought a non-custodial sentence on the basis that rehabilitation rather than deterrence should be the primary sentencing consideration. The appellant asserted that he had an extremely strong propensity for reform as evinced by the active steps he took post-offence to seek psychiatric intervention.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appellate court’s grounds of decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Court held that the offences committed by the appellant were in the low harm-low culpability category: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[98]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 In arriving at the assessment that the offences fell within the low harm category, the Court reasoned that although the appellant invaded the victims’ privacy by observing and recording videos of them, the degree of the invasion of privacy is limited – the appellant observed only the victims’ covered genitals for a brief period of time, and the video recordings were deleted shortly after the offences were committed. However, the harm caused by the second offence is higher for two reasons. First, the appellant touched the second victim’s thigh but did not make any physical contact with the first victim. Further, the second victim was considerably more traumatised, as can be gathered from the fact that she called her father and cried shortly after she caught the appellant in the act. The second victim’s relative youth had exacerbated the level of distress she experienced from the invasion of privacy and the violation of her bodily integrity: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[96]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The Court assessed that the appellant’s culpability for both offences fell within the low category. Though the appellant followed both victims, an act which suggests a degree of determination, the appellant only did so for a brief duration leading up to the commission of the offences: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[97]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 As both offences involve low harm and low culpability, the applicable indicative sentencing range is fine or up to four months’ imprisonment. Considering the offence-specific factors, a starting point of three weeks’ and four weeks’ imprisonment for the first and second offences respectively would be appropriate. The circumstances of both offences are such that the custodial threshold is crossed, and nothing suggests that the interests of deterrence would be adequately met by the imposition of a fine: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[98]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Adjusting the starting points with reference to offender-specific factors such as taking into account the trespass charge which was taken into consideration, and balancing that against the appellant’s guilty plea, cooperation with authorities as well as his propensity for reform, the Court calibrated the starting point of three weeks’ imprisonment to one week’s imprisonment for the first offence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[99]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The sentencing discount for the second offence, however, will be much less given that the appellant re-offended on bail slightly more than four months after he was arrested for his first offence.

The offence-specific factors going toward harm are: (a) the invasion of the victim’s privacy, in cases where there was unwanted observation of the victim’s private region, or the retention or dissemination of a record of the victim’s image; (b) violation of the victim’s bodily integrity, in cases where the offender made physical contact with the victim in the course of committing the s 377BB(4) PC offence; and (c) humiliation, alarm or distress, in cases where the victim was made aware of the offending conduct: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[65]</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">to</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">[75]. </span>The offence-specific factors going toward culpability are: (a) whether the offender actually knew, or merely had reason to believe, that the victim had not consented to be observed; (b) degree of premeditation and planning; (c) stalking or following victim; (d) type and sophistication of equipment used and whether it was concealed; (e) breach of relationship of trust with the victim; (f) steps taken to evade detection; (g) motivation for the offence; and (h) persistence of the offending conduct that is the subject of the charge: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76] to [81]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 The second and third steps of the sentencing framework requires the court to identify the applicable indicative sentencing range before proceeding to identify the appropriate starting point within that range: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[82] to [86]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 At the fourth step of the sentencing framework, the court must adjust the starting point sentence having regard to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[87].</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The fifth step of the sentencing framework is engaged where the offender has been convicted of multiple charges, in which case the court has to make further adjustments to the sentence for the individual charges in keeping with the totality principle. This ensures that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality through a two-limbed analysis: the first limb examines whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed, whereas the second limb considers whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[88] to [90]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
