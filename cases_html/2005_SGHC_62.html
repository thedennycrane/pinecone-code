<p class="Judg-Author" style="MARGIN: 10pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">V K Rajah J:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The first plaintiff is the former managing director of the third defendant, a company that he co-founded sometime in or about September 1996 (“the Company”). The second plaintiff is a company founded by the first plaintiff for the purpose of holding shares in the Company. As at 18 May 2004, the second plaintiff held 30% of the Company’s issued capital, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ie</i>, 642,000 shares out of an issued capital of 2,140,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The Company and its subsidiaries (namely, PT Bulkpakindo, a company incorporated in Indonesia and Bulkpak Ltd, a private limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom) are involved in the production of custom-made flexible intermediate bulk containers (“FIBCs”). FIBCs are commonly utilised to transport a wide range of solids and semi-solids, including polymers, agrochemicals, minerals, foodstuff, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and building materials.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The first and second defendants are currently directors cum shareholders of the Company. The first defendant also happens to be the executive chairman of the Company. As at 18 May 2004, the first and second defendants and/or their nominees, collectively held 70% of the Company’s issued capital, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ie</i>, 1,498,000 shares out of an issued share capital of 2,140,000 shares.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> In essence, the plaintiffs’ case against the first and second defendants is founded on a claim of minority oppression by the first and/or second defendants (“the liability issue”). The claim is brought under the umbrella of s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) (“s 216”). The plaintiffs charge the defendants with having systematically disregarded their rights and rely on a broad litany of purported misdemeanours on the part of the defendants. The defendants, in turn, deny that there is any basis to ground any claim(s) of oppression, discrimination or undue prejudice. Counter allegations have been hurled at the first plaintiff, portraying him as an “unprincipled opportunist”. It is as plain as a pikestaff from the affidavit evidence that the relationship between the parties is beyond repair.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The hearing</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Prior to the actual commencement of the hearing, I met with counsel and enquired whether they seriously intended to pursue the liability issue or whether they would merely be dealing with an equitable exit mechanism for the parties from the Company. Upon taking clients’ instructions, counsel confirmed that, “<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">the liability issue need no longer be ventilated. The sole issue remaining is the pricing mechanism for the purchase/sale of the second plaintiff’s share in the Company</span>”. Counsel then requested for time to finalise the terms of reference pertaining to the appointment of an accounting expert to value the shares in the Company. It bears emphasis that as a consequence of this agreement, there was no determination by the court on the issue of whether a case for oppression had been made out by the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The expert’s terms of reference</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The parties subsequently reached an agreement on the precise terms of reference for the court-appointed valuer. From the list of nominees proposed by both parties, I appointed Mr Ong Yew Huat (“Mr Ong”), a senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, as the accounting expert for the purposes of valuing the Company’s shares. It also bears mention that Mr Ong was the preferred nominee of the plaintiffs. The salient terms of his appointment provided that:</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Mr Ong finalised his report on 24 September 2004. After reviewing all the material circumstances, he concluded:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In arriving at the valuation of BPL, it is important to note that the Net Asset Value of BPL as at 31 May 2004 is in deficit, ie. negative US$23,867. However, this is after taking into account shareholders’ (shareholders of BPL) loans and directors’ loans of US$1,677,698 to PTB, a wholly owned subsidiary of BPL. If the shareholders and directors continue to expect these liabilities to be payable by PTB, the fair market value of 100% of the issued share capital of BPL, as at 7 June 2004 would be nil.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">On the assumption that the shareholders and directors treat their loans to PTB of US$1,677,698 as equity for the purpose of this valuation, the fair market value of 100% issued share capital of BPL would be US$398,631.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs were dissatisfied with Mr Ong’s conclusions and invited me to review his findings and/or modify his conclusions. They strenuously sought to make out a case for the court to enhance the valuation. At the resumed hearing on 3 December 2004, Mr Suhaimi, counsel for the plaintiffs, invited the court to make an express finding establishing oppressive conduct on the part of the first and second defendants apropos the plaintiffs, thereby entailing relief pursuant to s 216. He ventured to suggest in the alternative that even in the absence of any finding of oppression, the court was still empowered to exercise the powers conferred on it by s 216. He finally argued that the Company should, on equitable grounds, be wound up. I disagreed with all of his contentions and declined to interfere with Mr Ong’s findings. The plaintiffs have appealed against my refusal to modify Mr Ong’s findings and/or to wind up the Company. I shall now deal with each and every one of the contentions raised by the plaintiffs.</span></p>

This is a startling proposition, to say the least. Counsel has, in my view, attempted to add another dimension to the decision that cannot possibly stand the test of scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In that case the trial judge had, after considering the valuer’s report, decided to enhance the value of the shares. In enhancing the value, the trial judge took into account the benefits and growth which would have accrued to the subject company but for the oppressive act(s). In dismissing the appeal the Court of Appeal incisively observed at [71]:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">There is no doubt that s 216(2) of the Act, as similar provisions in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, is a wide-ranging section. In the words of Vincent J in <i>Re Bodaibo Pty Ltd</i> the section gives the court appropriately extensive discretionary power to effect justice in the particular circumstances of individual cases. <i>As such, we were of the view that the court has the discretion to enhance the share value in a minority oppression case and that the learned judge did not err in doing so</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> It is correct that the appellants in that case had complained, <i>inter alia</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">,</span> that the trial judge had erred in his findings by taking into account allegations of wrongdoings and oppression despite the fact that the petition had not been heard on its merits. To that extent, it might appear, at first blush, to have some superficial similarity to the present proceedings. What Mr Suhaimi regrettably refused to acknowledge is that the relevant circumstances of that particular case were altogether quite different (at [53]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">… A look at the background facts showed that the petition was stayed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and the application was in fact heard on the basis that oppression was assumed to have been established</i>. It was also for this reason that the respondents agreed at the hearing … to pay … costs of the petition, subject to submissions as to quantum. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> This passage very clearly puts in context why the trial judge in that case rightly exercised his jurisdiction pursuant to s 216.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In these proceedings the parties had, at the outset, resolved to set aside their grievances on liability and blameworthiness in an attempt to narrow down their differences. They expressly agreed at the outset not to try the liability issue. As a consequence, there was neither any trial on the plaintiffs’ allegations of oppression nor any findings on the issue by the court. The matters that the court was called upon to resolve were purely tangential factual matters and discrete legal issues that were not premised upon any finding of oppression on the part of the first and second defendants. Counsel for the plaintiffs were content to take this course of action with the full knowledge that the court was making no determination on the liability issue. It appeared to me that counsel for both parties were, at least at that juncture, supremely confident that the accounting expert would arrive at a decision that was favourable to their clients and that the outcome of the expert’s report would financially vindicate their respective client’s positions. I was nonplussed that after the receipt of Mr Ong’s report, Mr Suhaimi attempted to reopen the liability issue. This was well past the eleventh hour and he was blatantly attempting to have a second bite at the cherry. Clearly, when the terms of reference were earlier agreed upon between the parties, he must have been aware of the legal position apropos s 216. As a result, I categorically rejected his belated attempt to reopen the liability issue. As emphasised earlier, Mr Ong was the plaintiffs’ preferred nominee as expert. He prepared his report objectively and thoroughly. The plaintiffs’ attempts to criticise his well-prepared and carefully-reasoned report are misguided and, in the ultimate analysis, without any substance.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The expert’s report</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> There is yet another reason why I was not inclined to question Mr Ong’s findings. The parties had expressly agreed that his valuation “shall be final”. In the absence of fraud or some patent error it would be wholly inappropriate for me to have intervened in these circumstances. This, coupled with the parties’ earlier agreement on the liability, issue dictate that even if I had the discretion to modify Mr Ong’s valuation, there are no legitimate grounds on which I can do so.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Costs</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On the issue of costs, both parties contended that an order of costs should be made in their favour. It transpired that on 17 March 2004, the defendants attempted in an open letter to resolve the matter by mediation. They proposed that an accountant value the shares and that the parties thereafter submit sealed bids for shares they did not own. The highest bidder would secure the right to purchase the opposing parties’ shares. The plaintiffs rejected such a proposal. Although the defendants subsequently made two further offers to settle the matter, nothing meaningful transpired thereafter.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In the light of the parties’ agreement not to pursue the liability issue, I am of the view that the proper order for costs in these proceedings is for the respective parties to bear their own costs. In this connection, I have also taken into consideration the fact that there was an earlier direction dictating that the parties proportionately share the costs of the accounting expert, in proportion to their shareholdings in the Company.</span></p>
