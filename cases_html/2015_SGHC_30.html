<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Leong Hin Chuee (“the plaintiff”)
                    received a monthly salary of S$25,000 pursuant to an Employment Agreement dated
                    1 August 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (“the EA”) signed with the
                    Transpacific Group (a group of companies owned by Suganda Setiadikurnia
                    (“D7”)) (“the Group”) from 1 August 2007 to July
                    2010. Under the EA, he was also entitled to bonuses, share rewards and
                    reimbursements which were due to him if certain conditions were fulfilled. The
                    plaintiff alleges that he had not been paid these other benefits under the EA.
                    Thus he sues the defendants in these proceedings for breach of EA. He alleges
                    that he had not been paid the following sums under the EA:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     US$4,663,020 in respect of Project
                        Gibson being completed, which is the reverse takeover (“RTO”)
                        of PT Royal Oak Development Asia (”RODA”);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     US$4,511,250 in respect of Project MP being completed,
                        which is the RTO of PT Citra Kebun Raya Agri
                            (“CKRA”);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     US$1,138,315.22 in respect of fund
                        raising activities for Project Gibson and Project MP; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     S$1,852,000 in respect of fund raising
                        activities for the acquisition of properties at 21 Anderson Road
                        (“the 21 Anderson Properties”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In addition, the plaintiff also claims
                    S$54,004.52 for reimbursements for expenses he incurred in the course of his
                    employment from 2008 to 2010. Therefore, the plaintiff’s total claim is
                    for US$10,312,585.22 and S$1,906,004.52.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendants dispute the plaintiff’s
                    claims. First, they contend that they were not parties to the EA. According to
                    the defendants, the plaintiff should have sued PT Transpacific Securindo
                    (“PT Securindo”) which they say was his official employer.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Second, they contend that the
                    plaintiff was not entitled to the bonuses since the bonuses were not an absolute
                    entitlement. The plaintiff was also not entitled to the share rewards with
                    respect to Project Gibson and Project MP as the projects were incomplete.
                    Finally, they contend that the plaintiff was not entitled to the balance of the
                    expenses incurred in the execution of his duties as there is no proof that they
                    were incurred in accordance with the EA’s terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Besides disputing these claims, Citra Group Pte
                    Ltd (“D1”), Cozmo Properties Pte Ltd (“D3”), Forever
                    Prosperous Pte Ltd (“D5”) and Fortune International Trading Pte
                    Ltd (“D6”) (collectively “the Four
                    Counterclaimants”) also counterclaim against the plaintiff for his
                    alleged breach of directors’ duties and breach of
                        confidentiality.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Prior to his EA with the defendants, the
                    plaintiff was the Executive Vice-President and Head (Business Development and
                    Investor Relations)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> in Lereno Bio-Chem Ltd (“Lereno”),
                    a Catalist-listed company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> It was at Lereno that he met D7, the
                    Vice-Chairman of Lereno on 20 November 2007, after the latter had subscribed for
                    a significant number of Lereno shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, D7 resigned from Lereno’s
                    board when he failed to secure majority control of Lereno. He also fell out with
                    the other leading shareholders of Lereno.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> However, as D7 found the
                    plaintiff to be “shrewd and capable”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, D7 offered to employ him on a full-time
                        basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    so that the plaintiff could assist him with the RTO of two public-listed
                    Indonesian companies: RODA, a suspended company listed on the Indonesian Stock
                    Exchange (“IDX”), and CKRA, another suspended company listed on
                    the IDX. The plaintiff agreed and resigned from Lereno on 31 August
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Employment Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff entered into the EA after some
                    negotiations with D7. It was signed by D7 on behalf of the Group, which was
                    described in the EA as “a Group of companies incorporated in Indonesia
                    and Singapore with its principal place of business at the 18th floor of Menara
                    Imperium, Jakarta Indonesia”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Subsequently
                    and pursuant to the EA’s terms, the plaintiff was appointed to different
                    positions in the companies controlled by D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> His appointments included,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is important to note that with respect to the share
                        rewards, cll 5.4 and 5.5 were amended by having “1.5% for
                        100%” scribbled next to them and D7 countersigning at the side
                        (“the Handwritten Amendments”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In this
                        regard, the plaintiff also makes reference to Table 1 (exhibited in Annex A
                        of this judgment) to submit that the share rewards are essentially a
                        “loyalty device” and the price to be paid for the share
                        rewards should be in accordance with Table 1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>
                        The plaintiff interpreted this to mean that he would get 1.5% of the RODA
                        and CKRA shares or their cash equivalent when Project Gibson and Project MP
                        were completed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       While it is undisputed that the Handwritten
                    Amendments were made by D7, the parties disagreed on: (a) when completion took
                    place; (b) what were the circumstances under which the share rewards were to be
                    granted; and (c) the implication of the Handwritten Amendments to those clauses.
                    The plaintiff’s view is that Project Gibson and Project MP were
                    successfully completed and that he was instrumental to their success. He also
                    submits that he was instrumental in raising funds successfully for the
                    acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties and thus entitled to the sums claimed
                    for. The defendants’ view is that Project Gibson, Project MP and the
                    acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties failed. The plaintiff was merely a
                    liaison officer to obtain the loans for the various companies from the banks.
                    For these services, the plaintiff was already paid a salary under the EA.
                    Therefore, the defendants submit that the plaintiff is not entitled to his
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Given the very different interpretation of the
                    facts taken by the plaintiff and the defendants, it is useful to look at the
                    three abovementioned fund raising activities and the way the parties viewed
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Project MP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Project MP was an initiative under the
                    Bio-Resources Division of the Group<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and it involved the RTO of
                    CKRA. CKRA was a company engaged in the planting, processing, trading and
                    transportation of agricultural and plantation products and palm oil
                        processing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Project MP was to be executed in the following
                        manner:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first step was to issue CKRA
                        shares. CKRA would conduct a rights issue and the money raised would be used
                        to purchase mandatory exchangeable bonds (“MEB”) issued by PT
                        Kurnia Selaras (“PTKS”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     PTKS would pay 1% interest to CKRA every year for five
                        years until the bonds matured on 28 January 2013. Upon maturity, the MEB
                        would be exchanged for 70% equity in PT Transpacific Agro Industry
                        (“TPAI”) and PT Citra Indoniaga
                            (“CIN”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> two palm oil companies in Indonesia.
                        Upon the maturity of the MEB, CKRA was envisaged to become the indirect
                        owner of the palm oil plantations owned by TPAI and CIN. The first rights
                        issue was conducted in January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     After the first CKRA rights issue was conducted and the
                        acquisitions made, a second rights issue was conducted with 78% of the
                        proceeds funding the purchase of PT Horizon Agro Industry
                        (“HAI”). HAI owned a number of palm oil plantation-owning
                        subsidiaries. It was also in the process of constructing a starch products
                        factory. 22% of the proceeds would be used for CKRA’s working capital
                        needs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally,
                        D1 would be incorporated as an investment holding company to be the standby
                        buyer underwriting the second CKRA rights issue. To fulfil its underwriting
                        obligations, D1 later entered into a loan facility with the Singapore branch
                        of the Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG (“RZB”) for the
                        sum of US$111,663,482.44 (“the First RZB
                Loan”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff envisaged that under this plan,
                    CKRA would become a multi-billion dollar company in three years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> There were three eventual
                    scenarios contemplated by the parties in relation to Project MP:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     The best-case scenario envisaged
                        that up to 300bn rupiah would be raised from interested investors in the
                        second CKRA rights issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     The expected scenario was that up to 200bn rupiah would
                        be raised from interested investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     The worst-case scenario was that no money would be raised
                        from interested investors,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> thus necessitating a pledge of 400bn
                        rupiah worth of shares to RZB in order to secure 100bn rupiah worth of
                            loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As matters transpired, the second CKRA rights
                    issue was a total failure, necessitating D1’s use of the money raised from
                    the First RZB Loan to underwrite the share issuances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff submits that Project MP was
                    completed because D1 successfully held 78.76% of CKRA as of 31 December
                        2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>
                    with CKRA’s shares being freely tradable, showing that the asset injection
                    and monetisation were successfully completed. His role was to raise funds for
                    the project and<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> through his efforts, RZB was convinced
                    that the collateral which D1 had in place was acceptable under the proposed
                    financing structure and it therefore granted D1 credit facilities up to
                    US$111,663,485.44 for Project MP.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Annual Bonus under cl 5.3 of the

                        CKRA shares under cl 5.4 of the EA in relation to Project MP and pursuant to
                        an alleged oral agreement by D7 to increase his entitlement from 1.5% to 3%
                        of the CKRA shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendants disagree for three reasons.
                    First, they submit that Project MP was uncompleted as it entailed the completion
                    of the proposed rights issue and the total divestment of the CKRA shares by D1
                    to third parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Since the divestment did not take place
                    until after some major restructuring which took place after the plaintiff
                    resigned, Project MP was never completed during the plaintiff’s
                    tenure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Second, they submit that no fresh funds were
                    raised for CKRA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> In fact, losses were made when the Group
                    (and/or D7) was unable to pay the interest due on the First RZB Loan, forcing
                    RZB to sell the shares pledged to it in order to reduce CKRA’s interest
                        liability.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff is therefore not entitled to
                    the bonuses under cl 5.3 of the EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Third, the defendants submit that the First
                    RZB Loan was only granted because of a pledge of CKRA shares in RZB’s
                    favour. The plaintiff had merely liaised with RZB, for which he had been
                        remunerated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the plaintiff was not
                    instrumental in obtaining the First RZB Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Project Gibson</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Project Gibson involved the RTO of RODA, a
                    company engaged mainly in the building and development of housing projects for
                    the middle class. It envisaged, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    Group and/or D7 injecting assets into RODA and subsequently monetising those
                    assets so that RODA could take over several companies and stabilise its revenue
                        stream.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Project Gibson was to be executed in the
                    following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     D5 would be incorporated as an
                        investment holding company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> It
                        would then subscribe for and hold shares in RODA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> RODA would also conduct a rights issue in
                        or around January 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and the proceeds would be used
                        as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       40% of the proceeds would
                            go towards acquiring apartment and retail units in a property
                            development known as the Oakwood Premier Cozmo Jakarto (“the
                            Oakwood units”) from PT Adhisakti Kreasi Persada
                            (“AKP”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       50% of the proceeds would go towards buying
                            shares in PT Transpacific Mutual Capita (“TMC”), which in
                            turn owned other property development
                    projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     As
                        RODA’s rights issue subscription had to be in cash under IDX
                        regulations and the purchasing parties did not have sufficient cash to
                        effect the purchase,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> a loan was taken from the
                        Development Bank of Singapore (“DBS”) to enable D5 to
                        subscribe for RODA shares. Eventually, D5’s purchase of RODA’s
                        shares was done by borrowing US$115,999,561.97 from DBS under a one-day loan
                        facility agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Ultimately, the parties envisioned that RODA
                    would be relisted, the assets owned by the injecting Indonesian companies would
                    be monetised, and D5 would prosper from the increase in the value of the RODA
                    shares. To achieve that goal, it was envisioned that D5 would be able to sell
                    its RODA shareholding to third parties in the future.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> That, however, did not materialise.
                    Additionally, neither AKP nor RODA obtained title to the Oakwood units as (a)
                    the Oakwood units were earlier pledged to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
                    Corporation under an earlier financing agreement so that the developers would
                    finish the property development; and (b) there were insufficient funds to redeem
                    the Oakwood units from the existing pledge. Consequently, AKP had to cancel its
                    sale and purchase agreement with RODA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff submits that he is entitled to
                    be remunerated as he was instrumental to Project Gibson’s success since he
                    had successfully obtained the DBS loan for D5.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> It was because
                    of his discussions with DBS that DBS was satisfied with the collateral provided
                    under the financing structure that he had developed. As a result, funds were
                    available for purchasing RODA shares. That constituted successful
                        fundraising<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> as funds were successfully
                    raised for Project Gibson’s execution. Thus D5 successfully obtained 50.2%
                    of the RODA shares, with the balance of the freely-tradable shares held by other
                    entities of the Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff is therefore entitled to
                    receive:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Annual Bonus under cl 5.3 of the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Periodic Bonuses under cl 5.3 of the EA worth 0.5% of

                        by D7 to increase his entitlement from 1.5% to 3% of the RODA
                            shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendants disagree on three grounds.
                    First, they submit that Project Gibson had envisaged that property assets would
                    be injected into RODA. However, the intended property asset injections were
                    unsuccessful and incurred losses. Therefore, there was neither injection of
                    assets nor enhancement of RODA’s assets that would have led to an increase
                    in RODA’s share value. Consequently, no interested parties invested in
                    RODA and Project Gibson failed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Second, the defendants submit that Project
                    Gibson was left uncompleted as it entailed the completion of a second rights
                    issue and the total divestment of the RODA shares by D5 to third
                        parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Since no fresh funds were received by RODA
                    for its working capital and the funds were “round-tripped”, no
                    real money was received by the injecting companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore, Project Gibson was incomplete and the plaintiff cannot claim the sums
                    allegedly owed to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Third, the defendants disagree that the
                    plaintiff was instrumental to DBS loan being obtained and assert that the loan
                    was secured only because the acquired RODA shares were pledged to DBS as
                        collateral.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> D7 claims that DBS granted the loan because
                    of his own good standing and not the plaintiff’s proposed loan
                        structure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff’s task was merely to
                    liaise with DBS and he had been duly compensated by his monthly remuneration
                    under cl 5.1 of the EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Hence, the plaintiff is
                    not entitled to the sums claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 21 Anderson Properties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     After the EA was signed, the plaintiff submits
                    that D7 directed him to raise funds for the acquisition of the 21 Anderson
                    Properties pursuant to the EA’s terms. This was a subsequent addition to
                    Project Gibson and the plaintiff was appointed as the main liaison with various
                    banks to raise funds for the acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties. The plan
                    was that D6 would secure a loan and it would then lend the sum to D3 and
                    Springfield Ventures Group Ltd (“Springfield”), another company
                    used for the acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties, for them to purchase the

                    Properties was completed on 15 April 2010 after D6 disbursed the loan to D3 and

                    played an instrumental role in obtaining the Second RZB loan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> by
                    providing a personal guarantee for it. He alleges that D7’s wife, Elsie
                    Wijaya, was unwilling to give a personal guarantee to RZB, which was a condition
                    that RZB was not prepared to forego.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> During cross-examination,
                    the plaintiff described his guarantee as technically “credit
                        enhancement”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Hence, the plaintiff claims that funds were
                    successfully raised and he is entitled to 0.5% of S$170.4m raised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Subsequently, things did not go smoothly for
                    the 21 Anderson Properties purchase. It is here that material differences in the
                    events leading up to the eventual sale of the 21 Anderson Properties
                    manifest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff submits that it was a term of
                    the Second RZB Loan that D6 kept within the maximum loan-to-value ratio which
                    was approved by the RZB Board, failing which D6 would be deemed to be unable to
                    repay the loan sum. Since D6 breached the loan-to-value ratio under the loan
                    agreement, it was deemed to be unable to repay the loan by 31 March 2011. As a
                    result, RZB decided to sell the 21 Anderson Properties to reduce the interest
                    payable on the loan by D6 since it was of the view that D6 could not repay the
                    principal amount together with the accrued interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As a result, the plaintiff was specifically
                    assigned to raise more funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> According to him, he
                    managed to liaise with Arch Capital Management Co Ltd (“Arch
                    Capital”) and Arch Capital Asian Partners LP (“Arch Asian”)
                    (collectively “ARCH”), two private equity investors, to obtain
                    funds to repay the Second RZB loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> This was to be done via
                    Arch Asian purchasing the Properties for S$200m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> This constituted funds
                    raised for the Group and/or D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff submits
                    that he is entitled to the 0.5% of S$200m raised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In total, the plaintiff claims 0.5% of
                    S$370.4m raised, amounting to S$1.852m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendants’ position is that the
                    fund-raising in respect of the 21 Anderson Properties acquisition was not a
                    “Fund Raising Activity” as per cl 5.3 of the EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> They
                    submit that even if it was, the money was obtained due to D7’s good
                    relationship with his ARCH contact and it was also due to this that the 21
                    Anderson Properties were sold to Arch Asian at S$200m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> Even
                    though this sum went towards repaying the Second RZB Loan, D3 and Springfield
                    suffered a total loss of S$20m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> Since no funds from
                    investors had been raised, D7 had no reason to declare any bonus in favour of
                    the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In oral submissions, the plaintiff submitted
                    that he no longer wanted to pursue his 21 Anderson Properties claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless in the interest of
                    completeness and in view of the extensive written submissions that have already
                    been made, I will address this head of the claim in my judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s resignation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff eventually resigned in July 2010
                    as Project Gibson and Project MP were in a mess. He submits that this was
                    largely attributable to D7,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> who had asked him to
                    “falsify accounts to show that the Transpacific Group was generating
                    sufficient cashflows and could service the interest payments that were
                        due.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> As he could not take part in such a
                    morally reprehensible act, he chose to resign. Furthermore, his salary for
                    December 2009 was unpaid while his 2010 salary was paid late.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It was also around this time that the
                    plaintiff asked DW1, Angel Setiadikurnia, D7’s daughter, to reimburse his
                    expenses amounting to S$79,113.67. In return, he would waive his claim for the
                    bonuses and entitlements which according to him totalled more than S$10m.
                    However, he was only reimbursed S$25,109.15. The plaintiff submits that since he
                    was not reimbursed in full, he now claims for his bonuses, share rewards
                    relating to Project MP and Project Gibson, and the balance of the expenses not
                    reimbursed to him under the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The counterclaims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In response to this suit, the Four
                    Counterclaimants allege that the plaintiff was in breach of his directors’
                    duties towards D3 while he was its director. They also allege that the plaintiff
                    had breached his duty of confidentiality to all of them when he removed
                    documents belonging to them without their prior approval and subsequently used
                    those documents to commence the present suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The following issues arise for my
                    consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     are the defendants party to the
                        EA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     does the
                            <em>contra proferentem</em> rule apply against the
                        plaintiff since he admitted that he drafted the EA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     is the plaintiff entitled to be
                        reimbursed for the balance of his expenses incurred in the discharge of his

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     is the plaintiff entitled to the Periodic Bonuses in

                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_e"></a>(e)     is the
                        plaintiff entitled to the share rewards in relation to Project Gibson and
                        Project MP under cll 5.4 and 5.5 of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Four Counterclaimants raise the following
                    issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     was the plaintiff in breach of
                        directors’ duties to D3 under s 157 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006
                        Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     was the plaintiff in breach of his duty of
                        confidentiality to the Four Counterclaimants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I shall first deal with the plaintiff’s claims before
                        addressing the counterclaims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Who are the parties to the EA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     When an employee contracts with a corporate
                    group, the legal question that inevitably arises is who he is contracting with:
                    Ravi Chandran, <em>Employment Law in Singapore</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2011) at para 1.73. In this case, the plaintiff and the
                    defendants take opposing views as to who are the parties to the EA. At the start
                    of the proceedings, the plaintiff’s position was that all the defendants
                    were parties to the EA. At the closing submissions, he submitted that his
                    counterparty was D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the defendants submit that
                    the plaintiff’s counterparty was PT Securindo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is important to note that the Group is
                    neither incorporated nor registered in Indonesia or Singapore. Hence, it is not
                    a legal entity and is non-existent in law, having neither legal rights nor
                    obligations. This is also why the plaintiff did not sue the Group, although it
                    is <em>named</em> as the counterparty in the
                EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff’s initial case was that
                    all the seven defendants fell within the scope of the EA. He relied on <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp;
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”) where the Court of Appeal had
                    endorsed the contextual approach to contractual interpretation, holding that the
                    “first and foremost consideration in approaching any written contract
                    must be the essence and attributes of the document being examined” (at
                    [110]). Therefore, as long as extrinsic evidence is relevant and reasonably
                    available to both parties and goes towards showing the parties’ objective
                    intentions, it should be admitted subject to the requirements under the Evidence
                    Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (at [125]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> It was
                    pursuant to this that the plaintiff sought to admit extrinsic evidence to prove
                    which defendants were parties to the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s case in relation to D1 to D6</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff’s case in relation to D1
                    to D6 is as follows. First, D1 to D6 were incorporated as part of the Group on
                    D7’s directions for holding various assets and investments belonging to
                    the Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> Second, the reason why there was no
                    specific corporate entity with which the plaintiff contracted was because it
                    would not have been possible to list the names of all the companies forming part
                    of the Group then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> Third, it was the mutual intention of the
                    plaintiff and D7 that there would be no specific company under which D7 was to
                    serve. This was evident in cross-examination, where the plaintiff stated
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There were <em>additional orders and directions to
                            be provided for</em>. As the employee acting under the terms and
                        conditions of that [EA], all subsequent orders must fall under the broad
                        description of Transpacific Group. And it provides in the EA for holding
                        companies, subsidiary companies, associates as well as other parties [to]
                        which the seventh defendant may [be assigned] to give such orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [O]rders and specific directions given by the parties authorised
                        to do so or assigned to do so under the [EA] would then, by such action,
                        point out the companies which fall under the [EA], as provided in [EA]
                        itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiff later conceded that his case
                    against D1 to D6 was weak and his primary case was against D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Also, he did not pursue his case in
                    relation to D2, D3, D4 and D6 in his closing submissions, which was built around
                    negating the defendants’ case that companies under the Group must have the
                    “Transpacific” pre-fix in their names.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>. Moreover, he only submitted that D1 and D5 had
                    ratified the EA by paying the plaintiff’s salary from December
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless since much time and effort
                    was spent litigating the matter, I shall still address the parties’
                    submissions in relation to D1 to D6.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s case in relation to D7</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     With respect to D7, the plaintiff first
                    submits that D7 was party to the EA based on the indicia in <em>Chew Swee Hiang v Attorney-General and another</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R)
                    215. The question there was whether the employer of a government-aided school
                    teacher was the government or the school’s management committee. In
                    arriving at his decision, A P Rajah J held at [43] that the following indicia
                    were relevant in establishing a contract of service:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     the employer’s power of
                        selection of his employee;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     the payment of wages or other
                    remuneration;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        employer’s right to control the method of doing the work;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        employer’s right of suspension or dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On those factors, the plaintiff submits that
                    D7 was party to the EA because he <em>alone</em> exercised
                    significant power over important aspects of the plaintiff’s employment,
                        <em>viz</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 2.1.1, which states that the
                        plaintiff’s duties and powers were to be exercised “as directed
                        by [D7]”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 2.1.2, which states that the plaintiff’s employment
                        should accord with “all resolutions, regulations, policies and
                        directions” given by D7;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clause 2.1.3, which states that D7 would have sole
                        direction of the location of the plaintiff’s employment;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_d"></a>(d)     Clause 5.3,
                        which allows D7 to decide which fund raising activities applied to the
                        Periodic Bonuses and gives him “sole and absolute discretion”
                        over the quantum of the said bonuses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Second, the plaintiff submits that D7 was the
                    party to the EA as he purported to act as the Group’s agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In support of his proposition, the plaintiff
                    cited <em>Kelner v Baxter</em> (1866) LR 2 CP 174
                        (“<em>Kelner</em>”) (endorsed by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Quah Poh Hoe Peter v Probo Pacific Leasing

                        others</em> [2013] EWHC 3553 (Comm) (“<em>CIFAL</em>”)) where the plaintiff had entered into an
                    agreement with the defendant who had purportedly acted on behalf of an
                    unincorporated company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> It was held that as a matter of
                    construction, the parties had intended for the defendants in that case to be
                    personally bound.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The plaintiff submits that since the Group was
                    non-existent and the EA had been performed on the basis that it was binding, a
                    presumption arose that D7 intended to be personally bound by the EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff
                    relies on the following facts in support of his position:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff had entered into the
                        EA with D7 who acted on behalf of the Group;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Group had no legal capacity to enter into
                        contractual relations; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     the parties were aware that the Group had no legal
                        capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Therefore the plaintiff submits
                        that the present facts are “on all fours” with <em>Probo Pacific</em> and the presumption has not been
                        rebutted by D7. Further, any other interpretation would result in the EA
                        being a nullity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     both DW1 and DW2 understood that the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     D7 <em>subjectively</em> believed that he was signing

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_48-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       PT Securindo together with RODA and CKRA reimbursed the plaintiff

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_48-p2_c-p3_v"></a>(v)       the plaintiff admitted that he was employed by
                            PT Securindo at least on a temporary basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Second, the defendants submit that there are
                    cogent reasons why D1 to D6 were not parties to the EA. With respect to D1, D3
                    and D5, they were not even incorporated when the EA was signed. The mere fact
                    that they were parties to the transactions and financing arrangements did not
                    mean that they were parties to the EA. Also, they had not impliedly ratified the
                    EA since their directors did not know of the EA’s existence until after
                    the suit was commenced and no party had entered into the EA on their
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Third, D7 submits that D1 to D6 do not fall
                    within the Group as the “Transpacific group” refers to a group of
                        <em>Indonesian</em> companies he owned and those
                    companies have the prefix “Transpacific” in their names.

                    Since D1 to D6 do not bear the name “Transpacific” and are
                    Singapore-incorporated as opposed to Indonesia-incorporated,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> they

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">D7’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     D7 submits that he is personally not party to
                    the EA. First, he submits that his being personally liable was not the position
                    taken by the plaintiff in his Statement of Claim (“SOC”) which had
                    indicated that the contracting party was the Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Second, he submits that he had signed the EA on
                    behalf of the Group, which he claimed was represented by PT
                        Securindo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> Third, he submits that the
                    correct counterparty to the EA should be PT Securindo due to the reasons given
                    in [48(c)(i)] to [48(c)(v)].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span>
                    Fourth, D7 submits that the plaintiff had admitted to being employed by PT
                    Securindo, and the plaintiff’s submission that it was merely on a
                    temporary basis was just a mere assertion unsupported by the
                        evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Three significant cases on which the parties’ submissions are
                based</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I shall first discuss three cases which the
                    parties made extensive submissions on. They are <em>CIFAL</em>, <em>Probo Pacific</em>, and
                        <em>Mohamed Bassatne</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">CIFAL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In <em>CIFAL</em>, Groupe
                    CIFAL and the Meridian Group had signed a high-level Strategic Partnership
                    Agreement (“SPA”). It was agreed that the Meridian Group would
                    invest in suitable projects which would provide strong profits and a fast return
                    on investment (at [29]) and that Groupe CIFAL would provide the expertise in
                    identifying and developing those projects. The collaboration failed and the
                    plaintiffs sued the defendants. In addition to three corporate defendants which
                    formed part of the Meridian Group, the plaintiffs tried to make Meridian
                    Group’s agent, Mr Feld, personally liable for the claims. They contended
                    that since Mr Feld had purported to contract on behalf of Meridian Group, a
                    non-existent principal, he should be made personally liable. They were
                    unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     First, the court held that the argument that
                    Meridian Group was a non-existent entity was flawed as it would mean that the
                    plaintiffs’ case against the three corporate defendants was misconceived.
                    Second, the plaintiffs argued that Mr Feld failed to negate his personal
                    liability as he had represented that the Meridian Group was a corporate entity.
                    That argument also failed as there was no evidence that Mr Feld had represented
                    that the Meridian Group was a corporate entity. In the SPA, the Meridian Group
                    was merely described as having a registered office at the first corporate
                    defendant’s address. That was insufficient to find that Mr Feld had
                    represented that the Meridian Group was the name of a corporate entity (at
                    [94]). Third, the court noted that an Agency Agreement signed prior to the SPA
                    had identified the three corporate defendants as the entities within the
                    Meridian Group (at [95]). Hence, Mr Feld had negated his personal liability as
                    the corporate entities under the Meridian Group could be identified and he was
                    contracting on their behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Probo Pacific</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     
          <em>Probo Pacific</em>
                    concerned the lease of two yachts to an unincorporated entity, Container
                    Manufacturing Consultant Services Pte Ltd (“CMCS”). CMCS had
                    defaulted on its lease payment and when payment was sought, the plaintiff
                    discovered that it was not an incorporated company. The plaintiff then sought to
                    make the defendants personally liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In its judgment, the Court of Appeal
                    considered <em>Kelner</em> and held that it did not stand
                    just for implied ratification, but also the presumption that would arise when
                    one party contracts as an agent for a non-existent principal and another party
                    relies on that fact. The Court of Appeal cited the following passage from
                        <em>Black v Smallwood</em> (1965–1966) 117 CLR 52
                        (<em>Probo Pacific</em> at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>Where A, purporting to act as agent for a non-existent
                            principal, purports to make a binding contract with B, and the
                            circumstances are such that B would suppose that a binding contract had
                            been made, there must be a strong presumption that A has meant to bind
                            himself personally.</em> Where, as in <em>Kelner v
                            Baxter</em>, the consideration on B’s part has been fully
                        executed in reliance on the existence of a contract binding on somebody, the
                        presumption could … only be rebutted in very exceptional
                        circumstances. <em>But the fundamental question in every case
                            must be what the parties intended or must be fairly understood to have
                            intended.</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Court of Appeal held that since the second
                    defendant had acted as an agent for a non-existent principal, there was an
                    unrebutted presumption that the second defendant intended to bind himself
                    personally: <em>Probo Pacific</em> at [19]. Therefore, he
                    was personally liable for the contractual payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mohamed Bassatne </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The last case is <em>Mohamed
                        Bassatne</em>. The plaintiffs had signed a Memorandum of Understanding
                    (“MOU”) to establish a joint venture company with a party known as
                    the “Bakri Group of Companies, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia” (“the
                    Bakri Group”). It was their case that the second and third defendants,
                    Bakri International Energy Co Ltd and the third defendant, Bakri Trading Company
                    Inc, were both part of the Bakri Group and thus parties to the MOU. Similar to
                    the present case, the plaintiffs in <em>Mohamed
                        Bassatne</em> submitted that the Bakri Group referred to all companies
                    bearing the “Bakri” name, set up by the Bakri family and based in
                    Jeddah: see <em>Mohamed Bassatne</em> at
                [134].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Lai Siu Chiu J held that the second defendant
                    was party to the MOU but not the third defendant. She noted three particular
                    facts which pointed towards the second defendant being party to the MOU:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     an internal memorandum from another
                        Bakri-related entity to the second defendant referred to a joint venture
                        between the plaintiffs and the second defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was the second defendant who
                        appointed auditors to audit the joint venture company;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     when a letter
                        of demand was sent to the second defendant in relation to the joint venture,
                        there was no attempt made to dissociate the second defendant from the
                        dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Given that the three affirmative factors were
                    absent where the third defendant was concerned, Lai J held that the plaintiffs
                    had made out their case only in relation to the second defendant but not the
                    third.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is trite that companies within a group are
                    separate entities. Judith Prakash J held in <em>Win Line (UK) Ltd
                        v Masterpart (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 24
                    at [43] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In the <em>Cape Industries</em> case ([30]
                            <em>supra</em>), the court considered that the
                        concept of the group as a single economic entity could not justify any
                        departure from the normal rule that each “company in a group of
                        companies …
                        <em>is a separate legal entity possessed of separate legal
                            right and liabilities</em>”. … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Therefore, where a contract is signed on
                    behalf of a corporate group, one should not automatically presume that all the
                    group companies are jointly and severally liable. Faced with ambiguity, a court
                    should consider extrinsic evidence in determining who the true contracting
                    parties are. In my view, D7 was the plaintiff’s counterparty. I shall
                    first explain why D1 to D6 are not party to the EA before explaining why D7 is
                    party to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">D1, D3 and D5 were not party to the EA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In my view, D1, D3 and D5 were not party to
                    the EA as they had not been incorporated when the EA was signed on 1 August
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> They could not have had legal capacity to
                    contract at that point in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Second, I am not persuaded that D1 and D5
                    ratified the EA. The common law position is that, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, contracts entered into before a company is incorporated
                    only confer rights on the actual makers of the contract, not the company. A
                    company cannot ratify or adopt a contract made ostensibly on its behalf before
                    its incorporation, since a legal person cannot make himself liable as a
                    principal by a subsequent ratification if it was not in existence at the time of
                    the original contract: Hugh G Beale, <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2012) at paras
                    9–012 to 9–014 and <em>Walter Woon on Company
                        Law</em> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Rev Ed,
                    2009) (“<em>Walter Woon</em>”) at para 3.56.
                    That pre-incorporation contracts cannot be ratified under the common law is seen
                    in <em>Kepong Prospecting Ltd and others v Schmidt</em>
                    [1968] 1 AC 810 where Lord Wilberforce held at 824 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… services “prior to [a company’s] formation”
                        cannot amount to consideration. No services can be rendered to a
                        non-existent company, nor can a company bind itself to pay for services
                        claimed to have been rendered before its incorporation. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Therefore, D1 and D5 did not ratify the EA at
                    common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Third, the plaintiff seeks to rely on the
                    doctrine of implied ratification under s 41 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006
                    Rev Ed) to show that D1 and D5 impliedly ratified the EA. Section 41 reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Ratification by company of
                            contracts made before incorporation</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>41</b>.—(1) Any contract or other
                        transaction purporting to be entered into by a company prior to its
                        formation or by any person on behalf of a company prior to its formation may
                        be ratified by the company after its formation and thereupon the company
                        shall become bound by and entitled to the benefit thereof as if it had been
                        in existence at the date of the contract or other transaction and had been a
                        party thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Prior to ratification by the company the person or persons who
                        purported to act in the name or on behalf of the company shall in the

                        contract or other transaction and entitled to the benefit thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The plaintiff cites two cases in support of
                    his submission: <em>Cosmic Insurance Corp Ltd v Khoo Chiang
                        Poh</em> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 703 (“<em>Cosmic Insurance</em>”) and <em>The Golf Cheque
                        Book Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v Nilai Springs Bhd</em> [2006] 1 MLJ 554
                        (“<em>Nilai Springs</em>”). He seeks to
                    show that ratification can be implicit and that s 41 should be construed broadly
                    since it is intended to be a remedial or saving provision where contracts are
                    entered into before a company is incorporated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> His case is that D1 and D5 impliedly ratified
                    the EA as they paid for the plaintiff’s salary since December 2009. I do
                    not agree for the following two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     First, the position in s 41 is different from
                    the common law position in <em>Kelner</em>. <em>Cosmic Insurance</em>, which was decided on the then s 35(1)
                    of the Companies Act (Cap 185, 1970 Rev Ed) (which is <em>in pari
                        materia</em> with s 41), shows this difference. There, the Privy
                    Council appreciated that had the case been decided according to the common law
                    position, a different conclusion might have been reached. Lord Roskill held (at
                    [9]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if this appeal fell to be decided in accordance with the
                        principles established by <em>Kelner v Baxter</em>
                        (1866) CP 174 and many subsequent English decisions to the same effect it
                        could not be successfully contended that the appellants were contractually
                        bound … .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Similarly, <em>Walter
                        Woon</em> at paras 3.56­­­–3.58 observes that s 41 was enacted
                    to remedy the common law position such that the persons acting in the
                    company’s name are bound by and entitled to the benefit of the contract
                    until the company ratifies it. Two requirements are needed: (a) the contract
                    must purportedly have been entered into by the company or by any other person on
                    its behalf before incorporation; and (b) the company must ratify the contract
                    after its formation: <em>Cosmic Insurance</em> at [10].
                    Once the company ratifies the contract, that ratification is effective <em>as though</em> the company had existed at the time of the
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On the facts, neither requirement was met.
                    First, there is no evidence that D7 entered into the EA specifically on behalf
                    of D1 and D5. In <em>Cosmic Insurance</em>, the
                    court’s decision was based on a letter which showed that the
                    parties’ intention was for the company to be bound post-incorporation.
                    Also, there was a company resolution which was passed to bind the company to the
                    pre-incorporation contract (at [13]–[15]). Under those circumstances, it
                    was clear that the parties intended for the company to be bound upon
                    incorporation. That is not the case here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Instead, the facts here show that D7 had
                    signed a contract on behalf of the Group but the plaintiff was unclear which
                    companies fell within the Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff was also unsure which companies were bound by the EA and hence there
                    is no evidence that D7 entered into the EA on behalf of D1 and D5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Second, there is no evidence to suggest that
                    D1 and D5 had impliedly ratified the EA after their incorporation. Implied
                    ratification takes place only where the company does an <em>unequivocal</em> act indicating its willingness to be bound by the
                    contract earlier entered into. <em>Walter Woon</em> at para
                    3.60 gives the example of a company using goods ordered under the
                    pre-incorporation contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In <em>Forman &amp; Co
                        Proprietary, Ltd v The Ship “Liddesdale”</em> [1900] 1
                    AC 190 at 204, ratification was not found as the company’s conduct was
                    interpreted in some other way which did not imply ratification. Similarly, it
                    would be incredible if a finding is made that D1 and D5 impliedly ratified the
                    EA based on the conduct relied upon by the plaintiff (see [42] above). There
                    could be numerous reasons why D1 and D5 paid the plaintiff’s salary,
                    especially in a situation where D7, who ultimately owned all the companies, was
                    not doing well financially. <em>Ipso facto</em>, such
                    conduct cannot affirmatively show that D1 and D5 impliedly ratified the
                    contract. The facts are distinct from the facts in <em>Cosmic
                        Insurance</em>, in which the conduct of the parties pointed <em>unequivocally</em> towards the contract being ratified.
                    Therefore, I find that D1, D3 and D5 are not parties to the EA and D1 and D5 did
                    not impliedly ratify the EA by conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">D2, D4 and D6 are not party to the EA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The plaintiff’s evidence also does not
                    establish that D2, D4 and D6 were parties to the EA for two
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     First, the plaintiff submits that D1 to D6
                    have a common owner, <em>ie</em>, D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> However, having a common owner is not
                    a basis for binding a party to an agreement as each of the defendants is a
                    separate legal entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Second, the plaintiff seeks to defeat the
                    defendants’ position that the Group only consists of
                    Indonesian-incorporated companies by relying on an MAS notice filed on MAS.net
                    by Lereno, announcing D7’s appointment as a director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> He
                    submits that the MAS announcement did not contain the pre-fix
                        “PT”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> the
                    Indonesian pre-fix for companies referring to Indonesian-incorporated
                        companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> Since there was no pre-fix
                    “PT” (which referred to Indonesian-incorporated companies) in the
                    announcement, it is possible for Singapore-incorporated companies to be part of
                    the Group<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> and also for D2, D4 and D6
                    fall within the Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In my view, the plaintiff’s evidence is
                    inconsistent. Initially, he insisted that there was no pre-fix
                    “PT” in the MAS announcement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> and
                    took the view that it was possible for Singapore-incorporated companies to be
                    part of the Group. However, he changed his position when he realised that the
                    MAS announcement contained the pre-fix “PT”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> Once confident that the MAS
                    announcement did not contain the pre-fix “PT”, he now takes the
                    position that the MAS announcement is inaccurate<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> and
                    submits that he was made to believe that many companies under the Group did not
                    have the “Transpacific” name.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> With
                    such material inconsistencies, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove
                    that D2, D4 and D6 were parties to the EA. I should also state that I accept the
                    defendants’ submission that companies which fall within the
                    “Transpacific Group” will bear the word
                    “Transpacific” in their names. Since D1 to D6 do not bear the word
                    “Transpacific” in their names, they are not part of the
                    “Transpacific Group”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was D7 the counterparty to the EA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I find that it is more probable that D7 was
                    the plaintiff’s counterparty. There are two possible interpretations of
                    the facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff could have contracted
                        directly with D7 and PT Securindo used as a means to give effect to the EA;
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        plaintiff could have contracted with PT Securindo with D7 contracting on its
                        behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I will first address the plaintiff’s
                    objection based on the defendants’ failure to plead their case adequately
                    before giving the reasons why I prefer interpretation (a).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   Did the defendants’ plead their case
                sufficiently?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In his submissions, the plaintiff submits that
                    the defendants did not plead that PT Securindo was the plaintiff’s
                    counterparty to the EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore the defendants cannot now seek to prove that PT Securindo was the
                    plaintiff’s counterparty. I disagree as I find that while the defendants
                    might have failed to plead the fact that PT Securindo was the plaintiff’s
                    counterparty, the plaintiff did not appear to have been taken by surprise at
                    trial and had therefore waived or consented to the defendants’ departure
                    from their defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In <em>Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v

                    Sundaresh Menon CJ held that in an adversarial system, the general rule is that
                    parties and the court are bound by the pleadings, which serve the function of
                    upholding the rules of natural justice. Menon CJ stated at [94]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [The pleadings] require a party to give his opponent notice of
                        the case he has to meet to <em>avoid his opponent being taken

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a party is taken by surprise, he must object then and there at the

                        objection. The court will generally, however, grant an adjournment if
                        requested, on suitable terms as to costs, etc, for the pleading to be
                        amended by the party seeking to adduce such evidence. One must bear in mind
                        the need for an orderly adversary system of a court trial, not a chaotic

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It is clear from the above that the
                    defendants’ pleaded defence is founded on negating the plaintiff’s
                    claim and not on proof that PT Securindo was the real counterparty under the EA.
                    Be that as it may, the plaintiff did not object to the adducing of evidence with
                    respect to PT Securindo being the plaintiff’s counterparty and does not
                    appear to have been taken by surprise in the proceedings before me. His conduct
                    suggests that he has waived or consented to the defendants’ departure from
                    their pleaded defence. Thus, his objection based on the defendant’s
                    failure to plead cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   Do the surrounding circumstances at formation point to the
                plaintiff’s counterparty being D7?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Moving to the issue proper, having gone
                    through the facts of <em>CIFAL</em>, <em>Probo Pacific</em> and <em>Mohamed Bassatne</em>
                    (see [53]–[59] above), the legal position is that a party is presumed to
                    have contracted personally if the entity he is signing on behalf of is
                    non-existent or he has not rebutted the presumption that he is personally liable
                    by showing that he was signing on behalf of corporate entities under an
                    unincorporated group. Ultimately, the parties’ intentions must be
                    construed. On the facts, I find that it was D7 who was party to the EA and not
                    PT Securindo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The evidence indicates that when the plaintiff
                    entered into the EA, he did not know how many companies were within the
                    Transpacific Group. Even if he knew, he had no idea which company he was to work
                        for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> He only knew that he was to work
                    for the Group under D7’s control. In contrast, D7 knew which companies
                    were within the Group and which company the plaintiff was to work for. In fact,
                    under cross-examination, D7 admitted that his intention was for the plaintiff to
                    work in PT Securindo:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Er, by knowing [the plaintiff] more, his expertise is a banker. Can I add?
                        Also into corporate finance. Can I add? The most suitable for him during
                        that period, er, <em>Transpac Securindo</em> is the
                        vehicle, that investment bank, yah. Can I add? We have experience selling
                        Indon largest two bank to Temasek. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     That being the case, it is surprising that D7
                    did not <em>specifically</em> identify PT Securindo in the
                    EA. Instead D7 signed on behalf of the Transpacific Group. Why was it so
                    difficult for him to name PT Securindo as the entity that he was contracting on
                    behalf of if it was indeed his intention that the plaintiff was to be employed
                    by PT Securindo?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     During oral submissions, the defendants made
                    continuous reference to the fact that the plaintiff changed his position several
                    times under cross-examination. They submit that he could not give a clear answer
                    as to who he was contracting with<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> and
                    thus that his testimony cannot be believed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span>
                    However, I find that it was not and would not be easy for the plaintiff, a
                    non-legally trained person, to respond to a legal issue of legal personality,
                    especially when he now found out that the entity he had been contracting with
                    had no legal personality.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Ms Ho submits that the plaintiff knew of PT
                    Securindo’s existence by relying on a document produced by the plaintiff
                    which referred to D7 as the “founder of the PT Transpacific Group of
                    companies which includes stock broking, insurance, consumer financing, banking
                    and property development.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> Additionally,
                    she submits that under cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted to knowing that
                    PT Securindo formed part of the Group. The relevant portion she relies on are as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Er, the def---definition of Transpacific Group as set out earlier.
                        Stockbroking would refer to item 34 which is Transpacific Securindo.
                        Consumer finance, I’m not quite sure which one it is. Banking would be
                        Bank Multicor which is item 45. S---property development would be
                        Intermustika Mutiara which is item 36, erm, as well as item 47, Cozmo Bali
                        Jimbaran.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I do not think that the above can be relied on
                    to show that the plaintiff had knowledge of PT Securindo when the EA was signed.
                    The plaintiff did not specify whether his knowledge about PT Securindo came
                    about at the time he signed the EA or after. When he was cross-examined, he
                    already had the benefit of working in the Group for a substantial period of time
                    and his knowledge was with the benefit of hindsight. The above passage is
                    therefore insufficient to warrant a finding that the plaintiff had knowledge of
                    PT Securindo when the EA was signed. Instead, from the circumstances, I find
                    that the parties’ intentions must have been for the plaintiff to contract
                    with D7 and subsequent to the signing of the EA, the plaintiff would be assigned
                    by D7 to work in one of the Group companies. This interpretation makes sense,
                    and is corroborated by cl 2.1.1 of the EA, which reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.1.1 [The plaintiff shall] [u]ndertake such duties
                            and exercise such powers in relation to the Company and its business as

                            successors or assigns … shall from time to time assign to or vest
                            in the [the plaintiff]. However, the responsibilities and duties must be
                            legal and reasonably consistent with the Executive’s designation.
                            [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   Does the subsequent conduct of the parties’
                evidentially show that the plaintiff’s counterparty is D7?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Next, the parties’ subsequent conduct,
                    which can be considered if evidentially probative (see V K Rajah,
                    “Redrawing the Boundaries of Contractual Interpretation” (2010) 22
                    SAcLJ 513 at para 48), <em>indicates</em> that the
                    plaintiff’s counterparty is D7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     First, the plaintiff <em>primarily</em> took instructions from D7, who admitted to being the
                    CEO mentioned in the EA during cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> D7
                    controlled key aspects of the plaintiff’s employment, including
                    accommodation, expenses, what he could or could not do, the direction of the
                    projects, where he was posted to work, determined his bonuses and paid his
                        salary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Second, although the plaintiff’s work
                    permit was issued under the name of PT Securindo, <em>in
                        reality</em>, it was a means by which the plaintiff effected the
                    implementation of the EA. D7 admitted under cross-examination that at the time
                    of signing the EA, there were more than ten companies “under the
                    Transpacific umbrella” and he was not too sure which was the most
                    applicable to the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> In
                    fact, the plaintiff admitted in cross-examination that he was only temporarily
                    employed by PT Securindo because the parties had to meet regulations set by
                        <em>Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal &amp; Lembaga
                        Keuangan</em>, also Indonesia’s stock market
                        regulator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, he was deployed
                    wherever D7 intended for him to be deployed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> Eventually, he was placed in
                    RODA and CKRA, companies which did not exist at the time the EA was
                        signed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> He was also
                    appointed as the director of D2, D3, D4 and D6.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> The facts thus
                    point towards D7 being the party to the EA while the employment pass with PT
                    Securindo was merely a means to effect the parties’ mutual intention for
                    the plaintiff to work in Indonesia for various companies under the
                Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Therefore I find that while the EA did not
                    state D7 as the contracting party, he was <em>in fact</em>
                    the contracting party to the EA. There was no specific identification of the
                    corporate entities from the Group in the EA when it was signed. For all intents
                    and purposes, D7 had in his mind the knowledge that he was contracting with the
                    plaintiff with a view that he would be assigned to work in one of the
                    Group’s companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In the premises, I hold that the plaintiff has
                    no course of action against D1 to D6 in this suit as they are not parties to the
                    EA. However, I find that D7 is party to the EA. I shall proceed to address
                    whether D7 is liable to the plaintiff for the various claims sought. I note that
                    the defendants have raised the issue of whether the <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> rule should apply so that the terms of the EA are
                    construed against the plaintiff. They also raised the issue of whether the
                    plaintiff had waived his claim for the bonuses and share rewards. I shall first
                    consider whether the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule
                    should apply in interpreting the contractual clauses before proceeding to
                    consider the plaintiff’s substantive claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Should the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule
                apply against the plaintiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The defendants submit that the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule should apply against the
                    plaintiff such that the clauses relied on by the plaintiff are interpreted
                    against him. They submit that the rationale of the rule supports its application
                    in the present case as the EA was drafted by the plaintiff and he is now relying
                    on it to assert his claim against the defendants. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The plaintiff opposes the application of the
                        <em>contra proferentem</em> rule because he says that
                    the EA was negotiated on an equal footing between himself and D7. His argument
                    is that the rule does not apply to negotiated contracts and should only apply to
                    situations where the parties are not of equal bargaining power.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff’s oral submissions
                    are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… We submit that the very essence and <em>raison

                            application in the situation where parties had contracted as equals and
                            each had the opportunity to advance their respective

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Two questions must be considered when applying
                    the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule: (a) was there any
                    ambiguity in the EA; and (b) if so, who was the party against whom the clauses
                    were sought to be interpreted against: <em>LTT Global Consultants
                        v BMC Academy Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 3 SLR 903 (“<em>LTT Global</em>”) at [56]–[57]. <em>Tam Wing Chuen v Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong Ltd (in
                        liq)</em> [1996] 2 BCLC 69 (“<em>Tam Wing
                        Chuen</em>”) at 77 gives the rationale for this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] person who puts forward the wording of a proposed agreement
                        may be assumed to have looked after his own interests so that if the words

                        benefit there is reason to suppose that he is not. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In <em>LTT Global</em> at
                    [56], Prakash J held that there must first be an “ambiguity in the
                    contract which cannot be resolved by interpreting the term in the context of the
                    overall contract.” It is my finding that certain clauses relied upon by
                    the plaintiff here are ambiguous for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 5.3 did not make clear the
                        fund-raising activities which the plaintiff was to undertake. The scope and
                        context of the activities were also ambiguous.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clauses 5.4 and 5.5 did not mention what was
                        meant by and what constituted 1.5% of 100%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The second stage involves identifying the
                    person against whose interests the ambiguous term should be read: <em>LTT Global</em> at [57]. In dealing with this issue, I have
                    to consider which parties were involved in the drafting of the EA. However, the
                    circumstances leading up to the eventual signing of the EA are
                disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The plaintiff submits that he used the
                    employment contract of his former university classmate, Mr Wan Kum Tho
                    (“Mr Wan”), when Mr Wan considered taking up the job offer from
                    D7, as a template. He also submits that D7 is a “sophisticated corporate
                    financier well-schooled in the ways of the business world and corporate
                        finance".<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> Thus D7 would not sign the EA if he
                    disagreed with its conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    On the other hand, the defendants submit
                    that it was the plaintiff who drafted the EA. They note that the plaintiff had
                    shifted his position regarding the circumstances leading up to the eventual EA
                    being signed. Initially, the plaintiff denied that he was involved in the
                    preparation of the draft EA but later admitted to his involvement in the
                    drafting and incorporation of amendments to the draft EA based on D7’s
                        instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> D7 also testified that it was the
                    plaintiff who had drafted most of the disputed clauses and he buttressed his
                    position by saying that (a) the Group did not have the competency to draft such
                    a detailed EA in English; and (b) he only had a basic command of
                        English.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> Since it
                    was the plaintiff who drafted the clauses in question, D7 submits that the
                    ambiguities should be construed against the plaintiff as he must be taken to
                    have looked after his own interests: <em>Tam Wing
                        Chuen</em> at [77].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It is trite that the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule serves the basic purpose of protecting
                    weaker parties faced with an inequality of bargaining power. In Kim Lewison,
                        <em>The Interpretation of Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2011) (“<em>The Interpretation of
                        Contracts</em>”) at p 362, the author comments that
                    “[t]he origin and first purpose of the principle is to limit the power of
                    a dominant contractor who is able to deal on its own take-it-or-leave-it terms
                    with others.” He helpfully points to <em>Oxonica Energy
                        Ltd v Neuftec Ltd</em> [2008] EWHC 2127 (Pat) where Peter Prescott QC
                    at [90] observed that the principle is one imported from Roman law which sought
                    to protect parties in situations where they do not have any opportunity to
                    negotiate the terms of the agreement. It is therefore hard to apply the
                        <em>contra proferentem</em> where contracts are
                    bilaterally negotiated on an equal footing (<em>LTT
                        Global</em> at [58]) and John W Carter, <em>The
                        Construction of Commercial Contracts</em> (Hart Publishing, 2013) at p
                    149, comments that the rule should only be relevant in order to keep the clause
                    from being void for certainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    I do not think that the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule should be applied against the plaintiff
                    for the following three reasons. First, I find that the EA was <em>to some extent</em> bilaterally negotiated. While D7 did not
                    agree to the terms of the plaintiff, the original EA was modified as evinced by
                    the Handwritten Amendments. In the words of Prakash J in <em>LTT
                        Global</em> at [59], “[t]his was not a case of a standard form
                    contract which the defendant had no choice but to take or
                leave.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Second, both the plaintiff and D7 are
                    commercial men and have the ability to protect their own interests. While
                    D7’s poor command of English was raised as a reason for why the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule should be applied against the
                    plaintiff, I am not convinced. During the course of the court proceedings, D7
                    was able to testify in English. While not entirely fluent, he was at least
                    coherent and could understand the questions that were posed to him by counsel.
                    His language handicap was not as great as he made it seem to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Third, the plaintiff submits in his reply
                    submission that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The 7<sup>th</sup> defendant is an experienced and
                        successful businessman, with the commercial nous that these attributes would
                        entail. <em>That he would helplessly allow a prospective
                            employee free reign (sic) to dictate the terms of his employment, in
                            particular clauses that provided for potentially lucrative remuneration,
                            beggars belief</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>If D7 did not understand any of the terms in the EA, I am
                        confident that being the experienced and successful businessman that he is,
                        he would have asked or at least sought clarification as to the terms before
                        he signed the EA. For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule should not be applied
                        against the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Coming to the plaintiff’s claims

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Although the plaintiff’s full claim
                    was for S$79,113.67, he seeks to claim only S$54,004.52 in the present action as
                    he had already been paid S$25,109.15 in 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span> The claim
                    process was as follows. First, he submitted his claims to DW1, also D3’s
                        director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> In processing the claims, she would ask the

                    to her. She would then group the documents by year and ascertain whether the
                    expenses were reasonable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span>
                    Finally, the Human Resources Department of PT Securindo would decide whether the
                    claims were work-related before the board gave its approval.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> Eventually, only
                    S$25,109.15 of the plaintiff’s total reimbursement claims was approved.
                    D7’s position is that he had not seen the plaintiff’s claim for the
                    other expenses and that he should not be liable for them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to
                    the remainder of his expenses claim as he has not proven his case on the balance
                    of probabilities. The right to reimbursement of the plaintiff’s expenses
                    is not an unconditional one. According to cl 5.9, they must be “incurred
                    in or about the discharge of [his] duties” and must be reasonable. While
                    the plaintiff submits that he incurred the expenses, he did not produce evidence
                    to show that the expenses were incurred in the discharge of his duties or that
                    they were reasonable. Furthermore, under normal circumstances, I would have
                    expected the plaintiff to claim for reimbursement as and when expenses were
                    incurred. However there is no evidence to indicate whether he had made any claim
                    for reimbursement in the past. There was also no explanation for why he
                    accumulated his reimbursement claims over such a prolonged period and only
                    lodged these claims when he was about to resign. There is also no evidence that
                    he or his staff kept proper and accurate records of his official expenses in the
                    course of his employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    I am thus not satisfied that the expenses
                    were incurred “in or about the discharge of [his] duties”. That
                    being the case, I hold that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim for the
                    remainder of his expenses which were not approved by DW1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the plaintiff waive his bonus payment and share rewards
                claims?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Turning to the plaintiff’s bonus
                    payment and share rewards claims, the defendants submit that they should not be

                        perks received,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span> receiving a generous pay package of

                    cars;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        plaintiff’s claims for performance bonuses and success fees are
                        unmerited and his lack of belief in his claim of over S$10m can be seen from
                        how ready he was to waive them;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff accepted the defendant’s
                        counteroffer of S$25,109.15 for reimbursement of his expenses when he banked
                        in the cheque for the said amount.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a></span> Thus the defendants assumed that the
                        plaintiff had agreed to waive his bonus and success fee
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The plaintiff agrees with the defendants to
                    the extent that he was <em>initially</em> willing to waive
                    his other claims when he sought reimbursement of his expenses as he had intended
                    for a “clean break” from the “mess” so he could
                    “move on”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span> However, he now submits that the
                    defendants had not agreed to this as he was not paid in full for his claim of
                        reimbursement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span> Therefore, he now wants to pursue his
                    claims under the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I shall now deal with the three grounds of
                    waiver raised by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s salary was irrelevant in considering the waiver
                issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    It is true that the plaintiff’s salary
                    was very attractive. However, this may not be relevant as to whether he had
                    waived his other claims. Waiver is premised on totally different grounds and the
                    fact that he was well-remunerated cannot mean that he had waived his claim via
                    estoppel or election.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff could not have honestly believed in his share rewards
                and bonus payment claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I find that it is improbable that the
                    plaintiff had any honest belief in his share rewards and bonus payment claims.
                    He was clearly aware that he had sought a total reimbursement of S$79,113.67. In
                    contrast, his other claims amount to well over S$10m. This was stated in his
                    email dated 27 July 2010 to DW1 (see [112] above). As a commercial man, what
                    could have gone through the plaintiff’s mind that caused him to waive such
                    a huge claim in favour of heavily reduced sum?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The plaintiff submits that he chose to waive
                    the other claims because he wanted a clean break from the defendants (see [114]
                    above). However, I find it inconceivable that the plaintiff would be so generous
                    if he genuinely believed that he was entitled to legitimate claims worth over
                    S$10m. If the plaintiff was confident that his other claims of over S$10m
                    legally belonged to him, why did he trade this huge sum for only S$79,113.67?
                    Why was there a need to waive his other entitlements if he was of the opinion
                    that the expenses incurred were reasonable and supported by documentary
                    proof?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    I also find that the plaintiff’s
                    explanation of wanting a clean break from the defendants unsatisfactory. Giving
                    up one’s legitimate claim is one thing, but I fail to see how it would
                    enable him to effect a clean break from the defendants. If he truly wished to
                    effect a clean break from the defendants, he could have pressed for all his
                    claims and negotiated for a full settlement instead of waiving a claim of almost
                    S$10m in favour of a much reduced sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    On the evidence, I find that it is likely
                    that the plaintiff was using his other claims as a bargaining chip to compel DW1
                    and D7 to reimburse his expenses. When he submitted his reimbursement claim, his
                    relationship with D7 was not the best and he must have wanted to claim what he
                    thought was rightfully his. The claim of S$79,113.67, on its own is a large sum
                    of money and additionally, the reimbursement claim was for reimbursements
                    stretching over a period of three years. There would have been issues of
                    documentation and proof arising and the plaintiff must have known that he would
                    encounter problems with his large reimbursement claim especially given his
                    strained relationship with D7 and the fact that he had already indicated his
                    wish to leave D7’s employment. Thus, it is probable that the plaintiff
                    purported to waive his huge claims amounting to over S$10m so that his chances
                    of a full reimbursement would be better. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, DW1
                    was not intimidated by the veiled threat of a potential huge claim and she
                    processed his reimbursement claims accordingly. The plaintiff’s lack of
                    belief in his entitlement to the bonuses and share payments will also be
                    relevant later at [127] to [197] when I consider his entitlement to them. In the
                    meantime, I shall focus on whether his offer to waive the other claims was
                    accepted by D7.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff did not waive his share rewards and bonus payment
                claims </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Third, I find that the plaintiff did not
                    waive his share rewards and bonus payment claims. There are two forms of the
                    waiver doctrine, <em>viz</em>, waiver by election and
                    waiver by estoppel. The former arises in the context of a binding contract when
                    a state of affairs results such that one party becomes entitled under the
                    contract to exercise a right and he has to choose whether or not to do so. The
                    latter arises when a person having legal rights against another unequivocally
                    represents by word or conduct that he does not intend to enforce those legal
                    rights. The other party acts or refrains from acting in reliance on that
                    representation such that it would be inequitable for the representor to later
                    enforce his legal rights inconsistently with his representation. Professor John
                    W Carter makes this clear in his article “Waiver (of Contractual Rights)
                    Distributed” (1991) 4 JCL 59 at p 65 where he comments that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the context of contractual rights, the emphasis on waiver in the sense
                        of estoppel is on the reaction on the person, against whom the contractual
                        right may be exercised, to the words or conduct of the other party.
                            <em>The emphasis of waiver in the sense of election is on
                            the reaction of the promise to the circumstances giving rise to the
                            inconsistent rights</em>. Out of this difference of focus
                        important differences of proof arise. <em>Proof of reliance
                            on the words or conduct, and detriment, although crucial to waiver in
                            the sense of estoppel are not required for waiver in the sense of
                            election</em>. Therefore, it is not necessary for a party relying
                        on waiver in the sense of election to produce evidence of either reliance or
                        detriment. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The Court of Appeal has also made important
                    observations regarding the differences between waiver by election and waiver by
                    estoppel. In <em>Chai Cher Watt (trading as Chuang Aik
                        Engineering Works) v SDL Technologies Pte Ltd and another appeal</em>
                    [2012] 1 SLR 152 at [33], Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA cited Lord Goff of
                    Chieveley in <em>Motor Oil Hellas (Corinth) Refineries SA v
                        Shipping Corp of India (The “Kanchenjunga”)</em> [1990]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 391 at 397–399, holding that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There is an important similarity between the two principles,
                        election and equitable estoppel, in that each requires an unequivocal
                        representation, perhaps because each may involve a loss, permanent or
                        temporary, of the relevant party’s rights. But there are important
                        differences as well. In the context of a contract, the principle of election
                        applies when a state of affairs comes into existence in which one party
                        becomes entitled to exercise a right, and has to choose whether to exercise
                        the right or not. His election has generally to be an informed choice, made
                        with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right. His election once made
                        is final; it is not dependent upon reliance on it by the other party. On the
                        other hand, equitable estoppel requires an unequivocal representation by one
                        party that he that he will not insist upon his legal rights against the
                        other party, and such reliance by the representee will render it inequitable
                        for the representor to go back upon his representation. No question arises
                        of any particular knowledge on the part of the representor, and the estoppel
                        may be suspensory only. <em>Furthermore, the representation
                            itself is different in character in the two cases. The party making his
                            election is communicating his choice whether or not to exercise a right
                            which has become available to him. The party to an equitable estoppel is
                            representing that he will not in future enforce his legal
                            rights</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The evidence does not suggest a waiver by
                    election in this case. When the plaintiff elected to waive his other claims by
                    virtue of his 17 July 2010 email (at [111] above), it seemed to be waiver by
                    election. However, it was unequivocally clear that the plaintiff’s waiver
                    was <em>conditional</em> on DW1’s reimbursing him
                    S$78,803.29. This was not done and since the condition was unfulfilled, there
                    was no waiver by election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    An alternative interpretation of the facts
                    can also be taken where the plaintiff made a representation to DW1 via his email
                    (at [111] above). DW1, in reliance on that representation, then reimbursed the
                    plaintiff such that it is now inequitable for the plaintiff to sue for the rest
                    of his claims. This would seem to be waiver by estoppel. However, I find that
                    the element of reliance is not made out. The S$25,109.15 reimbursement was not
                    premised on the plaintiff’s representation but on the fact that DW1 agreed
                    that the expenses that the sum was based on was incurred by the plaintiff in
                    accordance with the EA’s terms. Therefore waiver by estoppel cannot be
                    made out as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the plaintiff entitled to the Periodic Bonuses?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The plaintiff submits that he is entitled to
                    the Periodic Bonuses under cl 5.3 of the EA payable in relation to various
                    “Fund Raising Activities”. He also submits that he has a right to
                    the Annual Bonus as well as 0.5% of the funds raised for Project Gibson, Project
                    MP and the acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span> This claim is essentially an exercise
                    in contractual interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Before turning to the claim, the parties
                    made extensive submissions on whether a person can be entitled to bonuses as a
                    matter of right. I shall address their submissions on this point
                first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on bonuses</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The plaintiff submits that <em>Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston</em> [2000] 2
                    SLR(R) 30 (“<em>Latham Scott</em>”) at [57]
                    makes clear that the matter is one of construction. In his view, this is also
                    the approach adopted in the United Kingdom (“UK”): <em>Saleem Khatri v Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank
                        BA</em> [2010] EWCA Civ 397 (“<em>Khatri</em>”) at [22]. Therefore, he submits that the
                    fundamental duty of the court is to objectively ascertain the parties’
                    intentions at the time of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In this regard, Ms Dawn Tan Ly-Ru
                    (“Ms Tan”), the plaintiff’s counsel, submits that the fact
                    that the word “discretionary” can be found in the bonus clause is
                    not fatal to the issue of whether the bonus is a contractual entitlement:
                        <em>Mr C Small &amp; Others v The Boots Co Plc and
                        another</em> [2009] IRLR 328 (“<em>Boots</em>”) at [20]. In his view, while it is true that
                    Singapore and the UK approach the question as one of construction, <em>Latham Scott</em> is outdated and does not consider legal
                    developments in the UK.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span> Specifically, she submits that the UK position
                    is that the employer’s discretion is not an unfettered one and must be
                    exercised in a genuine and rational as opposed to an empty or irrational manner
                        (<em>Cantor Fitzgerald International v Horkulak</em>
                    [2004] EWCA Civ 1287 (“<em>Cantor
                    Fitzgerald</em>”) at [30]) while in Singapore, the employer’s
                    discretion is unfettered if the decision to grant the bonus is discretionary
                        (<em>Latham Scott</em> at [72]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In summary, Ms Tan submits that the law
                    should be developed such that in this case, the use of discretionary language
                    with respect to the Periodic Bonuses will not preclude the finding of a
                    contractual right<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_169" id="Ftn_169_1"><sup>[note: 169]</sup></a></span> and on a contextual approach,
                    factors such as the fact that the employee was employed in a lucrative and
                    competitive industry with a bonus culture to reward productivity and loyalty
                    will be accounted for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_170" id="Ftn_170_1"><sup>[note: 170]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    On the other hand, the defendants submit
                    that the law is trite. They submit that in <em>Latham
                        Scott</em>, the Court of Appeal held that the bonuses are entirely at
                    the company’s discretion and employees are usually not entitled to bonus
                    payments if the bonuses are undeclared.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span> This was the case
                    in <em>Tan Hup Thye v Refco (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in
                        members’ voluntary liquidation)</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1069
                        (“<em>Tan Hup Thye</em>”) as well, where
                    the court found that although there was a bonus payment formula in which the
                    employer shared profits with its employee in a competitive industry, there was
                    still no bonus entitlement (at [72]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My views on the law on bonus payments </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    What then, is the correct legal position in
                    relation to bonus payments under cl 5.3? I note that this issue had previously
                    been discussed by Lionel Yee JC in <em>Brader Daniel John and
                        others v Commerzbank AG</em> [2014] 2 SLR 81 at [102]–[106],
                    although ultimately there was no pronouncement of the law (at [106]). In my
                    view, fundamentally there is no major difference between the Singapore and the
                    UK approach, <em>ie</em>, the contractual interpretation
                    approach as held in <em>Zurich Insurance</em> and
                    contextual approach in the UK. The facts in <em>Latham
                        Scott</em> and the UK cases were sufficiently different such that on a
                    contextual approach, one could arrive at the outcomes reached by the Singapore
                    and the UK courts. Indeed, Assoc Prof Ravi Chandran (“Prof Ravi”)
                    comments in his article “Bonuses (and other payments) in
                    Employment” (2012) 24 SAcLJ 338 (“<em>Bonuses in
                        Employment</em>”) at para 51 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In relation to bonuses and other payments in employment, much depends
                        ultimately on the actual construction of the clause in question.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I now turn to examine the three UK cases raised by the
                        plaintiff in support of his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   Three UK cases: <em>Cantor Fitzgerald,
                    Boots</em> and <em>Khatri</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In <em>Cantor
                        Fitzgerald</em>, the court dealt with a derivative trader’s
                    right to discretionary bonuses. The claimant had occupied a senior management
                    position working on interest rate swaps in money markets. He was first employed
                    as a director, and subsequently promoted to Senior Managing Director with a
                    basic salary of £250,000 per annum. There were three bonus components under
                    his employment contract, one for a “once only” bonus of
                    £100,000, one for a guaranteed loyalty bonus of £100,000 and another
                    for a discretionary bonus. The third clause read (reproduced in <em>Cantor Fitzgerald</em> at [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition the Company … may in its discretion, pay you an annual
                        discretionary bonus which will be paid within 90 days of the financial
                        year-end (30 September) the amount of which shall be mutually agreed by
                        yourself, the Chief Executive of the Company and the President of Cantor
                        Fitzgerald Limited Partnership, however the final decision shall be in the
                        sole discretion of the President of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. … It is a

                        Global Interest Rate Derivatives Business and that you shall still be
                        working for and not have given notice to or attempted to procure your
                        release from this Agreement nor have given notice to the Company in
                        accordance with clause 11(h) on the date such bonus is due to be
                        paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The issue was whether in the context of a highly competitive
                        industry, the plaintiff had a contractual right to discretionary bonuses.
                        The court held that he did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    While the plaintiff was not entitled to the
                    discretionary bonus, the court however held that he was entitled to a <em>bona fide</em> and rational exercise of his employer’s
                    discretion (at [46]). This was because the clause provided a process by which
                    the employee, the Chief Executive and the President could attempt to come to a
                    mutual agreement on the issue and the court emphasised that the employer had to
                    consider the issue in a <em>bona fide</em> and rational
                    manner as opposed to a manner which was arbitrary. Thus, in order to give
                    “contractual value or content” to the clause, the court held that
                    the employer did not have an unqualified right to act in any manner he wanted
                    but had to act in a <em>bona fide</em> and rational manner
                    (at [47]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The next case is <em>Boots</em>, a case in which a warehouseman was paid performance
                    related bonuses until the warehouse operations and correspondingly the plaintiff
                    were transferred from Boots to Unipart. During the period in which the plaintiff
                    was employed by Unipart, no bonuses were paid to him while his colleagues who
                    continued working in Boots were paid bonuses. He sued for the bonuses which he
                    thought he was entitled to. His first ground of appeal was allowed and the
                    matter was remitted to the Employment Tribunal (at [64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The grounds of appeal in <em>Boots</em> dealt with which are relevant for our purposes are: (a)
                    whether the use of the word “discretionary” could answer the
                    question of the employee’s contractual entitlement to bonuses; (b) whether
                    a past practice of awarding contractual payments rendered the discretion being
                    construed as having contractual content; and (c) whether there were fetters on
                    the way the employer could exercise his discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    First, it was held that just because the
                    clause used the term “discretionary” it did not determine the
                    question of whether the employee had any contractual entitlement to the bonuses:
                    at [19]. On that basis, the matter was remitted to be heard by the Employment
                    Tribunal. The court held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he use of the term discretionary in a bonus scheme may be
                        attached to the decision whether to pay a bonus at all, its calculation or
                        its amount. No doubt there are other factors to which discretion may be
                        attached. <em>In determining whether the reference to a
                            discretionary bonus conferred any contractual entitlement, the
                            Employment Judge should have decided what aspect of the scheme the term
                            discretionary was attached</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Second, the course of dealing between the
                    parties was relevant in determining whether the employer’s discretion can
                    be construed as having contractual content and the trial judge had failed to
                    account for this: at [28]– [29].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Third, the court held that the discretion
                    must be exercised in rationally and in good faith: at [33].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The third case is <em>Khatri</em>, which concerned a summary judgment application by a
                    derivatives trader seeking to claim bonuses supposedly due under his employment
                    contract with the bank. The relevant clause read (reproduced at [11] of
                        <em>Khatri</em>):</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The context of the case was that the
                    trader’s basic salary was £40,000 per annum with “any future
                    applicable bonuses made entirely at the discretion of the bank on the basis of
                    your financial and managerial performance viewed across Rabobank
                    International”: at [6]. It was also undisputed that he “was good
                    at his job and regularly made money for the bank”: at [7]. He had
                    received large amounts as discretionary bonuses in the past (£150,000 in
                    2007) (at [9]) but wanted a new contract with performance related bonuses as he
                    considered that he had lost out compared with colleagues who had performance
                    related bonuses: at [10].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    It was against this backdrop that the
                    employment contract was changed. The trader’s basic salary was increased
                    to £100,000 with £50,000 as guaranteed bonus and a performance related
                    bonus linked to his performance. It was acknowledged that the guaranteed bonus
                    of £50,000 was to make up for the shortfall he had “suffered”
                    in 2007”: at [12]. As matters transpired, the employee made a profit of
                    €13,898,066 at the end of 2008. Applying the formula, he claimed for
                    €1,601,767.62 after being dismissed for redundancy: at
                [20]–[21].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Adopting a contextual approach, the court
                    held that the employee had a contractual entitlement to the sum claimed because
                    (a) the language of the clause contained words of entitlement; and (b) the facts
                    showed that the clause was replacing a previous discretionary entitlement
                    clause. The language of the clause meant that the bonus formula applied for 2008
                    might be different for the following year and if the banks wanted to reward
                    employees through a purely discretionary bonus, they should seek to say so
                    openly and not use the language of entitlement and later qualify it (at
                    [37]–[39]). Moreover, where bonus entitlements are discretionary, the
                    employer must act in a rational and fair manner, with the test being one of
                        <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness: at
                [8].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   The construction of bonus clauses adopts a contextual
                approach and seeks to effect the parties’ mutual intentions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The three cases above show that the courts
                    are ultimately engaged in an exercise of construction of the bonus clauses
                    through <em>mainly</em> interpretation and implication. A
                    contextual approach is adopted and that was the basis of the court’s
                    decision in <em>Khatri</em>, where the court’s
                    finding that the bonus was a contractual entitlement turned on the language of
                    the relevant clause in question together with the surrounding context of its
                    operation. That was also the basis on which I decided <em>Seow
                        Hock Hin v MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2014] SGHC 42
                        (“<em>Seow Hock Hin</em>”) – the
                    approval of the relevant persons was needed for the bonuses to be paid out but
                    had not been obtained: at [17].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    
          <em>Latham Scott</em>
                    also does not appear to be substantively different from the English position, if
                    one adopts a contextual approach when viewing that case. In <em>Latham Scott</em>, the issue was whether the plaintiff had lost his
                    chance to earn his bonus which he alleged he would otherwise have earned if not
                    for the defendant’s act of wrongfully terminating him: at [54]. The court
                    held that on the facts of that case, a proper construction indicated that the
                    clause granted the employer full discretion to decide whether to grant a bonus
                    to the employee and hence dismissed his claim: at [57]. There is no absolute
                    rule laid down by the courts that bonuses are discretionary in nature and
                        <em>Seow Hock Hin</em> at [18] states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It must be emphasised that the declaration of bonuses is at the sole
                        discretion of a company unless guaranteed under a contract of employment. In
                        many instances, a company may adopt a general guideline as to how to compute
                        the quantum of bonuses to be declared in the ordinary course of business.
                        However, a company should not in any way be fettered and bound by such
                        guidelines. The economic climate is always changing. Sometimes a company may
                        experience a windfall and sometimes it may face a lack of business. At other
                        times, a company … may even face financial difficulties of such an
                        extent that it eventually has to enter into liquidation – a situation
                        which cannot be described as being in the ordinary course of business. The
                        amount of bonuses declared by a company would thus inevitably be based on a
                        consideration of the economic climate and other relevant factors and vary in
                        the light of such changing circumstances. Therefore, although a guideline as
                        to bonus computation grants the employee a degree of certainty as to the
                        quantum of bonus he may receive, it should not tie the hands of the company
                        such that it can no longer depart from such a guideline if the economic
                        circumstances demand that it does so. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Finally, I agree with Prof Ravi that both
                    the UK and Singapore approaches are ultimately similar and focused on the
                        <em>intention of the parties</em> and I set out the
                    following passage from Bonuses in Employment (at para 46):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    It should also be noted that in <em>Latham</em>, the court accepted the principles laid down in
                                <em>Abrahams v Reiach</em> (where the
                            publishers in breach were held to be liable for damages, on the basis
                            that a reasonable number of books would have been published) and
                                <em>Lee Paula v Robert Zehil &amp; Co Ltd</em>
                            (where the distributors in breach were held to be liable for damages, on
                            the basis that they would have performed the contract using a reasonable
                            method), but distinguished them on the ground that those cases involved
                            situations where there was a breach of contractual obligations to
                            publish books and order garments, respectively. <em>Thus,
                                the essential point was that on the facts, the payment of bonus was
                                not part of the contractual obligation. In this regard, it is
                                suggested that the mere use of the word ‘discretion’
                                should mean that the bonus can no longer be a contractual
                                entitlement. Instead, as is the current position in the UK, all the
                                relevant circumstances have to be examined to ascertain the true
                                intention of the parties</em>. [original emphasis omitted;
                            emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   The term of mutual trust and confidence can apply in
                appropriate situations with respect to bonus payment clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    With respect to implication, the courts have
                    indicated their willingness to imply a term of mutual trust and confidence where
                    warranted. In <em>Johnson v Unisys Ltd</em> [2003] 1 AC 518
                        (“<em>Johnson</em>”) at [35]–[37],
                    Lord Hoffmann observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… At common law the contract of employment was regarded by the
                        courts as a contract like any other. The parties were free to negotiate
                        whatever terms they liked and no terms would be implied unless they
                        satisfied the strict test of necessity applied to a commercial contract.
                        Freedom of contract meant that the stronger party, usually the employer, was
                        free to impose his terms upon the weaker. <em>But over the
                            last 30 years or so, the nature of the contract of employment has been
                            transformed. It has been recognised that a person’s employment is
                            usually one of the most important things in his or her life. It gives
                            not only a livelihood but an occupation, an identity and a sense of
                            self-esteem. The law has changed to recognise this new
                            reality</em>. … And the common law has adapted itself to
                        the new attitudes, proceeding sometimes by analogy with statutory
                        rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    
              <em>The contribution of the common
                                law to the employment revolution has been by the evolution of
                                implied terms in the contract of employment. The most far reaching
                                is the </em>
<b><em>implied term of trust and
                                confidence</em></b>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Employment law requires a balancing of the interests of employers
                        and employees, with proper regard not only to the individual dignity and
                        worth of the employees but also to the general economic interest. Subject to
                        observance of fundamental human rights, the point at which this balance
                        should be struck is a matter for democratic decision. The development of the
                        common law by the judges plays a subsidiary role. Their traditional function
                        is to adapt and modernise the common law. But such developments must be
                        consistent with legislative policy as expressed in statutes. The courts may
                        proceed in harmony with Parliament but there should be no discord.</p>

                    view in <em>Tan Hup Thye</em> where it was held that the
                    position in Singapore is dissimilar to the UK position in so far as the issue
                    pertained to the employer’s exercise of his discretion. Prakash J’s
                    view is that the UK authorities appear to lean towards regulating the
                    employer’s <em>exercise</em> of their discretion in
                    relation to bonus payments while the position in Singapore favoured the view
                    that the employer’s discretion is entirely unfettered: at [69]–[71].
                    However, the implied term of mutual trust and confidence was not argued before
                    the court in <em>Tan Hup Thye</em> and since that decision,
                    the implied term of mutual trust and confidence has been accepted in Singapore
                    as an implied term in law subject to express terms stating otherwise or the
                    context implying otherwise (<em>Cheah Peng Hock v Luzhou Bio-Chem
                        Technology Ltd</em> [2013] 2 SLR 577 at [59]). Indeed, as observed by
                    Lord Hoffmann in <em>Johnson</em>, the implied term of
                    mutual trust and confidence could have ramifications on an employer’s
                    exercise of his discretion with respect to his awarding of bonuses to his
                    employee and the court should not be hesitant to consider the matter when the
                    appropriate case arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Therefore, whether the employee is entitled
                    to his bonuses must depend on the intention of the parties as reflected in the
                    employment contract and the circumstances of the case. There can be an
                    obligation for the employer to exercise his discretion in a <em>bona fide</em> and rational manner. There can also be situations in
                    which the employer reserves an absolute right to declare bonuses in whatever way
                    he deems fit. Such a clause will arise where clear words such as
                    “absolute” are used in relation to bonus entitlements (see
                        <em>Bonuses in Employment</em> at para 50). I turn now
                    to address the plaintiff’s entitlement to the Periodic
                Bonuses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff is not contractually entitled to the Periodic
                Bonuses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    It is my view that the plaintiff is not
                    contractually entitled to the Periodic Bonuses. Under cl 5.3 of the EA, the
                    plaintiff’s entitlement to the Periodic Bonuses is premised on the
                    following conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_a"></a>(a)     it is to be determined at the
                        “sole and absolute discretion of the CEO;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_b"></a>(b)     it is dependent on the performance of
                        the company; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_c"></a>(c)     it is dependent on the attainment of the objectives as determined by
                        the CEO.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The plaintiff submits that he was
                    contractually entitled to the Periodic Bonuses on a contextual interpretation of
                    the EA. First, he submits that both he and D7 were not strangers and had
                    developed a close working relationship dating back to their days at
                        Lereno<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_172" id="Ftn_172_1"><sup>[note: 172]</sup></a></span> and therefore the present facts are
                    different from <em>Tan Hup Thye</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The plaintiff next submits that the
                    “fund raising activities” were in relation to funds raised for
                    Project Gibson, Project MP and the acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties. He
                    says that he was entitled to 0.5% of the funds raised as funds were successfully
                    raised for all three activities and he was instrumental to the raising of those
                        funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_174" id="Ftn_174_1"><sup>[note: 174]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The defendants disagree. First, they submit
                    that the term “Fund Raising Activities” referred to
                    “obtaining monies from third party investors in RODA and CKRA as working
                    capital to develop and enhance the assets in order for those assets to generate
                    returns thereby increasing the value of the shares of RODA and
                        CKRA.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_175" id="Ftn_175_1"><sup>[note: 175]</sup></a></span> Based on this definition, the plaintiff had
                    failed to raise any money since the first and second public offerings for RODA
                    and CKRA had respectively failed to raise funds from the public and other
                    investors. The credit facilities obtained from DBS and RZB were only designed to
                    last for one or two business days, providing temporary liquidity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_176" id="Ftn_176_1"><sup>[note: 176]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, it was undisputed that the
                    acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties was a failure and D7 had lost money as
                    a result of that failed acquisition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Second, the defendants submit that with
                    respect to the financing of the acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties, cl
                    5.3 of the EA referred to “various Fund Raising Activities as verbally
                    expressed by the CEO prior to the signing of this Agreement” (see [8]
                    above). Prior to the EA’s signing, there were only two projects verbally
                    expressed by the CEO as involving fund raising: Project Gibson and Project MP.
                    Hence, transactions that arose subsequent to the EA’s signing could not
                    qualify as part of the Periodic Bonuses to be paid. This was admitted by the
                    plaintiff in cross-examination where he stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_177" id="Ftn_177_1"><sup>[note: 177]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">ARCH and the 21 Anderson second RZB facility was
                            not originally within the scope of your appointment at the time of
                            signing your employment agreement. You agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Therefore, they submit that cl 5.3 of the EA (see [31] above)
                        does not encompass the funds raised for acquiring the 21 Anderson
                            Properties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_178" id="Ftn_178_1"><sup>[note: 178]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Third, the defendants submit that the
                    plaintiff had failed to show that he was instrumental in the fund-raising
                    activities. D7 had testified that it was he and not the plaintiff who opened the
                    doors and paved the way for obtaining the facilities and transactions with DBS,
                    RZB and ARCH. Thereafter, the plaintiff was the liaison officer with those
                        institutions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_179" id="Ftn_179_1"><sup>[note: 179]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    The bank officers from DBS and RZB
                    corroborated D7’s testimony in this respect. These bank officers DW3, Ms
                    Chan Lie Leng (“Ms Chan”), the General Manager of RZB, and DW4, Ms
                    Tsng Boon Kiat (“Ms Tsng”), the Managing Director of the
                    Institutional Banking Group division of DBS testified that the plaintiff was not
                    instrumental in raising funds for the various companies. They testified that the
                    facilities would have been granted even without the plaintiff’s
                        involvement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_180" id="Ftn_180_1"><sup>[note: 180]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My decision </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    I reject the plaintiff’s claim for the
                    following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   The plaintiff does not have any contractual <em>entitlement</em> to the Periodic Bonuses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    First, the plaintiff does not have any
                    contractual entitlement to the Periodic Bonuses. It is a principle of
                    contractual interpretation that the meaning of an unclear word is known by its
                    context (<em>The Interpretation of Contracts</em> at p
                    394). The exercise of construction is based on a holistic evaluation of the
                        <em>whole contract</em>. Courts are not to be
                    excessively focused on any particular word, phrase, sentence, or clause: see
                    Gerard McMeel, <em>The Construction of Contracts: Interpretation,
                        Implication and Rectification</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed,
                    2011) (“<em>The Construction of
                    Contracts</em>”) at para 1.156.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Clause 5.3 of the EA states explicitly that
                    the Periodic Bonuses <em>may be paid</em> subject to the
                        <em>sole and absolute discretion</em> of D7. This is in
                    contrast to the Annual Bonus, which <em>shall</em> be paid
                    depending on the Group’s performance and attainment of objectives as
                    determined by D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_181" id="Ftn_181_1"><sup>[note: 181]</sup></a></span> It is clear therefore from the
                    EA that the discretionary bonuses cannot amount to an entitlement. There is also
                    no evidence to suggest that D7 breached any implied term of mutual trust and
                    confidence or that he exercised his discretion in a manner that was entirely
                        arbitrary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_182" id="Ftn_182_1"><sup>[note: 182]</sup></a></span> In any event, that was not the
                    plaintiff’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    For the above reason, I hold that the
                    plaintiff does not have an <em>entitlement</em> to the
                    Periodic Bonuses. That alone is sufficient to dispose of the plaintiff’s
                    Periodic Bonuses claim. For completeness, I will proceed to address his other
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   The conditions on which the Periodic Bonuses were premised
                upon were not met</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Next, I find that the plaintiff was not
                    entitled to the Periodic Bonuses as the conditions on which they were premised
                    were not met. First, a reading of cl 5.3 (see [8] above) shows that it is the
                    CEO/D7 who decides whether the plaintiff had done well enough to deserve the
                    Periodic Bonuses. It also provides for a range of periodic bonuses that can be
                    paid for fund raising activities. The range is from the minimum limit of 0.25%
                    to the upper limit of 0.5%, with D7 having the power to decide how much to
                    award. There is no evidence that this was done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    There was also no evidence to suggest that
                    any such bonus entitlements was approved or declared such the plaintiff is now
                    entitled to Periodic Bonuses for the three fund raising activities. The
                    plaintiff unilaterally assumed that he would have been awarded the highest
                    quantum of the bonuses. In other words, he declared his own
                bonuses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Second, the circumstances did not favour the
                    plaintiff’s case. Clause 5.3 appears to be performance-based and the three
                    fund raising projects were unsuccessful and loss-making. Under those
                    circumstances, it is inconceivable that D7 would have declared any Periodic
                    Bonuses payable to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   The plaintiff was not instrumental in the
                fund-raising</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Finally, the plaintiff’s
                    instrumentality is irrelevant and in any event, he was not instrumental to the
                    raising of funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The plaintiff submits that he was
                    instrumental in raising funds for Project Gibson, Project MP and the acquisition
                    of the 21 Anderson Properties. Since he had played a pivotal role in
                    successfully raising funds for the three projects, he argued that he was
                    entitled to the Periodic Bonuses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_183" id="Ftn_183_1"><sup>[note: 183]</sup></a></span> He submits
                    that without him, DBS and RZB would not have granted funds and the significance
                    of his role would determine whether he would be given the low end of the range,
                        <em>ie</em>, 0.25%, or the highest range, which is
                    0.5%. With respect to the acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties, the
                    plaintiff contends that even though money was lost, he should still be paid a
                    bonus because it was a rescue exercise to limit the damage suffered by the Group
                    and/or D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_184" id="Ftn_184_1"><sup>[note: 184]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The plaintiff’s account does not make commercial
                sense</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    In my view, whether the plaintiff was
                    instrumental in the fund raising projects is irrelevant in cl 5.3 as it is not a
                    criteria for the awarding of bonuses. I shall first deal with the
                    plaintiff’s submissions with respect to the funds raised for acquiring the
                    21 Anderson Properties. I find it hard to believe that the parties intended for
                    the minimisation of losses to constitute successful fundraising entitling the
                    plaintiff to such large bonuses. It did not accord with commercial sense. This
                    also could not have been the intention of the parties under cl 5.3 of the
                    EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The plaintiff did not seem to believe in the truth of his
                Periodic Bonuses claim </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Second, the plaintiff did not seem to
                    believe in the truth of his claims for Project MP and Gibson.. He did not claim
                    for his entitlements under cl 5.3 during his early days of his employment.
                    Moreover, in his email to DW1 dated 27 July 2010 when he told her that he was
                    prepared to waive his claims under the contract on full reimbursement of his
                    expenses, he did not mention his entitlement for those two projects but only
                    made specific reference to the 21 Anderson Properties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_185" id="Ftn_185_1"><sup>[note: 185]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(c)   The plaintiff’s account went against the accounts of
                DW3 and DW4</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Third, I find that the testimonies of DW3
                    and DW4 went against the plaintiff’s case. These witnesses testified
                    clearly that the plaintiff was not instrumental in obtaining the
                loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    DW3 testified that the plaintiff was first
                    introduced to her around July 2007 by D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_186" id="Ftn_186_1"><sup>[note: 186]</sup></a></span> At that time,
                    RZB already had an existing banking relationship with D7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_187" id="Ftn_187_1"><sup>[note: 187]</sup></a></span> The loan was granted on the account of D7 and
                    not the plaintiff, who merely held several meetings with RZB in which
                    “the details of the transaction were ironed out”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_188" id="Ftn_188_1"><sup>[note: 188]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff’s role was primarily to be
                    the contact person for obtaining supporting documents and information regarding
                    the transactions under the First RZB Loan and he was also the person with whom
                    DW3 discussed the structure and mechanism of the transactions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_189" id="Ftn_189_1"><sup>[note: 189]</sup></a></span> This was similarly the case for the Second RZB
                    Loan taken out with respect to the 21 Anderson Properties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_190" id="Ftn_190_1"><sup>[note: 190]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    According to DW3, the plaintiff’s
                    input was irrelevant to RZB’s decision to grant either the First RZB Loan
                    or the Second RZB Loan. His involvement was not the reason why the First RZB
                    Loan was granted as the bank had also put in a “fair bit of
                    effort” to ensure that the security provided was “bankable
                    credit” and that the credit risk was acceptable to the bank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_191" id="Ftn_191_1"><sup>[note: 191]</sup></a></span> She also stated in cross-examination
                    that she disagreed that the Second RZB Loan was granted by RZB because of the

                        facility,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_192" id="Ftn_192_1"><sup>[note: 192]</sup></a></span> or that his personal guarantee
                    was a significant reason for why RZB granted the Second RZB Loan to finance the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    DW4’s testimony also went against the
                    plaintiff’s account. The plaintiff submits that the following factors were
                    crucial to DBS in its consideration of whether to grant the loan
                    facility:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_172-p2_a"></a>(a)     the exposure to shares as
                        collateral for more than ten business days, cross-border risks and
                        appropriate cost of funds to charge;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_194" id="Ftn_194_1"><sup>[note: 194]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_172-p2_b"></a>(b)     the underlying credit risks where the borrower has
                        regular cashflow generating capability to service and repay the
                            loan;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_195" id="Ftn_195_1"><sup>[note: 195]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_172-p2_c"></a>(c)     the sell-down of exposure risks by
                        syndicating risks which requires a structure acceptable to other banks and
                        financial institutions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_196" id="Ftn_196_1"><sup>[note: 196]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    DW4’s story was otherwise. She
                    testified that for Project Gibson, the factors mentioned by the plaintiff that
                    supported his instrumental role were marginal or irrelevant to DBS’s
                    eventual approval of the loan facility. In DW4’s view, the first category
                    of factors were internal considerations considered to be the risk and return
                    factors while the second and third factors were not applicable to the
                        transaction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_197" id="Ftn_197_1"><sup>[note: 197]</sup></a></span><sup></sup></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    In view of DW3’s and DW4’s
                    testimonies, I find that the plaintiff had not successfully shown that he was
                    instrumental to the fund raising activities. The evidence from both DW3 and DW4,
                    who were independent witnesses, was credible, consistent and it corroborated
                    D7’s account, which is that the loans were disbursed from RZB and DBS
                    because of his financial standing and not the plaintiff’s ingenuity in
                    structuring the facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    In conclusion, I hold that the
                    plaintiff’s claim under cl 5.3 cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the plaintiff entitled to the share rewards under cll 5.4 and
                5.5?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The plaintiff’s share rewards claim is
                    premised on cll 5.4 and 5.5 of the EA in relation to Project Gibson and Project
                    MP respectively. There are several issues in relation to these clauses. First,
                    the parties disagree on whether Project Gibson and Project MP were completed,
                    which is also the premise on which the share rewards were to be granted. Second,
                    they disagree on what the plaintiff is entitled to. Third, they disagree on
                    whether the payment of 1.5% or 3% is dependent on the profitability of the two
                    projects. I shall now deal with these issues in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were Project Gibson and Project MP completed?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The plaintiff submits that he is entitled to
                    the share rewards once the CKRA and RODA RTOs were completed by virtue of cll
                    5.4 and 5.5 of the EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_198" id="Ftn_198_1"><sup>[note: 198]</sup></a></span> In his view, completion entailed
                    the completion of the RTOs and IPOs of Project Gibson and Project MP. The two
                    events were the triggers for the accrual of the plaintiff’s
                        entitlement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_199" id="Ftn_199_1"><sup>[note: 199]</sup></a></span> and the assets had been
                    monetised because D5 and D1 were able to raise funds from the banks when they
                    pledged their RODA and CKRA shares. This was consistent with the Group’s
                    and/or D7’s desire to hold on to the RODA and CKRA shares. Since they were
                    able to do that, it showed that the assets had been monetised and the projects
                        completed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_200" id="Ftn_200_1"><sup>[note: 200]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Since Project Gibson and Project MP were
                    completed, the plaintiff submits that he was entitled to 1.5% of 100% of the
                    RODA and CKRA shares obtained during the RTOs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_201" id="Ftn_201_1"><sup>[note: 201]</sup></a></span> This
                    is because the Handwritten Amendments only affect the quantum of the shares to
                    be awarded but nothing else.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_202" id="Ftn_202_1"><sup>[note: 202]</sup></a></span> It was meant to be a “like for
                    like” replacement of the term “minimum of 12 million
                        shares”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_203" id="Ftn_203_1"><sup>[note: 203]</sup></a></span> The acquisition was to be on terms found

                    shares could be acquired and essentially worked as a “loyalty

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    The defendants submit that the plaintiff did
                    not just fail to raise funds but also caused the failure of both projects.
                    Successful fund-raising would entail D5 and D1 selling their majority stakes in
                    RODA and CKRA respectively to third parties after asset injection and
                    monetisation were complete. That was unsuccessful, so there was no asset
                    enhancement or any prospect of monetising the assets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_206" id="Ftn_206_1"><sup>[note: 206]</sup></a></span> Since there was no money raised from
                    third party investors, the plaintiff was not entitled to anything.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_207" id="Ftn_207_1"><sup>[note: 207]</sup></a></span>
                    Additionally, the defendants allege that the asset injection for RODA and CKRA
                    was a failure and the transactions had to be unravelled.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_208" id="Ftn_208_1"><sup>[note: 208]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    The defendants also contend that the effect
                    of the Handwritten Amendments to cll 5.4 and 5.5 totally superseded the original
                    words of cll 5.4, 5.5 and Table 1 of the EA. Instead, according to D7, the
                    plaintiff would only be entitled to 1.5% in value of whatever amount that was
                    obtained on successful divestment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_209" id="Ftn_209_1"><sup>[note: 209]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    I am not convinced by the plaintiff’s
                    submission that Project Gibson and Project MP were completed after the asset
                    injection/monetisation had taken place for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   The plaintiff is unsure of his case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    First, the plaintiff is unsure of his case.
                    Ms Ho pointed out that the plaintiff appeared to be unsure about what
                    constituted completion in his amended SOC. With respect to Project MP, the
                    plaintiff initially stated that “Project MP was successfully completed
                    with the initial listing of [CKRA] on 17 January 2008”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_210" id="Ftn_210_1"><sup>[note: 210]</sup></a></span> Later, he amended
                    that portion of his SOC to read, “Project MP was successfully concluded
                    with the injection and/or monetisation of assets belonging to the Transpacific
                    Group and/or D7.” When questioned, the plaintiff explained that he had
                    made a “typographical error”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_211" id="Ftn_211_1"><sup>[note: 211]</sup></a></span> I find his
                    explanation unconvincing in light of the significant differences between the
                    original completion event and the subsequent amendment. Additionally, I find
                    that his original position was untenable because CKRA was already a listed
                    entity on the IDX even before Project MP was implemented.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_212" id="Ftn_212_1"><sup>[note: 212]</sup></a></span> Therefore CKRA could not be listed on
                    17 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Moreover, the plaintiff’s claim rests
                    on D1 and D5 holding onto the CKRA and RODA shares for 100% of their value.
                    However, there was no evidence given as to the value of those shares at the time
                    the projects were completed. The plaintiff’s counsel was also unable to
                    give a convincing explanation when pressed for the value of those
                        shares:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_213" id="Ftn_213_1"><sup>[note: 213]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    The plaintiff’s testimony reveals his
                    uncertainty with respect to the quantification and calculation of his
                    entitlement. He vacillated between being entitled to the shares and the value of
                    the shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_214" id="Ftn_214_1"><sup>[note: 214]</sup></a></span> If I accept the
                    plaintiff’s view that he is entitled to the share rewards under cll 5.4
                    and 5.5 upon the issuance of the rights issue at the RTO taking place, then the
                    date on which the rights issue and the RTO took place would also be the date on
                    which the shares would be vested in the plaintiff. That would also be the
                    cash-out date of the plaintiff’s entitlement to his shares. Hence the
                    value of RODA and CKRA would have been zero as there were no third party
                    investors who invested in them. Correspondingly, his entitlement of 1.5% or 3%
                    of 100% of the RODA and CKRA profits would also be zero.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    In my view, the operative date on which the
                    plaintiff’s entitlement under cll 5.4 and 5.5 is triggered must be when
                    the plaintiff ceased his employment with D7. This was clearly stated in cll 5.4
                    and 5.5, which refer to Table 1 of the Schedule in the EA. Table 1 refers to the
                    cessation of employment as the operative date on which the shares should be
                    cashed out and there was no evidence provided as to what was the value of CKRA
                    and RODA shares when the plaintiff left D7’s employment on 1 September
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_215" id="Ftn_215_1"><sup>[note: 215]</sup></a></span> It is most probable that the shares were
                    worthless at that point in time as there were no third party investors who
                    invested in them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The plaintiff commenced legal proceedings to
                    claim under both clauses about two years after his resignation. It is also
                    pertinent to note that the action was taken after CKRA and RODA had undergone
                    major restructurings which resulted in the enhancement of the valuation of these
                    entities. For Project Gibson, the plaintiff bases his claim on the net equity
                    value of RODA as of 30 December 2011 and he claims for US$4,663,020. As for
                    Project MP, the plaintiff’s claim of US$4,511,250 is based on the net
                    equity value of CKRA as of 2 April 2012. However, those dates could not be the
                    cash-out dates as the plaintiff had left the employment in September
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   The plaintiff’s evidence is inconsistent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Second, cross-examination revealed
                    inconsistencies in the plaintiff’s position that the asset
                    injection/monetisation into RODA and CKRA were successful. With respect to
                    Project Gibson, the plaintiff admitted that the asset injection into RODA was a
                    failure and had to be reversed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_216" id="Ftn_216_1"><sup>[note: 216]</sup></a></span> Neither was money raised from
                    third parties, as DW7, Tan Ting Yong, the director of the second defendant from
                    8 May 2009, said that D5 was a standby buyer and it was only if there were no
                    third parties who bought the RODA shares in the second rights issue that D5
                    would subscribe for the RODA shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_217" id="Ftn_217_1"><sup>[note: 217]</sup></a></span> As things turned out, no third
                    parties subscribed for the second rights issue and D5 was forced to purchase the
                    RODA shares on offer. There was therefore no successful
                completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    With respect to Project MP, no money was
                    raised for CKRA from third parties. This was because D7 was arrested and unable
                    to travel out of Indonesia, causing investors to be spooked and
                        afraid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_218" id="Ftn_218_1"><sup>[note: 218]</sup></a></span> Later, the plaintiff tried to
                    salvage his case by saying that there were a few individual shareholders who
                    took part in the second CKRA rights issue to raise funds from third
                        parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_219" id="Ftn_219_1"><sup>[note: 219]</sup></a></span> However he could not escape from
                    the fact that D1 had bought more than 99.99% of the entire share
                        subscription,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_220" id="Ftn_220_1"><sup>[note: 220]</sup></a></span> akin to the worst-case scenario predicted by
                    the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_221" id="Ftn_221_1"><sup>[note: 221]</sup></a></span> Yet his case was that the projects
                    were complete because the assets had been successfully monetised. I find this
                    unconvincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    Moreover, the plaintiff’s evidence
                    went against the intended project timeline.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_222" id="Ftn_222_1"><sup>[note: 222]</sup></a></span>
                    In his reply submissions, the plaintiff admitted that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_223" id="Ftn_223_1"><sup>[note: 223]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Project Gibson and Project MP refers to two large scale projects involving
                        RODA and CKRA respectively. These Projects were to be <em>completed over the long term</em>, beginning with the RTO of RODA
                        and CKRA respectively, followed by the development of RODA and CKRA’s
                        assets to enhance their value, <em>and culminating in the
                            successful divestment of the RODA and CKRA shares to third parties at a
                            profit</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    From his reply submissions, the plaintiff
                    appears to take the view that Project Gibson and Project MP were large-scale,
                    long-term projects that would eventually be monetised by selling the RODA and
                    CKRA shares to third parties at a profit. There was no distinct stage mentioned.
                    Yet, he submits that cll 5.4 and 5.5 draw a clear distinction between the
                    projects as a whole and a specific stage of the projects and the clauses
                    referred to “RTO/IPO” in the context of gaining control of the
                    target listed companies in Indonesia, which could be effected by: (a) listing a
                    private company by way of an IPO; or (b) doing a RTO of an already listed
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_224" id="Ftn_224_1"><sup>[note: 224]</sup></a></span> His view is that the
                    “RTO/IPO” referred to was confined to the RTOs of CKRA and RODA,
                    which were <em>limited</em> public offering shares fully
                    underwritten by the intended controlling parties rather than public offerings in
                    the true sense.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_225" id="Ftn_225_1"><sup>[note: 225]</sup></a></span> His evidence appeared
                    contradictory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    For the above reasons, I find that the
                    plaintiff had not established his case that the completion of Project Gibson and
                    Project MP was at the point of asset injection. It is undisputed that both these
                    projects failed to secure third party investors. In other words, the plaintiff
                    admitted that the worst-case scenario happened and the projects failed. It is
                    inconceivable that the parties would have included in the EA clauses that would
                    reward the plaintiff even when he failed to attain the objectives in Project
                    Gibson and Project MP and therefore I find that the plaintiff was not entitled
                    to the share rewards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What was the plaintiff entitled to?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Has the plaintiff shown that the parties’ intentions are for
                cll 5.4 and 5.5 to apply in tandem with the Handwritten Amendments?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    The next issue that I shall deal with is in
                    relation to the intention of the parties when D7 amended cll 5.4 and 5.5 by
                    inserting the Handwritten Amendments “1.5% for 100%” against the
                    margin of these clauses. The parties’ views on this diverged greatly and
                    they will be addressed below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    The starting point is that the law on
                    contractual interpretation is clear. It is concerned about the interpretation of
                    the parties’ intentions objectively ascertained (<em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another
                        appeal</em> [2013] 4 SLR 193 at [28]) and the question is what would
                    the express terms of the contract convey to a reasonable person with all the
                    background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties
                    at the time of the contract (at [33]). On that basis, I find that it is unclear
                    whether the Handwritten Amendments were made in substitution of the phrase
                    “a minimum of 12 million shares” which were not cancelled out in
                    cll 5.4 and 5.5. That was also the argument of the plaintiff. On the other hand,
                    D7 submits that cll 5.4 and 5.5 were too complicated for him and he made the
                    amendments in order to substitute cll 5.4 and 5.5 as well as Table 1 – in
                    his view, it was intended that if there were profits made from Project MP and
                    Project Gibson, he would give the plaintiff 1.5% of the profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In my view, the burden is on the plaintiff
                    to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Handwritten Amendments were
                    merely to substitute the phrase “a minimum of 12 million shares”
                    with the other aspects of the two clauses remaining binding on the parties.
                    Clauses 5.4 and 5.5 by themselves may not be helpful in ascertaining the
                    parties’ intentions. In this regard, the subsequent actions of the parties
                    in effecting the EA <em>can</em> have probative value in
                    helping the court to ascertain the parties’ intentions when they entered
                    into the EA. I find that if the plaintiff’s version was the true intention
                    of the parties at the time when the EA was signed, there should be evidence of
                    him asserting his rights under cll 5.4 and 5.5 of the EA. Unfortunately, there
                    was no indication from the plaintiff or the defendants that the plaintiff was
                    entitled to 1.5% of the profit with respect to Project MP and Gibson. The
                    earliest indication of that was when the plaintiff sent an email to DW1 in July
                    2010 to seek reimbursement of his expenses and where in return he was prepared
                    to waive his huge claims under cll 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5. As I have explained earlier
                    at [119]–[122], if the plaintiff truly believed at that point in time that
                    he was entitled under the EA to those claims, he would not have waived them for
                    the expenses. Between the plaintiff’s version and D7’s version I am
                    of the view that D7’s version is more probable as it accords with
                    commercial sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is the plaintiff entitled to 1.5% or 3% of the RODA and CKRA shares
                if his account was true?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    For completeness, I shall consider the
                    plaintiff’s claim that although the Handwritten Amendments were made, he
                    was promised 3% of the RODA and CKRA shares because of his good performance. The
                    plaintiff submits that while his original entitlement to the share rewards was
                    1.5% of the RODA and CKRA shares or their cash equivalent, the percentage was
                    later increased to 3%. He claims that this is because D7 was pleased with his
                    performance, especially in relation to the completion of Project Gibson, Project
                    MP and the Group’s property investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_226" id="Ftn_226_1"><sup>[note: 226]</sup></a></span> Pursuant to
                    this, the plaintiff seeks 3% of the RODA and CKRA shares or their cash
                        equivalent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_227" id="Ftn_227_1"><sup>[note: 227]</sup></a></span> As he had served 35 months from 1 August
                    2007, he claims to be entitled to the shares for free.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_228" id="Ftn_228_1"><sup>[note: 228]</sup></a></span> This is with reference to Table 1 in the
                        EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_229" id="Ftn_229_1"><sup>[note: 229]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    The defendants submit that if the court
                    finds that the plaintiff was indeed entitled to the share rewards, he should
                    only be entitled to 1.5% as there was never any agreement to increase his reward
                    to 3% of the shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_230" id="Ftn_230_1"><sup>[note: 230]</sup></a></span> Additionally, D7 testified that when he
                    wrote 1.5% of 100% against cll 5.4 and 5.5, he had explained to the plaintiff
                    that he would share with him 1.5% of the profit made from the two projects from
                    the divestment of the shares and if D7 did not make money, the plaintiff would
                    not be entitled to anything.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    I am unconvinced by the plaintiff in this
                    respect. First, the plaintiff did not plead this extra 1.5% in his original
                        SOC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_231" id="Ftn_231_1"><sup>[note: 231]</sup></a></span> He only mentioned it when it
                    was amended more than a year later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_232" id="Ftn_232_1"><sup>[note: 232]</sup></a></span> When
                    questioned about why he failed to include this in his SOC, he explained that he
                    had forgotten about it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_233" id="Ftn_233_1"><sup>[note: 233]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff also agreed that he had not provided any documentary evidence
                    regarding the notes leading up to the extra 1.5%. All there was to his claim was that D7 was happy with
                    his performance on the successful completion of Project MP and Project Gibson
                    and D7 promised to increase his share rewards from 1.5% to 3%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_234" id="Ftn_234_1"><sup>[note: 234]</sup></a></span> However, that was unconvincing –
                    why would D7 be happy with the outcome of Project MP and Project Gibson when
                    they failed to attain the objective of attracting third party
                investors?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Second, in the plaintiff’s email in
                    July 2010 to DW1 purporting to waive his other claims, he mentioned 1.5% and not
                    3% in relation to the share rewards. The July 2010 email would have been much
                    closer to the occasions when D7 had allegedly increased his share reward to 3%,
                        <em>ie</em>, in October 2008, October/November 2009 and
                    March/April 2010, but it only indicated 1.5% instead of 3% when it was only
                    about three or four months from the last occasion when D7 allegedly promised him
                    3%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    For the above two reasons, I am not
                    convinced of the plaintiff’s claim of his entitlement to 3% based on the
                    oral agreement asserted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are the share rewards independent of RODA and CKRA’s success
                and profitability?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Finally, the plaintiff submits that he is
                    entitled to the share rewards under cll 5.4 and 5.5 upon the issuance of shares
                    to D1 and D5 and subsequent monetisation of those shares for the two projects as
                    it is a loyalty scheme. This implied that his entitlement was regardless of the
                    success and profitability of these projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Was this the intention of the parties
                    vis-à-vis those clauses when they signed the EA? I find that when D7 amended
                    them by making the Handwritten Amendments, ambiguity resulted as those clauses
                    became open to different interpretations. On a contextual reading of the
                    clauses, I note that they are housed under the heading “Salary, bonuses,
                    stock earn-outs and benefits”, which deals with the plaintiff’s
                    remuneration, bonuses, benefits, <em>etc</em>. Generally,
                    they are provisions to reward the plaintiff when the Group did well and it would
                    seem logical that for the plaintiff to be entitled under cll 5.4 and 5.5, the
                    projects must be successful and it was only then that the plaintiff would be
                    given a share of the success.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    For the above reasons, I reject the
                    plaintiff’s share rewards claim under cll 5.4 and 5.5 of the EA. I shall
                    now proceed to consider the counterclaims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the plaintiff in breach of his directors’ duties?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">D3’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    D3 submits that the plaintiff breached his
                    directors’ duties when he performed his duties under the EA. The plaintiff
                    had been appointed as the President Director because of his financial expertise.
                    His role was to: (a) manage the day to day affairs of D3; (b) mentor DW1 such
                    that she was taught about property, banking and financing matters;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_235" id="Ftn_235_1"><sup>[note: 235]</sup></a></span> and
                    (c) ensure that the necessary financing arrangements were in place so that D3
                    could successfully complete its purchase of the 21 Anderson
                        Properties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_236" id="Ftn_236_1"><sup>[note: 236]</sup></a></span> However, he failed to raise the
                    necessary financing which resulted in the failure to acquire the 21 Anderson
                        Properties<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_237" id="Ftn_237_1"><sup>[note: 237]</sup></a></span> and led to the seller of the 21
                    Anderson Properties commencing legal action against D3 to compel the completion
                    of the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    In order to raise sufficient funds, the
                    Second RZB Loan facility was entered into by D6, D3, Springfield and RZB in
                    order to finance the purchase of the 21 Anderson Properties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_238" id="Ftn_238_1"><sup>[note: 238]</sup></a></span>
                    Despite the Second RZB Loan facility being obtained, issues arose and RZB called
                    on the loan, causing D6, D3 and Springfield to sell the 21 Anderson Properties
                    to ARCH at a loss.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_239" id="Ftn_239_1"><sup>[note: 239]</sup></a></span> Hence it was necessary to raise money
                    to repay the Second RZB Loan by 8 July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_240" id="Ftn_240_1"><sup>[note: 240]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    To effect the sale of the 21 Anderson
                    Properties to ARCH, D3 and Springfield entered into the ARCH MOU. This was to be
                    signed on 5 July 2010. However, DW1 submits that the plaintiff failed to turn up
                    for the signing of the ARCH MOU and was uncontactable for the next few days,
                    thus jeopardising the conclusion of the transaction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_241" id="Ftn_241_1"><sup>[note: 241]</sup></a></span> After that, the
                    plaintiff did not do a proper handover of the 21 Anderson Properties project and
                    left her to pick up the pieces with limited information and
                        assistance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_242" id="Ftn_242_1"><sup>[note: 242]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore, the plaintiff breached his directors’ duties to
                D3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    The plaintiff first submits that D1 to D6
                    were mistaken about the circumstances surrounding the completion of the ARCH
                    MOU. It was to be executed in counterparts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_243" id="Ftn_243_1"><sup>[note: 243]</sup></a></span> Hence, there was
                    neither need for the signatories to be physically present at the same location
                    nor need for a “signing ceremony” that would have required the
                    plaintiff’s or ARCH’s representative’s attendance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_244" id="Ftn_244_1"><sup>[note: 244]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    Second, the plaintiff submits that his
                    resignation was not a surprise. He had indicated as early as December 2009 that
                    he would resign if the starch factories owned by CKRA were not operational by
                    the end of July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_245" id="Ftn_245_1"><sup>[note: 245]</sup></a></span> It was also untrue that he was
                    intentionally uncontactable before tendering his resignation on 27 August 2010.
                    He had tendered his resignation to Dr Patrick Loh (“Dr Loh”), the
                    Chairman of RODA and CKRA, on 5 July 2010 with the resignation embargoed till 16
                    July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_246" id="Ftn_246_1"><sup>[note: 246]</sup></a></span> He had emailed D7 and DW1 on 5 July 2010
                    at 2.49pm with the final ARCH document and an explanation that the deal was to
                    be signed in counterparts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_247" id="Ftn_247_1"><sup>[note: 247]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    Third, the plaintiff submits that it is also
                    untrue that the plaintiff had failed to handover the project properly as he
                    continued to provide assistance to D7 and his companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_248" id="Ftn_248_1"><sup>[note: 248]</sup></a></span>
                    Additionally, the plaintiff alleged that the resignation letters dated 27 August
                    2010 had been forged and falsified since he had resigned on 5 July
                        2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_249" id="Ftn_249_1"><sup>[note: 249]</sup></a></span> with the letters of resignation
                    dated 1 July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_250" id="Ftn_250_1"><sup>[note: 250]</sup></a></span> However, DW1’s hypothesis for the
                    discrepancy was that while the plaintiff had resigned in July, Dr Loh had
                    requested the plaintiff to post-date the letters of resignation to August 2010
                    as it reflected badly on RODA and CKRA should they not have a President
                    Director. Therefore, the letters of resignation dated August 2010 were to give
                    the regulators some semblance of a proper handing over.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_251" id="Ftn_251_1"><sup>[note: 251]</sup></a></span> In this regard, I should mention that
                    I prefer DW1’s account as the plaintiff’s case is premised on
                    fraudulent behaviour and he has to provide cogent evidence to prove his
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    The plaintiff denies these allegations. He
                    submits that D1, D3, D5 and D6 were in breach of the EA and had therefore come
                    to court with unclean hands. I shall now address D3’s
                allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff did not breach his duty to act honestly</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    First, I find that the plaintiff had acted
                    honestly. The circumstances showed that he was honestly mistaken regarding the
                    need for his presence at the ARCH MOU signing. While he had thought that the
                    agreement was to be executed in counterparts, the other parties did not think so
                    and therefore they arranged for a meeting to sign the ARCH MOU on the morning of
                    5 July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_252" id="Ftn_252_1"><sup>[note: 252]</sup></a></span> On 5 July 2010 at 11.09am, Arch Capital
                    sent the following email to the plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Andrew [the plaintiff]/Charles,</p>

                        Springfield. Charles will sign for Arch Capital. <b><em>For

                        me the signed document with original by courier… .</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This was followed by an email from the plaintiff to D7 and DW1
                        setting out the ARCH MOU’s terms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_253" id="Ftn_253_1"><sup>[note: 253]</sup></a></span>
                        Subsequently, Arch Capital replied the plaintiff on 6 July 2010 at 7.19pm
                        stating that D7 had signed the ARCH MOU and giving instructions for
                        follow-up action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_254" id="Ftn_254_1"><sup>[note: 254]</sup></a></span> This probably explains why the
                        plaintiff embarked on his own course of action to sign the documents in
                        counterparts with no knowledge that there was a meeting fixed for D7 to sign
                        the ARCH MOU on the morning of 5 July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_255" id="Ftn_255_1"><sup>[note: 255]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    That being the case, there is no basis to
                    find the plaintiff dishonest if he was acting in the company’s best
                    interests: <em>Walter Woon</em> at para 8.10. In fact, the
                    plaintiff sent an email to DW3 disclaiming responsibility for any of D7 or
                    DW1’s acts. The email reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_256" id="Ftn_256_1"><sup>[note: 256]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Andrew [the plaintiff],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Is MOU with ARCH executed? Please provide us a copy if it is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear [DW3],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As [D7] himself disclosed, there are some significant familial
                        repositioning, and <b><em>I am unable to accept responsibility
                            or act for any of them until they make a clear cut and irrevocable
                            decision.</em></b> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    In the circumstances, I find that the
                    plaintiff was not in breach of his directors’ duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff did not breach his duty of care, skill and
                diligence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    Second, the plaintiff did not breach his
                    duty of care, skill and diligence. This duty arises under common law and in
                    equity (Andrew Keay, <em>Directors’ Duties</em>
                    (Jordan Publishing Limited, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“<em>Directors’ Duties</em>”) at para 8.1). The standards to
                    which a director is held to may not necessarily be the same in all cases and
                    there are two different thresholds in determining whether a director has acted
                    with skill and whether he has acted with diligence. The former necessitates a
                    factual enquiry into his position and any special skill possessed by the
                    director while the latter involves conscientiousness, energy and attentiveness
                    that is required to ensure the company’s affairs are managed carefully:
                        <em>Directors’ Duties</em> at paras 8.127 and
                    8.135.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   The plaintiff did not breach his duty to act with reasonable
                care and diligence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    It is trite that directors owe a duty to the
                    company to take reasonable care and diligence in the performance of their
                    duties. In <em>Lim Weng Kee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 848 at [26]–[28], Yong Pung How CJ held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The policy under this modern approach is clear: a person who
                        accepts the office of director undertakes the responsibility that he
                        understands the nature of the duty required of that office. That duty will
                        vary depending on the circumstances, the size and the business of the
                        particular company and the experience or skills that the director held
                        himself out to possess in support of appointment to that office.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    A similar view was held by Hoffman J in <em>Re D’Jan of London Ltd</em> [1994] 1 BCLC 561
                            (Chancery Division) where he decided that the duty of care owed by a
                            director at common law is the conduct of a reasonably diligent person
                            having both (a) the general knowledge, skill and experience that may
                            reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as
                            are carried out by that director in relation to the company; and (b) the
                            genral knowledge, skill and experience which that director has. As
                            pointed out by Professor Davis in <em>Gower’s
                                Principles of Modern Company Law</em> (sixth Ed) at p 642, the
                            crucial difference with the traditional approach is that limb (b) adds a
                            subjective standard which can operate only to increase, and not decrease
                            the level of care and diligence required by the director.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    
              <em>The law hence stands as thus:
                                the civil standard of care
                                and diligence expected of a director is
                                objective, namely, whether he has exercised the same degree of care
                                and diligence as a reasonable director found in
                                his position. This standard is not fixed but a continuum depending
                                on various factors such as the individual's role in the company, the
                                type of decision being made, the size and the business of the
                                company. However, it is important to note that, unlike the
                                traditional approach, this standard will not be lowered to
                                accommodate any inadequacies in the individual's knowledge or
                                experience. The standard will however be raised if he held himself
                                out to possess or in fact possesses some special knowledge or
                                experience.</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    I find that the plaintiff is not in breach
                    of his duty to act with reasonable care and diligence. He was genuinely of the
                    view that the ARCH MOU was to be signed in counterparts as per the Arch Capital
                    email. I also disbelieve the allegation that he was uncontactable as he had sent
                    several emails out on 5 July 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_257" id="Ftn_257_1"><sup>[note: 257]</sup></a></span> and
                    while he did not contest DW1’s evidence that he did not answer his phone
                    even though they sought to call him many times,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_258" id="Ftn_258_1"><sup>[note: 258]</sup></a></span> he
                    might not have seen the need to return DW1’s calls bearing in mind that
                    his relationship with DW1’s father, D7, was not the best at that time. He
                    had also tendered his resignation around that time and to his mind, the ARCH MOU
                    was completed and he had done his part to achieve its completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    In addition, the plaintiff was a liaison
                    officer who assisted in the fundraising efforts. When he was assigned to raise
                    the necessary funds for D3’s acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties, he
                    sent DW1 the necessary documents with the necessary instructions to effect the
                    acquisition. In spite of their deteriorating relationship, the plaintiff took
                    the effort to explain to D7 and DW1 in details the terms of ARCH MOU. Given
                    these circumstances, I find that the plaintiff did not breach his duty of
                    reasonable care and diligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   The plaintiff did not breach his duty to act
                skilfully</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Second, directors are under a duty to
                    discharge their duties skilfully. In the words of Clarke and Sheller JJA in
                        <em>Daniels and others (formerly practising as Deloitte
                        Haskins &amp; Sells) v Anderson and others</em> (1995) 16 ACSR 607 at
                    667:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Skill is that special competence which is not part of the
                        ordinary equipment of the reasonable man but the result of aptitude
                        developed by special training and experience which requires those who
                        undertake work calling for special skill not only to exercise reasonable
                        care but measure up to the standard of proficiency that can be expected from
                        persons undertaking such work. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    The standard to which directors are held to
                    varies according to whether they are in an executive position, whether they have
                    specific managerial responsibilities and whether they have a contract of
                    employment with the company and the duty of skill owed must be referenced to the
                    objective body of knowledge and expertise possessed by those in the same
                    calling: <em>Walter Woon</em> at para 8.107.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    I hold that the plaintiff did not breach his
                    duty to act with skill. The plaintiff was hired, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to assist in obtaining the necessary financing for the
                    acquisition of the 21 Anderson Properties (see [203] above) and it was
                    D3’s position that the plaintiff was just a liaison between D3 and the
                    financiers, RZB and ARCH. In such circumstances, I find that the plaintiff did
                    not breach of any duty of skill as it is not disputed that he did the necessary
                    to ensure that the ARCH MOU documents were in place for the parties to sign in
                    counterparts as requested by Arch Capital.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff did not misuse the defendants’ documents by using
                them in these proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    Third, the plaintiff did not breach his duty
                    by using documents belonging to the defendants. The law is that directors have a
                    duty not to place themselves in situations where the interests of the company
                    which he is bound to protect comes into conflict with either his personal
                    interest or the interests of a third party for whom he acts: <em>Walter Woon</em> at para 8.40. It is undisputed that the information
                    and documents were acquired as a result of the plaintiff’s directorship in
                    D3 and the question is whether the plaintiff’s use of the documents in the
                    present proceedings is improper. The no-conflict rule extends to refraining from
                    using information and documents acquired by virtue of his position to make an
                    improper profit for himself: <em>Walter Woon</em> at para
                    8.45.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    In <em>Es-me Pty Ltd v
                        Parker</em> [1972] WAR 52, a director was alleged to have committed a
                    breach of s 124(2) of the Companies Act 1961 (No 6839 of 1961) (Aust) in that he
                    improperly used secret or confidential information for his own personal gain. In
                    interpreting that section, Burt J held at 55 that for confidentiality to be made
                    out, information need not be secret but must be confidential in the sense that
                    apart from the statute, it would be a breach of the officer’s fiduciary
                    duty to use that information to gain an advantage for himself. While this
                    definition does not assist on what use of information amounts to a breach of
                    fiduciary duty, <em>Walter Woon</em> at para 8.45 suggests
                    that the use of information acquired by a director to make a profit for himself
                    without disclosing that profit to the company would amount to a breach of a
                    director’s fiduciary duty. Whether the use of information acquired by a
                    director is improper must then be judged with reference to the director’s
                    duty to act in the company’s interests and that would in turn depend on
                    the nature and scope of the fiduciary relationship owed to the company:
                        <em>Tay Choo Wah v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 725 and <em>Selangor United Rubber
                        Estates Ltd v Craddock (No 3)</em> [1968] 1 WLR 1555.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    In this case, the plaintiff did not use the
                    information and documents for any other purpose other than to gain access to
                    justice in his claim against his former employer. There was no evidence to
                    suggest that he misused his access to documents and used them for profit or to
                    his advantage. Therefore, I hold that this counterclaim fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the plaintiff in breach of confidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    The Four Counterclaimants also claim that
                    the plaintiff was in breach of confidence because he had access to confidential
                    information belonging to them in the course of his work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_259" id="Ftn_259_1"><sup>[note: 259]</sup></a></span> They submit
                    that the plaintiff’s duty of confidentiality arises at common law since
                    they are owners of the confidential documents and the plaintiff misused those
                    documents for his own benefit at their expense in breach of his contractual
                    obligations. Moreover, the plaintiff also had a duty of confidentiality to D1
                    and D3 under s 157(2) of the Companies Act as he was the secretary and a
                    director of D1 and D3 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    Clause 3.1 of the EA is the confidentiality
                    clause that governs the contracting parties. It is not applicable here as the EA
                    is between the plaintiff and D7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    The plaintiff denies that he is in breach of
                    his confidentiality obligations by wrongfully retaining and taking confidential
                    documents relating to Project Gibson and Project MP in both in his pleaded case
                    and under cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_260" id="Ftn_260_1"><sup>[note: 260]</sup></a></span> He also submits that the defendants
                    are unable to show any loss or damage suffered as a result of the
                    plaintiff’s alleged breaches and thus even if he was in breach of
                    confidence, any damages awarded against him should be nominal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_261" id="Ftn_261_1"><sup>[note: 261]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    It is trite that a duty of confidentiality
                    can arise either from the express or implied terms of a contract. It can also
                    arise out of a relationship under which information is imparted: R G Toulson
                    &amp; C M Phipps, <em>Confidentiality</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2012) (“<em>Toulson &amp;
                        Phipps</em>”) at para 2–018. As the types of
                    relationships in which a duty of confidentiality can arise are manifold, the
                    test is whether “a reasonable person would understand [the information]
                    as involving an obligation of confidentiality”: <em>Toulson &amp; Phipps</em> at para 3–008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    It is undisputed that the plaintiff had
                    obtained the documents through his employment under the EA and through his
                    directorship with D3. The Four Counterclaimants submit that the confidential
                    documents obtained by the plaintiff contain sensitive internal correspondence,
                    sensitive information relating to correspondence with banks on the provision of
                    loan facilities, Project MP, Project Gibson and the acquisition of the 21
                    Anderson Properties. They are not freely accessible to the public and should
                    therefore not be used for any other purpose other than for one’s duties
                    with the relevant companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_262" id="Ftn_262_1"><sup>[note: 262]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    I find that while the information and
                    documents are confidential, there was no breach of confidence by the plaintiff.
                    The duty to maintain confidentiality is not an unqualified one and the scope of
                    confidence is not so wide such that the confidential information cannot be used
                    for the purposes of establishing one’s claim. In <em>Esso
                        Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman</em> (1995) 128 ALR 391 at 406, such
                    an exception was recognised in the context of arbitration agreements, where
                    Brennan J held that where there is no provision for confidentiality under an
                    arbitration agreement, a term would be implied that the other party will keep
                    the documents produced and the information disclosed confidential unless
                    disclosure is fairly required for the protection of the party’s legitimate
                    interests. <em>Toulson &amp; Phipps</em> at paras
                    3–175 and 3–179 to 3–180 comments that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3–175 Another purpose for which it may be
                            necessary for a party to refer to information otherwise confidential is
                            in order to establish or protect his legal rights against other parties
                            or to defend himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3–179 It is
                            suggested that the legitimate interests of the confidant may in
                            appropriate cases include disclosure to another party who has a
                            legitimate interest in the matter, for example, disclosure by a wholly
                            owned subsidiary to a holding
                            company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3–180 A possible
                            approach is to say that it is all a matter for the court’s
                            discretion. In <em>Webster v James Chapman &amp;
                                Co</em> Scott J. said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The court must, in each case where protection of confidential
                            information is sought, balance on the one hand the legitimate interests
                            of the plaintiff in seeking to keep the confidential information
                            suppressed and on the other hand the legitimate interests of the
                            defendant in seeking to make use of the information. There is never any
                            question of an absolute right to have the confidential information
                            protected. The protection is the consequence of the balance to which I
                            have referred coming down in favour of the plaintiff.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    Balancing the rights of the plaintiff and
                    Four Counterclaimants, I find that the balance lies with the plaintiff.
                    Disclosing the confidential information for the purposes of legal proceedings is
                    necessary for the plaintiff to have access to justice and establish his legal
                    rights. They were disclosed in the interests of justice and to enable the truth
                    to be elucidated, facilitating the litigation process. Therefore, there was no
                    breach of confidentiality by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    As this has been a long judgment, my
                    findings with respect to the plaintiff’s claims are summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_a"></a>(a)     D7 was the plaintiff’s
                        counterparty to the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_b"></a>(b)     The <em>contra proferentem</em>
                        rule should not be applied against the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff is not entitled to the
                        remainder of his expenses claimed for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff did not waive his claims to the bonus
                        payment and share rewards.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff is not entitled to the Periodic
                        Bonuses.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
                        plaintiff is not entitled to the share rewards under cll 5.4 and 5.5 of the
                        EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    I also dismiss the counterclaims of D1, D3,
                    D5 and D6 entirely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    Therefore, I dismissed both the
                    plaintiff’s claim and counterclaims. I shall hear the parties with regards
