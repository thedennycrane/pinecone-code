In my view, there was nothing ambiguous about the wording of clause 4, which indicated quite clearly that early repayment of the outstanding loan and interest by the plaintiff was permitted.  As such, I found that the various arguments by the defendant that the plaintiff was not allowed to repay the loan early were rather spurious.  Indeed, these arguments obscured the true objection that the defendant was raising, which was that the plaintiff was not permitted to repay the loan and redeem its mortgage early, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">unless</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> it also made full payment of the full interest over the entire 12-month tenor of the loan.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The real question in dispute before the court in these proceedings was the amount of interest to be paid by the plaintiff in the case of early repayment.  Was the full interest over 12 months already earned by the defendant upon the full disbursement of the loan on 17 May 2021, such that any early repayment by the plaintiff would require the payment of the principal and the full 12 months of interest (which worked out to S$10,080,000, being 3.5% interest per month for 12 months in relation to the principal loan amount of S$24m)?

If the intent </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">of the parties was that all 12 months of interest was incurred upon the disbursement of the loan, clause 5.1.1 would not have been worded in the way it was.

I found that such an argument was neither here nor there, and it ignored the words used in clause 5.1.1 as to how and when interest would accrue.  As for the defendant’s argument that the phrase “actual number of days elapsed” was to take into account the possible extension of the loan tenor for a further 12 months, I did not see how this would follow logically from these words used in clause 5.1.1.  After all, an extension of the loan tenor by 12 months would simply mean, if one was to follow the flow of the defendant’s arguments, that the interest over the next 12 months would again accrue immediately at the beginning of the second 12-month period.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">As for the defendant’s reliance on the first and third sentences in clause 5.1.1 (see [14] above) respectively that interest was chargeable “at the rate of 3.5% per month” and that “[i]nterest shall be payable in advance at the start of each calendar month and on the Due Date”, I found that this simply indicated the rate of interest and when it fell due to be paid.  These words do not determine how interest would be calculated if early repayment was made on any specified date that may be agreed by the parties as the date of redemption.  For that, one has to refer to the second sentence in clause 5.1.1 which deals with the precise question of when interest accrues, which is “day to day”, and based on “the actual number of days elapsed”.  The latter is clearly a reference to a calculation of the accrued interest up to a particular date, such as the actual date of repayment of the loan and redemption of the mortgage.   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The defendant then referred to clause 2.1.5 of the Loan Agreement, which it claimed required the plaintiff to provide eleven post-dated cheques towards interest for the 12-month loan tenor as a condition precedent for the disbursement of the loan (see [36] above).

Thus, clause 2.1.5 simply pointed back to clause 5.1.1 and it was that latter clause that had to be examined in order to determine when interest accrued on the loan and how it was to be calculated up to any particular date.  In this regard, I agreed with the plaintiff’s submission at the hearing that, if there was any early repayment of the loan and the accrued interest up to the date of such repayment, the plaintiff would clearly be entitled to countermand all uncashed post-dated cheques, if such cheques had indeed been given to the defendant prior to the loan’s disbursement.    </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) "></span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The pre-contractual negotiations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The defendant also argued that, in interpreting the contractual provisions, regard should be had to the parties’ negotiations leading to the signing of the Loan Agreement.

I thus did not accept the submission by the plaintiff that reliance on pre-contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and defendant would necessarily violate the parol evidence rule, which is encapsulated in s 94 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“EA”).  It all depends on the purpose for which the extrinsic evidence is referred to.  If the defendant was relying on the evidence of negotiations to introduce new terms into the Loan Agreement, I would agree with the plaintiff that such an attempt should be rejected because of the parol evidence rule.  Not only that, the parties had also specifically included an “entire agreement” clause in the Loan Agreement at clause 21 (see [16] above).  The effect of a usual “entire agreement” clause is to preclude any party to the contract from asserting that there are other terms which formed part of the contractual bargain between the parties, but which were not included in the written contractual document (see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">eg</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Lee Chee Wei</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[25])</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

Otherwise, the reference to the pre-contractual negotiations would often stray into attempts to persuade the court to re-write the contract by the introduction of terms that are not found in the written document (see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Zurich Insurance </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [122]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">).  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In this case, the defendant submits that its reference to pre-contractual negotiations was not an attempt to introduce a term into the Loan Agreement, but it was to assist in the interpretation of the contractual document.  As I have already stated, this is permissible.  However, the defendant made no serious attempt to identify exactly which clause or term or expression in the Loan Agreement its reference to the pre-contractual negotiations seeks to assist in interpretation.  In my view, this was an insurmountable hurdle in the defendant’s attempt to refer to the pre-contractual negotiations on the interest payable if there was early repayment.  Be that as it may, I did proceed to review the evidence of pre-contractual negotiations on this issue of interest that the defendant sought to rely on to determine if the requirements for their admission as extrinsic evidence were otherwise met.  I set out the evidence in the record of such negotiations in the following paragraphs.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">As earlier mentioned (see [8] above), negotiations began in early April 2021.  The possibility of early repayment was raised in a WhatsApp exchange on 21 April 2021 between Tan, who as explained above (at [8]) was one of the parties who represented the plaintiff in negotiations, and Lee, who as earlier explained (at [8]) is the chairman and executive director of the defendant and who was intimately involved in the negotiations.</span>

This is for several reasons.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">First, it is quite apparent from the chronology of correspondence above that the issue of interest in the case of early repayment was not only the subject of correspondence exchanged between the parties, but also oral discussions that might have taken place between different individuals representing the plaintiff and the defendant.  In other words, the picture presented to the court does not appear entirely complete in terms of the discussions between the parties on this issue.  One indication of this is in Sen’s email of 6 May 2021 (see [53] above) when he referred to discussions on the issue of interest in the case of early repayment.  Another instance is in Lee’s email of 11 May 2021 (see [59] above) where he refers to the fact that the parties had discussed the issue of interest “many times”.  In their affidavits, the parties had not elaborated on the contents of those discussions and whether any common understanding was actually reached on this issue in the course of those discussions.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Second, it does not appear to me from the written correspondence referred to by the defendant that they clearly show that the parties understood and intended that the plaintiff must pay the full interest for 12 months even in the event of early repayment.  As mentioned (at [58] above), Drew &amp; Napier had proposed the inclusion of a prepayment clause, which would fix the amount payable as a “fee” for prepayment at 3% of the principal amount of the loan.  In reply, the defendant’s Lee stated in an email dated 11 May 2021 to Eva Wong of Drew &amp; Napier that “[a]s at signing no prepayment. Both parties are open to negotiate the prepayment for full redemption or partial payment … So the penalty would be discounted based on willing borrower and willing lender basis at the time of negotiations which would range between the full term penalty and zero penalty … ”.</span>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">  This was somewhat similar to what he had stated in his earlier email of 10 May 2021 to his solicitor, Dorothy Tay, on the same issue, which had been copied to some of the representatives of the plaintiff (see [56] above).  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In short, it appears to me that Lee was suggesting that, if there was going to be early payment of the loan by the plaintiff, the parties could discuss, when that time came, how much interest would be paid by the plaintiff as a “penalty” for early repayment.  I should say that it is clear from the use of the words “full term penalty” and “zero penalty” in Lee’s email of 11 May 2021 (see [63] above) that Lee must have been referring to whether the full amount of interest would be payable or interest only up the date of repayment.  In other words, Lee was saying that the issue of the amount of interest would be up for discussion at that time.  It is significant that Lee did not state that, upon early repayment, interest for the full loan tenor must be paid, but subject to any waiver by the defendant of its right to insist on the full interest after the parties had had an opportunity to discuss the amount of interest that it would be fair for the plaintiff to pay.  Lee was proposing that the parties negotiate at that stage how much interest would be paid by the plaintiff.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I also noted the defendant’s reliance on the plaintiff’s representative’s WhatsApp message as the plaintiff’s purported acceptance that there would be no early repayment (see [60] above).  Indeed, the WhatsApp message read “tenure 12 months with no prepayment”.  However, from my review of the parties’ exchanges, it appears that there was no landing reached on the issue of how much interest would be payable in the event of an early repayment of the loan.  The WhatsApp message did not unequivocally show that the plaintiff accepted that it would have to pay the full 12 months’ interest if it tried to make early repayment.  Further, the WhatsApp message followed closely after Lee’s email of 11 May 2021 to Eva Wong of Drew &amp; Napier stating his position on the inclusion of the prepayment clause.  This suggested that the plaintiff was simply accepting Lee’s position that no prepayment clause would be included in the Loan Agreement.  In other words, I understood “tenure 12 months with no prepayment” in the WhatsApp message to simply mean that clause 4 would state the loan tenor of 12 months and the proposed prepayment clause was to be removed.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Third, there was a point in the negotiations after Lee’s email of 11 May 2021 where the deal appeared to have stalled because of the lack of agreement on the commercial terms.  This is evident from the email from Dorothy Tay’s email dated 11 May 2021 referred to above (at [60]), where she referred to the matter as being “on hold”.  It is unclear as to what happened next or what discussions might have taken place, or what compromises might have been reached, but from the correspondence on the record, it appears that Drew &amp; Napier later withdrew its proposed prepayment clause from the draft Loan Agreement.  In a way, this demonstrates the lack of clarity as to the proper context to the eventual execution of the Loan Agreement.  It is entirely unclear whether or not parties had reached some consensus on the issue of the amount of interest payable in the case of early repayment, or perhaps, whether each party might have taken advice from their own counsel and was content to execute the Loan Agreement in its final form, confident that its legal position on this issue was protected.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The difficulties that the court faced in this case when determining the context in relation to the issue of interest payable illustrates the sometimes intractable problems that one has to deal with when examining pre-contractual negotiations.  As pointed out by counsel for the plaintiff, pre-contractual negotiations often reflect a dynamic process of bargaining, where parties’ positions are changing over time and their views are divergent.  The task for the court is to determine whether one can discern a clear or obvious context on how to interpret the Loan Agreement insofar as the issue of the amount of interest payable is concerned.  The best that I could ascertain is that the parties appeared to be content to leave the question of the “fee” or “penalty” payable as a matter for further discussion if the plaintiff chose to make early repayment.  It follows from this that there was no consensus reached on how much interest would be paid in the case of early repayment.  In other words, one cannot say that the pre-contractual negotiations provided a “clear and obvious” context on how to interpret the Loan Agreement insofar as it concerned the question of the amount of interest payable if there was to be early repayment.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The appropriate date of redemption </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In light of the proper interpretation of the Loan Agreement, I found that the defendant had, by issuing the Redemption Statement which insisted on the plaintiff paying interest for the full loan tenor,</span>

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> wrongfully refused to accept early repayment of the loan and redemption of the mortgage which would otherwise have taken place on 23 July 2021.  Not only that, I found that the defendant was egregiously wrong, by insisting in the Redemption Statement that the plaintiff was liable for default interest.  Clause 5.1.2 of the Loan Agreement only entitled the defendant to charge default interest “if [the] Borrower shall fail to repay the Loan by the Due Date”, and the Due Date was 16 May 2022.  Thus, in my view, it could not be seriously contended that the defendant was entitled to charge default interest based on the terms of the Loan Agreement for the late payments of interest instalments that fell due on 17 June 2021 and 17 July 2021.  Simply put, the time when the defendant could charge default interest had not arrived.  Default interest was only chargeable if the terms of the Loan Agreement provided for it, and in this case, clause 5.1.2 was clearly inapplicable.  I should add, for completeness, that the parties had made submissions on whether clause 5.1.2 was a penalty clause.  However, given my finding that the clause was inapplicable in the circumstances, the issue as to whether clause 5.1.2 was a penalty clause did not arise. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It was important to bear in mind that, on the facts of this case, the plaintiff and defendant had agreed to an early repayment date of 23 July 2021.  This was clear from the fact that the plaintiff had offered by its solicitors’ letter of 16 July 2021 to repay the loan and accrued interest on 23 July 2021.  On 19 July 2021, the defendant’s solicitors accepted the date of 23 July 2021 as the date where early repayment could take place (see [23] above).  On that basis, I found that the defendant should only have charged interest on the loan owing up to 23 July 2021.  If there had been due payment by the plaintiff of the principal and interest accrued, the defendant would have been obliged to permit redemption of the mortgage on that date.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">However, on the face of the documents before the court in these proceedings, the written evidence did suggest that the plaintiff only had the funds to make payment of the loan and interest on 2 August 2021, and not 23 July 2021.  Counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged at the hearing that there were only two documents before the court indicating the sources of the plaintiff’s financing.  The first was a letter of offer from VM Capital dated 13 July 2021</span>

</div>
</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">  That being so, given the circumstances of this case, I found that no issue actually arose as to whether the plaintiff had made a valid tender to make payment of the amount owed as of 23 July 2021.  The only issue in dispute between the parties was the proper amount of interest due as of the early repayment date of 23 July 2021, and not any question of whether the plaintiff had adequate sources of financing.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It is true that I have found (at [70] above), from the documents produced in these proceedings, that the plaintiff appears to only have had sufficient available financing from 2 August 2021.  This did not mean, however, that the offer to repay the loan and redeem the mortgage by its letter of 16 July 2021 was a sham.  It might well have been the case that the plaintiff could have arranged its financing from PT Organik to be available by 23 July 2021, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">if</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> the defendant had produced an accurate redemption statement on 19 July 2021 instead of demanding an amount that was well in excess of what was due.  The </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">matter of financing had been overtaken by the emergence of the dispute between the parties over the amount of interest payable.  As things turned out, the plaintiff could only produce in these proceedings the letter of additional financing from PT Organik dated 2 August 2021 (see [70]).  This evidence could not be ignored by the court.  As such, I fixed the date of redemption as 9 August 2021, being seven days after the additional financing became available.  That was the earliest date which I determined that the plaintiff would have been able to make repayment of what it owed to the defendant under Loan Agreement and to seek a redemption of its mortgage.  This meant that the defendant would suffer no prejudice, or at least none that was a result of the plaintiff’s conduct, because interest would continue to accrue on the loan until 9 August 2021.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In its submissions, the defendant cited a number of cases on how the principle as to a valid tender applied.  I have set out the key facts in those cases and what they decided below (see [80]–[84]).  But, a review of those authorities would show that they deal with rather different circumstances.  In most of them, the mortgagee’s right to enforce the mortgage had arisen because the underlying loan obligations had fallen due.  The mischief that the courts are concerned with in those situations is that, once the time had passed for the mortgagor or borrower to discharge its payment obligations, the mortgagor should not be allowed to put up a tender that it does not intend to or cannot fulfil, with the effect of reducing the intervening interest.   It was in that context that the question arose in those authorities cited by the defendant as to whether there was indeed evidence that the mortgagor had genuinely been ready, willing and able to discharge its payment obligations such that it could then avail itself of the defence of tender.  On the facts of this case, I have found that the plaintiff did have access to the necessary financing by 2 August 2021, and would have been able to repay the owed amount and redeem the mortgage by 9 August 2021.   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Kinnaird v Trollope </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1889] 42 Ch 610, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the mortgagee had commenced an action to recover the principal and interest from the mortgagors upon the insolvency of a third party to whom the mortgagors had sold and assigned the equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises.  In response, the mortgagors took out a summons to make repayment within one month of the principal with interest to date of payment, and costs, and thereby stay the enforcement action and redeem the property.  The summons was heard on 18 November 1886, but no order was made because the mortgagee refused to reconvey the property.  The matter was eventually decided on a later date and the court ordered that an account should be taken of what was due to the mortgagee, and a certificate was issued.  The mortgagors took issue with the computation of interest and argued that interest after 18 November 1886 should be disallowed.  The issue of whether there was valid tender on 18 November 1886 that stopped the running of interest thus arose.  Stirling J held that the mortgagors’ summons to stay the mortgagee’s proceedings was not equivalent to a tender by them, and so interest must be paid by the mortgagors up to the date of actual repayment. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Turning to </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Edmon</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">dson v Copland</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [1911] 2 Ch 301</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Edmondson</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, the mortgagee had given the mortgagor notice to pay off the mortgage, and that if payment was not made within three months, the mortgagee intended to sell the property.  A week after the expiry of the three-month period, the mortgagor tendered the amount of principal and interest to date, which the mortgagee refused to accept.  The mortgagor commenced a redemption action.  It was decided and a certificate rendered to the effect that good tender had been made by the mortgagor and refused by the mortgagee, and interest was not to run subsequent to the tender.  The mortgagee then took out a summons to vary the certificate.  Joyce J held that there had been “good tender” but that the mortgagor was liable for interest from the date of tender to the date of actual payment because he had not actually set the money aside in that period. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">More recently in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 5) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2008] FCA 1700</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Australian </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Securities and Investments Commission</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, receivers had been appointed to wind up an investment scheme and were directed to sell the principal asset of the investment scheme.  The first and second mortgagees with loans secured over the principal asset were ordered to deliver up duly executed discharges of mortgage.  There was a dispute over the sum that the second mortgagees had secured over the principal asset.  Pending the resolution of the dispute, the balance of the proceeds of sale that remained after the first mortgagee had been paid were kept in an interest-bearing account.  The sum owed to the second mortgagees was determined, and the sum was paid out of the interest-bearing account to the second mortgagees accordingly.  The issue was whether the second mortgagees were entitled to interest on the debt from the date that the sum was paid into the interest-bearing account till the date of actual repayment.  The Federal Court of Australia considered the general principle that interest runs till the mortgage is discharged by actual payment, as well as the exception of refusal of valid tender which will result in interest ceasing to run.  However, Finkelstein J was also of the view that “tender of the amount due is not always required” and decided that tender was not required in the case at hand because the second mortgagees had made clear that they would not discharge the second mortgage unless they received the disputed sum that they claimed was due to them.  The judge concluded that, at the point when the sale proceeds were paid into the interest-bearing account, the obligation to continue paying interest under the mortgage was discharged.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Iain Lawrie </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Shearer &amp; Ors v Spring Capital Ltd &amp; Ors </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2013] EWHC 314</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">8 (Ch) (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Iain Lawrie Shearer</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, the claimants were guarantors of loans carrying significantly high interest rates that had been made by the lender to certain companies.  When the lender found out that the companies had failed, it made demands for repayment.  The effect of these demands was that the sums due under the various loan agreements became immediately repayable, and the lender became entitled to enforce security that it held.  The claimants negotiated with the lender and entered into a standstill agreement, pursuant to which the lenders agreed not to enforce any security for a period of time, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement.  One day before the standstill period came to an end, the claimants sent a letter of tender to the lender, confirming that they held the relevant sum and indicating that the securities which the lender held would fall to be redeemed upon acceptance of the tender.  However, the lender disputed the correct sum that was due and refused to accept the tender.  The claimants then commenced redemption proceedings, while the lender brought an application seeking summary judgment (or striking out in the alternative) on the allegations that valid tender had been made.  Daniel Alexander QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the Chancery Division of the English High Court, refused to grant summary judgment or striking out.  Instead, he granted the interim injunction sought by the claimants to restrain the lender from taking enforcement measures against any of the claimants’ assets charged to the lender.  The court held that there were triable issues on, among others, whether the absence of a costs offer was fatal to the tender and whether the tender was valid if it was made conditional upon execution of a release of existing security held by the lender. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">For completeness, I note that the case of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Young v Queensland Trustees Ltd </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1956] </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">99 CLR 560 was also cited by the defendant.  However, the context in which tender was discussed was quite different.  The executors of the lender’s estate sought repayment on various loans made to the borrower.  The borrower admitted to the loans but argued that he had repaid those loans.  The trial judge disbelieved the borrower’s story.  The borrower then appealed, arguing that the trial judge should have accepted his uncontradicted testimony to the effect that he had repaid the money, and that the burden of proving otherwise lay on the plaintiff executors.  The High Court of Australia considered whether the executors bore the burden to disprove that payment had been made, or whether the borrower bore the burden of proving that payment had been made.  The court considered that, although it is the case that in an action for breach of contract, the claimant must prove the breach, “the common law does not and never did conceive of indebtedness in a sum certain for an executed consideration as a mere breach of contract”.  The court found that, if indebtedness in a sum as such were a mere breach of contract, it would not be necessary for a defendant who sets up a plea of tender to bring into court the amount of debt with his plea.  The court ultimately found that the burden lay on the borrower to prove his defence, and that he was unable to do so. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I should add that the defendant argued that there was no valid offer of redemption, whether one takes the redemption date as 23 July or 9 August 2021, because VM Capital would only have disbursed the funds if the defendant had consented to a simultaneous release of the mortgage.  The defendant argued that this meant that the offer to redeem was not unconditional.</span>

One cannot seriously expect the plaintiff’s financiers to disburse funds without some assurance that the defendant would discharge its mortgage over the Property.  After all, the plaintiff’s financiers would also be taking security over the Property in exchange for disbursing their funds.  Indeed, VM Capital, in its letter of offer, required its facility to be secured by a first legal mortgage on the Property (among other security) and required as a condition precedent to disbursement of the loan that the necessary consents be obtained for its mortgage.</span>

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">  This is hardly surprising given that the subject of the financing involves the Property.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Iain Lawrie Shearer</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(see [83] above) was a decision on an interlocutory application for summary judgment or, in the alternative, striking out.  It does not stand for the proposition that an offer for repayment which is subject to a discharge of the mortgagee’s existing security would never qualify as a valid tender because it would not be regarded as an unconditional offer.  In fact, in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Iain Lawrie Shearer</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">,</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the deputy judge </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">provided his preliminary view (at [219]) that a mortgagor </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">can</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> validly make</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> a tender subject to a condition of simultaneous release of security by the existing lender.  He then went on to explain (at [226]–[227]):</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I think it is clear that it is perfectly reasonable to impose such a condition and at the very lowest arguable that, if money is only available on fulfillment of that condition, that will not mean that it is to be treated as unavailable for the law of tender.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">… it is inherent in the very nature of a redemption that there will be no period of time at which borrower or lender should be at risk (on the one side of non-payment and on the other of retention of the security for the debt). It can therefore be seen to be inherent in the act of tender that the normal expectation would be mutual simultaneous exchange were there to be acceptance.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In my view, it would depend on the condition in question that qualifies the commitment to pay, as well as the surrounding circumstances.  In each case, the court has to determine whether the condition was one that showed that the offer for repayment was not genuine, or that the condition was not a reasonable one.  On our facts, I was completely unpersuaded by the defendant’s arguments that the offer for repayment by the plaintiff was not genuine.  The defendant also failed to show that the plaintiff had imposed any conditions to repayment that would be regarded as unreasonable.   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I also found it rather absurd for the defendant to contend that the plaintiff ought to have drawn down on its sources of financing and set them aside for repayment of the amount due under the Loan Agreement, even while the dispute with the defendant was ongoing.  That would not be sensible from a commercial point of view.  First, the plaintiff’s new financiers would not have disbursed the funds unless there was certainty as to the amounts owed to the defendant, and obtained assurance that the defendant would discharge its mortgage upon being repaid what was properly due.  Secondly, even if such disbursement of funds was allowed by the financiers well ahead of actual repayment to the defendant, one surely cannot insist that the plaintiff must take on the burden of incurring the interest and other charges on the newly drawn funds, pending the resolution of the legal dispute with the defendant, simply to demonstrate that it had set aside funds for repayment.  Indeed, had the plaintiff drawn down on the VM Capital funding, it would have incurred interest of close to S$1 million between the agreed redemption date of 23 July 2021 and the date of my decision in these proceedings on 24 February 2022, given that the letter of offer stipulated interest at a rate of at least 0.667% per month (with VM Capital reserving the right to change the rate of interest).</span>

This is, of course, subject to any terms of the loan or mortgage that might stipulate otherwise.  The mere fact that the offer to make repayment does not fall within the paradigm case of a valid tender where a borrower attends upon the lender with the full sum in hand ought not to be a bar against a finding that the borrower has made a valid tender.
