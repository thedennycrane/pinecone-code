        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    trial judge (“the Judge”) in Suit No 195 of 2007 (“the
                    Suit”). The reasons for the decision of the Judge are found in <em>Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others v Basil Anthony
                        Herman</em> [2009] SGHC 214 (“the
                    Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant, Mr Anthony Herman Basil
                    (“Basil”), is a former police officer. He had served in the
                    Singapore Police Force (“the SPF”) for 24 years, and had held the
                    rank of acting station inspector at the time of his retirement from the SPF in
                    1987. After his retirement, he took on several jobs before joining the first
                    respondent, Premier Security Co-operative Ltd (“Premier”), a
                    co-operative in the business of providing security services, as a security
                    executive on 13 April 2006. The second respondent, Mr Saraj Din s/o
                    Sher Mohamed (“Saraj”), was the managing director of Premier at
                    the material time. He had previously served in the SPF for 36 years, and had
                    attained the substantive rank of deputy superintendent. The third respondent,
                    Ms Annie Leow Cher Kheng (“Leow”), was the administration and
                    finance manager of Premier at the material time. Saraj and Leow appear to have
                    been the key decision makers in Premier at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Basil’s employment as a security executive
                    was terminated by Premier in December 2006. The true reasons for his
                    termination, and the facts and circumstances surrounding his termination, were
                    hotly disputed at the trial before the Judge. Suffice to say at this juncture
                    that Basil felt deeply aggrieved by what he perceived to be an unjust
                    dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Not long after his employment was terminated,
                    Basil wrote four letters of complaint against the respondents. The letters,
                    which were sent between 8 January 2007 and 16 February 2007, contained
                    a number of allegations relating to, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the circumstances of Basil’s dismissal and the quality of the security
                    services that Premier provided to its clients – in particular, SBS Transit
                    Ltd (“SBS”), Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (“SMRT”)
                    (the precise member of the SMRT group of companies was not identified), and
                    Singapore Airport Terminal Services Ltd (“SATS”). The letters were
                    sent to a number of persons, including the Minister for Manpower, the
                    Commissioner of Police, the chairman of the Singapore Police Co-operative
                    Society Ltd, the head of the Security Industry Regulatory Department of the SPF
                    (“the SIRD”), and the general manager of SATS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In particular, Basil’s letter to the
                    Minister for Manpower alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that he
                    was wrongfully dismissed. As a result, Ms Adeline Kong
                    (“Kong”), an assistant commissioner for labour at the Ministry of
                    Manpower (“the MOM”), requested Premier to provide information
                    relating to Basil’s employment and dismissal. Premier’s reply, which
                    was signed by Saraj and dated 15 February 2007, set out its complaints
                    against Basil and enclosed, <em>inter alia</em>, an
                    “anonymous letter” to Premier dated 12 August
                        2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The letter, which had not
                    been shown to Basil previously, alleged, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that Basil was racist, incompetent, and had caused trouble
                    in each of his prior jobs in the private sector (see [62] of the Judgment, where
                    the letter is set out in full). Saraj claimed that he had forwarded this letter
                    to the MOM only to prove that he had been unwilling to prejudge Basil, but it is
                    pertinent to note that the accusation of racism was repeated in the body of
                    Premier’s reply. Kong subsequently testified during the trial that the MOM
                    did not enquire into the circumstances pertaining to Basil’s dismissal
                    because his contract of employment did not come within the purview of the
                    Employment Act (Cap 91, 1996 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 6 March 2007, the respondents demanded,
                    through a letter from their solicitors, that Basil cease making statements in
                    connection to them, make an unqualified apology, and pay damages for the
                    statements he had already made. Basil refused. The respondents then initiated an
                    action in defamation against Basil on 28 March 2007 (<em>ie</em>, the Suit). In response, Basil pleaded the defences of
                    justification, fair comment and qualified privilege, and counterclaimed for
                    wrongful dismissal and defamation in respect of Premier’s response to the
                    MOM, including the enclosed anonymous letter. He asserted that the allegations
                    relating to his alleged misconduct were contrived and had never been raised
                    while he was in Premier’s employ, and that he had been victimised by Saraj
                    and Leow. He also claimed that he had never been reprimanded during his time
                    with Premier, and that his dismissal had been capricious. Further, Saraj had
                    forwarded the anonymous letter to the MOM maliciously and with reckless
                    disregard to the truth of its contents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It ought to be pointed out that Basil was
                    initially unrepresented. He only engaged counsel after the respondents applied
                    for, <em>inter alia</em>, a determination of the natural
                    and ordinary meaning of certain statements, via Summons No 2599 of 2007.
                    Any incongruity in the manner in which Basil’s case was initially
                    presented could, perhaps, be attributed to this lack of legal input at the
                    outset. Unsurprisingly, the respondents have amplified the presence of these
                    so-called inconsistencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summons No 2599 of 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Early on in the proceedings, on 15 June
                    2007, the respondents filed Summons No 2599 of 2007 (hereafter referred to
                    as “SUM 2599” for convenience), which was an application for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, an order that the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of seven selected statements in three of Basil’s four
                    letters was as pleaded in the respondents’ Statement of Claim pursuant to
                    O 14 R 12 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules”), a declaration that the natural and ordinary meaning
                    of one or more of the selected statements was defamatory, and interlocutory
                    judgment with damages to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The application was heard by a different High
                    Court judge, who ruled that the seven statements were defamatory, but
                    nevertheless gave unconditional leave to Basil to advance his defences at trial
                    as he had raised triable issues. Broadly speaking, the seven statements were
                    found to carry the defamatory meaning that (a) Premier, through Saraj and
                    Leow, had terminated Basil and other ex-employees wrongfully and capriciously;
                    and (b) Premier, under the management of Saraj and Leow, provided
                    sub-standard services to its clients, both generally and specifically to SBS,
                    SMRT and SATS. There was no appeal against the decision in SUM 2599. The
                    trial before the Judge was therefore only in relation to Basil’s defences
                    of justification, fair comment, and qualified privilege, which he advanced in
                    respect of all seven defamatory statements, as well as his
                counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial and the Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The trial below was by any measure a bruising
                    one – salted by the accusations of malice and incompetence liberally
                    levelled by both sides against each other. The hearing was spread over nine
                    days, of which four were spent on the cross-examination of Basil alone. The
                    respondents called three witnesses; Basil called eleven. In the end, after
                    considering the evidence before her, the Judge categorically rejected
                    Basil’s defences against the respondents’ claim and dismissed his
                    counterclaim. She then awarded the respondents aggravated damages totalling
                    $150,000, of which $80,000 went to Premier, $50,000 to Saraj, and $20,000 to
                    Leow. She also granted an injunction prohibiting Basil from reproducing the
                    contents of the four letters he had sent. Costs were awarded to the respondents
                    on the High Court scale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     We pause here to note that the Judge made the
                    award of damages notwithstanding her prior direction given at the end of the
                    trial that the parties were to submit “<em>[p]urely on
                        liability</em>, vis-à-vis <em>the defence and liability
                        on the counterclaim</em>” [emphasis added],<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that the “<em>[a]ssessment of damages, if necessary, is [to be] done by the
                        registrar</em>” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It seems clear from the material
                    before us that counsel for Basil, led by Mr Singa Retnam
                    (“Mr Retnam”), had, as they should, complied with the
                    Judge’s direction and refrained from addressing the issue of
                    quantification of damages in their closing submissions. On the other hand,
                    counsel for the respondents, led by Mr Adrian Wong
                    (“Mr Wong”), seem to have taken it upon themselves to submit
                    on the issue of quantum of damages in their closing submissions, which were
                    tendered <em>in response</em> to the submissions from
                    counsel for Basil on the viability of Basil’s defences. It therefore
                    appears to us that, in so far as the issue of the quantification of damages is
                    concerned, the Judge only had the benefit of the submissions of counsel for the
                    respondents before she gave her decision, and had not afforded any opportunity
                    to counsel for Basil to make any submissions on the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We also note that, while the Judge held (at
                    [143] of the Judgment) that aggravated damages were awarded because of
                    Basil’s “conduct and his malice” towards the respondents,
                    she did not initially give separate figures for the damages flowing from
                    Basil’s seven defamatory statements and the damages flowing from
                    Basil’s aggravating conduct. However, in an addendum which primarily
                    addressed the appropriate scale of costs applicable, the Judge explained (at
                    [151] of the Judgment) that “[b]ecause of the finding of malice …
                    , the damages awarded to the [respondents] were double what this court would
                    have otherwise awarded to each of the [respondents]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues arising on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In this appeal, Mr Retnam made a root and
                    branch attack against the decision of the Judge. He took issue with, <em>inter alia</em>, the Judge’s setting aside of the
                    subpoenas of five potential witnesses for the defence, several findings of fact
                    and propositions of law stated in the Judgment, and the general conduct of the
                    proceedings by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At the hearing before us on 16 March
                    2010, Basil had sought, via Summons No 753 of 2010, to adduce fresh
                    evidence on appeal in the form of a private investigator’s report dated
                    31 December 2009, which stated that Leow had since the trial left Premier
                    in questionable circumstances. Mr Retnam failed to convince us that this
                    application should be allowed, and it was dismissed with the issue of costs
                    reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The subpoenas issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The issue of the subpoenas will be considered
                    first. Basil had, in the course of the proceedings, attempted to subpoena the
                    following persons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Johnny Kung Leong Jin

<p class="Judg-1">For convenience, we shall hereafter use the term “the disallowed
                    witnesses” when referring to these persons collectively. Basil had also
                    subpoenaed Kong, but that subpoena was not set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The attempts to subpoena the disallowed witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It should be stated at the outset that the
                    disallowed witnesses were, despite several prior requests, unwilling to produce
                    the relevant documents or swear/affirm affidavits. Basil, therefore, had no
                    alternative but to resort to the machinery of the court and subpoena them. It is
                    helpful to briefly outline Basil’s many attempts to seek leave for the
                    disallowed witnesses to testify on and make discovery of relevant matters, and
                    the strenuous efforts of the respondents to resist these attempts at every
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Basil’s first application in this regard
                    was Summons No 3682 of 2008, in which leave to subpoena the disallowed
                    witnesses to give oral evidence and for their affidavits of evidence-in-chief
                    (hereafter abbreviated to “AEICs” (or, for a single affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief, “AEIC”)) to be dispensed with was prayed for.
                    An assistant registrar acceded to the respondents’ objections and
                    dismissed the application on 3 September 2008 for non-compliance with the
                    requirements in O 39 R 14 of the Rules, but without prejudice to
                    Basil’s ability to file a fresh application. This was, it seems to us, a
                    relatively minor procedural oversight which could in fact have been cured by the
                    assistant registrar without the need for a further application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Basil then filed a second application,
                        <em>viz</em>, Summons No 4221 of 2008
                    (“SUM 4221”), which was to similar effect. This application
                    was heard by another assistant registrar on 17 October 2008. During the
                    hearing, Mr Wong again raised a procedural objection based on O 39
                    R 14. He further argued that the application, being a repeat of the first
                    application, was an abuse of process and that the respondents might be caught by
                    surprise with the large number of witnesses involved. The assistant registrar,
                    after considering these arguments, granted leave for the disallowed witnesses to
                    give oral evidence and for their AEICs to be dispensed with, on the condition
                    that Mr Retnam furnish to Mr Wong, by 4pm on 28 October 2008, a
                    list of questions and issues that each of the disallowed witnesses would be
                    giving evidence on. It is not clear from the record when the list was eventually
                    given. However, during oral arguments before us, Mr Wong informed us that
                    the questions were provided only in early February 2009. Mr Retnam did not
                    dispute this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 29 January 2009, Basil issued
                    subpoenas to the disallowed witnesses to testify and to produce documents. It
                    should be noted that the issue of a subpoena takes place upon the administrative
                    act of the subpoena being sealed by an officer of the Registry (see O 38
                    R 14(2) of the Rules).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 26 February 2009, the respondents
                    filed an application, <em>viz</em>, Summons No 901 of
                    2009 (“SUM 901”), to set aside the subpoenas (which were
                    addressed to the disallowed witnesses) on the ground that they were irrelevant,
                    oppressive, and/or an abuse of process. On the same day, Basil filed an
                    application, <em>viz</em>, Summons No 905 of 2009, to
                    vacate the original trial dates, on the ground that more time was needed to
                    peruse the additional documents which had been belatedly given in discovery by
                    the respondents only on 11 February 2009. Both applications were fixed for
                    hearing before the Judge on 2 March 2009, the day the trial was originally
                    scheduled to begin. On 2 March 2009, the Judge heard the applications. She
                    found that no satisfactory reason could be given to justify the issuance of the
                    subpoenas in question and ordered that they be set aside. This order was made
                    without prejudice to Basil issuing fresh subpoenas for the disallowed witnesses
                    to testify, with the leave of the Judge. The Judge also vacated the trial dates
                    and rescheduled the trial to commence on 9 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 5 March 2009, Basil filed an
                    application, <em>viz</em>, Summons No 1018 of 2009,
                    for leave to issue fresh subpoenas to the disallowed witnesses. At the hearing
                    before the Judge on 9 March 2009, Mr Retnam submitted that he was not
                    proceeding with the application in so far as Wong was concerned. The application
                    was vigorously opposed by counsel for the respondents, Mr Wong, who argued,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that the documents sought by way
                    of the subpoenas should have been obtained through discovery from the
                    respondents, that the application did not include an offer to reimburse the
                    witnesses, that the questions proposed to be asked of the disallowed witnesses
                    were leading, and that the whole application was a “fishing
                    expedition”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Here, we pause to make some observations on
                    Mr Wong’s reasons for resisting the application. First, Mr Wong
                    did not concede that the respondents had the documents that Basil sought, and
                    indeed he could not, for such a contention would immediately render the
                    respondents in knowing breach of their discovery obligations. If the respondents
                    did not have the documents sought, then why should Mr Retnam proceed
                    against them first, or indeed at all? Second, reimbursement for the subpoenaed
                    witnesses could be ordered by the court, and was, in any event, no business of
                    the respondents. Third, leading or irrelevant questions could be disallowed by
                    the court, or rephrased. Fourth, it is not clear at all what Mr Wong meant
                    in describing the application as a “fishing expedition” –
                    Mr Retnam had prepared specific questions to be addressed to each of the
                    disallowed witnesses. We are, therefore, of the opinion that there was no
                    substance at all to Mr Wong’s recorded reasons for resisting
                    Basil’s application. They were wide off the mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Judge, nevertheless, dismissed
                    Basil’s application. We cannot ascertain from the material before us
                    whether she agreed with any of Mr Wong’s imaginative contentions. But
                    it is clear from the Judge’s notes of argument that there was no proper
                    argument addressed to her on the issue which truly mattered – whether or
                    not the disallowed witnesses were in a position to give relevant evidence which
                    could have materially affected the outcome of some or all of the live disputes
                    before the court in Basil’s favour. The Judge briefly mentioned at [118]
                    of the Judgment that she “upheld [Mr Wong’s] objections that
                    the subpoenas were being used for the purpose of obtaining discovery and
                    dismissed the application”. We are unable to agree with this reason.
                    Mr Retnam, having unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the agreement of the
                    disallowed witnesses to give evidence, had little option but to compel them to
                    come forward to testify and produce documents. This is hardly an abuse of
                    process. While it may have been preferable for Mr Retnam to have taken out
                    a separate and earlier application for third-party discovery against their
                    employers, his failure to do so was not a fatal procedural defect. Appropriate
                    directions and costs could have redressed any prejudice allegedly suffered by
                    the respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The right of a litigant to bring relevant evidence before the
                court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     At this juncture, we would emphasise that
                    every litigant has a general right to bring all evidence <em>relevant</em> to his or her case to the attention of the court. This
                    general right is so fundamental that it requires no authority to be cited in
                    support of it; in fact, to say that the right derives from some positive
                    decision or rule is to understate its constitutive importance to the adversarial
                    approach to fact-finding. The importance of the right is reflected in the fact
                    that a litigant may pray in aid the machinery of the court to compel, on the
                    pain of contempt, all persons who are in a position to give relevant evidence,
                    to come forward and give it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The general right is, of course, subject to
                    specific limits. For present purposes, the following limits are germane. A
                    litigant only has the right to adduce <em>relevant</em>
                    evidence, as defined by the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and
                    other applicable rules; irrelevant evidence is inadmissible and will not be
                    considered by the court. The adduction of relevant evidence must, as far as
                    practicable, take place in accordance with the rules of procedure whose purpose
                    is to ensure the <em>fair</em>, economical, swift and
                    orderly resolution of a dispute. Finally, a litigant is prohibited from
                    manipulating the court’s machinery to further his ulterior or collateral
                    motives in an abusive or oppressive manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In striking the proper balance between the
                    general right and the specific limits, a trial judge must not only be guided by
                    the applicable rules and decisions, but must look beyond the mechanical
                    application of these rules and decisions, and carefully assess the interests at
                    stake in every case to ensure that a <em>fair</em> outcome
                    is reached through the application of <em>fair</em>
                    processes. It should always be borne in mind that grave consequences might flow
                    from the wrongful exclusion of evidence (such as by shutting out a witness from
                    testifying or preventing cross-examination). In cases where the relevance of
                    evidence sought to be adduced is unclear, or even doubtful, we are of the view
                    that it is usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather
                    than exclusion. With specific regard to the calling of witnesses, we would
                    reiterate what was said in <em>Auto Clean ‘N’ Shine
                        Services (a firm) v Eastern Publishing Associates Pte Ltd</em> [1997]
                    2 SLR(R) 427 (at [17]), where this court allowed an appeal to
                    introduce eleven new witnesses of fact after the summons for directions
                    stage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] balance should be struck between the need to comply with the rules and
                        the parties’ right to call witnesses whom they deem necessary to
                        establish their case. It may well be that the additional evidence to be
                        adduced by the parties may assist in illuminating the issues before the
                        court or result in the expeditious disposal of the proceedings. If, however,
                        it really turns out at the trial that the evidence adduced is unnecessary,
                        irrelevant or vexatious, the trial judge is in full control and is in a
                        position to deal with the party adducing such evidence in an appropriate
                        way, such as by disallowing the evidence which is being elicited from the
                        witness and/or by an order as to costs. <em>It must always be
                            borne in mind that the duty of the court is to examine all the evidence
                            put forward by the parties which is material and relevant to the dispute
                            between the parties and not to shut out potentially material and
                            relevant evidence by a strict adherence to the rules of civil
                            procedure</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     With these observations in mind, we now turn
                    to examine the relevance of the testimony which the disallowed witnesses could
                    have given, and the documents that they might have produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevance of the evidence of the disallowed witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevance <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">vis-à-vis</span> the services
                provided by Premier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above), the seven defamatory statements made by
                    Basil broadly alleged that (a) Premier, through Saraj and Leow, terminated
                    Basil and other ex-employees wrongfully and capriciously; and (b) Premier,
                    under the management of Saraj and Leow, provided sub-standard services to its
                    clients, both generally and specifically to SBS, SMRT and SATS. In our view, it
                    is obvious that the testimony of those of the disallowed witnesses who are
                    employees or ex-employees of SBS or SMRT, <em>ie</em>,
                    Kung, Hong, Wong and Sarip, are <em>prima facie</em>
                    relevant for the purpose of proving the defence of justification and the factual
                    basis for the defence of fair comment in relation to those of Basil’s
                    defamatory statements that alleged serious lapses in the quality of the services
                    which Premier typically provided to its clients. It is plain from their present
                    or past designations that Kung, Hong, Wong, and Sarip were in positions of
                    authority which would have given them oversight of security issues, and even if
                    this was not the case, appropriate directions could be given by the court to
                    summon the appropriate persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Further, Kung and Hong were involved in
                    specific incidents concerning Premier. Kung was, according to Leow’s AEIC,
                    the SBS employee who contacted her about SBS’s dissatisfaction with the
                    deployment of one Ong Choon Hock (also known as Casino Ong or Kasino Ong)
                    (“Casino Ong”) to its premises (an event which is also relevant to
                    the issue of Basil’s alleged wrongful dismissal (see [35]–[36] and
                    [44]–[49] below)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The evidence of Hong, who also was an SBS
                    employee, would appear to be particularly important. He was the author of an
                    internal e-mail dated 21 August 2006 detailing several complaints that SBS
                    had about the security guards supplied by Premier. The contents of the e-mail,
                    whose authenticity was not disputed at the trial, are arresting, and the
                    unadulterated text is set out in full as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>

                        send it to the Straits Times.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I understand our new security contract do not allow SBST to issue monetary
                        penalty to Premier. So are there any alternatives to strengthen their
                        services to us before something unpleasant happens, now that IMF delegates

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is evident from these two e-mails that SBS
                    was highly dissatisfied with the services provided by Premier about six months
                    prior to Basil’s defamatory statements. More importantly for present
                    purposes, the e-mails unequivocally establish that Hong was in a position to
                    give highly relevant evidence about the quality of services provided by Premier
                    to SBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Raihan, for his part, was identified by Basil
                    as one of the two persons (the other being one Andrew Lee (“Lee”),
                    who eventually testified on Basil’s behalf) who told him (<em>ie</em>, Basil) that Premier did not conduct orientation
                    courses for security personnel to be deployed to the premises of SATS. The
                    purpose of the orientation course was to prepare the guards for the basic
                    aviation security test which SATS required all guards deployed at its premises
                    to pass. Basil further testified that Raihan had shown him a list of guards who
                    had not taken the orientation course. In the circumstances, Raihan’s
                    testimony would plainly be relevant for the purposes of corroborating or
                    refuting Basil’s evidence. Raihan’s testimony would be all the more
                    important given that the respondents had, curiously, chosen not to make out a
                    positive case (save by giving bare oral evidence) with regard to the conduct of
                    orientation courses and tests for the guards to be deployed to the premises of
                    SATS. As far as we can tell, no relevant documents were discovered by the
                    respondents with regard to the conduct of the orientation courses or the tests
                    in 2006 – the latest test scores and statistics exhibited in Saraj’s
                    AEIC were dated February 2005. Here, we note that the Judge had held (at [61] of
                    the Judgment) that since Lee, from whom Basil got his information, “was
                    told of the lack of orientation for SATS’ assignment by Raihan …
                    who did not testify …
                    <em>it was a case of hearsay upon hearsay
                    evidence</em>” [emphasis added]. With respect, the Judge’s
                    opinion seems to us to only confirm the need for Raihan to have been allowed to
                    testify.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In our view, the evidence of Kung and Hong
                    would also be relevant for the purposes of determining the circumstances
                    surrounding Basil’s dismissal. The circumstances of Basil’s
                    dismissal would be highly pertinent to his counterclaim for wrongful dismissal,
                    to the truth of his defamatory statement that he was capriciously dismissed, and
                    to the motives underlying Premier’s response to the MOM’s queries on
                    Basil’s dismissal, which Basil claimed defamed him. In connection with the
                    latter, if, for example, the evidence showed that Saraj had acted capriciously
                    in dismissing Basil, his motivation in attaching the anonymous letter to
                    Premier’s response to the MOM’s request for more information on
                    Basil’s dismissal would naturally be called into question, with the result
                    that the claim of qualified privilege in relation to that response might be seen
                    to rest on a dubious footing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In order to understand the relevance of the
                    testimony of Kung and Hong, it is necessary to understand the nature of the
                    parties’ dispute in relation to the alleged wrongful dismissal. In their
                    Statement of Claim, the respondents pleaded, <em>inter

                    completeness, it should be mentioned that Casino Ong was a relief guard who
                    walked with a limp, which presumably prevented him from effectively patrolling
                    SBS’s premises. In addition to the Casino Ong incident, the respondents

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In support of these general allegations, Saraj
                    referred in his AEIC to two other incidents. The first, which will be referred
                    to as “the Pandan Valley incident”, concerned Basil’s
                    monthly report for November 2006 to the manager of Pandan Valley condominium,
                    sent on 4 December 2006, which Saraj complained was drafted in poor
                    English, riddled with incorrect facts, and sent without his authorisation. Saraj
                    then sent a corrected copy on 6 December 2006. The second, which will be
                    referred to as “the field book incident”, concerned Basil’s
                    field book. Saraj deposed that he checked the field book after Basil left the
                    employ of Premier and found it “shocking” that the last entry was
                    recorded on 6 June 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Saraj took this to mean
                    that Basil had stopped recording and performing his work from that date
                    onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Basil, for his part, pleaded in his Defence
                    and Counterclaim that he was well aware of Casino Ong’s unsuitability for
                    duty, and had in fact reflected this several times to Saraj and Mr Kahka
                    Singh s/o Kernal Singh (“Kahka”), a senior supervisor at Premier
                    who testified on behalf of the respondents. Basil further denied that he was
                    ever given any oral warning or reminder that his performance was unsatisfactory.
                    In relation to the field book incident, Basil asserted during cross-examination
                    that, besides the field book that was produced at trial, he kept two other field
                    books in which he recorded his field work, and, specifically, his objections to
                    the deployment of Casino Ong. Basil did not apply for the production of these
                    books, and the respondents denied their existence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Judge found that Basil was dismissed with
                    just cause for all three incidents raised by the respondents, <em>viz</em>, the Casino Ong incident, the Pandan Valley incident, and
                    the field book incident (see [38]–[50] of the Judgment). Some observations
                    may be made in regard to the three incidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is undisputed that Basil’s report to
                    the management of Pandan Valley condominium had typographical errors and was
                    sent without Saraj’s prior clearance. That said, we could see no great
                    difference in substance between the reports sent by Basil and Saraj. Indeed, the
                    only difference of note appears to be Basil’s greater candour about the
                    reasons for an absentee guard; this can hardly be counted against him. We should
                    also say, for completeness (since much time was taken up on this issue below),
                    that complaints by Saraj about the standard of Basil’s command of the
                    English language seem to have been greatly exaggerated as, <em>inter alia</em>, the defamatory letters written by Basil evinced a
                    more than competent command of the language. At any rate, the respondents’
                    attempt to establish Basil’s lack of language skills was considerably
                    weakened by the complete absence of any evidence about the median language
                    skills of the other security executives who were then in the employ of Premier.
                    In the circumstances, we are unable to view the Pandan Valley incident, by
                    itself, as objectively of such a magnitude as to warrant Basil’s sudden
                    dismissal. We also find it difficult to accept that Saraj would dismiss Basil
                    over the Pandan Valley incident alone – indeed, Saraj had deposed in his
                    AEIC that the Casino Ong incident was the decisive consideration for dismissing
                    Basil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Three observations may be made in relation to
                    the field book incident. First, the implications flowing from a finding that
                    Basil did not perform or record his fieldwork since 6 June 2006 (which the
                    Judge seemed to have made at [44] of the Judgment) do not sit well with the rest
                    of the respondents’ case. If the respondents were right that Basil failed
                    to conduct and record his fieldwork, it must necessarily follow that such
                    failure (a) went undetected by the respondents for a period of six months,
                    from 6 June 2006 to December 2006 when Basil was terminated; or
                    (b) was detected but condoned. Both implications would be incongruent with
                    the respondents’ case at trial. Saraj took considerable pains to emphasise
                    that Premier was an efficient organisation with meticulous checks and balances
                    in place which uncompromisingly strove to weed out undesirable practices. These
                    implications are also inconsistent with Saraj’s evidence in his AEIC that
                    he was troubled by Basil’s failure to report to him – if this is
                    true, a most natural and logical response would be to check Basil’s field
                    book. But Saraj did not do this until after Basil was terminated, some six
                    months after Basil was alleged to have stopped his field work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Second, the existence of the other two field
                    books alluded to by Basil was not satisfactorily contested during
                    cross-examination. Here, it is pertinent to refer to the evidence of
                    Mr Jamaludin Malik bin Attan (“Jamaludin”), who was
                    Premier’s human resource manager at the material time. He deposed in his
                    AEIC that soon after Basil’s dismissal, he attempted to locate the
                    A4-sized field book which Basil had used to record his investigations and
                    movements. This A4-sized field book was one of the two which Basil said he kept,
                    in addition to the one produced at trial (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above). In cross-examination, Jamaludin was strenuously
                    challenged on the propriety of attempting to remove the field book from the
                    possession of Premier without notifying Saraj. Nevertheless, we find it highly
                    significant that he was not challenged on his confirmation during
                    cross-examination that he personally observed this A4-sized field book being
                    used by Basil after May or June. Nor was it even put to him that the A4-sized
                    field book did not in fact exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Third, we also find it noteworthy that the
                    respondents’ solicitors made no mention of Basil’s alleged failure
                    to maintain his field book after 6 June 2006 in their comprehensive letter
                    of 6 March 2007 (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). What
                    the respondents’ solicitors said was: “our clients have reviewed
                    the site records and noticed that you did not visit the sites under your charge
                    at least once every two days as required of you by our
                        clients”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This is altogether different from
                    saying that Basil had stopped maintaining records and stopped performing field
                    work from 6 June 2006. In the circumstances, we do not think that much can
                    be made out of the fact that the last entry in the field book discovered by
                    Premier was dated 6 June 2006, and would disagree with the Judge’s
                    findings in this connection. By the same token, we are not altogether convinced
                    that the other two field books referred to by Basil did not exist. The Judge
                    felt that Basil’s claim in relation to the other field books was simply
                    not believable as this emerged for the first time when he was cross-examined and
                    it was neither pleaded nor stated in his AEIC, and he had not requested the
                    respondents’ for specific discovery of the same. On the other hand, we
                    note that Basil’s evidence in this regard found support in the AEICs of
                    both Jamaludin and Mr Mohd Masudi bin Haji Masuri, who was a senior
                    security supervisor in Premier from 2004 until he left for another security firm
                    in 2006. Further, as the respondents had insisted that there were no field
                    records after 6 June 2006, and had not included such documentation in their
                    list of documents, should an adverse inference have been drawn by the Judge
                    against Basil if his counsel felt it would be pointless to ask for specific
                    discovery?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It follows from our analysis in the preceding
                    two paragraphs that the respondents are left with the Casino Ong incident, which
                    was strikingly described by Saraj as “[t]he straw that broke the
                    camel’s back”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> as the main justification
                    for their dismissal of Basil. Here, it should be emphasised that the
                    respondents’ complaint relates to Basil’s <em>failure
                        to check on</em> Casino Ong, and to report his unsuitability for
                    deployment to the respondents. Contrary to the Judge’s finding at [38(c)]
                    of the Judgment, Kahka had expressly confirmed during the trial that the
                        <em>deployment</em> of guards was done by him and his
                    operations manager from Premier’s control room.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The
                    responsibility of security executives was to check on the guards and give
                    feedback on the clients’ concerns. It would appear, therefore, that Basil
                    was not responsible for the original deployment of Casino Ong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     With regard to Basil’s alleged failure
                    to report on Casino Ong’s deployment, Leow had deposed in her AEIC that
                    Kung of SBS had, on 13 December 2006, telephoned her to complain about
                    Casino Ong. She then passed the information on to Saraj, who requested to see
                    Basil the day after (<em>ie</em>, 14 December 2006).
                    During that meeting, Saraj, in the presence of only Jamaludin, terminated the
                    employment of Basil. Basil on his part insisted that he had informed both Saraj
                    and Kahka about the unsuitability of Casino Ong for deployment at SBS’s
                    worksites since late November. At trial, he was unable to recall whether he
                    wrote a report to Saraj or informed him orally about this at a meeting of
                    security executives in early December. Both Saraj and Kahka denied that Basil
                    informed them about Casino Ong’s unsuitability for deployment. It is
                    readily apparent that, without any corroborative material from a reliable
                    source, this issue would turn, as it did in the trial before the Judge, on the
                    relative credibility of each side’s witnesses. Parenthetically, we might
                    add that it is rather puzzling, given SBS’s strict requirements and
                    several prior complaints, that Premier (through Kahka or whoever else was the
                    relevant person) had in the first instance deployed Casino Ong, notwithstanding
                    his physical infirmity, at a SBS site. If the relevant people in Premier did not
                    know about SBS’s prior unhappiness, this would raise questions about how
                    Premier was managed. If the relevant people in Premier knew about the earlier
                    difficulties with SBS and, despite this, proceeded with the deployment of Casino
                    Ong, this too would raise eyebrows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In regard to the question of whether Basil had
                    informed Saraj and Kahka about Casino Ong, we are of the view that an evaluation
                    of the evidence of Kung, as well as the relevant documentary records of SBS,
                    could well be crucial. He would have been able to confirm or refute the evidence
                    of Saraj and Leow that they were first informed of Casino Ong’s
                    unsuitability for deployment only on 13 December 2006, and not earlier. He
                    would also have been able to shed light on whether his complaint was made to
                    Basil and/or other Premier staff. He would, in addition, have been able to give
                    evidence on the respondents’ eventual responses (both written and oral) to
                    his complaint. All this could have, in turn, enhanced or tarnished the credit of
                    Saraj, Leow, and, ultimately, even Basil. If, for instance, Saraj had been
                    informed much earlier about Casino Ong’s unsuitability for deployment, his
                    professed main reason for dismissing Basil sometime well after the fact might be
                    thrown into doubt; indeed, his entire credibility might well be called into
                    question. In other words, the evidence of Kung and the relevant correspondence
                    between Premier and SBS represents <em>important corroborative
                        material</em> on the Casino Ong incident <em>from an
                        entirely independent source</em>. This would have been <em>most</em> helpful in deciding the outcome of the bitter
                    contest of credibility between Saraj and Leow on one side, and Basil and his
                    witnesses on the other. We do not understand why Mr Wong strove so
                    strenuously to prevent such evidence from being adduced if, indeed, the
                    respondents’ case was, as he jauntily put it during cross-examination,
                        “Teflon”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Kung’s testimony could have been
                    given without taking up much time and would not have inconvenienced either the
                    parties or the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The testimonies of Kung and Hong are also
                    pertinent in a more general sense. Both Kung and Hong were involved with
                    SBS’s security arrangements. The dissatisfaction with Casino Ong was not
                    the first time SBS was dissatisfied with the guards provided by Premier –
                    as Hong’s e-mail (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above)
                    shows, there were already several instances of dissatisfaction in August 2006.
                    How Kung and/or Hong conveyed SBS’s dissatisfaction to the respondents,
                    and how the respondents responded to such complaints, both internally and
                    externally in relation to SBS, would form an important canvas against which to
                    evaluate Saraj’s evidence in relation to the Casino Ong incident. Saraj
                    might, for example, be shown to have reacted in an uncharacteristically harsh
                    manner when he dismissed Basil, in which case his <em>bona
                        fides</em> in dismissing Basil, as well as in his subsequent actions,
                    might again be called into question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is necessary at this juncture to reiterate
                    the importance of the Casino Ong incident in relation to the issue of
                    Basil’s wrongful dismissal and all the subsequent defamatory statements.
                    The Pandan Valley incident was, by any yardstick, relatively trivial and appears
                    to us to be an afterthought contrived as an additional peg on which to justify
                    Basil’s abrupt dismissal. We are also, on the basis of the material before
                    us, not entirely convinced that Basil’s additional field books did not in
                    fact exist. In any case, because Saraj had himself confirmed that he only
                    checked Basil’s field book after Basil was dismissed, the field book
                    incident cannot be relied on to refute Basil’s defamatory statement that
                    he was terminated capriciously, in the sense that the respondents had no
                        <em>ex ante</em> and <em>bona
                        fide</em> reason for dismissing him. The Casino Ong incident is,
                    therefore, central to the issue of Basil’s wrongful dismissal and the
                    evidence of Kung and Hong (as well as relevant documentation from SBS) would
                    have been crucial in assessing the credibility of the main protagonists in this
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Finally, if Saraj’s <em>bona fides</em> in dismissing Basil are called into question, then,
                    as mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above), his
                    motives in crafting Premier’s response to the MOM’s query on
                    Basil’s dismissal in the way he did would almost certainly be
                    questionable. In this regard, we observe that it was not obviously necessary or
                    relevant for Saraj to allege, in the communication to the MOM over Basil’s
                    dismissal, that Basil was a racist, and further to include the anonymous letter
                    of 12 August 2006, which alleged that Basil was racist and incompetent,
                    amongst other things (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).
                    Further, no credible evidence was adduced by the respondents to prove that Basil
                    was, as alleged in the anonymous letter as well as the response to the MOM
                    drafted by Saraj, ever motivated by racial considerations in the discharge of
                    his duties either with Premier or in any of his previous jobs. In fact, the
                    racism point was not mentioned in the respondents’ solicitors’
                    letter dated 6 March 2007 (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    above) nor at any point in the proceedings below. These considerations, combined
                    with a possible finding that Saraj did not act <em>bona
                        fide</em> in dismissing Basil, might well support an inference that
                    Premier’s response to the MOM was made maliciously for the purpose of
                    discrediting Basil, thus defeating any claim of qualified privilege that the
                    communication to the MOM might otherwise have attracted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on the subpoenas issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For the reasons given above, we are of the
                    view that the disallowed witnesses were in a position to give oral and
                    documentary evidence relevant to almost all the issues that were raised. In
                    fact, we would go so far as to say that they were in a position to give what
                    could have been crucial evidence on the key events on which the outcome of the
                    case turned. In addition, with the exception of Raihan, who had previously been
                    employed by Premier, the disallowed witnesses are disinterested third parties
                    whose evidence are likely to be more credible than the partisan witnesses called
                    by each side. The only issues that would not be directly affected by evidence
                    from the disallowed witnesses would be the issues relating to Basil’s
                    defamatory statement that <em>other</em> employees were
                    wrongfully dismissed. That said, those issues might be indirectly affected
                    – the testimony of the present or former SBS and SMRT employees, who are
                    disinterested third parties, would have the effect of affirming or compromising
                    the credit of each side’s witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     We are therefore of the opinion the Judge
                    ought not to have set aside the subpoenas that were addressed to the disallowed
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate remedy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The question, then, is what would be the
                    appropriate remedy. It is not possible for us to predict what the evidence of
                    the disallowed witnesses would be, and therefore we cannot now reverse the
                    decision of the Judge in favour of Basil. At the same time, it is also neither
                    proper nor convenient for the disallowed witnesses to be examined before us, as
                    we will be unable to contextually evaluate the evidence if it is not properly
                    put to all the other relevant witnesses who testified below. In the
                    circumstances, it is necessary for us to consider whether a new trial should be
                    ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The power of this court in the exercise of its
                    civil jurisdiction to order a new trial is found in s 39 of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the
                    SCJA”), which is echoed in O 57 R 14 of the Rules.
                    Section 39(2) of the SCJA provides that a new trial shall not be granted on
                    the ground of improper admission or rejection of evidence, unless in our
                    opinion, “some <em>substantial wrong or miscarriage of
                        justice</em> has been thereby occasioned” [emphasis added].
                    This is “an exacting test for an appellant to satisfy” (see
                        <em>Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd</em> [2001]
                    2 AC 127 at 144 <em>per</em> Lord Bingham of
                    Cornhill CJ).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Susilawati v American
                        Express Bank Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 at [22], this
                    court observed that the grounds on which a new trial may be ordered have not
                    been statutorily fleshed out. The terms “substantial wrong” and
                    “miscarriage of justice” defy precise definition. The lack of a
                    precise formulation may well be for the better; as Lord Watson indicated in
                        <em>George Bray v John Rawlinson Ford</em>
                    [1896] AC 44 at 50, it may not be possible to formulate anything
                    useful, and it may be inexpedient to make an attempt to do so. Each case must
                    turn on its own facts. That said, it is possible to lay down some very general
                    guidelines, and in this regard we would respectfully refer to a passage in the
                    judgment of Ma JA in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision of <em>Ku Chiu Chung Woody v Tang Tin Sung</em>
                    [2003] HKEC 727 (at [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal will not order a retrial (which inevitably involves
                        further costs) unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
                        taken place. This usually involves two facets:- identifying some error that
                        has taken place (for example the wrongful rejection of evidence) and next,
                        determining whether the error so identified has deprived the party
                        complaining of a substantial and realistic chance of success in the case. In
                        other words, however serious the error, if the Court of Appeal takes the
                        view that ultimately it would have made no difference to the outcome of the
                        case, a new trial will not be ordered. There is a third facet to the
                        exercise:- the Court of Appeal’s discretion. A retrial will be ordered
                        not only where it is just to do so (see above), but where it is right to do
                        so. If the Court of Appeal is in as good a position as the Court of First
                        Instance to take a fresh view of the facts, a new trial will not be ordered.
                        One sees the Court of Appeal operate in this way on a regular basis. It is
                        only where the Court of Appeal is somehow disadvantaged in looking at and
                        determining questions of fact that an order for a new trial will be
                        seriously countenanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Although we have already determined that
                    evidence was improperly rejected, it goes without saying that if the improperly
                    rejected evidence <em>will not</em>, if admitted,
                    meaningfully vary the outcome of the case, no new trial will be ordered (see,
                    also, s 169 of the Evidence Act). Equally, if the improperly rejected
                    evidence <em>will</em> vary the outcome of the case if
                    admitted, but can be <em>clearly and objectively</em>
                    established before the appellate court, no new trial will ordinarily be ordered,
                    because in such a situation the outcome of the case should simply be varied
                    accordingly. Thus, a new trial would ordinarily be ordered only where
                    (a) the improperly rejected evidence would, if admitted, have a substantial
                    and realistic prospect of making a meaningful difference to the outcome of the
                    case, and (b) the appellate court is in no position to evaluate the
                    improperly rejected evidence itself (see, <em>eg</em>,
                        <em>Chia Bak Eng and another v Punggol Bus Service
                        Co</em> [1965–1967] SLR(R) 270). Whether this is
                    indeed the position would depend, of course, on the facts of each case. Whether
                    a complete or partial retrial is necessary would also depend on the facts of
                    each case, and, in particular, the effect of the improperly rejected evidence on
                    the relevance and weight of the rest of the evidence. We would emphasise that an
                    appellant seeking a new trial for the reason of improperly rejected evidence
                    bears the heavy burden of establishing that a new trial is the appropriate
                    remedy in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the present case, the evidence of the
                    disallowed witnesses would certainly have a substantial and realistic prospect
                    of making a meaningful difference to the outcome of the case. In fact, as we
                    have said at various points, the evidence of the disallowed witnesses might well
                    be of decisive importance in confirming or refuting the factual positions taken
                    by Basil and the respondents, as well as the credibility of each side’s
                    witnesses. At the same time, it is impossible to say precisely what the evidence
                    of the disallowed witnesses might be, whose evidence would be confirmed, and
                    whose would be refuted. This can only be done by subjecting both parties’
                    witnesses to the crucible of cross-examination. For the witnesses who had
                    testified in the trial before the Judge, the difference would be that they will
                    be confronted with the evidence of disinterested third parties this time
                    round.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In these circumstances, we will set aside the
                    decision of the Judge and order a new trial on Basil’s defences and his
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations on the legal issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Since we have decided to set aside the
                    decision of the Judge and order a retrial, it is not necessary for us to
                    consider the remainder of Mr Retnam’s arguments. We, therefore, will
                    not address Mr Retnam’s complaints about the general conduct of the
                    proceedings below. That said, given that the distinct requirements of the
                    standard defences to defamation, <em>viz</em>,
                    justification, fair comment and qualified privilege (all three of which were
                    discussed recently by this court in <em>Review Publishing Co Ltd
                        and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 52 (“<em>Review Publishing v
                        Lee</em>”)), did not seem to have been fully appreciated in the
                    proceedings below, we think it appropriate to make some general
                    observations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The distinction between statements of fact and comment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     There is a bright line in the law of
                    defamation distinguishing statements of fact from comments. The defence of
                    justification applies to statements of facts, and is not defeated by malice
                        (<em>contra</em> [85] and [139] of the Judgment). The
                    defence of fair comment applies to comments, and is defeated by malice.
                    Additionally, provided the other requirements are met, the defence of fair
                    comment will apply if the comment is objectively capable of being made by an
                    honest though obstinate and prejudiced person. It is, therefore, necessary to
                    identify, in each case, whether the defamatory statement is one of fact or
                    comment. The Judge appears to have treated all of Basil’s defamatory
                    statements as statements of fact requiring justification. This was incorrect.
                    There is at least one comment amongst Basil’s defamatory statements
                    – the statement in his letter dated 24 January 2007 that Premier did
                    not deserve the “B” grade it received from the SIRD,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> which is the
                    industry regulatory body,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> was quite plainly a
                    comment and not a statement of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The distinction between types of malice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It seems to us that the Judge also failed to
                    appreciate that there is a distinction between the type of malice which defeats
                    the defence of qualified privilege and that which defeats the defence of fair
                    comment. The defence of fair comment does not apply if the defamer did not
                    honestly believe in the truth of the defamatory comment. The fact that the
                    defamer was acting with ulterior purposes is by itself immaterial for the
                    purposes of the defence of fair comment, though it can, depending on the facts,
                    give rise to an inference that the defamer did not honestly believe in the truth
                    of the comment he or she made. For the defence of qualified privilege, motive
                    rather than honesty of belief is the essential indicator of malice. The defence
                    of qualified privilege is not an available defence if the defamer does not make
                    the defamatory statement for the purposes of protecting the interest or
                    discharging the duty which gives rise to the privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The reason for the distinction has been
                    authoritatively explained by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, sitting as a
                    non-permanent judge in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, in <em>Tse Wai Chun Paul v Albert Cheng</em>
                    [2001] EMLR 31 (“<em>Tse
                    Paul</em>”), which was quoted with approval by this court in
                        <em>Oei Hong Leong v Ban Song Long David and
                        others</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 608. Lord Nicholls
                    explained that the rationales for the two defences are different and this has
                    led to the difference in the sort of malicious conduct that would serve to
                    defeat each defence. The defence of qualified privilege is grounded on the
                    law’s recognition that there are circumstances where one party has a duty
                    or interest to pass on information to another party who has a duty or interest
                    in receiving it. The rationale of the defence of fair comment is different in a
                    material respect. It is not based on any notion of performing a duty or
                    protecting an interest. It is meant to protect and promote the freedom of
                    comment by everyone at all times on matters of public interest, irrespective of
                    their particular motives. Therefore, an investigation into what is or is not a
                    “proper purpose” would undermine the whole rationale for the
                    defence of fair comment. With regard to spiteful or injurious motives in
                    particular, Lord Nicholls noted (<em>Tse Paul</em> at
                    [49]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The spiteful publication of a defamatory statement of fact attracts no
                        remedy if the statement is proved to be true. Why should the position be
                        different for the spiteful publication of a defamatory, genuinely held
                        comment based on true fact?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We respectfully agree with this observation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Since the Judge apparently considered all of
                    Basil’s statements to be statements of fact, there was naturally no
                    finding as to whether Basil honestly believed in the truth of his statements.
                    However, since we are of the view that there was at least one comment amongst
                    Basil’s defamatory statements (see <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a> above), the issue of fair comment would arise, and in that
                    regard, a relevant question would be whether Basil honestly believed that
                    Premier should not have obtained a “B” grade. Certainly, it is
                    arguable that the other requirements of the defence were made out – issues
                    of security involving public transport are ordinarily a matter of public
                    interest. Saraj had to concede that “[i]solated incidents of guards being
                    not entirely vigilant may exist”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> and “there may be
                    occasions where my guard had made mistake [<em>sic</em>]”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and it seems that an honest but
                    obstinate and prejudiced man could have objectively concluded on this basis that
                    Premier did not merit a “B” grade. On the facts, we are unable, as
                    an appellate court, to ascertain whether Basil honestly believed in the truth of
                    this comment, especially since material evidence had been excluded from the
                    trial. In particular, we are unable to infer that Basil did not honestly believe
                    that Premier did not merit a “B” grade, simply on the basis of the
                    Judge’s finding (at [137] of the Judgment) that “[h]is motive was
                    to ruin the reputation of Premier and cause [Saraj] and [Leow] to be dismissed
                    from Premier’s employment just as he was dismissed”. In fact, it is
                    not implausible that Basil embarked on a defamatory campaign to ruin the
                    respondents <em>because</em> he honestly believed that
                    Premier had skeletons in its closet.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevancy of facts occurring after the alleged defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     There is a difference in the relevancy of
                    events that occur after the defamation for the purposes of the defence of
                    justification and the defence of fair comment. Such facts may be relevant to
                    proving the former, which is concerned only with the truth of the defamatory
                    statement, but not the latter. Regarding the former, an example can be made
                    using an issue which featured prominently in Mr Wong’s
                    cross-examination of Basil: the fact that several Premier’s guards were
                    caught sleeping after his defamation may arguably support an inference that this
                    was an existing practice which had not been remedied. The alleged
                    defamer’s lack of knowledge of the relevant fact at the time of defamation
                    is irrelevant since malice does not defeat the defence of justification;
                    conversely, events that occur after the defamation are never relevant to
                    establishing the defence of fair comment, since the defamer could not have
                    formed an honest belief about the truth of his or her defamatory comments on the
                    basis of facts which he or she could not, by definition, have known at the time
                    of the defamation (see <em>Cohen v Daily Telegraph Ltd</em>
                    [1968] 1 WLR 916). This difference in relevancy does not seem to have been
                    fully appreciated by the Judge in several of her rulings during the trial
                    proceedings as well as in the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Quantum of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Several points should be made in relation to
                    the Judge’s award of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     First, while damages for defamation may be
                    given as a single award, we are of the opinion that, in awarding damages for
                    defamation, a judge ought to demarcate and explain the damages awarded for the
                    defamation itself and the additional damages awarded for the defamer’s
                    aggravating conduct in relation to the defamation. The need for some form of
                    separation is self-evident where financial loss is concerned. With regard to a
                    solatium, it seems to us that the vindicatory value of such an award would be
                    enhanced by a statement and explanation of the extent to which the award was
                    increased by the defamer’s aggravating conduct. Second, given the
                    Judge’s clarification (at [151] of the Judgment) that she doubled the
                    damages awarded to each of the respondents because of her finding of malice, we
                    are not at all certain that she had, in deciding on the quantum, appreciated
                    that “[a] company [such as Premier] cannot be injured in its feelings, it
                    can only be injured in its pocket” (<em>Rubber Improvement
                        Ltd and another v Daily Telegraph Ltd</em> [1964] AC 234 at
                    262 <em>per</em> Lord Reid). Only an individual can
                    claim damages for distress. A corporate or business entity can only recover
                    damages appropriate for vindication and (if pleaded) special damages for loss of
                    business and goodwill. We also note that the ability of a corporate plaintiff to
                    recover aggravated damages for defamation has not been authoritatively settled
                    (see, <em>eg</em>, the contrasting positions taken in the
                    English High Court cases of <em>Messenger Newspapers Group Ltd v
                        National Graphical Association</em> [1984] IRLR 397 and
                        <em>Collins Stewart v The Financial Times Ltd</em>
                    [2005] EMLR 5). These points of considerable import were not drawn to
                    the Judge’s attention by counsel for the respondents in their terse one
                    paragraph submissions on the appropriate awards to be made. And last, but
                    certainly not least, it is unfortunate that the Judge made the award of damages
                    notwithstanding the fact that counsel for Basil had complied with her directions
                    and refrained from submitting on that issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other observations on the proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Before we conclude this judgment, we feel it
                    necessary to briefly comment on three aspects of the proceedings below which,
                    while not the subject of this appeal, have given us cause for
                concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Segmentation of the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The first aspect relates to the segmentation
                    of the proceedings which resulted from SUM 2599, an application pursuant
                    to, <em>inter alia</em>, O 14 R 12 of the Rules.
                    As mentioned (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>–<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above), in SUM 2599, another High Court judge
                    determined the natural and ordinary meaning of Basil’s statements and
                    found them to be defamatory of the respondents, but was of the view that Basil
                    had raised triable issues in defence and gave him unconditional leave to
                    prosecute his defence. This outcome had the unfortunate result that
                    Basil’s liability for defamation for the seven statements was, in effect,
                    determined by two different High Court judges in two distinct
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Such an approach would appear, at first blush,
                    to be permissible following the decision of this court in <em>Microsoft Corp and others v SM Summit Holdings Ltd and another and
                        other appeals</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 465 (“<em>SM Summit</em>”), where it was held that the
                    natural and ordinary meaning of allegedly defamatory words is a question which
                    is suitable for determination under O 14 R 12 of the Rules. This
                    conclusion was reached notwithstanding the fact that triable issues in defence
                    were raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     We do not think that <em>SM Summit</em> ought to be read as standing for the general
                    proposition that the natural and ordinary meaning of allegedly defamatory
                    words/statements is always or even generally suitable for summary determination
                    even though there are triable defences – the judgment in that case only
                    stated (at [51]) that “<em>in this case</em>, the
                    natural and ordinary meaning of the alleged defamatory words is a question which
                    is suitable for determination under O 14 R 12(1)” [emphasis
                    added]. Indeed, we are of the opinion that there are a number of difficulties
                    with having such a determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of
                    allegedly defamatory words/statements where triable defences are raised. First,
                    the trial judge would be put in the difficult and uncomfortable position of
                    having to disregard the original defamatory words/statements and to confine his
                    or her analysis to the meaning determined by the judge that heard the O 14
                    R 12 application. This is not at all optimal or natural in an area of law
                    where innuendoes and implied meanings feature so prominently. As an example, the
                    trial judge may have to further interpret the pre-determined meaning to decide
                    whether or not it was justified, with the result that the defendant would be
                    justifying a meaning which is twice removed from the original words. Second, a
                    segmented approach is not likely to be cost or time efficient, both in terms of
                    the time it takes for the case to be steered through the various stages and the
                    possibility of an appeal at each stage. On the present facts, for example, there
                    could have been three appeals to us: one in relation to the O 14 R 12
                    application, another in relation to the trial, and a third in relation to the
                    assessment of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In our view, the plaintiff in a defamation
                    action ought to apply for an O 14 R 12 determination of the natural
                    and ordinary meaning of allegedly defamatory words/statements only where there
                    are clearly no triable defences (see, <em>eg</em>,
                        <em>Bank of Chia v Asiaweek</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 230; <em>Chee Siok Chin and another v
                        Attorney-General</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 541; <em>Review Publishing v Lee</em> (<a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> <em>supra</em>)). Ordinarily, if there clearly are triable
                    defences, the court should refrain from giving an opinion on the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of the alleged defamatory words/statements concerned in the
                    O 14 R 12 proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The second aspect of the proceedings below
                    which warrants comment is the scope of discovery given by the respondents. After
                    reviewing the record for the purpose of deciding this appeal, we were not at all
                    assured that the respondents have discharged their obligation to make full and
                    frank disclosure of all documents relevant to the case. In fact, they seem to
                    have been rather economical in making available relevant documents. Also, from
                    what we had noted earlier (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above),
                    it would appear that the belated discovery of further documents delayed the
                    start of the trial. There are a number of reasons, some of which we will now
                    outline, for our intuitive feeling that the respondents have not been altogether
                    forthcoming in disclosing relevant documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The SIRD, for its 2007 grading exercise, had
                    required participating agencies to, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    provide documentation to show the “[p]resence of [a] disciplinary system
                    to penalize errant security officers.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> To this end,
                    Saraj included three termination letters which explained the reason for
                    termination, two warning letters detailing the unsatisfactory performance
                    required to be improved, and one record of absenteeism. Based on these
                    documents, it would not be unreasonable for us to assume that some form of
                    practice in this connection was in existence. But, curiously, to say the least,
                    the respondents did not produce any similar documentation to support their
                    sustained attack on the competence of Basil and the ex-employees of Premier who
                    testified on Basil’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     With specific reference to Basil, the absence
                    of personnel records is especially glaring. Saraj’s confirmation letter to
                    Basil, dated 12 July 2006, stated that “your work performance has
                    been very good” and exhorted Basil to “<em>[k]eep
                        up your good work</em>” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> We note that
                    the record contains a draft of this letter showing that Saraj inserted these
                    complimentary words onto a template which was noticeably bland. Beyond this
                    letter, there was no written record relating to Basil’s employment until
                    he was terminated by Saraj on 14 December 2006, by a letter which gave no
                    explanation. In these circumstances, we are not at all sure that the Judge was
                    right to dismiss the incongruity between Saraj’s scathing evaluation of
                    Basil at trial and the attitude he evinced in writing Basil’s confirmation
                    letter, even accepting, in this regard, Saraj’s breezy explanation that he
                    was “trying to motivate [Basil] although [Basil] was not to [his]
                        expectation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     All in all, the absence of personnel records
                    raises a worrying number of questions. If such records existed, the respondents
                    would be in breach of their discovery obligations. If they do not, questions
                    would arise as to how Premier hired and managed its staff. Who called the shots
                    in relation to the dismissal of staff? What was the dismissal process like? What
                    was the evidence relied on in each case? Further, the absence of personnel
                    records (<em>contra</em> the image presented by Saraj in
                    2007 to the SIRD) might well support Basil’s defamatory comment that
                    Premier did not truly deserve the “B” grade it received from the
                    SIRD in 2006. In this connection, the absence of Premier’s submission in
                    2006 to the SIRD is also noteworthy. We should add that the subsequent
                    “A” grades in 2007 and 2008 from the SIRD that impressed the Judge
                    (see [128] of the Judgment) may not be relevant or material as they do not
                    unequivocally indicate how Premier was managed during the material period,
                        <em>ie</em>, 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Separately, Premier also does not appear to
                    have made any discovery of the correspondence it probably had with SBS in
                    relation to the contents of Hong’s August 2006 e-mail (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above) and the complaint from Kung about
                    Casino Ong that Leow allegedly received on 13 December 2006. Neither has
                    Premier made full discovery of the relevant documents in relation to several of
                    the issues raised in Basil’s Defence and Counterclaim such as the
                    liquidated damages it paid to SMRT and other clients in 2006 and the orientation
                    course it purportedly conducted for the security personnel deployed to
                    SATS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It is trite law that Basil, in defending the
                    defamation claim made against him, bore the legal burden of proving the defences
                    he advanced. However, it should not be forgotten that the respondents, like all
                    other litigants, are under an uncompromising obligation to give discovery of all
                    documents in their possession, care or control which are relevant to the issues
                    raised in their own, as well as <em>Basil’s</em>,
                    pleaded case. In this regard, we hardly need to emphasise the consequences which
                    may follow if there are suspicious and unexplained gaps in the documentation
                    that is discoverable by a party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to set aside the subpoenas</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The third point we would like to make is in
                    relation to the respondents’ misconceived application to set aside the
                    subpoenas. Basil had, as said (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                    above), succeeded in SUM 4221, and was granted leave to have the disallowed
                    witnesses give oral evidence and for their AEICs to be dispensed with. The
                    respondents did not file an appeal against that decision; instead, they applied,
                    via SUM 901 (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above), some four
                    months after the decision in SUM 4221 and less than a week before the
                    original trial dates, to set aside the subpoenas issued by Basil. We do not
                    think that this is right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     A party who opposes another party’s
                    attempt to call witnesses to give evidence-in-chief orally should, bar
                    exceptional circumstances, raise all of his or her objections when the other
                    party seeks leave to dispense with AEICs. Such leave is necessary in every case
                    where a party wishes a witness to give evidence-in-chief other than by affidavit
                    (see O 38 R 2 of the Rules), because of the judicial policy against
                    trial by ambush, which requires the timely submission of evidence-in-chief in
                    affidavit form. And because leave is necessary and is sought at an <em>inter partes</em> hearing, a party who objects to the giving
                    of oral evidence-in-chief would always have an avenue to raise its objections
                        (<em>eg</em>, on relevance). If the objections are not
                    sustained before the assistant registrar, the objecting party should appeal to a
                    judge in chambers. If not, he or she would have to live with the assistant
                    registrar’s decision and deal with the witnesses at trial. The objecting
                    party should not subsequently initiate a collateral attack against the assistant
                    registrar’s grant of leave to dispense with AEICs. As this case
                    illustrates, such a manoeuvre would severely disrupt the other party’s
                    ability to plan its case, and should not be countenanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     We would, of course, not preclude the
                    possibility that there might be exceptional circumstances requiring a party to
                    bring an application to set aside a subpoena after it has failed in its
                    opposition to an application for leave to dispense with AEICs. But no such
                    circumstances were alleged in this case, and we can see none.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Directions and conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As we held earlier (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>–<a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above), the failure to allow the disallowed witnesses to
                    testify and to produce documents is a sufficient reason for us to set aside the
                    Judge’s decision and order a new trial on the viability of Basil’s
                    defences and his counterclaim. We further direct that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_a"></a>(a)     Basil shall have leave to subpoena
                        the disallowed witnesses and any other person from SBS, SMRT and SATS who is
                        in a position to give relevant testimony or documentation to the
                        case;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        respondents shall discover, and Basil may discover from them, any
                        documentation relevant to the case;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_c"></a>(c)     all AEICs filed so far shall stand;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_d"></a>(d)     all the
                        witnesses that had testified in the trial before the Judge shall testify
                        again and be re-evaluated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since we have set aside the
                    decision of the Judge on the basis that relevant evidence had been excluded, the
                    trial judge in the new trial ought not to have regard to any of the findings of
                    the Judge or the evidence adduced in the trial before the Judge in coming to his
                    or her decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The new trial should be held in the District
                    Court, since we are of the opinion that the respondents, even if entirely
                    successful, would not recover damages exceeding the District Court limit;
                    indeed, the respondents submitted for a total award of $190,000 in the trial
                    below. We therefore exercise our powers under para 10 of the First Schedule
                    to the SCJA, and s 54C(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321,
                    1999 Rev Ed) read with s 29A(3) of the SCJA, to forthwith transfer the
                    present proceedings to the District Court save for the issue of the costs
                    incurred to-date which we reserve to ourselves. In this connection, the parties
                    are to let us have, within seven days of this judgment, their submissions on
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In closing, we would add that it is never a
                    light matter for an appellate court to order a new trial. The parties will
                    surely incur further costs, much inconvenience, and the ultimate result may not
                    be different. Any order for a new trial must be preceded by a close scrutiny of
                    all the available facts. At the same time, an appellate court would not hesitate
                    to order a new trial when the appellant has been deprived of a real and
                    substantial chance of success by a serious error in the conduct of the
                    proceedings, and when the appellate court is in no position to decide what the
                    outcome would be but for that error.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Supplemental Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">19 May 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript on costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     We heard the parties on the issue of costs on 19 May 2010. Mr Retnam argued that Basil should be awarded costs here and below on an indemnity basis. Mr Wong argued that the issue of costs should be reserved for determination by the district judge hearing the new trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Mr Wong relied on two cases where costs were reserved to the trial judge hearing a retrial, <em>viz Ku Chiu Chung Woody</em> (<a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> <em>supra</em>) and <em>Richard McGivney v Rustico Summer Haven (1977) Limited</em> (1989) 81 Nfld &amp; PEIR 293). The two cases, in our view, provided little assistance, as the orders for new trials in both cases were not attributable to the conduct of the parties in question. In any event, costs are in the discretion of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In contrast, the reasons for ordering a new trial in this case would be substantially attributable to the conduct of the respondents. They strenuously resisted the subpoenas of the disallowed witnesses on questionable grounds, right up to the trial (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>–<a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above). We were unable to accept Mr Wong’s explanation that the respondents were merely attempting to protect Premier’s relationships with its clients. The vindication of a party’s interests must not come through misguided procedural strategies of attrition, which deep-pocketed litigants will, in particular, be tempted to resort to. Nevertheless, we agreed with Mr Wong that some weight had to be given to the fact that Mr Retnam did not assist the court as comprehensively and as promptly as one might expect from counsel of his standing and experience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In the result, we determined that it was appropriate to award Basil the costs of the appeal and half of his costs for the trial below on a standard basis, with the usual consequential orders to apply.</p>
