However, on 19 March 2019, the defendant terminated the plaintiff’s employment with immediate effect by way of the Termination Letter.

She attested that the primary reason for awarding the 2016 Bonus to the plaintiff, was because the plaintiff had competently attended to and fulfilled additional duties of a CEO, when Geyer Singapore had no CEO. This was on top of his duties as a COO. The plaintiff carried out these roles extremely well, given the cashflow difficulties and pressures faced by the Geyer Group at the time. The same considerations applied to awarding the 2017 Bonus. The plaintiff also led the Turnaround Program to restructure the Geyer Group to optimise its various business processes. As such, Ms Watts, along with Mr Thornton-Smith and Mr Ross, agreed that the plaintiff was entitled to Bonus Payments.

To advance their case against this, the defendant sought to impugn the credibility of Ms Watts, Mr Ross and Mr Thornton-Smith’s evidence by suggesting to each of them that they had an interest in giving evidence that was beneficial to the plaintiff even if such evidence was not true. This was roundly rejected by each witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I find no grounds to treat their evidence as biased. On the contrary, I find each witness to be forthright and impartial in their testimony. Importantly, the defendant’s allegations of bias are completely unsubstantiated. While Mr Thornton-Smith acknowledged that he was owed certain sums from Valmont, the defendant has not shown how the plaintiff’s success in this suit would assist Mr Thornton-Smith in his claims. Mr Thornton-Smith explained that as Geyer Corporation was in liquidation, he did not stand to receive anything back. Nor was he in a financial position to challenge Valmont. He had nothing to gain from this suit.

It is Geyer Corporation and not the plaintiff that is a party to the Share Sale Agreement. Notably, Valmont did not seek to set aside the Share Sale Agreement and went ahead with the completion. Moreover, in an email dated 20 November 2018, the plaintiff explained to Mr Calandra, copying Mr Zalloua, that the Management Accounts would have required forecasting their accounting position. This is not the case where the plaintiff represented that the Management Accounts would be fully accurate. On the contrary, he forewarned the buyer, Valmont, that using 23 November 2018 as accounts settlement date “would mean Geyer is faced with having to complete accounting information mid monthly cycle. This would require forecasting the accounting position, which is not an exacting process”. Geyer would have to use “accumulated monthly work-in-progress on 115 active projects as a proxy for revenue.” Assumptions would be made that the supplier services invoices are those received to date.  This “could artificially distort the profit position” and is “certainly not a fully accurate accounting position”.

His answers in re-examination are thus telling. He was asked by the defence counsel, since he had earlier testified that the Deltek Vision figures were reasonably accurate,  whether “this 300-odd thousand (referred to in the AP report) might well have been included in the 31 October management accounts”, if the plaintiff had been more careful. Mr Power’s answer was a qualified “[s]ome of the 300,000 may have”.

</div> However, the plaintiff has satisfactorily explained that staff would generally be away for holiday around December and would not have put in the WIP until they returned in January. There is therefore higher WIP write-off provision in December. Moreover, the Geyer Group business was invoicing around AUD$1m–AUD$1.4m a month, involving 120 employees of whom 100 were practitioners. The change in numbers from October 2018 to December 2018 is not large when seen in that context.

The first project would potentially have an overrun because design standards were being established and costs would be imposed on that project, but there would be benefits in multiple flow-on projects in other locations.

First, the plaintiff’s witnesses, including Ms Watts who was the Chair of the Geyer Group, have consistently testified that the board meetings for Geyer Corporation, Geyer Australia and the defendant were held concurrently for operational reasons. The minutes kept by Geyer Corporation were also minutes of Geyer Australia and the defendant. Mr Zalloua also accepted in cross-examination that when the relevant directors of the three companies, namely Ms Watts, Mr Thornton-Smith and the defendant, sit on the board meetings, the three companies could be regarded as having board meetings at the same time.

</div> Nor is it against the Companies Act for the defendant to hold its meetings concurrently with the Geyer Corporation. While the defendant has pointed to statutory provisions, namely s 251A(1) of the Corporations Act 2001, and s 188(1)(a) of the Companies Act, that require the keeping of minutes, it has not pointed out any statutory provisions or case authority that prohibits the defendant or Geyer Australia from keeping concurrent minutes when their board meetings were conducted concurrently with Geyer Corporation. In any event, the decision to keep concurrent minutes was not one for the plaintiff to make, but for the Chair and the boards of Geyer Singapore and Geyer Australia to make. Given that the Chair of the board of Geyer Group had decided to only adopt concurrent minutes, the lack of separate board minutes cannot be attributed to any breach of duty flowing from the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, the plaintiff has also testified that all statutorily required minutes of the defendant were compiled and kept on the premises of the defendant up till December 2016, and with Intertrust Singapore Corporate Services Pte Ltd (the defendant’s professional corporate secretary) from 1 January 2017 onwards.

In the 26 February 2019 email of 6.42pm, the plaintiff encloses a list of role transition matters for another Geyer staff. In his email of 4 March 2019, the plaintiff asks if there will be a response to his request for a payment plan for accrued remuneration.

It informs the plaintiff in plain language that he “will receive repatriation allowances as outlined in your employment contract of:” and then specifies such entitlements, including “2 x economy class, one-way airfares from Singapore” and “[r]elocation moving costs of an amount equal to one month’s salary”. There was clearly an explicit agreement on the part of the defendant to pay the plaintiff the relocation allowances. It is also the evidence of Mr Zalloua that he considered the relocation allowances to be payable as of 6 February 2019 when Ms Robertson emailed him about this. In response to the question what changed between then and now, he testified that the plaintiff “was terminated and to—still in Singapore.”
