</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Legally speaking, this was a marriage of 26 years. In reality, it is not disputed that the marriage broke down sometime in 2001, 11 years after the parties were married. In fact, the grant of IJ in 2016 was pursuant to the Wife’s third application for divorce; her first application in December 2001 and second application in December 2010 had both been dismissed. That the marriage broke down sometime in 2001 is also evident from the numerous legal proceedings the parties have been embroiled in, including a criminal trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 We raise this to highlight that although this was a long marriage, the facts relating to the breakdown of the marriage were highly unusual. First, as mentioned, the marriage broke down in 2001 even though IJ was granted only in 2016. Second, there was a negative value in the Wife’s indirect contributions (see [130] to [132]). Third, the Wife herself acknowledged the absence of indirect contribution from her to the family from March 2010. We discuss the implications of the Wife’s conduct below (at [128] to [134]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Husband is a medical doctor. He began his career with the Ministry of Health in 1989, until he paid off his bond and set up a clinic as a sole proprietorship (“the Clinic”) in April 1991, where he worked as the resident doctor until it closed down in 2003. The Wife, who was then working as an accountant, quit her job to work in the Clinic from the time it was set up until 2001. In 2001, the parties also set up a bubble tea shop within the same premises as the Clinic to generate income on the side, although this closed down within a year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In 1989, prior to the marriage, the Husband’s father passed away. It is not disputed that he was generous with the Husband and gave assets to the Husband during his lifetime and by his will. These included 500,000 shares and 35,000 shares in two family companies, “TQA” and “TQB”, respectively. In 1993, during the marriage, the Husband incorporated a company named “TQCDE” and transferred 499,909 of his 500,000 TQA shares and all 35,000 of his TQB shares to TQCDE.

</div> The Husband held approximately 90% of the 100,000 shares in TQCDE, while the Wife held approximately 10%. The Husband’s mother held one of the 100,000 shares. The Husband’s mother passed away in 2000 and, according to the Husband, he inherited even more assets upon her death. TQCDE was eventually liquidated in 2014. By then, the Husband’s two sisters had become shareholders of TQCDE. When TQCDE was liquidated, its shares in TQA and TQB were distributed to its shareholders according to their shareholding at that time. Both the Husband and the Wife thereafter held shares in TQA and TQB directly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 September 2001. She filed her first divorce action on 14 December 2001 and, two weeks later, took the two sons to live with her. The first divorce application was dismissed in 2005, whereupon the Wife moved back into the family home with the two sons. Less than a year later, she moved out again and never moved back to live with the family. The two sons were shuttled between the two homes until March 2010, when they moved back in with the Husband, and there they have stayed. The Wife’s second divorce action was filed on 27 December 2010 and dismissed in February 2015. The third divorce action, filed less than two weeks later, led to the grant of IJ and the ancillary matters proceeding below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ submissions and the decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 During the marriage, the parties acquired properties in Singapore, China and Malaysia.

In his decision in <span class="font-italic">TQT v TQU </span>[2018] SGHCF 17 (“GD”) on 15 November 2018, the Judge concluded that all the assets currently owned by the parties came from the Clinic, which was a “joint matrimonial venture”: GD at [11]. He therefore concluded that each party should be entitled to 50% of the matrimonial assets: GD at [11]. The Judge also drew an adverse inference against the Husband for failing to shed light on the identity and value of the assets and gave effect to that adverse inference by adjusting the ratio of division by 25% in favour of the Wife, to reach a final ratio of 75:25 in favour of the Wife: GD at [11].

Her TQA and TQB shares were also acquired during the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As we elaborate below, the Judge was correct to exclude the Husband’s shares in TQA and TQB which were originally given to him by his father.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 While the Draft Order did not include the Pender Court sale proceeds, the Judge had taken that exclusion into account in drawing an adverse inference against the Husband: GD at [11]. Whether the Judge was correct to do so is a separate point which we will address below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is also important to bear in mind that both parties approved the Draft Order. Thus they must have considered which assets were to be included or excluded in that order after the initial decision of the Judge on 15 November 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It is not necessary to make any order on the Husband’s application in SUM 67 as we will not allow the Wife to raise any new issue which is not covered by a cross-appeal from her. We also dismiss the Wife’s application in SUM 78. We deal with costs below at [152].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issue on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The sole issue before us is the division of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 We have said that we do not readily interfere with orders made by a court below pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets, as these are squarely within the trial judge’s discretion (<span class="font-italic">BOR v BOS </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2018] SGCA 78 (“<span class="font-italic">BOR v BOS</span>”) at [1], citing <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal and another matter </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]). To warrant appellate intervention, the trial judge’s decision must be shown to be clearly inequitable or wrong in principle. We have also highlighted the need for counsel to do their part to assist the court in achieving a just outcome (<span class="font-italic">BOR v BOS</span> at [3]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 While the Wife appeared in person throughout these proceedings, the Husband was represented by counsel below, and though many issues were raised in relation to the value of the matrimonial assets, his counsel could not assist the court. Given the state of the evidence, the Judge had great difficulty determining the value of the matrimonial assets and his final order was for the sale of all ascertainable assets, and for the sale proceeds to be divided in the ratio of 75:25 in favour of the Wife: GD at [11]. Any order of the court must be workable and practical. While orders for the sale of all assets may be workable and practical in specific situations, such as where assets are liquid, a significant portion of the matrimonial assets before us consists of real property. The Judge’s order placed the parties in the unenviable position of selling <span class="font-italic">all </span>their assets, including their homes, when retaining their homes would ordinarily be preferred as it avoids unnecessary disruption in their lives. The Husband and three children currently live in the Lorong Pisang Raja property while the Wife lives in the Petir Road HDB flat. To implement the court’s order, they will have to uproot and start again. In addition, the Husband and the Wife will likely have to purchase new homes which will mean additional expense in terms of stamp duty and legal costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In order to avoid such disruption and expense and attempt to allow the parties to retain their homes, it is necessary to identify the matrimonial assets and their values so as to make adjustments to take into account the retention of the homes. The values will also provide an idea as to how much is involved in the division exercise. This is especially pertinent if the Husband has failed to disclose matrimonial assets held by him as we may then take into account the matrimonial assets disclosed to decide on the uplift to be given to the Wife for the Husband’s non-disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As for how the matrimonial assets should be divided, the court is empowered to order the division of matrimonial assets by s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”), which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">112</span>.—(1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Judge’s main holding is that the assets were acquired with income generated from the Clinic and, as this was a joint matrimonial venture, the proceeds should be attributed to both parties in equal proportions: GD at [11]. While we have said that marriage is an equal co-operative partnership of efforts (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">NK v NL </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span>”) at [20]; <span class="font-italic">BOI v BOJ </span>[2019] 2 SLR 114 at [20]), this does not mean that the contributions of both parties in a marriage are always equal. The court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the extent of the contributions made by each party towards acquiring matrimonial assets and to the welfare of the family (ss 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the WC). We said in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”) at [22]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The ultimate objective of any approach towards the division of matrimonial assets is to accord due and sufficient recognition to each party’s contribution towards the marriage… so that the outcome would, in the circumstances of each case, lead to a just and equitable division. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 To that end, we set out a “structured approach” to recognise both parties’ contributions to a marriage (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he court could first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. Next, to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage, instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the other an ‘uplift’ to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other. Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further adjustments (to take into account, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC) may need to be made to the parties’ average percentage contributions …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The structured approach was affirmed in <span class="font-italic">BPC v BPB</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 608 at [70]. To be clear, it may not be appropriate in every case. For example, in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [44], we highlighted that the structured approach may be inappropriate for long single-income marriages, where the court tends towards equal division of matrimonial assets. The Wife submitted that this was a long single-income marriage and so the structured<span class="font-italic"> </span>approach was inapplicable, but we disagree. Both the Husband and the Wife worked at the Clinic during the marriage, and neither party was a full-time homemaker spouse until the Clinic was closed. We have also set out our reasons for not considering this marriage as a typical long one (see [5] above).  We therefore found the present case to be an appropriate one for the <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>structured approach, and we consider the parties’ direct and indirect contributions during the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In light of the foregoing, the issues that arise for this court’s consideration are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the operative dates for determining and valuing the matrimonial assets;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the matrimonial assets and their value; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the direct contribution ratio between the parties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the indirect contribution ratio between the parties; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) any adverse inference to be drawn against either party.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Determination of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 To determine the matrimonial assets, we first identify the operative dates for determination and valuation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Date of determination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2016] 2 SLR 686 (“<span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span>”), this court observed that the default position for the operative date to determine the matrimonial assets is the date that IJ is granted (at [31]), though the court may depart from the starting point where there are cogent reasons to do so (at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Judge did not address the issue of the operative date for determination of the matrimonial assets in the GD. In the present appeal, the Husband submits that the matrimonial assets should be determined as of 28 June 2010 because it is undisputed that the marriage had broken down by this date.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The three dates proposed by the Husband are all prior to the date of IJ, which we have already determined will be the operative date of determination of the matrimonial assets (at [38] above). It is not logical to set the operative date for valuation <span class="font-italic">before </span>the date of determination, as the purpose of identifying a date for valuation is to determine the value of the assets that are matrimonial assets. We see no reason to depart from the default position of the date of the first hearing. As the hearing before the Judge was on 24 September 2018, the appropriate date for the valuation of each property is as of 1 September 2018, this being a convenient date close to the date of the first hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 At this juncture, we highlight that the purpose of identifying an operative date for valuation is so that parties can provide <span class="font-italic">appropriate</span> valuations. The Judge could not identify the valuation of the matrimonial assets as neither party submitted any valuation at all, only scant evidence on how much each property had been acquired for. Given that the dates of acquisition go as far back as 1991, the purchase price may bear little resemblance to the value of each property as at the date of the hearing before the Judge, and this did not assist the court. The Husband, who was represented by counsel below, took the position that the court should decide on the operative date of valuation first before he submitted valuations. Hence, he was not in a position to assist the court below on the valuations at the time of the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 We heard the Husband’s appeal on 25 September 2019. On 18 October 2019, we directed the parties to obtain valuations for certain properties with such valuations to be as at 1 September 2018. The valuations were to be submitted by 3 January 2020. While both parties provided valuations for four properties located in Singapore, they did not provide any valuation for the properties located in China and Malaysia. We address the implications of this below. Furthermore, the valuations provided by both parties did not value the properties as at 1 September 2018 and most of the valuations were done in December 2019. Be that as it may, we have taken those valuations into account since neither side raised any further issues about the date of the valuations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Matrimonial assets for division</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having identified the operative dates for determining and valuing the matrimonial assets, we now identify which assets are matrimonial assets and, further, determine their values.

That is understandable, given that it concerns events which occurred nearly twenty years in the past, but we are left to deal with a gap in the evidence. We note that the Judge did not reach a specific finding on whether this property was used as the matrimonial home. As the property was a gift from the Husband’s father, we think that the burden is on the Wife to produce evidence that it was used as the matrimonial home and transformed into a matrimonial asset. She has not discharged her burden by her bare allegations and accordingly she has failed to prove her assertion that the property was used as a matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Furthermore, the Wife also did not dispute the Husband’s assertion that his mother and sisters were living in the Pender Court property even before and at the time the marriage was registered. Accordingly, it seems to us that the Pender Court property was used more as a home for the Husband’s family rather than a matrimonial home. Thus, even if the parties had lived in the Pender Court property, it would have been a temporary measure while awaiting their home in the Bukit Batok HDB shophouse, and we do not think this would suffice to transform it into a matrimonial asset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Wife argues, in the alternative, that she made substantial improvements to the property as she was responsible for finding tenants and supervising maintenance works.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The evidence shows that from 1996 to 2010, TQCDE earned at least $8m in dividends from the shares it held in TQA, TQB and another family company known as “LCF”. Theoretically, this was sufficient to purchase the property. While we address the issue of direct contributions below (at [104] below), we are satisfied that the Lorong Pisang Raja property is a matrimonial asset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 We reach this conclusion based on the application of the existing case law. First, the Husband was unable to provide any evidence to support his bare allegation about borrowing from TQCDE. While TQCDE’s books were destroyed after it was liquidated in 2014, and presumably all evidence of loans with it, the liquidators’ report did not mention that the Husband had borrowed against his shares. Also, the Husband could not even produce evidence of the purchase and sale of listed shares that would match up with the purchase of this property. As the source of funds was unclear, it is logically impossible to consider whether the original gift of shares to the Husband continues into this property (see <span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee </span>at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, even assuming the Husband’s version of events is true, we are not convinced that the property should remain a “gift”. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee</span> at [57], the correct approach to assets acquired by gifts is to inquire whether or not the transformation was accompanied by a voluntary intention on the part of the donee of the gift (the Husband) that such transformation was for the purpose of integrating the gift into the matrimonial assets. By the Husband’s own allegation, he borrowed against the unappropriated profits of TQCDE to purchase listed shares during the marriage. These shares were then sold, and the proceeds used to purchase this property in 2010. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The parties did not agree on the reason for the incorporation of TQCDE. The Wife’s position was that the Husband incorporated TQCDE for the purpose of holding matrimonial assets, and he demonstrated this intention by giving her a share in TQCDE and promising to increase her share in future.

</div> Assuming the Wife’s version of events is true, it would seem that the incorporation of TQCDE demonstrated the Husband’s intention to benefit the Wife and the family, in line with <span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee </span>at [57]–[58]. Even if the Husband’s position is true, we think that the loans and the purchase of the listed shares during the course of the marriage demonstrate the Husband’s intention to utilise the assets “for and on behalf of the family” (<span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee </span>at [57]). Furthermore, there was no reason for the Husband to incorporate TQCDE and inject the shares in TQA and TQB into TQCDE if he were to remain the sole owner of the shares. The fact that he then gave the Wife a share in TQCDE supports her argument that TQCDE was incorporated to hold matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 We also do not accept the Husband’s submission that the court should exercise its discretion to exclude this property as a matrimonial asset.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 There are different issues. One is whether the Husband diluted the Wife’s shareholding in TQCDE. There was no appeal by the Wife on this point. In any event, if the Husband had diluted her shares wrongly or without her approval, that is a different matter that should not be before the court hearing the ancillary matters proceeding. We proceed on the basis of the shareholding in TQCDE at the time that it was liquidated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The other issue concerns what happened to TQCDE’s assets upon its liquidation. When TQCDE was liquidated, its shares in TQA and TQB were distributed to the shareholders according to their shareholding at that time. The Judge included the Wife’s shares in TQA and TQB within the pool of matrimonial assets, but accepted that the Husband’s shares were not matrimonial assets as they were originally gifts from his late father. The Wife is prepared to accept that the Husband’s TQA and TQB shares were properly excluded on condition that her shares are excluded too. We have already set out our reason for not entertaining the Wife’s attempt to include the Husband’s shares in TQA and TQB as matrimonial assets at [18] above. In any event, we are of the view that the Judge was correct not to include the Husband’s shares in TQA and TQB as they originated as gifts from his father to him before TQCDE was incorporated. They were subsequently injected into TQCDE when this company was incorporated and later distributed to the Husband and to the Wife and the other shareholders of TQCDE upon its liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Unfortunately, the parties failed to provide any valuation of the Wife’s shares in TQA and TQB. Notwithstanding that these are held in the Wife’s name, they are shares in the Husband’s family companies. Although the Husband suggested that the Wife did not want to pay her share of the cost of valuation, he could have obtained the valuation on his own if he wanted to.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3

In the GD, the Judge adopted the classification methodology rather than the global assessment methodology as he considered the Pender Court property separately from the remaining property (GD at [9]–[10]). He did so because the other assets were acquired after parties started working at the Clinic, and he concluded that parties’ contributions to those properties could be assessed together. Pender Court had also been sold in a collective sale prior to the proceedings, and so only its sale proceeds were contested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Husband urges this court to use the classification methodology and identifies four classes:

Whether the Clinic was in operation at the time of the acquisition may support or disprove her allegation. Yet we do not consider this an application of the classification methodology because there is insufficient evidence to clearly differentiate between the properties based on the time they were acquired.

</div> We find that the evidence supports his allegation and, in any event, it seems more likely that the purchase was funded by gifts and inheritance rather than by the Wife as, at the time of the purchase, the parties were still in the early years of their careers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The parties also took a loan of $200,000 in their joint names to finance the purchase of this property, which loan was redeemed in 1994. The Wife seeks credit for this loan, but she does not dispute that the Husband was singularly responsible for paying off the loan. We find that the Husband should be credited for the majority of the direct contributions used to acquire this property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Properties acquired when the Clinic was operational</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The parties acquired the following properties (at [114] to [117] below), which we have found to be matrimonial assets, between 1994 and 1995, when the Clinic was operational. These properties were acquired with upfront payment of the full purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The parties set up the Clinic in 1991. Though the Husband tendered tax statements to demonstrate that the Clinic was operating at a loss and to invite the court to infer that he relied heavily on gifts and inheritance, we agree with the Judge below that the Husband’s tax liability does not accurately reflect his financial ability (GD at [10]). The Wife was also paid $6,000 a month as a clinic assistant, which we do not think is a true measure of her contribution and would have affected the Clinic’s reported income. We doubt each party’s claim that the other party singlehandedly siphoned off the Clinic income; both parties appear to have worked together to manage their tax liability. It may be that the Clinic was doing better than the Husband’s income tax assessments suggest, certainly well enough to set up and maintain a second branch at Choa Chu Kang from 1993 to 1996, but it is unclear how much better.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The Judge found that the Clinic was a joint matrimonial venture, and its income ought to be attributed equally between both parties. While both parties worked at the Clinic, the Husband was the resident doctor and the Wife handled administrative matters. The Wife also had the assistance of nurses and other part-time staff. The Wife claims to have actively engaged in the affairs of the Clinic in various ways, such as by sourcing for clients and running errands. On the other hand, the Husband disputes her allegation and said she spent much time on the phone trading in shares and speaking to her friends. Without downplaying her efforts at the Clinic, we find that a greater portion of the Clinic income should be attributed to the Husband as he was the resident doctor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 As for the Husband’s submission that he utilised gifts and inheritance, we highlight that parties acquired the assets discussed below (from [114] to [117]) with no mortgage loan, which shows that they had a large pool of financial resources to draw on. We find it likely that the assets were acquired with a combination of <span class="font-italic">both </span>the income from the Clinic and the Husband’s gifts and inheritance from his parents. The gift and inheritance should be recognised as the Husband’s direct contribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 We now address the parties’ submissions on each property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Liang Feng Mansion in Shanghai, China</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 This property was acquired in 1994. The Husband tendered evidence that a sum of US$137,116.80 was transferred from his mother’s bank account to M/S Gallant Y.T. Ho &amp; Co, the Hong Kong solicitors, on 11 January 1995, which matches a letter from Singaporean solicitors Ong Tan Nair &amp; Kwek dated 9 January 1995 requesting payment of that exact sum for the property in question.

The court’s duty in such a situation is to make a “rough and ready” approximation of the figures as best as it can to determine parties’ direct contributions (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [23]). In conclusion, bearing in mind that the Clinic was not the sole source of moneys used to acquire most of the properties and that the Husband’s gifts and inheritance were a source as well, and the point that the Husband was the resident doctor of the Clinic, the end result is that he will be credited with a larger share of the direct contribution for the properties acquired during the Clinic’s operational years. Applying the broad-brush approach, we find that the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions to the matrimonial assets is 90:10 in the Husband’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Indirect contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The next step in the structured approach set out in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>is to assess the parties’ indirect contributions to the family, which consists of both financial and non-financial contributions. Especially in such intangible matters, the court should exercise its discretion in broad strokes, bearing in mind that the values are necessarily a matter of impression (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The Husband submits that the indirect contribution ratio between the parties should be 90:10 in his favour,

</div> The Judge had the opportunity to speak to two of the three children, and found that they did not speak ill of the Wife at all (GD at [7]). He therefore inferred that parties’ indirect contribution to the family were equal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 We are heartened that the children, who are now adults, have moved on from the circumstances of their parents’ separation and do not bear a grudge against either parent. We nonetheless find reason to disagree with the Judge’s inference that both the Husband and the Wife looked after the children equally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In practical terms, the Wife left the matrimonial home for the first time in 2001, when the children were between three and eight years old, and only lived with the family for brief periods thereafter. It is undisputed that their daughter lived with the Husband from that date onwards. Although their two sons moved back and forth between the care of the Husband and the Wife, they spent more time with the Husband and have lived with him since 2010. While the mere fact that the children lived with one parent more than with the other will not necessarily affect the court’s assessment of indirect contributions, we find that this supports the Husband’s submission that he was mainly responsible for caring for the three children. In particular, his evidence is that after the Clinic closed in 2003, he became a stay-at-home parent and cared for the children full-time, and this is supported by the close bond he has with the children until today.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The Husband raised numerous concerns about the impact of the Wife’s care of the two sons and we had the opportunity to consider reports from psychologists and an appointed child representative. We need only note that the two sons appear to have had a difficult time when they lived with the Wife, and eventually returned to live with the Husband in about March 2010. Indeed the Wife acknowledged that her indirect contribution from March 2010 was zero.

</div>
</div> The Wife accuses the Husband of influencing and alienating the children from her, but she should recognise that she bears significant responsibility for the current state of affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The Husband submits that a negative value should be ascribed to the Wife’s indirect contributions due to her misconduct, as this court did in the case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</span> [2015] 2 SLR 195 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span>”) at [27] and [28]. Where one spouse not only fails to contribute to the marriage, but also engages in conduct that fundamentally undermines the co-operative partnership and harms the welfare of the other, the court can ascribe a negative value to his or her conduct (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [27]). In <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span>, the wife had systematically poisoned the husband for at least one year, and had been convicted and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for her actions. Even then, the court did not ascribe <span class="font-italic">no </span>value to the wife’s contributions, but applied a discount of 7% to determine her share of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The threshold for the court to ascribe a negative contribution is a high one, and conduct must be both extreme and undisputed (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [25]). The intention is not to turn the ancillary matters hearing into another opportunity for parties to fling spurious allegations at one another. The power to divide matrimonial assets does not exist to serve a punitive function and all factors must be considered in a holistic manner (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span> at [28]). The court will also have regard to the conduct of both parties; where both sides are engaged in a mutually destructive exercise, it will not ascribe a negative value (see <span class="font-italic">UAP v UAQ </span>[2018] 3 SLR 319 at [82]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 However, the present case was an unusual example of marital breakdown because of the sheer extent of conflict from 2001 onwards. The Wife filed numerous complaints against the Husband with the authorities from 2001 to 2004, with at least one complaint culminating in a 15-day criminal trial in the district court from February to June 2004. She accused the Husband of corruption and other regulatory offences, which contributed to the closure of the Clinic, the “joint matrimonial venture” that the Judge identified. The Wife testified as a prosecution witness in the criminal trial, and the district judge who heard the trial found her evidence to be “absurd and ludicrous” and concluded that she “was most eager to concoct evidence calculated to cause damage to the [Husband]”. The judge rejected her evidence unreservedly. On the other hand, the judge noted that the Husband did not retaliate against the Wife even when he had the opportunity to do so. The Husband was eventually acquitted of the charge. These acts of the Wife amounted to harassment and undermined the co-operative partnership that marriage is intended to be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Therefore, while we acknowledge that prior to the breakdown of the marriage in 2001, the Wife was involved in the care of the children and home and some recognition should be awarded to her for that, we are of the view that the Husband’s indirect contribution was much more than the Wife’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Applying the broad-brush approach, we find that the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions to the family is 80:20 in the Husband’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Weightage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The average of parties’ direct and indirect contributions is as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband (%)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife (%)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Direct contributions</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">90</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Indirect contributions</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">80</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">20</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Average ratio</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">85</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">15</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Under the structured approach, the court may vary the weight assigned to direct and indirect contributions where appropriate, depending on factors such as the length of the marriage and the value of the matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [27]). We see no reason to vary the weight of the direct and indirect contributions here, and we assign them equal weight to reach an average of 85% for the Husband and 15% for the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Adverse inference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The structured approach does not detract from the court’s powers to draw an adverse inference against either party where he or she is found to have failed to make full and frank disclosure of the matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [29]). To give effect to that adverse inference, the court may choose to give a value to the undisclosed assets or give a higher percentage of the disclosed assets to the other party (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157). In <span class="font-italic">BOR v BOS</span> at [75], we stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court should not draw an adverse inference unless (a) there is a substratum of evidence which establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and (b) that person has some particular access to the information he is said to be concealing or withholding …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In the present circumstances, we agree with the Judge below that the circumstances warranted drawing an adverse inference against the Husband. We do not think he fulfilled his duty of full and frank disclosure to the Judge and this court, and he did not cooperate in providing further details of the assets or further valuations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 While we accept that some foreign properties were no longer in existence at the time of IJ as they had been disposed of (see [61], [68] and [72]), the Husband also failed to provide evidence of any returns he received upon disposal of the properties such as the sale proceeds of the Wadihana auction or the Hai Hong Plaza buy-back. The TQCDE liquidators’ report also suggests that at the time of liquidation, he should have received $2,686,440.74 from TQCDE’s surplus assets.

</div> In the circumstances, we find it highly suspicious that he claims he only has a single bank account containing $6,235.47 (see [45] above). His explanation that he had forgotten or decided not to deal with the properties in Shanghai, China was contrary to common sense. We have not included the value of Liang Feng Mansion and the Regalia even though they are matrimonial assets as the Husband did not provide any valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 As for the valuation of the Wife’s shares in TQA and TQB, we do not hold the absence of valuation against the Wife.

As the Pender Court property is not a matrimonial asset, neither are its sale proceeds, and we do not include the sale proceeds of Pender Court to draw an adverse inference against the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 We give effect to that adverse inference against the Husband by adjusting the ratio of division by 10% in the Wife’s favour, to reach a final ratio of 75:25 in favour of the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the division of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Given the total value of matrimonial assets as $13,667,860.72 (see [94] above), the Husband is entitled to 75% or $10,250,895.54 and the Wife is entitled to 25% or $3,416,965.18. The Wife is to retain the assets in her sole name and the Husband is to retain those in his sole name. In addition, the Husband is to pay the Wife $2,293,307.73 within six months from the date of this decision so that this sum, together with the assets in her sole name amounting to $1,123,657.45 (see [94] above), amount to 25%. He is to pay this sum, after the set-off mentioned below, with interest on the net balance at 3% per annum from 1 December 2018 until the date of full payment to her, since the Judge’s initial decision was on 15 November 2018 and the Wife has not received maintenance since December 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Each party shall remove any caveat lodged by that party against any of the properties within 14 days from the date of this decision, except for the caveat on the Lorong Pisang Raja property which is addressed below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The Wife is to remove the caveat on the Lorong Pisang Raja property within 14 days after receipt of the sum of $2,293,307.73 and interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 If any party fails to remove any caveat within the applicable deadline stated above, the Registrar of the Supreme Court may sign any document on behalf of that party to withdraw the caveat in question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 As the Judge awarded the Wife 75% of the ascertainable matrimonial assets, the Judge did not address the issue of maintenance and the Wife did not file an appeal against his decision.

<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Woo Bih Li):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Court of Appeal grants husband 75% of matrimonial assets instead of 25% as
ordered by the High Court
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
· This was a long but unusual marriage as the marriage broke down 15 years
before interim judgment of divorce was granted, there was a negative value
in the Wife’s indirect contributions, and the Wife admitted that she made
no indirect contributions to the family after March 2010 (at [    <strong>5</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
· Any order of the court had to be workable and practical. The Judge’s
order required the parties to sell all their assets, including the homes.
In order to avoid disruption and expense arising from such an order, it was
appropriate to identify the matrimonial assets and their values so as to
make adjustments to take into account the retention of the homes (at [    <strong>27</strong>] and [<strong>28</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
· A negative value was ascribed to the Wife’s indirect contributions due to
her misconduct during the marriage in making numerous complaints about the
Husband and her evidence in a criminal trial that the court then rejected
(at [<strong>130</strong>] to [<strong>133</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
· An adverse inference was drawn against the Husband for not fully
disclosing matrimonial assets (at [<strong>137</strong>] to [    <strong>142</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Background </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 The appellant-husband (“the Husband”) and the respondent-wife (“the
Wife”) were married on 6 March 1990. They have three children together, a
daughter and two sons. The Husband worked as a doctor and set up a clinic
(“the Clinic”) in 1991, and the Wife quit her job to assist him in the
Clinic.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 In 2001, the Wife left the matrimonial home and filed the first divorce
action. The action was dismissed in 2005, and the Wife moved back into the
family home for less than a year before she left the Husband again. The
daughter lived with the Husband while the two sons were shuttled between
the Husband and the Wife until 2010, when they moved back to live with the
Husband. The Wife filed a second divorce action in 2010, which was
dismissed in 2015. Less than two weeks later, she filed the third divorce
action, which led to the grant of interim judgment and the ancillary
matters proceeding in the High Court.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 From 2001 onwards, the Wife also filed numerous complaints against the
Husband with the authorities, accusing him of corruption and other
offences. The criminal complaint culminated in a trial in the district
court, and the Husband was eventually acquitted of the offence after the
Wife’s evidence against him was rejected.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 During the marriage, both parties acquired properties in Singapore and
overseas. According to the Husband, these assets were acquired with money
he received from his parents and were not matrimonial assets while
according to the Wife, they were acquired with income from the Clinic and
were matrimonial assets.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) found that all of the parties’ assets
were acquired with income from the Clinic and concluded that each party
should be entitled to 50% of the matrimonial assets. The Judge also drew an
adverse inference against the Husband for failing to shed light on the
assets and adjusted the ratio of division by 25% in favour of the Wife, to
reach a final ratio of 75:25 in favour of the Wife. As the parties had not
provided the Judge with current valuations of the assets, he was unable to
determine the total value of the matrimonial assets. The Judge ordered the
sale of all ascertainable assets with the sale proceeds to be divided in
the ratio of 75% to the Wife and 25% to the Husband.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 The Husband filed an appeal against the Judge’s decision on the division
of matrimonial assets.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Decision </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 The court allowed the Husband’s appeal. It applied the structured
approach set out in <em>ANJ v ANK </em>[2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“    <em>ANJ v ANK</em>”) and found that the ratio of parties’ contributions to
the marriage was 85:15 in favour of the Husband. This was after finding
that a negative value should be ascribed to the Wife’s indirect
contributions due to her misconduct during the marriage. However, as the
Husband had not fulfilled his duty of full and frank disclosure to the
court, the court drew an adverse inference against him and adjusted the
ratio of division by 10% in the Wife’s favour. The final ratio was 75:25 in
favour of the Husband (at [<strong>94</strong>], [<strong>135</strong>] and
[<strong>142</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Reasons for the decision</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 This was a long marriage but the facts relating to the breakdown of the
marriage were unusual. First, it was undisputed that the marriage broke
down in 2001 but interim judgment of divorce was only granted in 2016.
Second, there was a negative value in the Wife’s indirect contributions to
the family. Third, the Wife herself acknowledged the absence of indirect
contribution from her to the family from March 2010 (at [<strong>5</strong>
]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 The Wife filed an application to review the Judge’s orders but had not
filed an appeal. Order 57 rule 9(A) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
2014 Rev Ed) did not permit the Wife to mount a backdoor appeal against the
decision of the Judge without following the proper procedure. Her
application was dismissed (at [<strong>18</strong>] and [    <strong>24</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 Any order of the court had to be workable and practical. A significant
portion of the matrimonial assets consisted of real property and the
Judge’s order placed the parties in the unenviable position of selling all
their assets, including the homes. In order to avoid disruption and
expense, it was necessary to identify the matrimonial assets and their
values so as to make adjustments to take into account the retention of the
homes. The values also provided an idea as to how much was involved in the
division exercise. This was especially pertinent if the Husband failed to
disclose matrimonial assets as the court might then take into account the
matrimonial assets disclosed to decide on the uplift to give to the Wife
(at [<strong>27</strong>] and [<strong>28</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11 While marriage was an equal co-operative partnership of efforts, this
did not mean that the contributions of both parties in a marriage were
always equal. The court had to have regard to all the circumstances of the
case, including the extent of the contributions made by each party towards
acquiring matrimonial assets and to the welfare of the family. The
structured approach was set out in <em>ANJ v ANK </em>to recognise both
parties’ contributions to a marriage and could be applied in the present
case (at [<strong>30</strong>], [<strong>31</strong>] and [    <strong>32</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12 Though the circumstances of the parties’ separation were unusual, there
was no principled reason to depart from the default operative date to
identify matrimonial assets, which was the date of interim judgment on 24
March 2016. There was also no reason to depart from the default date for
valuation of the matrimonial assets, which was the date of the first
ancillary matters hearing on 24 September 2018 (at [<strong>38</strong>]
and [<strong>41</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
13 The global methodology approach was applied alongside the    <em>ANJ v ANK </em>structured approach because there was insufficient
evidence to clearly differentiate between the properties. However, on a
general level, it was useful to discuss the properties according to the
time they were acquired in relation to the running of the Clinic because
the Wife alleged that the properties were acquired with income from the
Clinic (at [<strong>102</strong>] and [<strong>103</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
14 Applying the broad-brush approach, the ratio of the parties’ direct
contributions was 90:10 in favour of the Husband. Where assets were
acquired with income from the Clinic, a greater portion should be
attributed to the Husband as he was the resident doctor. Where assets were
acquired with gifts or inheritance from the Husband’s parents, it should be
attributed to the Husband. It was likely that the assets were acquired with
a combination of both the income from the Clinic and the Husband’s gifts
and inheritance from his parents as the parties had a large pool of
financial resources to draw on. As for properties that were acquired after
the Clinic shut down, the Husband should be credited for a far larger share
than the Wife as the Wife had filed multiple complaints against the Husband
that directly affected the Clinic’s business (at [<strong>111</strong>], [    <strong>112</strong>], [<strong>118</strong>] and [<strong>124</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
15 Applying the broad-brush approach, the ratio of the parties’ indirect
contributions was 80:20 in favour of the Husband. The Wife had left the
matrimonial home when the children were between three and eight years old,
and only lived with the family for brief periods thereafter. The daughter
lived with the Husband while the two sons spent more time with him. This
supported the Husband’s submission that he was mainly responsible for
caring for the children. (at [<strong>128</strong>], [<strong>129</strong>]
and [<strong>134</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
16 Also, where one spouse not only failed to contribute to the marriage,
but also engaged in conduct that fundamentally undermined the co-operative
partnership and harmed the welfare of the other, the court could ascribe a
negative value to his or her indirect contribution. The threshold is a high
one, and conduct must be both extreme and undisputed. The present case was
an unusual example of marital breakdown because of the extent of conflict
from 2001 onwards. The Wife filed numerous complaints against the Husband,
with at least one complaint culminating in a criminal trial. The Husband
was eventually acquitted of the charge. These acts amounted to harassment
and undermined the co-operative partnership that marriage is intended to be
(at [<strong>130</strong>], [<strong>131</strong>] and [    <strong>132]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
17 Assigning equal weight to direct and indirect contributions, the average
ratio was 80:15 in favour of the Husband. The structured approach did not
detract from the court’s power to draw an adverse inference against either
party where he or she was found to have failed to make full and frank
disclosure of the matrimonial assets. The present circumstances warranted
drawing an adverse inference against the Husband. For example, the Husband
failed to provide evidence of any returns he received upon disposal of the
properties. The court gave effect to that adverse inference by adjusting
the ratio of division by 10% in the Wife’s favour, to reach a final ratio
of 75:25 in favour of the Husband (at [<strong>137</strong>], [    <strong>138</strong>], [<strong>139</strong>] and [<strong>142</strong>]).
