Owing to differences in the substantive and procedural laws of various jurisdictions, it is not uncommon for a litigant to “forum shop” – to choose the jurisdiction which is perceived by him to be the most advantageous. Correspondingly, that choice would almost invariably be either adverse or less advantageous from the perspective of his opposing party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The choice of forum can confer substantive advantages in addition to strategic benefits. The law over the years has developed several principles to curtail a litigant’s right to choose a forum. In some instances, the jurisdiction of the court is challenged altogether by the other party. In other situations, the court might be asked to stay the proceedings in favour of another jurisdiction. Such an application can arise in a variety of ways – due to a breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause or an arbitration agreement<span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">lis alibi pendens</span> or <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> – and the stay could either be mandatory or discretionary<span class="font-italic">.</span> Each of these doctrines are informed by the overriding principle that the court has to achieve a just outcome by balancing a litigant’s right to choose a forum against the need to hold the parties to their contractual choice, if any, and to ensure that the dispute is heard in the most appropriate forum for the adjudication of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The present case is not a classic stay application. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants under two joint personal guarantees (“the Personal Guarantees”) for outstanding loans owed by two of the defendants’ companies. There is no dispute that the action was legitimately commenced by the plaintiff against the defendants in Singapore. As the Personal Guarantees expressly provide for the parties to submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court and are governed by Singapore law, not unexpectedly, the defendants are not disputing the jurisdiction of the Singapore court. Neither are the defendants claiming that the Singapore court is not the appropriate forum for the adjudication of the claim. Hence, the usual principles governing <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> are not directly relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendants claim that the application is for a <span class="font-italic">limited</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, temporary) stay of the Singapore proceedings pending the determination of related proceedings in France. The application is ostensibly to avoid the risk of conflicting judgments on account of the multiplicity of proceedings in Singapore and France. The power of the court to grant such a limited stay is firmly grounded in case management considerations and has to be exercised in order to achieve efficiency in the resolution and disposal of disputes. Hence, it is necessary to inquire into the circumstances which brought about the multiplicity of proceedings, in particular the identity of the party responsible for the state of affairs, and whether the parallel foreign proceedings were brought for <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purposes or were contrived in aid of the stay application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Here, the principal reason why there is a multiplicity of proceedings is because of a French action commenced by the defendants against the plaintiff (“the French counter-action”). The French counter-action was not only brought after the commencement of this suit in Singapore, but more significantly after the defendants had already taken steps in the proceedings including the filing of a counterclaim. Further, the French counter-action is substantially a mirror of this action. It includes a claim by the defendants that the Personal Guarantees are <span class="font-italic">non-existent</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and therefore unenforceable – the very issue which is before the Singapore court. In essence, the defendants are not applying for a limited stay but are instead seeking for the validity and the enforceability of the Personal Guarantees to be decided in France. Would the grant of such a stay achieve a more efficient management of the dispute before the Singapore court? It appears to us that granting the defendants’ stay application would be the very antithesis of case management. For the reasons elaborated below, in our view, the stay application ought to be dismissed as the multiplicity of proceedings is entirely a result of the defendants’ French counter-action which appears to have been commenced to deliberately stifle the expeditious resolution of the current action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The first and second defendants, Jacob Agam and Ruth Agam respectively, are siblings and Israeli nationals.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As the pleadings stood at the time we heard the stay application, the defendants did not aver that the same was true for the Det Internationale facility agreement and the Personal Guarantee granted thereunder. This is probably due to the fact that Det Internationale, unlike SCI Ruth Agam, is a Danish company and hence not directly governed by French law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The second defendant also asserts the defence of <span class="font-italic">non </span><span class="font-italic">est factum</span> on the basis that she only understands Hebrew, and not English or French, and was not aware or informed that personal liability will be imposed on her when she signed the Personal Guarantees in Paris on 9 June 2010. In addition, both defendants contend that their liability under the Personal Guarantees is diminished and/or extinguished by various counterclaims which they and the Agam companies have against the plaintiff arising from, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the plaintiff’s purportedly wrongful declaration that there was a breach of the global margin requirement following the criminal seizure of the Paris penthouse property in 2014. However, as pointed out at [14] above, the plaintiff’s notices of demand were in fact premised only on the <span class="font-italic">maturity</span> of the facility agreements rather than on any prior breaches of the facility agreements by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Present application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As we noted in our introduction, the defendants do not challenge the jurisdiction of this court, nor do they contend that Singapore is not an appropriate forum for the resolution of this suit under the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. Rather, their application, at least on its face, is for a <span class="font-italic">limited</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>case management stay on the basis that there will be a multiplicity of proceedings, with a risk of conflicting judgments, if the proceedings in France and Singapore were to proceed at the same time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The application is for the limited stay until the determination of the related proceedings in France. As outlined above (at [17] and [19]), there are four sets of proceedings in France – (a) the conservatory proceedings, (b) the foreclosure proceedings, (c) the French counter-action, and (d) the Art 145 proceedings. At the hearing of this application, the defendants clarified that the relevant proceedings for the purpose of their stay application are the foreclosure proceedings and the French counter-action. So they accept that the conservatory and Art 145 proceedings do not impinge on this suit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 At the outset, it is worth noting that the application for a limited stay was filed by the defendants on 25 May 2016. This was almost six months after the plaintiffs commenced this suit in Singapore on 27 November 2015. It was also filed shortly after the application to commence the French counter-action was brought before the Paris Court on 17 May 2016. The timing of the application is an important factor to which we will return (see [50] below). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ evidence on French law  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At the case management conference heard by us on 17 May 2016, counsel for the second defendant indicated that the defendants would be adducing evidence of French law for the purposes of this application, but only to explain the nature of proceedings in France. He assured us that the evidence of foreign law would not touch on the merits of those proceedings. Despite this assurance, the parties have adduced substantial evidence, in the form of French law expert reports, relating to the merits of the case under the laws of France.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Leaving aside the relevance of this evidence, there was a question as to its admissibility because the defendants’ initial pleadings on French law were both extremely brief and inadequate. This deficiency was pointed out by the court at a further interlocutory hearing on 18 July 2016.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 There were three aspects to the amendments sought by the defendants. First, the amendments particularised the doctrines and provisions of French law which the facility agreements and Personal Guarantees purportedly contravene. Second, they introduced an attack on the <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>of the choice of law and jurisdiction agreements in the Personal Guarantees. Third, they sought to introduce the second defendant’s denial of having signed the Personal Guarantees at all, in addition to her defence of <span class="font-italic">non </span><span class="font-italic">est factum</span>. As these amendments were substantial, the plaintiff’s counsel required time to take instructions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 From the evidence of the defendants filed in support of the amendment applications, it was apparent that their concern was that without the amendments, they would not be able to rely on the experts’ affidavit evidence on French law in aid of this stay application. To give the plaintiff sufficient time to consider the proposed amendments while, at the same time, ensuring that the stay application, which was to be heard by three judges, could proceed, the court inquired from the defendants’ counsel whether he would be prepared to proceed with the stay application on the pleadings as they stood, but with the parties given full liberty to refer to all the affidavits on French law despite the inadequacies in the defendants’ pleadings. The defendants’ counsel agreed to the suggestion and the plaintiff did not object. On this premise, the amendment applications were adjourned to enable the plaintiff’s counsel to take proper instructions, and the stay application was heard on the basis of the pleadings as they then stood with liberty to the parties, in particular, the defendants, to refer to the experts’ affidavit evidence on French law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ positions on impact of French proceedings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Although the parties were given liberty to refer to all the French law material tendered, our view is that the evidence on French law is only relevant to this application insofar as it touches on any overlap between this present suit and the French proceedings (see [48] below). On this issue, there are two main areas of contention between the plaintiff and the defendants:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, and significantly, the parties dispute the governing law of the Personal Guarantees. The plaintiff’s case is that the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> contractus </span>is Singapore law. The defendants acknowledge that there is an express choice of law clause in the Personal Guarantees in favour of Singapore law. But they contend that both the French and Singapore courts ought to apply French law instead as the choice of law agreement is not <span class="font-italic">bona </span><span class="font-italic">fide</span>. If so, then it is argued that this court would benefit from the findings of the French courts on the validity of the Personal Guarantees under French law. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, in relation to whether there is an overlap between the foreclosure proceedings and this present suit, the plaintiff’s case is that there is no overlap, or at most a minor and insignificant overlap, because the Personal Guarantees would still be enforceable even if the facility agreements are struck down by the Enforcement Judge, regardless of whether Singapore or French law applies. The defendants’ evidence is that any ruling by the Enforcement Judge on the validity of the facility agreements will affect the enforceability of the Personal Guarantees due to the French doctrine of <span class="font-italic">l’inexistence</span>. This submission assumes that the Personal Guarantees are governed by French law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Legal principles governing a limited stay of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The defendants’ application is based on s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) read with para 9 of the First Schedule of the same Act. Paragraph 9 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stay of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9.  Power to dismiss or stay proceedings where the matter in question is res judicata between the parties, or <span class="font-italic">where by reason of multiplicity of proceedings in any court or courts</span> or by reason of a court in Singapore not being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought not to be continued.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Alternatively, the defendants rely on the inherent jurisdiction of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In either case, the leading authority is <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 1192 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung</span>”). The Court of Appeal held that the grant of a limited stay order pending the conclusion of other proceedings does not strictly require the application of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>principles because under s 18 of the SCJA read with para 9 of the First Schedule, or alternatively, under the inherent jurisdiction of the court, the court has the full discretion to stay any proceedings before it until whatever appropriate conditions are met (at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung </span>concerned parallel proceedings in Malaysia and Singapore arising from a dispute over the administration of a will. The proceedings were premised on different causes of action – the Malaysian action sought reliefs against the trustees of the estate for breach of their duties to the beneficiaries while the action in Singapore was for defamation by the trustees. However, the Court of Appeal found that the two actions traversed much of the same grounds, and that there was a considerable overlap in the issues to be determined. Thus, it upheld the High Court’s order that the Singapore action should be stayed on a temporary basis pending the outcome of the Malaysian proceedings. It was held that this was a sensible and practical order which would allow the Singapore court the benefit of the Malaysian court’s findings, and therefore minimise the risk of conflicting judgments. The limited stay was also judged to promote international comity by ensuring that the courts of the two countries would not go on their separate and independent ways (at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung</span> have been considered in subsequent cases such as <span class="font-italic">RBS Coutts Bank Ltd v Brunner Hans-Peter </span>[2010] SGHC 342 (“<span class="font-italic">RBS Coutts</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Ram </span><span class="font-italic">Parshotam Mittal v Portcullis Trustnet (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1337 (“<span class="font-italic">Ram Mittal</span>”). These cases have expanded on <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung </span>by approving the following factors, identified by the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited v The Boots Company (Australia) Pty Limited</span> (1992) 34 FCR 287 at [16], as relevant (<span class="font-italic">RBS Coutts</span> at [26]; <span class="font-italic">Ram Mittal</span> at [53]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) which proceeding was commenced first;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the termination of one proceeding is likely to have a material effect on the other;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the public interest;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the undesirability of two courts competing to see which of them determines common facts first;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) consideration of circumstances relating to witnesses;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) whether work done on pleadings, particulars, discovery, interrogatories and preparation might be wasted;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) the undesirability of substantial waste of time and effort if it becomes a common practice to bring actions in two courts involving substantially the same issues;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(h) how far advanced the proceedings are in each court;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(i) the law should strive against permitting multiplicity of proceedings in relation to similar issues; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(j) generally balancing the advantages and disadvantages to each party.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The above list of factors is not exhaustive. Ultimately, the grant of a limited stay of proceedings is a discretionary exercise of the court’s case management powers. This discretion is triggered when there is a multiplicity of proceedings; and in exercising these powers, the court is entitled to consider all the circumstances of the case. The underlying concern is the need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The parties also rely on authorities drawn from the analogous context of overlapping court and arbitration proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals</span> [2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Maybank</span><span class="font-italic"> Kim Eng Securities Pte Ltd v Lim Keng Yong and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 431). Although those cases also relate to the court’s case management powers, there are important differences between the exercise of case management powers in the context of overlapping court and arbitration proceedings and in the context of a multiplicity of court proceedings. In the former case, the multiplicity of actions is a result of some, but not all, of the parties and/or claims being subject to an arbitration agreement. Hence, the need to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of the arbitration clause is an important concern (see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd</span> at [188]). On the other hand, in the latter case (which includes the present application), the overlap between the proceedings in Singapore and in the foreign court is a consequence of the cross-border nature of the dispute. Hence, the principle in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd</span> which was developed to balance the need for proper case management with the view to prevent a party from circumventing an arbitration clause is not engaged here. Instead, a consideration of private international law factors such as the principles of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> and international comity is more germane, although the former doctrine does not strictly need to be applied due to the temporary nature of the stay which preserves the plaintiff’s right to prosecute his claim in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Shirley </span><span class="font-italic">Kathreyn v Tan Peng Quee</span> [2011] SGHC 5 at [7]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Following on from the above, the key issues to be determined are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there is an overlap of issues between the proceedings in Singapore and France which gives rise to a risk of conflicting judgments; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if so, whether the court should exercise its discretion, under para 9 of the First Schedule to the SCJA and/or under its inherent powers of case management, to order a limited stay of proceedings pending the determination of the proceedings in France.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Do the French proceedings overlap with the current suit?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 We start with the inquiry whether there is any overlap of issues between the proceedings in Singapore and France. If not, there would be no multiplicity of proceedings, and the court would have no reason to order a limited stay. An analysis of this issue requires: first, an examination of the relationship between the current suit and the French foreclosure proceedings commenced by the plaintiff; and, second, the overlap between this suit and the defendants’ French counter-action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Foreclosure proceedings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The defendants concede that the validity of the Personal Guarantees is not directly in issue in the foreclosure proceedings, which are based on the facility agreements and mortgages. In fact, the defendants are not even party to the foreclosure proceedings. But their submission is that any findings by the Enforcement Judge on the legality and enforceability of the facility agreements are likely to have a material impact on the present suit. This submission principally turns on the governing law of the Personal Guarantees, which will determine the relationship between the Personal Guarantees and the facility agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As the pleadings stand, there is no doubt that that the Personal Guarantees are governed by Singapore law by virtue of cl 34 (see [12] above). The defendants accept that, on their face, the Personal Guarantees can be enforced as indemnities as a result of cl 17, which provides that “[a]s a separate, additional, independent and continuing obligation”, the defendants undertake to make payment under the Personal Guarantees “as original, primary and independent sole obligor[s]… by way of a full indemnity”.

</div>
</div> It is also common ground that insofar as the Personal Guarantees can be enforced as indemnities, the position under Singapore law is that the defendants’ liability is primary and would survive even if the underlying facility agreements are void or otherwise unenforceable (<span class="font-italic">American Home Assurance Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 992 at [41]). This analysis supports the plaintiff’s case that there is no overlap, or at most a minor and insignificant overlap, between the foreclosure proceedings and this suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This is the reason why the defendants have sought to amend their pleadings to challenge the <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>of the parties’ choice of Singapore law. However, even if the amendments had been allowed, there is no material before the court to support a finding, at this stage, that the choice of law agreement was not genuine. The defendants rely on the case of <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee v Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 842 (“<span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee</span>”). However the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee </span>establishes that where an express choice of law has been made by the parties, it is virtually conclusive of the proper law governing the contract (at [17]). The court also accepted that a choice of law may be held to be not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> if the <span class="font-italic">only </span>purpose for choosing Singapore law was to evade the operation of a foreign law. It appears to us, at least <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, that there were good reasons for the parties to choose Singapore law as the governing law of the Personal Guarantees. The guaranteed loans were disbursed from and chiefly managed by the plaintiff’s Singapore branch. The first defendant’s own evidence is that the investment proposals which he reviewed before entering into the facility agreements were presented to him by the plaintiff’s executive from Singapore,

</div> Certainly, there is no clear evidence, at this interlocutory stage, that the plaintiff had deliberately chosen Singapore law as the governing law of the Personal Guarantees for the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> purpose of evading the operation of French law (see <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee</span> at [17]). Thus the choice of Singapore law is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> valid.

Even if Singapore law was found to be inapplicable, there is no evidence that the purported illegality of the facility agreements would affect the enforceability of the Personal Guarantees under French law. The defendants’ French law expert states in his report that the Personal Guarantees would be unenforceable under French law if the facility agreements are found to be illegal; however, this proposition is asserted without any substantiation. Reference is made to the French doctrine of<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">l’inexistence </span>or “non-existence” – it appears from the evidence that in French contract law, a finding of non-existence is distinct from a finding that a contract is null or voidable. In particular, the defendants’ expert asserts that if the facility agreements are found to be non-existent, then the defendants and the Agam companies would be completely absolved from all liability, including under the Personal Guarantees.

</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, if we had to decide the issue at this stage, we would have preferred the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert that, under French law, the Personal Guarantees are not likely to be affected by the purported illegality of the facility agreements. His evidence is both cogent and well supported by French legal sources.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It should also be recalled that SCI Ruth Agam has applied to stay the foreclosure proceedings pending the determination of the French counter-action (see [19(c)] above). Such an application casts further doubt on the relevance of the foreclosure proceedings to the present stay application. Thus we find that the foreclosure proceedings are not likely to have a material impact on the present suit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">French counter-action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 By contrast with the foreclosure proceedings brought by the plaintiff, there is a clear overlap between the present suit and the defendants’ French counter-action. The Personal Guarantees are directly in issue in the French counter-action before the Paris Court, and the principal remedy sought by the defendants is a declaration from the court confirming the non-existence of<span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Personal Guarantees. This remedy is similar to declaration which the first defendant seeks, by way of counterclaim in this suit, that he is discharged from all liability under the Personal Guarantees. The French counter-action is therefore a mirror of this current suit. Therefore, the substantial overlap between both proceedings was entirely brought about by the defendants. Although the plaintiff acknowledges that there is such an overlap, its case is that this overlap should nonetheless be disregarded for present purposes as the French counter-action was strategically commenced after this suit. This is a consideration which is relevant to the court’s exercise of discretion. It does not change the fact that there is a multiplicity of proceedings in this case, with the attendant risk of conflicting judgments if both this suit and the French counter-action were to proceed concurrently. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Exercise of court’s discretion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, the risk of conflicting judgments is not by itself a sufficient reason for the grant of a limited stay of proceedings. As outlined above, the court, in exercising its discretion, needs to consider all the circumstances of the case, and keep in mind the need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole (see [35] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Governing law and relevance of arguments on merits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, the defendants argue that this court will benefit from the findings of the French court on the validity of the Personal Guarantees as the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> contractus </span>is French law. This submission falls away in light of our finding (at [40] and [41] above) that the Personal Guarantees are <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>governed by Singapore law. In any event, even if this court should decide otherwise at the trial of this action, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that French law applies because the choice of Singapore law is not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, this factor cannot be determinative since this court, which is an international commercial court with an International Judge from France, can apply the laws of France to decide the dispute.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Other than expressing a <span class="font-italic">provisional</span> preference for the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert in [43] above, we did not find the evidence tendered by the parties on the merits of the case under the laws of France useful or relevant to the determination of this stay application. Once it is determined that there is a <span class="font-italic">risk </span>of conflicting judgements, there is no further need for the court, at this stage, to make any findings on the merits of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Bona fides of present application and French counter-action </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>of this stay application and the defendants’ French counter-action, by contrast, is highly relevant. As analysed above, the foreclosure proceedings are distinct and do not materially overlap with this current suit. Hence the multiplicity of proceedings in this case is entirely a result of the defendants’ commencement of the French counter-action. The French counter-action, however, appears to have been commenced to deliberately stifle the current action. This is borne out by the timing of this application and the scope of the French counter-action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As noted above (at [25]), the application to commence the French counter-action was only brought by the defendants on 17 May 2016, almost six months after this suit was commenced. This application was then brought shortly thereafter. The scope of the French counter-action, which mirrors this suit, is also relevant. Due to the complete overlap between both proceedings, if this suit is stayed pending the determination of the French proceedings, then this action will effectively be rendered otiose, particularly if the Paris Court finds in favour of the defendants. In other words, although the defendants’ application is, on its face, for a limited case management stay, the stay of proceedings granted would <span class="font-italic">in substance</span> be permanent. The defendants accept that this would be the practical consequence of a limited stay order should they prevail in the French counter-action. But they argue that if the plaintiff prevails in France instead, then this suit would still need to be revived as the plaintiff will then need to enforce the Personal Guarantees in Singapore. Even if this is true, it does not undermine the observation that the defendants’ motivation in bringing this application appears to be to derail these proceedings in Singapore in order to embroil the plaintiff in a much wider and protracted dispute in France. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This factor clearly distinguishes this case from the precedents on a limited stay of proceedings cited above. In cases such as <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ram Mittal</span> and <span class="font-italic">RBS Coutts</span>, there were common issues between the proceedings in Singapore and in the foreign court, but the overlapping proceedings were not identical. This is the reason why the limited stay was granted – it was considered to be a sensible and practical order which would preserve the plaintiff’s right to prosecute its claim in Singapore while minimising the risk of conflicting decisions by allowing the Singapore court to have the benefit of the findings of the foreign court (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung</span> at [46]; <span class="font-italic">Ram Mittal</span> at [59]). This reasoning does not apply to the present case, where it is difficult to see how, as a matter of case management, staying this action until the full determination of the French proceedings would allow for a more expedient resolution of the dispute between the parties. In <span class="font-italic">Ram Mittal</span>, it was also implicitly accepted that a limited stay application filed for the extraneous purpose of stifling the proceedings in Singapore should not be allowed (at [57]). As a matter of principle, this is patently right.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Forum non conveniens and international comity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, it is useful to consider the principles of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> and the argument that these proceedings should be stayed as a matter of international comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There can be no doubt that Singapore is an appropriate forum for the resolution of this dispute. This is conceded by the defendants who are bound by the jurisdiction agreement in favour of the courts of Singapore in the Personal Guarantees. The defendants have also actively participated in this action, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, by bringing a counterclaim. So the defendants cannot, and more importantly have not, argued that the principles of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>point in favour of the French court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The defendants thus place much reliance on the principle of international comity. But the principle works both ways. Here, Singapore is the appropriate forum and the French court can take cognisance of any Singapore judgment. Further, there is no reason why the defendants cannot amend their pleadings to bring in any additional issues which they have raised in the French counter-action rather than starting <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> in France. This would clearly be, as a matter of case management, the more sensible way to resolve the dispute in an efficient and fair manner especially given that the Singapore proceedings are at a more advanced stage than the French counter-action, which is still in its nascency. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In our view, it is clear that this application is an attempt by the defendants to stifle these proceedings and undermine the proper jurisdiction of this court through the stratagem of a case management stay. If allowed, it would hinder rather than promote the expedient resolution of the dispute between the parties. Therefore we dismiss the application with costs.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Post-script: Defendants’ summonses for amendment of pleadings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As a post-script, we record that the defendants’ applications to amend their pleadings (see [27] above) were heard on 30 September 2016 after the hearing of the stay application. The amendments were allowed, save for those relating to the second defendant’s denial that she had signed the Personal Guarantees. Those proposed amendments contradicted her pleadings on the defence of <span class="font-italic">non </span><span class="font-italic">est factum</span>. The plaintiff did not object to the other amendments. We should make clear that the fact that the other amendments – relating to the particulars of French law and the <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>of the jurisdiction and choice of law clauses – were allowed does not change our assessment of the defendants’ stay application. As stated earlier (at [29]), the arguments and evidence sought to be introduced <span class="font-italic">via</span> these amendments were permitted to be raised at the hearing of the stay application and were therefore fully considered by this court.      </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Steven Chong     Roger Giles     Dominique Hascher<br/>Judge     International Judge  International Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">K Muralidharan Pillai, Luo Qinghui and Andrea Tan (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Sivakumar Murugaiyan and Kyle Gabriel Peters (Straits Law Practice LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

The Agams owned four properties in France and Monaco through companies which were incorporated in France, Denmark and Panama (“the Agam companies”). In 2010, the Agam companies entered into four facility agreements with BNP Paribas under which a total amount of €61.7m was loaned to the companies. These monies were disbursed through BNP Paribas’s local branch in Singapore. Each facility agreement was for a term of five years. They were secured by various securities including mortgages over the four properties and joint personal guarantees executed by the Agams in favour of BNP Paribas. Both the facility agreements and the personal guarantees contained clauses stating that they were governed by Singapore law and that the Agams and their companies agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span>In 2014, the <span class="font-italic">Tribunal de Grande Instance of Paris </span>(“the Paris Court”) ordered the criminal seizure of one of the properties in France following a request by the authorities of the United States of America as part of their money laundering investigations. This led to a dispute between the parties as to whether the Agam companies were in breach of their obligations under the facility agreements. The parties subsequently entered into discussions to settle the outstanding monies which the Agam companies owed to BNP Paribas. But they were not able to reach a compromise on the facility agreements with two of the Agam companies – SCI Ruth Agam and Det Internationale Ejendoms-OG Udviklingsselskab ApS (“Det Internationale”). Following the contractual maturity date for these two facility agreements, BNP Paribas issued formal notices of demand to SCI Ruth Agam and Det Internationale for repayment of the loans. SCI Ruth Agam and Det Internationale failed to make repayment. Hence BNP Paribas demanded payment of the outstanding sum of approximately €30.1m from the Agams under the personal guarantees. BNP Paribas then commenced this present action in the Singapore High Court in November 2015 against the Agams on the same basis. The action was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“the SICC”) before a coram comprising Steven Chong J, Roger Giles IJ and Dominique Hascher IJ. In January 2016, BNP Paribas also brought foreclosure proceedings in France to enforce the mortgages over the properties belonging to SCI Ruth Agam and Det Internationale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">3 </span>In response, the Agams and their companies brought a counter-action in the Paris Court seeking a declaration that the facility agreements and personal guarantees were invalid and “non-existent” under French law. They claimed that the entire transaction was illegal and contrary to the laws of France. This French counter-action was commenced in May 2016, some six months after BNP Paribas commenced the present action in Singapore. Shortly after, the Agams made this application for a limited (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, temporary) stay of the SICC proceedings pending the determination of the foreclosure proceedings and the counter-action in France. The application was ostensibly to avoid the risk of conflicting judgments from the overlapping proceedings in Singapore and France.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span>In its judgment, the Court held that the grant of a limited stay of proceedings is a discretionary case management power which has to be exercised in order to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole. In this case, the foreclosure proceedings were found to be distinct as they did not materially overlap with the current action. So the principal reason for the multiplicity of proceedings was because of the French counter-action commenced by the Agams against BNP Paribas. The French counter-action was not only brought after the commencement of the Singapore proceedings, but after the Agams had already taken steps in this suit including the filing of a counterclaim. Further, the French counter-action was substantially a mirror of this action – the claim in France that the personal guarantees were unenforceable was the very issue before the SICC. In essence, the Agams were not applying for a limited stay but were instead seeking for the validity and the enforceability of the personal guarantees to be decided in France. The Court thus found that the French counter-action and the stay application had been commenced to deliberately stifle the expeditious resolution of the current action and in order to embroil BNP Paribas in a much wider and protracted dispute in France.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>The Court also rejected the Agams’ argument that this present action should be stayed temporarily as a matter of international comity. The principle worked both ways. Here, the Agams conceded that Singapore was an appropriate forum for the resolution of this dispute; and the French court could take cognisance of any Singapore judgment. Further, there was no reason why the Agams could not bring in any additional issues which they have raised in the French counter-action into this suit rather than starting <span class="font-italic">de novo </span>in France. This would clearly be, as a matter of case management, the more sensible way to resolve the dispute in an efficient and fair manner especially given that the SICC proceedings were at a more advanced stage than the French counter-action, which was still in its nascency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>The Court thus dismissed the Agams’ application<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
